Summary of Economic Projections

In conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting held on June 15-16, 2021, meeting participants submitted their projections of the most likely outcomes for real gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation for each year from 2021 to 2023 and over the longer run. Each participant's projections were based on information available at the time of the meeting, together with her or his assessment of appropriate monetary policy-including a path for the federal funds rate and its longer-run value-and assumptions about other factors likely to affect economic outcomes. The longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the value to which each variable would be expected to converge, over time, under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. 'Appropriate monetary policy' is defined as the future path of policy that each participant deems most likely to foster outcomes for economic activity and inflation that best satisfy his or her individual interpretation of the statutory mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability.

Note : Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are percent changes from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The projections for the federal funds rate are the value of the midpoint of the projected appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the projected appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The March projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on March 16-17, 2021. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the March 16-17, 2021, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the June 15-16, 2021, meeting.

- 1. For each period, the median is the middle projection when the projections are arranged from lowest to highest. When the number of projections is even, the median is the average of the two middle projections.
- 2. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 3. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 4. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Note : The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box 'Forecast Uncertainty.'

Note : The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to onset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero - the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Note : Error ranges shown are measured as plus or minus the root mean squared error of projections for 2001 through 2020 that were released in the summer by various private and government forecasters. As described in the box 'Forecast Uncertainty,' under certain assumptions, there is about a 70 percent probability that actual outcomes for real GDP, unemployment, consumer prices, and the federal funds rate will be in ranges implied by the average size of projection errors made in the past. For more information, see David Reifschneider and Peter Tulip (2017), 'Gauging the Uncertainty of the Economic Outlook Using Historical Forecasting Errors: The Federal Reserve's Approach,' Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2017-020 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, February), https://dx.doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2017.020.

- 1. Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1.
- 2. Measure is the overall consumer price index, the price measure that has been most widely used in government and private economic forecasts. Projections are percent changes on a fourth quarter to fourth quarter basis.
- 3. For Federal Reserve staff forecasts, measure is the federal funds rate. For other forecasts, measure is the rate on 3-month Treasury bills. Projection errors are calculated using average levels, in percent, in the fourth quarter.

Forecast Uncertainty

The economic projections provided by the members of the Board of Governors and the presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks inform discussions of monetary policy among policymakers and can aid public understanding of the basis for  policy  actions.    Considerable  uncertainty  attends  these projections, however.  The economic and statistical models and relationships used to help produce economic forecasts are necessarily imperfect descriptions of the real world, and the future path of the economy can be affected by myriad unforeseen developments and events.  Thus, in setting the stance  of  monetary  policy,  participants  consider  not  only what appears to be the most likely economic outcome as embodied in their projections, but also the range of alternative possibilities, the likelihood of their occurring, and the potential costs to the economy should they occur.

tions are summarized in the bottom-left panels of those figures.  Participants also provide judgments as to whether the risks  to  their  projections  are  weighted  to  the  upside,  are weighted to the downside, or are broadly balanced.  That is, while  the  symmetric  historical  fan  charts  shown  in  the  top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C imply that the risks to participants' projections are balanced, participants may judge that there is a greater risk that a given variable will be above rather than below their projections.  These judgments are summarized in the lower-right panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.

Table 2 summarizes the average historical accuracy of a range of forecasts, including those reported in past Monetary Policy  Report s  and  those  prepared  by  the  Federal  Reserve Board's staff in advance of meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).  The projection error ranges shown in the table illustrate the considerable uncertainty associated with economic forecasts.  For example, suppose a participant projects that real gross domestic product (GDP) and total consumer prices will rise steadily at annual rates of, respectively, 3 percent and 2 percent.  If the uncertainty attending those projections is similar to that experienced in the past  and  the  risks  around  the  projections  are  broadly  balanced, the numbers reported in table 2 would imply a probability of about 70 percent that actual GDP would expand within a range of 1.5 to 4.5 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 5.0 percent in the second and third years.  The corresponding 70 percent confidence intervals for overall inflation would be 1.2 to 2.8 percent in the current year and 1.0 to 3.0 percent  in  the  second  and  third  years.    Figures  4.A through  4.C  illustrate  these  confidence  bounds  in  'fan charts' that are symmetric and centered on the medians of FOMC participants' projections for GDP growth, the unemployment rate, and inflation.  However, in some instances, the risks around the projections may not be symmetric.  In particular, the unemployment rate cannot be negative; furthermore, the risks around a particular projection might be tilted to either the upside or the downside, in which case the corresponding fan chart would be asymmetrically positioned around the median projection.

Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed,  on  average,  over  history,  participants  provide judgments as  to  whether  the  uncertainty  attached  to  their projections of each economic variable is greater than, smaller than, or broadly similar to typical levels of forecast uncertainty seen in the past 20 years, as presented in table 2 and reflected in the widths of the confidence intervals shown in the top panels of figures 4.A through 4.C.  Participants' current assessments of the uncertainty surrounding their projec-

As with real activity and inflation, the outlook for the future path of the federal funds rate is subject to considerable uncertainty.    This  uncertainty  arises  primarily  because  each participant's assessment of the appropriate stance of monetary policy depends importantly on the evolution of real activity and inflation over time.  If economic conditions evolve in an unexpected manner, then assessments of the appropriate setting of the federal funds rate would change from that point forward.  The final line in table 2 shows the error ranges for forecasts of short-term interest rates.  They suggest that the historical confidence intervals associated with projections of the federal funds rate are quite wide.  It should be noted, however, that these confidence intervals are not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, as these projections are not forecasts of the most likely quarterly outcomes but rather are projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy and are on an endof-year basis.  However, the forecast errors should provide a sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy  that  would  be  appropriate  to  offset  the  effects  of shocks to the economy.

If  at  some  point  in  the  future  the  confidence  interval around the federal funds rate were to extend below zero, it would  be  truncated  at  zero  for  purposes  of  the  fan  chart shown in  figure 5;  zero  is  the  bottom  of  the  lowest  target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted by the Committee in the past.  This approach to the construction of the federal funds rate fan chart would be merely a convention; it would not have any implications for possible future policy decisions regarding the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so were appropriate.  In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation.

While figures 4.A through 4.C provide information on the  uncertainty  around  the  economic  projections,  figure 1 provides  information  on  the  range  of  views  across  FOMC participants.    A  comparison  of  figure  1  with  figures 4.A through  4.C  shows  that  the  dispersion  of  the  projections across participants is much smaller than the average forecast errors over the past 20 years.
