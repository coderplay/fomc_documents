Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales and Prices of New Homes

Sales of new homes rose 4¾ percent in September to an annual rate of 770,000 units, but from an August figure that was revised down nearly 8 percent to an annual rate of 735,000 units.  In addition, sales in June and July were both marked down to annual rates of about 800,000 units.  These sales figures were generally in line with our expectations, given that initial estimates of new home sales have been revised down systematically over the past two years.   As for prices, the incoming data provide solid evidence to 1 support anecdotal reports that builders are now resorting to aggressive price cuts to entice reluctant buyers.

The inventory of new homes for sale edged down for the seventh consecutive month in September and is now about 9 percent below the all-time high reached in July of last year.  Even so, these inventories still amounted to 8¼ months' supply at September's sales pace-up from about 6½ months late in 2006 and about twice what we view as the builders' desired target.

The constant-quality price index for new homes was down ¾ percent relative to its level four quarters earlier.  This was the first outright four-quarter decline in this index since 1992 and only the fifth such decline since 1964.  Average new-home prices-which are not quality adjusted-were down 2¾ percent in September relative to twelve months earlier, their third-consecutive twelve-month decline.

Consumer Sentiment

After having been unchanged in September, the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment fell to 80.9 in October.  The decrease was slightly larger than had been reported in the preliminary estimate released in the middle of the month, implying that sentiment fell a bit further in the second half of the month.  Since July, the level of sentiment has fallen below what would seem to be consistent with the news on inflation, the labor market and, until recently, the stock market; the decline may well reflect households' continued concerns regarding financial turmoil and unfavorable

developments in housing markets.  The 'expected conditions' component of the overall index decreased significantly between September and October while the 'current conditions' component was unchanged.  Nonetheless, both indexes are down noticeably from their mid-year highs.  Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened a little in October.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars also softened, as respondents reported less favorable pricing and credit conditions. However, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for houses strengthened in October, largely because of an increase in number of households noting that prices were low.

Among households, the median of expected inflation over the next twelve months remained unchanged at 3.1 percent in October, and the median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years ticked down to 2.8 percent, the lowest level in two years.

Orders and Shipments of Durable Goods

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 1.0 percent in September, on the heels of an upward-revised increase of 1.8 percent in August; new orders were up 0.4 percent.  Within the high-tech category, orders and shipments of computers and peripherals posted a robust gain in September and were revised up significantly in August.  Orders and shipments of communications equipment also rose in September. Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments increased at a solid rate last month on top of upward revisions to August, while orders were flat.

The three-month moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders increased in September for the sixth month in a row.  This series-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-is an indicator of near-term industrial production.
