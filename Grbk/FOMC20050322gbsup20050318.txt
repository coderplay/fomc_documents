The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment decreased 1.2 points in early March to 92.9, a bit below its average over the previous twelve months.

The March decline reflected a slight weakening in both components of the index.  Within the 'current conditions' component, consumers' assessments of their current personal financial situation moved lower, while assessments of buying conditions for large household appliances were unchanged.  Within the 'expected conditions' component, consumers' assessments of expected business conditions over the next twelve months receded.  But assessments of expected business conditions over the next five years edged up, and expected personal financial conditions retraced some of last month's decrease.

Among the items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened slightly.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for houses and appraisals of buying conditions for cars both dropped to their lowest levels since 2001.

While the mean of expected inflation over the next twelve months climbed to 4 percent, the median rose less, to 3.2 percent.  The mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years inched up to 3.2 percent, while the median was unchanged at 2.8 percent.

The International Economy

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In February, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods rose 0.2 and 0.3 percent, respectively.  Higher prices for food, feeds, and beverages, consumer goods, and non-petroleum industrial supplies were the main contributors to the price increase.  The price index for foods, feeds and beverages rose 1.3 percent in February, following no change in the previous month.  Prices for consumer goods rose 0.2 percent, down from the 0.5 percent increase in January.  (Within consumer goods, apparel prices fell 0.1 percent.)  Prices for imported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) rose 0.2 percent, whereas prices for imported automotive products were unchanged.  For both computers and semiconductors, import prices fell in February.

The average level of imported core goods prices in January and February was 4½ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level.  All of the major categories, except automotive products, registered substantial price gains.  In particular, both capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and consumer goods experienced increases in their inflation rates of more than 2 percentage points.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 3.9 percent in February.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil rose 2.4 percent in February-averaging about $48 per barrel.  The spot price began to increase late in the month and continued to rise in March, closing at a nominal record of $56.47 per barrel on March 16.  The increase in oil prices largely reflects indications that oil demand will remain stronger than previously anticipated and remarks by OPEC that imply the cartel is targeting a higher level of oil prices.  In addition, concerns about future supplies from Iraq, Iran, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia also continue to support oil prices.

Exports. In February, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods were unchanged.  A sharp 0.9 percent decline in agricultural products was offset by a 0.2 percent increase in industrial supplies.  Export prices for consumer goods edged lower.  Prices of exported computers ticked up, whereas prices for semiconductors declined.

The average level of exported core goods prices in January and February was 5¼ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level.  Price increases were widespread across

categories, with the exception of agricultural products, which fell.  Prices for industrial supplies posted the largest increase.

U.S. Current Account

In the fourth quarter of 2004, the U.S. current account deficit widened $88 billion to $752 billion at an annual rate, equivalent to 6¼ percent of GDP.  The change was concentrated in the trade balance on goods and services, which fell $61 billion.  The balances on income and transfers also declined.

The widening of the trade deficit occurred as an $84 billion rise in imports outweighed a $23 billion increase in exports.  Nearly half of the gain in imports reflected a surge in oil imports as both oil prices and import volumes strengthened.

The surplus on net investment income fell $11 billion as a rise in receipts was outpaced by higher payments.  Payments and receipts were both lifted by higher earnings on direct investment positions and higher average interest rates.  In addition, U.S. dividend payments to foreigners were boosted by Microsoft's special dividend in the quarter.

Net transfer payments to foreigners rose more than $16 billion in the fourth quarter.  This strong increase reflected a rebound from the unusually low level in the third quarter, which was held down by sizable inflows of insurance claims to cover hurricane-related losses.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The March 16 balance of payments press release included new data for the fourth quarter of 2004.

U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) increased to $101 billion in the fourth quarter, owing in large part to the reincorporation in the United States of News Corporation Ltd. (Australia).  For the year, record reinvested earnings helped to raise direct investment outflows to $249 billion from $174 billion in 2003.  Foreign direct investment into the United States (FDIUS) was little changed during the fourth quarter at $36 billion (line 7); for the year it increased to $116 billion from $40 billion in 2003, due to new equity investment and reinvested earnings.  The increase in U.S. direct investment abroad during 2004 was roughly offset by increased FDIUS, resulting in net direct investment outflows of approximately $135 billion in both 2003 and 2004.

The re-incorporation of News Corporation has four balance of payments components which net to zero.  The most visible is increased U.S. direct investment abroad (USDIA), reflecting the newly-formed Delaware corporation's holdings of the Australian corporation.  A small part of this USDIA is offset by new foreign direct investment into the United States, reflecting the Murdoch trust's interests in the new Delaware corporation.  In addition, private equity holdings in the Australian corporation were swapped for equity in the new entity.  U.S. residents had an estimated $22 billion swapped, which reduced U.S. equity claims on foreigners (line 5c); and foreigners were estimated to have had about $23 billion in foreign equity swapped for U.S. equity (included in line 4d).

The statistical discrepancy (last line) was positive $5 billion for the fourth quarter and positive $52 billion for the year.  A positive statistical discrepancy indicates some combination of over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net capital inflows.
