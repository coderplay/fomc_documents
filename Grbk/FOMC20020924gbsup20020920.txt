Housing Market

Total private housing starts declined 2.2 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.61 million units.  The decline was almost entirely concentrated in the Midwest, where starts dropped nearly 19 percent.  Although housing starts have retreated from the elevated levels seen during the first half of this year, homes continued to be started at about the robust pace recorded in the first half of 2001.

In the single-family sector, housing starts fell 4.4 percent in August to an annual rate of 1.25 million units, the slowest pace since last November.  In addition, single-family starts in July were revised down somewhat.  However, permit issuance for single-family construction-adjusted for activity where permits are not required-increased slightly in August and now stands well above the pace of starts.  The excess of adjusted permits relative to starts and the increase in the backlog of unused permits suggest that single-family starts may move back up in September.  In the multifamily sector, the pace of starts in August rose 6.3 percent to an annual rate of 357,000 units.  However, the issuance of  permits for multifamily housing construction dropped sharply last month, suggesting that multifamily starts may fall some in September.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit in July was $34.6 billion.  For the second quarter (which includes revised data for June), the trade deficit was $442 billion, s.a.a.r, $60 billion larger than in the first quarter and little changed from the previous estimate.

The value of exported goods and services rose 1.3 percent in July following a similar-sized increase in June.  Exports of goods were up 1.5 percent in July, owing largely to increases in exports of autos and aircraft.  Exports of services rose about 1 percent, owing to moderate gains in travel, passenger fares, and other private services.  Total exports of goods and services in July were about 2Â½ percent above the second-quarter level.

The value of imported goods and services in July dropped nearly 1 percent from the elevated June level, with similar-sized percent declines in both goods and services.  Among categories of goods, increases in industrial supplies and automotive products were more than offset by declines in both capital and consumer goods.  The decline in services imports was mainly in royalties and license fees.  The level of total imports of goods and services in July was about the same as the second-quarter level.
