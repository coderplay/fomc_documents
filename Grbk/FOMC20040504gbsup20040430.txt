Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Real Gross Domestic Product

According to the BEA's advance estimate, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 4.2 percent in the first quarter, a percentage point below the staff's April Greenbook estimate.  Inventory investment was significantly weaker than we assumed, accounting for about 3/4 percentage point of the difference.  In addition, government spending, personal consumption expenditures, and residential investment were all slightly weaker than we anticipated; in contrast, business fixed investment was in line with our expectation, and net exports were a bit stronger than we projected.

Private inventory investment contributed just 1/4 percentage point to the change in real GDP last quarter, compared with a boost of 3/4 percentage point in the fourth quarter.  The BEA's procedures for deriving constant-dollar stocks of trucks and for seasonally adjusting them yielded a smaller accumulation than we estimated-albeit still a sizable one.  In addition, the BEA's translation of book-value inventories outside of the motor vehicle sector into constant-dollar terms resulted in a smaller real accumulation of stocks than occurred in the fourth quarter; we had expected the estimate of real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles to show the same rate of accumulation as in the fourth quarter.

Final sales rose at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter after having increased 3.4 percent in the fourth quarter.  Among the components of final demand, real PCE moved up at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, as a decline in spending on motor vehicles was more than offset by a pickup in spending on other goods and services.  Real business investment in equipment and software posted another double-digit advance in the first quarter, but nonresidential structures investment fell again.  Residential investment rose in the first quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the fourth quarter.  Federal government consumption and investment increased at an annual rate of 10.1 percent in the first quarter because of a surge in spending on national defense, while state and local government outlays declined at an annual rate of 2.6 percent.

Exports and imports both increased modestly on the heels of outsized jumps in the fourth quarter.  On balance, the arithmetic contribution of net exports to the change in real GDP growth was 0.02 percentage point compared with the -0.16 percentage point we had expected.  The difference is largely explained by the BEA's lower estimate of imports, with about half of the miss being associated with weaker service imports.  The increase in real exports was reported to have been slightly higher than we projected, at 3.2 percent versus our forecasted 2.7 percent, with stronger-than-expected exports of goods more

than offsetting weaker-than-expected exports of services.  Core import price inflation was less than expected, at 6.6 percent versus our projected 7.2 percent.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending

Total nominal personal income rose at an annual rate of $38 billion in March following upward-revised increases of $46 billion in February and $49 billion in January.  For the first quarter, both wages and salaries and supplements to earned income posted larger gains than in the fourth quarter, but the gains in rental and interest income were noticeably smaller.  Personal taxes were down $26.5 billion (annual rate) from the fourth-quarter level because of January's downward adjustment to federal income taxes.  As a result, current-dollar disposable personal income increased $155.4 billion in the first quarter.  Real disposable personal income, which increased 3.6 percent in 2003, rose at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first quarter.

Real personal consumption expenditures were up 0.1 percent in March after having increased 0.2 percent per month in January and February.  Although spending on motor vehicles turned up in March, it was down sharply, on average, in the first quarter.  However, real outlays for other durables increased at an annual rate of 7-1/2 percent last quarter, real spending on non-energy nondurable goods picked up at a 7-1/4 percent rate, and real expenditures for non-energy services expenditures rose at a 4 percent pace.  Real outlays for energy goods and services fluctuated widely during the first quarter; for the quarter as a whole, real outlays for nondurable energy products were, on balance, little changed from the fourth-quarter level, but real spending on energy services was sharply higher.  The personal saving rate, which had dipped to 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter, inched up to 1.9 percent in the first quarter.

According to the final report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment edged down about 1-1/2 points in April, but remained above its level at the end of last year.  Both components of the index were down slightly:  The 'current conditions' component slid about 2 points as consumers' assessments of their current personal financial situation and of buying conditions for large household appliances both decreased.  The 'expected conditions' component slipped 1-1/2 points as consumers' appraisals of their expected personal financial situation and of expected business conditions over the next five years both weakened.  Assessments of business conditions over the next twelve months were unchanged.

Among those items not included in the overall index, consumers' assessments of buying conditions for houses strengthened somewhat in April.   Consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months also improved a touch.  In contrast, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars fell.

In April, the median of expected inflation over the next twelve months rose to 3.2 percent, while the mean jumped to 4 percent.  Both measures stand at their highest levels since the middle of 2001.  In contrast, the median and mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years slid to 2.7 percent and 3.2 percent, respectively.

Prices and Labor Costs

The chain-weighted GDP price index is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the first quarter, and the index for PCE prices was up at a 3-1/4 percent rate.  Core PCE prices rose at a rate of 2 percent last quarter following an increase of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter.  The BEA's estimate of core PCE price inflation was somewhat higher than the staff's estimate because it included an upward-revised increase in the price index for medical services in January.  With the revision, the four-quarter change in core PCE prices was 1.3 percent in the first quarter compared with 1.6 percent over the four quarters ending in 2003:Q1.

The employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent over the three months ending in March.  The wages and salaries component of the ECI rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent while the benefits component increased at a pace of nearly 11 percent.  Over the twelve months ending in March, the ECI for total compensation rose 3.9 percent, about matching the increase in the preceding two twelve-month periods.  Wages and salaries in March were up 2.6 percent from a year earlier, about 1/2 percentage point less than the increase in the preceding year.  Workers in the construction industry, where activity has been remarkably strong, as well as those in retail trade and services saw wages accelerate over the year ending in March.  However, wages in the financial industry, which had been increasing rapidly, slowed markedly; workers in manufacturing, transportation, and wholesale trade also saw their wages decelerate.

In contrast, benefit costs increased 7 percent over the twelve months ending in March, a pickup of nearly a percentage point over the previous twelve months. 1 The acceleration in benefit costs mainly reflected a step-up in contributions to defined-benefit pension funds.  The rise in costs for health insurance, which previously had been contributing to a pickup in benefit costs, slowed a bit in this report, although the rate of increase remained high.  With the rapid rise in benefit costs, the twelve-month changes in hourly compensation for workers in most industries in March were at or above the rates of increase recorded in the preceding year; the exceptions were finance and wholesale trade.

Labor Productivity and Costs

Nonfarm Business Sector

(Percent change from preceding period at compound annual rate; seasonally adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

Four-quarter changes in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector, have been running roughly in line with changes in the ECI over the past year. Official figures for the first quarter will be released on May 6, and we currently estimate that compensation per hour increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent last quarter.  The release also will incorporate revisions to compensation in the third and fourth quarters of last year, based on unemployment insurance tax records that are more comprehensive (but much less timely) than the average hourly earnings figures used by the BEA in forming its initial compensation estimates. 2 We currently estimate that the four-quarter change in compensation per hour through the first quarter of this year was about 4 percent.

On May 6, the Bureau of Labor Statistics will also release its advance estimate of productivity for the first quarter.  Based on the NIPA output data and the available data on hours, we estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, above the fourth-quarter pace but below the average increase of the last two years. Productivity measured with only employee hours is expected to have increased more slowly, at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the first quarter.  The rates of

increase differ because of a sharp decline in the hours worked by self- employed workers in March.
