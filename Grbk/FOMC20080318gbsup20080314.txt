The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Sentiment

After a sharp decline in February, the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment held steady in early March at a low level.  Households' assessment of business conditions during the next twelve months was even more pessimistic in March than in February, but their longer-term view of the economy improved somewhat.  While respondents' appraisal of buying conditions for large household goods improved slightly, their views of buying cars and homes slipped.  More than 50 percent of households now expect the unemployment rate to rise over the next year.

Households' median expectation for year-ahead inflation jumped almost 1 percentage point in March to 4.5 percent from 3.6 percent in February.  This is highest level recorded since the month after Hurricane Katrina.  In contrast, the median expectation for inflation over the next five years edged down to 2.9 percent.

Consumer Prices

The consumer price index (CPI) was essentially unchanged in February, as energy prices fell ½ percent and core prices were unchanged.  February's flat core CPI reflected a moderation in a few of the categories with high inflation recently.  Prices for apparel fell after seasonal adjustment following sizable increases in recent months; lodging away from home dropped back, reversing its significant rise in January; and increases in the indexes for medical services and tenants' and owners' equivalent rent were a good bit lower than in recent months.  The twelve-month increase in the core CPI stood at 2.3 percent in February, 0.4 percentage point less than the rise over the previous twelve months.

Based on our translation of the February CPI data, we estimate that both overall PCE prices and core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent last month.   Lodging away from home and 1 tenants' and owners' equivalent rent receive a lower weight in PCE than they do in the CPI, and the estimate of medical services in the PCE index comes largely from the producer price index (PPI) instead of the CPI.  These differences, along with other weighting differences between the CPI and PCE prices, suggest core PCE inflation in February will moderate substantially less than the CPI.

Last month's decline of ½ percent in the CPI for energy reversed only a small portion of the substantial jump in energy prices since the end of last summer.  A sharp increase in natural gas prices in February was more than offset by falling prices for other energy components, particularly a decline of 2 percent in gasoline prices.  However, the fall in gasoline prices appears to have been short-lived as survey data from late February and early March suggest a considerable rise in gasoline prices in the March CPI, and futures

prices suggest further near-term price increases.  For the twelve months ending in February, energy prices in the CPI increased 19 percent, compared with a decline of 1 percent over the previous twelve month period.

Despite declines in prices for meats and for fruits and vegetables, CPI food prices continued their upward climb-rising 0.4 percent in February.  Prices of dairy products increased 0.8 percent, and the index for food away from home rose 0.4 percent.  Food away from home, one of the least volatile indexes in the CPI, has increased at roughly a 4 percent rate for much of the past year.  Overall, the CPI for food was up 4.6 percent over the twelve months ending in February, 1.5 percentage points more than over the preceding year.
