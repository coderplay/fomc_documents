Trade in Goods  and Services

The U.S.  trade  deficit in goods  and services  was  $27.1  billion in August, $2  billion  smaller than in  July.  For July-August combined, the deficit was $338 billion  at a seasonally  adjusted  annual  rate, considerably  smaller than  in the second quarter as imports fell  more than exports  declined.

(Billions of dollars,  seasonally  adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of imports fell  1.1  percent in August, the fifth sharp decline in seven months.  Decreases were recorded in  almost all  major trade categories. The value of imported oil changed little  as a small drop in quantity was offset by an  increase in price. For July and August combined,  the value of imports fell 14 percent at  an annual rate from the second-quarter  level; this follows  a  similar decrease in the  second quarter.  The decline  in July-August was  spread  among all  major trade categories  other than automotive products, food, and to a much lesser extent aircraft,  which rose.

The value of exports  increased  1 percent in  August, only partly reversing the sharp drop recorded in July.  Much  of the increase was  in automotive products, industrial  supplies,  and agricultural  products.  For July and August combined, the value of exports fell  12 percent  at an annual rate from the second-quarter level;  this follows  a similar decrease  in  the  second  quarter.  While the decline was concentrated  in  exported  capital  goods, there were also  substantial  decreases in exported consumer goods  and industrial  supplies.
