Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Spending

Total nominal retail sales increased 0.3 percent in February.  Sales in the retail control group of stores (which exclude motor vehicle dealers, gasoline stations, and building material and supply stores, and are the component of overall retail sales used by the BEA in constructing the national accounts) jumped 0.9 percent in February following a downward-revised gain of 0.6 percent in January.  The gains were spread widely across establishment types and were especially robust at general merchandise stores, food and beverage stores, electronics and appliance stores, auto parts stores, and other retailers. Folding in our forecast for February PCE prices, we estimate that real PCE control moved up 0.8 percent in February.

Consumer Attitudes

The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment edged down in early March, as assessments of both current and expected conditions fell back a bit. Overall, measures of consumer sentiment remain relatively downbeat and have improved little, on balance, since their modest rebound last spring.

The preliminary survey results for the median expectation for inflation over the next 12 months edged up in March, returning to its January level, while the median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years was unchanged.  At 2.8 and 2.7 percent, respectively, these readings remained at the low end of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years.

Federal Government Sector

The data for defense spending in the Monthly Treasury Statement for February were consistent with real defense purchases remaining roughly flat in the first quarter of 2010.

The unified federal budget deficit widened further over the first five months of fiscal 2010.  Net receipts were 7 percent lower in the October to February period than they had been a year earlier.  Federal outlays in October-February rose 1½ percent relative to the same period a year earlier as a substantial decrease in outlays for the TARP largely offset a 9½ percent increase in other spending. 1

Business Inventories

Folding in a modest decline in the book-value of retail inventories excluding motor vehicles and parts, the combined book-value of inventories in the manufacturing and trade sector (excluding motor vehicles and parts) fell at an annual rate of $7 billion in January.  This figure is consistent with a further small liquidation of real stocks.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales (excluding motor vehicles and parts) edged down again in January and stood well below the recent peak recorded near the end of 2008.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $37.3 billion in January, as a modest fall in exports was more than offset by a decline in imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

BOP  Balance of payments.

NIPA  National income and product accounts.

In January, the value of exports of goods and services declined 0.3 percent.  The decrease was concentrated primarily in capital goods, as aircraft partially reversed very strong December sales and industrial machinery declined.  Automotive products also fell sharply driven by a decline in sales outside of North America.  Exports of agricultural products, services, fuels, chemicals and consumer goods all posted small increases.

The value of imports of goods and services fell 1.7 percent in January, as oil, capital goods, automotive products and consumer goods all registered declines, more than offsetting a rise in industrial goods.  The decrease in oil was driven by falling volume, as prices increased moderately.  Capital goods fell as computers and telecommunication products partially retraced strong gains at the end of 2009, while automotive products purchases were down across major trading partners.  Consumer imports fell on account of large declines in televisions and pharmaceuticals.
