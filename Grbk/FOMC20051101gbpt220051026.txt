Overview

Hurricane Rita hit the Gulf Coast on September 24, barely four weeks after Hurricane Katrina.  These storms caused considerable damage and disruption, and although the overall magnitudes of their immediate effect and aftermath are still uncertain, they undoubtedly depressed economic activity in September and October.  The energy sector was most clearly affected, as the hurricanes severely curtailed oil and natural gas extraction and petroleum refining in the Gulf region.  Despite progress in bringing the Gulf's energy production capacity back on line, a significant portion of that capacity remains shut in, and recovery is expected to continue for some time.  Energy prices jumped sharply in the wake of each hurricane, and while the ongoing restoration of energy production capacity has brought energy prices down from their post-hurricane peaks, they generally remain at lofty levels.

The limited information currently available suggests that economic activity outside of the Gulf region, at least so far, appears to have been well maintained.  Hiring in September in the areas unaffected by the hurricanes was reported to be in line with its moderate pace of expansion over the preceding year, and, excluding the estimated effects of the hurricanes and the Boeing strike on production, industrial output increased briskly last month.  In addition, residential construction remained buoyant.  Consumer spending, however, showed some signs of weakness.  Although spending appears to have been strong for the third quarter as a whole, it was particularly soft in September, and consumer confidence has slumped noticeably since August.  Despite the huge increase in consumer energy costs, core price inflation was still restrained through September.

Energy Sector

Hurricane Rita caused further disruption to energy production in the Gulf area, which had not yet fully recovered from Hurricane Katrina.  Immediately after the second hurricane, essentially all crude oil extraction, more than three-quarters of natural gas extraction, and about two-thirds of petroleum refining in the Gulf region was shut in.   The energy 1 production lost in the Gulf area limited total domestic crude oil production and petroleum refining to about 70 percent of their pre-Katrina levels, while total domestic natural gas production stood at about 85 percent of its pre-hurricane level.

Activity in October is still below pre-hurricane levels, although progress has been made in bringing shutdown energy facilities back on line.  As of October 24, total domestic crude oil production was running at about 80 percent of its pre-Katrina level, and natural gas production remained below 90 percent of its pre-hurricane rate.   Full recovery is not 2 expected until the spring of next year.  Meanwhile, four Gulf area refineries remain idle,

and another six are in the process of restarting or are operating at reduced rates, keeping domestic refining output below 90 percent of its pre-Katrina level.  Some refinery outages are expected to last until the end of the year.

While Hurricane Katrina had trimmed a bit off industrial production at the end of August, the hurricanes caused the IP index for oil and natural gas extraction and refining to plummet 11 percent in September.  Although the level of production in the energy industries remains below pre-hurricane levels, the industries' recoveries are expected to provide a small boost to the rate of change in energy IP in October.

Following the hurricanes, rising imports, along with more-subdued consumption of gasoline and other petroleum products, helped to offset some of the output losses in refined products.  In addition, to address the low level of gasoline inventories and more-immediate retail demands, domestic refiners sharply increased the share of gasoline in their output of total refined product.   These developments helped to boost gasoline 3 inventories a bit, although they still hover near their low pre-hurricane levels.  At the same time, inventories of heating oil and other refined products (such as diesel fuel and jet fuel) have declined from their high pre-hurricane levels as a result of shutdown production and the shift in the refining mix.  In contrast, as the Gulf's natural gas production capacity has recovered, inventories of natural gas have continued to accumulate, and their current level is a little above average for this time of year.

Wholesale gasoline prices spiked soon after Rita's landfall but have since declined to prehurricane levels.  Retail prices for regular gasoline have declined more than 30 cents per gallon from their post-Rita peak.  Although retail gasoline prices and margins are down from their recent highs, they remain above levels seen before the hurricanes.  Prices for heating oil are significantly above their pre-Katrina peak.  The shift in the refining mix, and concerns about supply for the winter, have resulted in heating oil prices falling back only modestly as refining capacity has come back on line.  Rising spot prices for natural gas soared further with the hurricanes and remain at elevated levels, even though the inventory situation for natural gas appears comfortable at the moment.  Indeed, because of limited capability to import natural gas, concerns about the adequacy of inventories for the peak winter heating season have intensified as some capacity in the Gulf is expected to remain shut in through the end of the winter.

Labor Market Developments

The rise in employment in September was held down by job losses associated with Hurricane Katrina.  Private nonfarm payrolls fell 66,000 in September, whereas the level

of private employment in August was revised up 51,000. 4,5 Although the BLS did not publish a precise figure on hurricane-related job losses, it stated that employment in the areas unaffected by the hurricane appeared to increase in line with the average pace over the twelve months ending in August.  On the basis of this information, we estimate that Hurricane Katrina held down employment by approximately 220,000 in September. 6 However, measuring the change in employment stemming from such a major disruption is difficult and is associated with a wide band of uncertainty.

The largest employment loss in September occurred in the leisure and hospitality category, an industry particularly hard hit by Hurricane Katrina.  Employment in retail trade also registered a sharp decline, much of which was likely the consequence of hurricane disruptions and higher energy prices.  In manufacturing, only the ship and boat building category experienced job losses that appeared to be related directly to the hurricane.  Elsewhere in manufacturing, and in industries such as natural resources and health services, establishments in the storm-affected region, particularly large ones, had apparently either reopened, continued to pay their idle employees, or relocated such employees.  Also, the marked increase in the demand for workers in temporary help services may have reflected in part the hiring of relief workers.

The workweek remained at 33.7 hours in September, and aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined 0.2 percent, an indication of only a small hurricanerelated effect.  For the third quarter as a whole, aggregate hours increased at an annual rate of 1.7 percent after a rise of 2.8 percent in the second quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate moved up 0.2 percentage point in September to 5.1 percent, largely because of an increase in the number of newly unemployed.  Although the BLS did not estimate the effect of Hurricane Katrina on the unemployment rate, part of the increase may be attributable to the hurricane.  In contrast, the participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent in September.  While some individuals displaced by Hurricane Katrina may have reported themselves as being out of the labor

force, the number of individuals reporting that they had a job but were not at work because of bad weather increased tremendously last month to a seasonally adjusted level of 408,000, the highest level since the hurricane-affected September reading of last year. Initial claims for unemployment insurance are indicative of substantial job losses associated with hurricanes Katrina and Rita.  As of the week ending October 15, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) estimates that nearly 480,000 of the claims filed since early September have been related to the hurricanes.   Alternatively, 7 the cumulative effects of the hurricanes can be measured by the increase in insured unemployment, which, as of the week ending October 8, stood about 300,000 above its pre-Katrina level.  However, job losses associated with the hurricanes appear to be subsiding.  In the most recent reporting week, 355,000 new claims were filed--well below the peak of the surge after the hurricanes and almost back to its pre-hurricane range.

Most other indicators of current labor market activity appear to have been unaffected by the hurricanes-at least so far--and remain generally consistent with moderately improving labor market conditions.  The exhaustion rate moved down in September, retracing its August rise.  After falling sharply in June, the percentage of the labor force unemployed more than twenty-six weeks has moved up gradually over the past several months, but still remains below the May level.  Layoff announcements fell back in August from early summer highs and persisted at this lower level in September.  The share of firms reporting to the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) that they had a hard-to-fill position was little changed in September and remained close to its highest level this year.  However, household perceptions of labor market conditions were a little less upbeat.  According to the Conference Board, household assessments of job availability were nearly unchanged in October after having fallen sharply in September to their lowest level since the end of last year.

Forward-looking indicators of labor market conditions paint a mixed picture, as households' expectations are apparently less optimistic than those of businesses.  The net hiring plans of small businesses reporting to the NFIB were unchanged last month after having popped up in August, and the three-month moving average climbed to its highest level since February.  In contrast, households' expected labor market conditions, as reported in both the Michigan and Conference Board surveys in September, fell back to their lowest levels in several years.  In October, the preliminary reading from the Michigan survey suggests only a slight recovery in expectations, while expectations in the Conference Board survey worsened a bit further.

Industrial Production

The hurricanes and the strike at Boeing took their toll on industrial output in September. As a result, total IP fell 1.3 percent.  But, excluding the effects of the hurricane-related

disturbances and the Boeing strike, industrial production is estimated to have risen a brisk 0.8 percent in September.  Our best estimate of the effects of the hurricanes in September is that the change in IP was reduced by about 1.7 percentage points, and the Boeing strike subtracted nearly another 0.5 percentage point.  For the third quarter as a whole, IP increased at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent, about the same pace as in the second quarter, when output was restrained by a marked slowing in inventory accumulation. Excluding the hurricane and strike effects, the third-quarter rise in IP is estimated to have been at an annual rate of about 5.2 percent.

Besides the energy-producing industries, the hurricanes also significantly affected chemicals producers.  In particular, petrochemical production, which is concentrated along the Gulf Coast near feedstocks, plunged 20 percent in September.  As of October 17, facilities that account for roughly 12.5 percent of domestic petrochemical capacity remained closed.  Elsewhere, manufacturing output fell noticeably in the shipbuilding, food manufacturing (including sugar, coffee, seafood, and poultry), paper, and plywood industries.

The machinists' strike at Boeing, which lasted from September 2 to September 29, caused the company to cease nearly all commercial aircraft production during the month. 8 Boeing expects to return production rapidly to pre-strike levels-thereby contributing about ½ percentage point to the change in IP in October-and will likely boost output further in the coming months to make up for the production losses.  Elsewhere in transportation equipment, motor vehicle production climbed 300,000 units in September to an annual rate of 12.5 million units.  In the third quarter, automakers assembled vehicles at an annual rate of 12.2 million units, a pace about ½ million units higher than assemblies in the second quarter.  Despite current inventories of light motor vehicles near a record low after the summer sell-off, the industry plans to begin the official 2006 model year with a production rate of 11.9 million units in the fourth quarter, about 300,000 units below the third-quarter pace.

High-tech output-led by strong gains in the production of semiconductors and communications equipment-surged 3¾ percent in September.  In the third quarter, hightech output rose at an annual rate of 31 percent, a significant acceleration from the tepid second-quarter pace and the largest quarterly increase since the middle of 2000. Semiconductor production jumped 4.6 percent in September, and monthly output gains averaged almost 4 percent during the third quarter.  Production gains in the industry were broad-based and were led by especially large increases for chips used in communications equipment and consumer electronics.

suggests continued strength in real output of microprocessors, though the pace of production gains will likely slow a bit.  Although the monthly index for communications equipment has been volatile of late, production has expanded substantially-output jumped at an annual rate of nearly 30 percent in the third quarter--and industry reports support a bright outlook for this sector.  Computer producers remain the laggards among domestic high-tech manufacturers, as production gains are running below the pace of the late 1990s.  However, recent data from Gartner indicates that sales of PCs and servers were strong in the third quarter, and that strength is perhaps a forerunner of a larger stepup in production in this category.

In other market groups, output gains continue to be mixed.  Excluding the strike-related drop in aircraft production, the output of business equipment rose in September and was up at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent during the third quarter.  In addition, the output of defense and space equipment jumped at an annual rate of more than 6 percent in the third quarter despite the hurricanes' disruption to shipbuilding.  In contrast, the production of consumer goods, which had been weak over most of the year, only edged up in September.  The production of construction supplies rose slightly in September, but output increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent for the third quarter overall, and production should be supported in the future by the rebuilding in the Gulf region.  The output of business supplies edged down for a fourth consecutive month in September.

Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity generally point to solid production gains in the coming months.  The three-month moving average of the Board staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders rose about 1¾ percent in August, and the Institute for Supply Management's new orders diffusion index jumped in September to its highest level in more than a year.  The first readings for October from the regional surveys were also favorable; the new orders diffusion indexes from both the FRB New York and the FRB Philadelphia surveys rose smartly to levels consistent with solid output gains in the months ahead.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light vehicles declined more than 400,000 units in September to an annual rate of 16.3 million units.  General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler extended their employee discount programs through the end of September.  By most accounts, however, the pricing schemes, which had boosted sales to near-record levels earlier in the summer, offered only modest support to sales in September, as they had been set to expire earlier and their potential effect had likely already run much of its course.   In addition, inventories of the 9 most popular GM and Ford 2005 models were nearly depleted at the beginning of September.  For the third quarter as a whole, however, sales of light vehicles averaged 17.9 million units, the highest pace recorded in almost four years.

Because employee discounts substituted for traditional consumer incentives in September, the average incentive per light vehicle sold declined $66 last month. 10 In October, incentives have fallen an additional $60 despite the expiration of the employee discount programs.  Part of the recent decline reflects a sharp drop in September in the market share of large and mid-sized SUVs, which carry larger cash-back rebates than do other market segments.  Going forward, statements by General Motors-the market leader in incentives-indicate that the automaker intends to curtail incentives for the 2006 model year.  GM's commitment to pricing with lower average incentives over the next several months is a topic of industry speculation, and the transition could be challenged if sales are weak this fall.

Although price discounts boosted consumers' car buying attitudes this summer, high gasoline prices took a toll on consumer sentiment in September and October.  Motor vehicle buying conditions, as measured in the Michigan SRC index, fell sharply in September, and preliminary data for October indicate that the index has edged down a bit further this month.  The percentage of respondents who blamed high gasoline prices or gasoline shortages for the deterioration in vehicle buying conditions jumped to 20 percent in September and increased further to 24 percent in October, a level not seen since July 1979.

Looking ahead, automakers anticipate that the pace of sales will cool considerably in the fourth quarter, partly as payback for the sales this summer that were brought forward by the discount programs.  Press reports in October indicate that showroom traffic at auto dealerships has slumped, and our industry contacts anticipate that sales of light vehicles in October will move down into the range of 14½ million to 15½ million units.

Consumer Spending

Real consumer spending appears to have increased at an annual rate of about 3½ percent in the third quarter as a whole, although it slowed markedly in August and September after having risen substantially earlier in the summer.  The recent slump in spending reflects in part the diminishing boost to light vehicle sales from manufacturers' employee discount programs.  However, spending on other goods and services has also been sluggish, likely as a consequence of the direct effects of the dislocation of households by the hurricanes, stratospheric energy prices, and falling consumer confidence.  The personal saving rate has been below zero since June and stood at negative ¾ percent in August, held down 0.3 percentage point, according to the BEA, by the estimated effects on personal income of Hurricane Katrina.

In the retail control category of goods, which excludes sales by auto dealers and building material and supply stores, nominal spending increased 1 percent in September-about the same as in August-and was led by an increase of 4 percent in spending at gasoline stations.  Retail sales at gasoline stations include items other than gasoline, such as

purchases at convenience stores, but a 4 percent increase is remarkably small in light of the 18 percent rise in gasoline prices last month.  Taking the retail sales data at face value, we estimate that real spending in PCE goods excluding motor vehicles fell 0.8 percent in September after having been unchanged in August. 11

Rising home prices have continued to boost household wealth, but equity prices have declined recently, and other fundamentals for consumer spending have also been a little less favorable because of factors related to the hurricanes.  Although nominal wages and salaries rose in August, real disposable income fell ½ percent, mostly because of steep increases in energy prices and Hurricane Katrina's hit to rental and proprietor's income. 12 Increases in average hourly earnings suggest a further gain in nominal wages and salaries in September, but sharply higher energy prices presumably held down real income last month.  Rising interest rates are also damping the rise in consumer spending.  Consumer sentiment in October, as measured by both the preliminary reading of the Michigan Survey and the Conference Board, dropped a little further after having plunged in September.  Consumer sentiment appears to have weakened even more than underlying fundamentals would suggest and is likely putting some downward pressure on spending.

Housing Markets

Residential construction has continued at a robust pace.  New single-family homes were started at an annual rate of 1.75 million units in September, a bit above their average level in the first half of the year.  New adjusted permit issuance jumped in September to a new high of 1.75 million units, while the backlog of unused permits was still near record levels.  In the multifamily sector, starts in August and September remained at the average pace seen since 2001.  Permits for these units in the past two months were a bit lower than in the first half of the year but remained strong in comparison with previous years.

New home sales in August fell 9.9 percent from July's elevated level to an annual rate of 1.24 million units. The stock of new homes for sale moved up in August and represented 4.7 months of supply at August's sales pace.  Although months' supply is now at the upper end of the range it has occupied since 1996, it remains low by historical norms. Sales of existing single-family homes rose 0.6 percent in September after having risen 1¾ percent in August.  Inventories of existing homes for sale moved up in September and

equaled 4.7 months' supply at September's pace-also at the high end of recent readings but a good bit below the historical average.

Other recent indicators of homebuying activity have been mixed.  Although they remain low historically, both the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate and the one-year adjustable rate have moved up a bit in recent months and are now about 40 and 75 basis points, respectively, above the levels seen at the beginning of the year.  The Michigan SRC index of homebuying attitudes fell sharply in September and October to its lowest level since October 2000.  In contrast, the Mortgage Bankers Association's index of mortgage applications for home purchases remained elevated through early October.  The average price of existing homes sold in September was 10 percent higher than it was a year earlier, about the same increase as in the previous twelve-month period.  However, the average price of new homes has decelerated markedly over the past couple of months.

Equipment and Software

Real outlays for equipment and software appear to have been sluggish last summer. Nevertheless, a broad-based pickup in orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft in August may be pointing to a firming that would bring capital spending into better alignment with relatively solid investment fundamentals-namely, continued expansion in business sales, a declining cost of capital, and corporate balance sheets that are flush with cash.  Surveys of executive sentiment currently square well with these fundamentals:  Although business leaders have expressed some misgivings about the overall macroeconomic environment, their stated capital spending intentions point to increasing investment.

In the high-tech sector, recent orders and shipments data for computers, on net, point to moderate real spending gains.  Similarly, earnings reports from major software vendors have shown solid, though unspectacular, growth.  Real outlays for communications equipment likely expanded at a robust pace in the third quarter, a development consistent with industry reports that telecom service providers had planned solid increases in capital spending for the second half of this year.

Outside of a sharp strike-related drop in aircraft investment, business spending on transportation has been well maintained.  Domestic automakers, which account for the bulk of fleet sales, appear to have taken advantage of the pause in retail sales in August and September to speed up deliveries of light vehicles to businesses.  Sales of medium and heavy trucks were also strong in September; in particular, the recent strength in sales of class 8 trucks, according to industry sources, may reflect some pull-forward in demand before new EPA regulations on engines take effect in 2007.

Real business outlays for non-high-tech, non-transportation equipment appear to have remained soft over the summer after having declined modestly in the second quarter.  The most recent data, however, suggest that spending growth may be regaining traction; August shipments of non-high-tech, non-transportation equipment advanced 1.4 percent,

and orders moved up 1.9 percent. Moreover, after having floundered earlier in the year, imports of this type of equipment rose 3.4 percent in August.

Nonresidential Construction

Although vacancy rates for nonresidential properties have continued to edge down, they remain elevated for office and industrial properties, and real spending on new construction has yet to markedly improve.  The vacancy rate for office buildings stood at 12½ percent in the third quarter, about 2 percentage points below its peak in the first quarter of 2004.  Construction in this sector, however, remains at a low level.  Spending on commercial buildings has also held steady at a low level since the middle of 2002, despite persistently high occupancy rates for these types of structures.  Furthermore, real construction outlays in the manufacturing sector dipped during the summer after having increased late last year.

In contrast, in the drilling and mining sector, the number of gas rigs in operation continued to rise in September and, according to initial estimates from Baker Hughes, remained high in early October.  The number of rigs drilling for crude oil rose over the summer after some weakness last spring and is estimated to have held fairly steady after the recent hurricanes.  The Baker Hughes data, however, consider rigs to be operating unless officially confirmed lost or significantly damaged; thus, the data may not yet fully reflect hurricane-related disruptions. 13

Business Inventories

Business investment in real nonfarm inventories was relatively subdued over the summer. The book value of stocks held by the manufacturing and trade sectors, excluding motor vehicles, increased in July and August at annual rates of $36 billion and $42 billion respectively.  However, a portion of the accumulation was in the petroleum sector and probably related to the run-up in oil prices.

Although inventory-to-sales ratios moved down some in July and August, businesses did not appear dissatisfied with their level of stocks.  For example, September survey results from the ISM indicate that respondents viewed their customers' current inventory situation as reasonably well aligned with demand.  Information from the staff's flow-ofgoods inventory system suggests that inventory-consumption ratios rose in September. Excluding motor vehicles, however, much of the increase was concentrated in the chemicals and aerospace industries, in which hurricane- and strike-related shutdowns markedly decreased consumption.  Elsewhere-with the exception of paper-inventories remained well aligned with consumption.

Federal Sector

As a result of an exceptionally strong increase in tax receipts in September, the fiscal 2005 budget closed with a deficit of $319 billion.  As recently as August, the

Congressional Budget Office had projected a deficit of $331 billion for the fiscal year. Legislative initiatives, particularly spending for hurricane disaster relief, continue to put some upward pressure on the deficit outlook.

Tax receipts in September stood 18½ percent above the year-earlier level (after adjusting for payment timing shifts), boosted by a jump of 46 percent in corporate income tax collections. 14 September is an important month for corporate tax collections because of the quarterly tax filing deadline of September 15, and payments last month were much larger than they were in earlier quarters.  A portion of the surge in corporate receipts may reflect one-time payments on repatriated corporate foreign earnings. 15 Nonetheless, quarterly payments for nonwithheld personal income and social insurance taxes were 23 percent higher than they were a year earlier, also a larger increase than the one seen in earlier quarterly payments.

Outlays in September, adjusted for shifts in payment timing, rose 12 percent from a year earlier, a significantly larger increase than for the fiscal year as a whole.  The acceleration in spending reflected an increase in outlays for disaster relief, Medicare, and defense. Disaster relief spending in September by the Department of Homeland Security totaled $4 billion, an amount about $3½ billion higher than such spending in September 2004.

For the fiscal year as a whole, receipts rose 14 percent, reaching 17½ percent of GDP, while outlays increased 7 percent, remaining around 20 percent of GDP.  As a result, the deficit fell from $413 billion in fiscal 2004 to $319 billion in fiscal 2005, or 2½ percent of GDP.

The Congress continues to consider legislation related to hurricane relief.  In September, the Congress passed $62.6 billion in new budget authority for disaster relief, $2 billion in borrowing authority for the federal flood insurance program, and $6 billon in tax cuts (over two years). 16 With regards to regular budget legislation, little progress has been made on the annual appropriations bills and on the two reconciliation bills to reduce taxes

16 In September, the Department of Energy sold 11 million barrels of crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (at an average price of $63.85 per barrel).  In addition, exchange agreements--which are in-kind loans of oil that are paid back with oil--were reached for 13.2 million barrels, although the amount was later reduced to 10.8 million barrels at the request of the contractors.  As of October 24, about 5½ million barrels of oil had been delivered from the sale agreements, and almost 9½ million barrels had been delivered from the exchange agreements.  Damage done by Hurricane Rita reduced the rate at which purchasers have been able to take delivery of the oil and process it, so delivery is planned to continue through November.

and mandatory spending.  The Congress passed a continuing resolution on September 30 to fund government programs normally covered under the annual appropriations bills through November 18.

State and Local Government Sector

Indicators of state and local government spending have posted moderate increases in recent months against a backdrop of improving financial conditions.  State and local employment rose 32,000 in September despite layoffs in New Orleans as a result of the closure of its schools after Hurricane Katrina.  Employment gains over the three months ending in September averaged 38,000, a pace more than twice the one seen over the past year.  Nominal construction spending is now estimated to have risen 0.7 percent in August and 0.5 percent in July.  These data are consistent with a small gain for the third quarter in the NIPA measure of real state and local investment in structures.

Census data indicate that tax revenues at the state and local levels increased markedly in the second quarter.  For the year ending in June, state taxes were 8 percent higher than they were the previous year, as individual income tax revenues surged.  Local governments experienced a 6½ percent increase in tax revenues, led by a sizable increase in property tax payments (which account for about 75 percent of local revenues).  With spending rising moderately and receipts robust, state and local finances continued to improve.  The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that general fund balances of state governments for fiscal 2005, which in general closed in June, were higher than expected; the increase reflects the surge in tax receipts.  The balances of the forty-six states included in the survey reached 7 percent of spending, somewhat above the average level seen over the past 20 years. 17 Looking toward fiscal 2006, these states have budgeted an increase of 5¾ percent in general fund spending.  According to the survey, new legislation is expected to boost revenues ½ percent on net, as increases in tobacco taxes outweigh small cuts to personal income taxes.

Prices

Soaring energy prices boosted overall measures of consumer price inflation during the past three months.  However, recent measures of core consumer price inflation have been much more restrained.  Although the aggregate CPI rose 1.2 percent in September-the largest monthly increase in 25 years-core consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent for the fifth straight month.  The latest figures left the estimated twelve-month change in core PCE prices at 1.9 percent, essentially the same as in the year-earlier period.  In contrast, we estimate that overall PCE prices increased 3.7 percent over the twelve months ending in September, compared with 2.4 percent a year earlier. 18

The CPI for energy rose 12 percent in September, after increases of 5 percent in August and 3.8 percent in July.  Motor fuel prices jumped almost 18 percent in September, by far the largest monthly increase on record in that category.  The CPI for natural gas also increased considerably, although much of the sharp run-up in spot prices has not yet been passed through to consumers, probably because of lags in rate adjustments by some state public utility commissions.  Over the twelve months ending in September, the CPI for energy increased 35 percent, a jump far exceeding the approximate 7 percent rise posted over the previous twelve months.

The food component of the CPI increased 0.3 percent in September after no change in the previous month.  This pickup reflects price increases for meats and vegetables, which reversed the previous month's declines.  Compared with twelve months earlier, consumer food prices increased 2.5 percent, down ¾ percentage point relative to the previous year. The hurricanes had little effect on food and agricultural markets.  However, favorable export prospects have lifted prices for wheat over the past few weeks, while unexpectedly strong harvest estimates have eroded the prices of corn and soybeans.  Transportation disruptions associated with the hurricanes were short-lived and do not appear to have had any lasting effect on crop prices, although barge rates remain elevated.

Excluding food and energy, consumer prices have been quiescent.  Prices of transportation services--which are especially energy intensive--have increased noticeably over the past year after having held steady during 2004.  In September, however, the only hint of a pass-through of higher fuel prices to the core CPI was an increase of 1.1 percent in the CPI category for delivery services.  Prices for airfares and other intercity transportation were reported to have declined for a second month despite sharp increases in the prices of jet fuel and diesel.

PCE prices of core consumer goods are estimated to have changed little over the twelve months ending in September and to have declined at an annual rate of about 1 percent from three months earlier.  Some of this recent softness reflects the automakers' discount pricing schemes, which have now expired.  We estimate that PCE prices of core services rose about 2¾ percent between September 2004 and September 2005; the figure is about ½ percentage point less than the year-earlier reading and reflects a noticeable deceleration in shelter prices.  On balance, core PCE prices have increased an estimated 1.9 percent over the twelve months ending in September, little changed from the 2.0 percent increase over the previous year.

Inflation expectations have moved higher, presumably in response to rising energy prices. As measured by the preliminary October release of the Michigan SRC survey, median expectations for inflation over the coming year rose to 4.6 percent--well above the 3 to 3¼ percent readings that had prevailed over the spring and summer.  However, median expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years remained at 3.1 percent in early October, only a little above the average range reported in recent years.  As noted in the financial section of Part II, rate spreads on CPI-indexed Treasury bonds as of October 24 implied inflation compensation near 2.6 percent over both the next five and ten years,

about the same as in mid-September and near the middle of the range observed over the past year.

The PPI for capital equipment increased 0.3 percent in September after having declined 0.1 percent in August.  Over the twelve months ending in September, capital equipment prices rose 2.3 percent, compared with an increase of 1.7 percent during the year-earlier period and little change over the two previous years.  This year's pickup occurred mainly in the prices of heavy trucks and the catchall category of non-high-tech, nontransportation capital equipment.

Although Hurricane Katrina had little apparent effect on the core CPI or the core PPI for finished goods, it appears to have had a substantial effect on prices at earlier stages of processing.  Producer prices for core intermediate materials rose 1.2 percent last month after four months of small declines, with prices of industrial chemicals, fertilizers, and plastics--all energy-intensive intermediate materials--picking up notably.  Also, prices for nearly all types of building materials increased substantially; plywood prices rose 14 percent, and prices of cement, concrete, and asphalt all rose about 1 percent.  Despite the September increase, prices of core intermediate materials moved up just 3½ percent from a year earlier, 4 percentage points less than the increase over the preceding year.

Movements in commodity prices have been mixed since the September Greenbook.  Steel scrap prices have fallen noticeably, while spot prices of copper and building materials have risen sharply.  Since the September Greenbook, the Journal of Commerce metals index has fallen 3.3 percent, while the CRB spot industrials index, which excludes energy, has picked up 1.1 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Interest rates rose appreciably over the intermeeting period, reflecting an easing of investors' concerns about the impact of Hurricane Katrina on economic activity, data releases that were on net a bit stronger than the market had expected, and comments by Federal Reserve officials that were interpreted to suggest that more substantial tightening would be necessary to contain inflation risks.  The increase in nominal interest rates seemed to represent primarily a rise in the market's outlook for real rates, as measures of inflation compensation based on TIPS yields did not change materially, on net.  A few high-profile credit events-including bankruptcy filings in the airline and auto sectors and the revelation of fraud at a major derivatives dealer-garnered considerable attention in the press but apparently left little imprint on market functioning or asset prices more broadly.  Amid higher interest rates and cautious guidance from companies about expected earnings, stock prices fell about 3 percent over the period.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

Short-term interest rates rose slightly following the announcement that the FOMC had raised the intended federal funds rate 25 basis points at the September meeting; market participants had placed some odds on a pause in the tightening cycle.  Policy expectations rose further over the intermeeting period in response to data releases that confirmed that the economy had been on a solid growth track before the hurricanes and to signs that disruptions from Katrina were less severe than had been feared.  The market reaction to the incoming data likely was colored by comments from Federal Reserve officials that were seen as hawkish on inflation, although the fall in oil prices over the period may have tempered inflation fears somewhat.  Judging from federal funds futures, investors currently place a 95 percent probability on a quarter-point tightening at the November FOMC meeting and now expect a federal funds rate of about 4½ percent by next summer-up from a bit over 4 percent just before the September meeting.  Uncertainty about the future path of policy implied by options on Eurodollar futures diminished over the period, but remains above the level of late August.

In line with the increase in near-term policy expectations, nominal Treasury yields rose 30 to 45 basis points over the intermeeting period, with the largest increases at shorter maturities.  A good part of the rise in Treasury yields occurred in the first half of the intermeeting period, with noticeable responses to better-than-expected data on initial claims and from surveys of manufacturing activity.  TIPS yields rose about in line with their nominal counterparts.  As a result, inflation compensation over the next five years and five to ten years ahead was little changed, on net, as investors evidently viewed the

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock market indexes declined 2 to 4 percent over the intermeeting period in response to the rise in long-term interest rates and to some concerns about profits going forward.  Energy stocks posted some of the largest drops because of the fall in oil prices over the period.  Declines were also relatively large for segments of the market that tend to be more sensitive to interest rates, such as small companies, utilities, and REITs.  The ratio of trend earnings to share prices for S&amp;P 500 firms-a measure of expected longrun real equity returns-has remained near 5½ percent, where it has hovered since early 2004.  As a result, the rise in the long-run real Treasury yield indicated a slight narrowing of the long-run real equity premium.

Implied volatilities for the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 rose a bit over the intermeeting period, although these measures of equity market risk remained relatively low.  As broad indexes of corporate yields increased about in line with Treasuries, risk spreads on bonds were little changed.  Bankruptcies in the airline sector and the revelation of accounting fraud at Refco, a large derivatives broker, did not appear to have any lasting effect on bond spreads; however, the bankruptcy filing of a major auto parts firm did lead to some increase in spreads in the auto sector.  Risk spreads on thirty-day commercial paper remained in a fairly low range.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

The third-quarter earnings season has been relatively uneventful to date, with the news about the third quarter, including insurance companies' reported losses from Katrina and Rita, coming in close to expectations.  With about 250 of the S&amp;P 500 firms having reported, earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 are estimated to have come in nearly 15 percent above the year-ago level, an increase boosted almost 7 percentage points by growth at energy firms.  At the same time, forward-looking guidance has been cautious, and expectations for earnings in the year ahead, outside of the energy sector, were revised down a bit through mid-October.

Outside the airline and auto sectors, firms' credit quality-boosted by continued profitability, relatively low leverage, and high liquidity-remained strong.  Ratings changes in the auto and airline sectors pushed up the overall rate of bond downgrades in the third quarter; apart from these troubled sectors, bond downgrades have been modest.

The bond default rate moved up in September and is expected to tick up again in October on the filings of Delta and Northwest Airlines and major auto parts supplier Delphi.  The timing of these filings likely was pulled ahead in order to avoid changes in the bankruptcy code that took effect on October 17.  The expected one-year-ahead default rate based on estimates from KMV Corporation remains low.

Business Finance

Overall, the pace of net debt financing appears to have been moderate over the past couple of months.  C&amp;I lending has continued to be particularly strong, consistent with reports from the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey that standards and terms on these loans were eased somewhat further over the past three months.   In contrast, commercial 1 paper outstanding only edged up over the period, and bond issuance has been modest of late, as higher yields apparently have discouraged new longer-term issues.

Boosted by a substantial seasoned offering from Google, gross public equity issuance ended the third quarter rather strongly but has waned a bit in October with the softening in the equity market.  Registrations of new offers with the SEC have slowed after having surged in the middle of the year, an indication that gross equity issuance will likely remain moderate into the winter.  Equity retirements related to mergers ballooned in the third quarter because of strong merger activity, including several large leveraged buyouts. Moreover, announcements suggest that share repurchases continued to be very robust in the third quarter.  Taken together, gross equity issuance and retirements suggest that outstanding net equity decreased by more than $35 billion per month during the third quarter-a pace that exceeds the rapid contraction of the late 1990s.  However, compared with firms in the late 1990s, firms currently are less leveraged and have larger cash positions, mitigating concerns about a deterioration in credit quality.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial mortgage debt in the third quarter is estimated to be about 13 percent above its level of a year earlier.  Gross issuance of commercial mortgage backed securities (CMBS) was elevated in the third quarter, and the CMBS issuance calendar currently shows that a record volume of deals may close in the fourth quarter.  The surge in supply of late has been associated with a modest increase in CMBS spreads.  In addition, concern about lax underwriting standards has led at least one rating agency to increase the amount of credit support required to achieve a given rating.  Nonetheless, market

indicators do not point to a broad increase in credit risk.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages at banks and on CMBS have continued to trend down, and delinquencies on commercial mortgages at insurance companies remain low.  Data on vacancy rates and rents through the third quarter point to continued improvement in real estate market conditions.

Household Finance

Over the intermeeting period, the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate increased about 30 basis points to 6.1 percent, its highest level since the summer of 2004.  Mortgage debt in the second quarter was 13 percent above its level a year earlier.  Although refinancing activity has tapered off recently in response to higher rates, low rates throughout most of the summer suggest that growth of mortgage debt likely remained strong in the third quarter.  In contrast, consumer credit has continued to expand only moderately:  The August figure was just 4 percent above its level of a year earlier.  Growth in overall household debt outpaced that of disposable income in the second quarter, and the financial obligations ratio ticked up again but remains below its peak reached earlier this decade.

Personal bankruptcy filings have surged to unprecedented levels.  Filings are estimated to have exceeded 500,000 in the week before the implementation of the much-publicized bankruptcy reforms on October 17.  This figure included a large number of filings that had been made over the weekend just before the new law went into effect but may not have been processed by the courts until the following week.  Estimates of the number of filings after October 17 point to a sharp drop, an indication that most of the recent surge of filings was likely pulled forward from future months.   Most delinquency rates for 2 consumer loans have remained low in recent months and do not point to a deterioration in household credit quality.

By itself, the net gain in stock prices over the third quarter would suggest a slight increase in household net worth.  Despite the rise in stock prices last quarter, net purchases of equity mutual funds were moderate in August and September; domestic equity funds had net outflows while bond funds had relatively strong net inflows.

Treasury and Agency Financing

The federal budget's surplus in September reflected particularly strong corporate tax receipts.  During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned two- and five-year nominal coupon securities and five- and ten-year TIPS, and on balance the auctions were well subscribed.  Indirect bidder participation-an indicator of demand by foreign official institutions-was above its recent average.

Fannie Mae's stock price fell 3 percent during the period as more evidence of accounting inadequacies was revealed.  Freddie Mac's share price, supported by news of a proposed share buyback, ended the period up 1 percent.  Agency debt spreads over comparablematurity Treasuries are roughly unchanged since the last FOMC meeting.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of municipal securities, supported by strong issuance of both new capital and refunding bonds, remained elevated in the third quarter.  However, refunding issues have slowed significantly in October as interest rates have moved higher.  The credit quality of municipal bonds has remained stable, as rating upgrades have just outpaced downgrades so far this year.  To date, no municipal bond rating downgrades have been specifically related to the hurricanes in September, although some bonds from the affected region are still on Moody's watchlist.  The ratio of yields on high-grade general obligation municipal bonds to those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, an additional measure of credit quality, was also little changed over the intermeeting period.

Money and Bank Credit

In September and October, growth of M2 averaged 6½ percent at an annual rate somewhat above the pace registered earlier this year.  The staff estimates that the effects of Hurricane Katrina contributed about 1 percentage point to the growth of M2 in September; in particular, currency expanded, the Federal Emergency Management Agency delivered relief payments to individuals, and insurance companies advanced funds to hurricane victims against likely future settlements.  For September and October, overall M2 growth was boosted by a turnaround in the volatile retail money market fund component and an uptick in growth of liquid deposits.

After having surged in August, growth of bank credit dropped in September to an annual rate of 5 percent.  A marked decline in banks' lending to households accounted for the bulk of last month's slowdown.  Growth of residential mortgage loans on banks' books slowed sharply, in part as a large volume of mortgages was securitized.  In addition,

home equity loans contracted in September, likely reflecting the continued rise in the floating rates on such loans.  Growth of banks' consumer loans fell back from the outsized pace in August to the range seen earlier this year.  By comparison, commercial real estate and C&amp;I loans expanded notably last month.

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $59 billion in August from $58 billion in July (revised).  The increase in the deficit reflected a surge in imports that was partially offset by a sizeable gain in exports.

Net Trade in Goods and Services

(Billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

In August, the value of exports of goods and services increased 1.7 percent from a strong July level.  The increase was largely driven by higher merchandise exports, although exports of services also advanced a bit.  Most major categories of merchandise posted gains in August, with capital goods, automotive products, and industrial supplies showing particular strength.  Within capital goods, exports of aircraft recorded the largest absolute gain, but semiconductors, computers, and telecommunication products also rose.  In contrast, exports of agricultural products fell.  The average value of exports in July and August increased 5¾ percent (a.r.) from the second quarter.  Exports of capital goods (particularly aircraft) and automotive products exhibited particularly robust growth.

The value of imported goods and services rose 1.8 percent in August, reflecting gains in non-oil goods and, more markedly, oil; imports of services were little changed.  Within non-oil goods, imports of automotive products surged.  Imports of capital goods also rose, as an increase in imports of machinery offset a decline in aircraft.  Imports of industrial supplies and consumer goods retreated a bit.  The drop in consumer goods reflected declines in imports of apparel and textile products.  The average value of imports in July and August increased 5¾ percent (a.r.) from the second quarter, more

than accounted for by a surge in oil imports as non-oil imports dropped sharply in July. Automotive products also grew robustly, but imports of consumer goods and industrial supplies fell.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In September, BLS prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and core goods both increased 1.2 percent, led by a strong increase in the price of imported natural gas.  Core goods prices excluding natural gas rose 0.6 percent, largely reflecting higher prices for material intensive goods, with chemicals and building supplies exhibiting particularly large increases.  Finished goods prices recorded much more modest gains; prices of imported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and consumer goods both increased 0.3 percent in September after declining slightly in the previous two months.  Prices of imported semiconductors fell 0.8 percent in September, whereas prices of imported computers declined 0.3 percent.

In the third quarter, BLS non-oil import prices climbed 0.3 percent at an annual rate, whereas the prices of imported core goods increased 1.1 percent, a difference attributable to a 9.7 percent decrease in imported computer prices and a 5.6 percent decrease in imported semiconductor prices.  The rise in core goods prices primarily reflected a 6.4 percent increase in prices of non-oil industrial supplies that was concentrated in September.  Prices of most other categories of imports fell in the third quarter, with imported food prices declining 3.3 percent and the prices of consumer goods edging down 0.8 percent.

Oil .  The BLS price index of imported oil rose 7.3 percent in September, reflecting a modest rise in the price of imported crude oil and much larger increases in the prices of refined petroleum products.  The average spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose 1 percent in September to average about $65.50 per barrel.  The spot price of WTI reached nearly $70 per barrel at the beginning of the month in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, but then edged down following the release of strategic stocks by the International Energy Agency and diminished demand by refiners.  The spot price rebounded somewhat due to Hurricane Rita later in September, but has since eased to an average of $62.76 per barrel so far this month.  Nonetheless, prices remain elevated due to diminished oil production in the Gulf of Mexico and perceptions of a tight market going forward.  The spot price of WTI closed at $63.05 per barrel on October 25.

Exports. In September, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods increased 0.9 percent, and the prices of core exports increased 1.1 percent.  The increase in export prices was largely due to a 3.6 percent increase in prices for exports of non-agricultural industrial supplies, particularly for petroleum products and chemicals, which more than offset a 1.4 percent drop in the price of agricultural products.  Other categories of export prices changed only modestly.  In September, prices of exported semiconductors fell 0.3 percent, whereas prices of computers increased 0.1 percent.

In the third quarter, total goods export prices increased 1.1 percent at an annual rate, whereas core export prices rose 2.5 percent, with the price increase concentrated in September.  Within core goods, prices of non-agricultural industrial supplies showed the most pronounced increase in the third quarter, rising 6.7 percent.  Agricultural prices increased 2.1 percent.  Other categories in core goods saw only modest price changes.  In the third quarter, semiconductor export prices fell 12.9 percent, and computer export prices fell 5.3 percent.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Net foreign private purchases of U.S. securities continued strong in August (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) at $58 billion, led by unusually high net acquisitions of corporate debt securities (line 4c).  There were also substantial acquisitions of Treasuries (line 4a), while net foreign purchases of both equities (line 4d) and agency debt securities (line 4b) lagged.  For the first eight months of the year, net foreign private acquisitions of U.S. securities are well above last year's pace.

Foreign official inflows (line 1) continued at a high level in August but remained well below the record pace of 2004.  For both the month and the year to date, China has accounted for the bulk of official inflows.  Japanese official holdings have decreased slightly during the year through August and we have seen almost no inflows attributable to the major oil exporting countries.  Partial and confidential data on custody holdings at FRBNY indicate very modest foreign acquisitions during September and moderate inflows thus far in October.

It should be noted that both the monthly transactions data and the annual holdings surveys may record some foreign official inflows as private if investments are made via foreign private intermediaries.  Thus, the private inflows reported above are likely overstated and the official inflows correspondingly understated.  This could help to

account for the very modest increase in official holdings attributed to the oil exporting countries.

U.S. residents reduced their holdings of foreign securities (line 5) slightly in August, with strong net purchase of foreign equities (line 5b) offset by even larger net sales of foreign bonds (line 5a).  U.S. residents showed a particular appetite for Japanese equities in August, increasing their holdings by $7 billion during the month.

The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a modest outflow in August that roughly offset a similar inflow in July.

Foreign Financial Markets

The major currencies index of the dollar rose about 1 ⅓ percent on net over the intermeeting period.  This rise occurred as dollar-denominated interest rates rose more than those of currencies of the other major industrial economies.  Late in the period, the dollar retraced some of its earlier gains as Treasury yields fell while European yields rose following confidence survey data that was significantly stronger than expected in Germany but was weaker-than-expected in the United States.  On net, long-term yields rose globally, as market participants focused on comments from policy makers in several major economies that were interpreted as indicating that upside risks to inflation might necessitate some firming of monetary policy.  Energy prices spiked up early on in the intermeeting period on the landfall of Hurricane Rita, but declined later as concerns over the long-term damage caused by the hurricane moderated and market reports indicated that U.S. demand for petroleum products was softening.  Even so, energy prices remained near historically elevated levels.  Major equity indexes generally declined across the globe, driven in part by the rise in global bond yields. The exception was Japan, as market participants continued to discuss signs of progress in Japanese economic recovery and in financial sector reform.

<!-- missing-text -->

The dollar appreciated 3¾ percent on balance against the Japanese yen, about 1½ percent against sterling, but less than 1 percent against the euro and the Canadian dollar.  The dollar appreciated in reaction to a widening of interest rate differentials against the yenand sterling-denominated assets in favor of the dollar.  Federal Reserve officials' commentary highlighting inflation concerns was generally interpreted as indicating that a greater-than-previously-anticipated degree of monetary tightening was forthcoming.  The underperformance of the yen against the dollar also appeared to owe to Japanese private-sector outflows that did not appear to be driven by economic fundamentals.

NOTE.  Change is from September 19/20 to October 26 (10 a.m. EDT).

Only short-term Canadian dollar interest rates nearly kept pace with the rise in short-term dollar denominated rates, rising over 20 basis points during the intermeeting period.  The Bank of Canada further tightened its monetary policy stance, raising its policy rate another 25 basis points, to 3.0 percent, on October 18.  Three-month euro interest rates rose only slightly on net, despite statements by European Central Bank President Trichet and other officials that highlighted inflation concerns. Yields implied by sterling interest rate futures currently show that market participants have reduced the odds of an additional 25-basis-point cut by the Bank of England through next year.

While short-term interest rates rose more moderately in non-dollar currencies, global benchmark long-term yields rose around 30 basis points in the euro area as well as in Canada, and close to 20 basis points in Japan, as market participants focused on global official commentary highlighting inflation risks.  Yields on inflation-indexed notes rose nearly as much as nominal yields, leaving inflation compensation measures only slightly higher on the period.

The rise in long-term yields contributed to some downward pressure in global equity markets. Headline indexes in the United Kingdom dropped more than in U.S. equity markets, falling nearly 4 percent, while the euro-area headline index declined about

2½ percent.  In contrast, Japanese equities continued to breach multi-year highs, as market participants discussed the likelihood that economic recovery was firming.  The Topix banking sub-index gained over 10 percent, as the passage of the postal reform bill appeared to support sentiment over the outlook for further financial sector reform.

In several emerging markets, equity market indexes declined, particularly late in the period, as the rise in U.S. interest rates reportedly reduced investor demand for riskier assets.  Emerging market sovereign external debt spreads over Treasuries were little changed on balance.  Although the Brazilian real gained nearly 2 percent against the dollar over the period, and the Mexican peso depreciated modestly against the dollar, late in the period these currencies came under some pressure as market participants noted that expectations of additional monetary easing by the Mexican and Brazilian central banks, had begun to weigh on the exchange value of these currencies.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Rising energy prices led consumer prices to run up in the twelve months to September in all major industrial economies, except Japan, where mild deflation persisted.  In the euro area, headline inflation jumped to 2.6 percent, but core inflation remained moderate. Consumer price inflation in the United Kingdom rose to 2.5 percent, also pushed up by rising gasoline prices.  Headline inflation in Canada surged to 3.4 percent, above the ceiling of the Bank of Canada's 1-3 percent target range.

Economic performance in the third quarter appears to have varied substantially among the foreign industrial economies.  In the United Kingdom, GDP growth declined to 1.5 percent from 2 percent in the second quarter.  In Japan, indicators of private investment and consumption were fairly flat, pointing to a slowdown in the pace of economic growth.  In contrast, in the euro area, recent figures for industrial production and retail sales indicate that the economy has improved from its disappointing secondquarter performance.  In Canada, data on external activity and housing starts point to continued robust GDP growth in the third quarter.

Monthly indicators suggest that economic activity in Japan rebounded in August from a weak July, but third-quarter growth nevertheless appears to have stepped down from its rapid pace in the first half of the year.  In August, real household spending rose 3.2 percent and retail sales rose 1.5 percent, but averages of both over July and August are below their second-quarter levels.  Industrial production rose 1.1 percent in August, bouncing back to the average level recorded in the second quarter.  The external sector continued to contribute positively.  In July and August, on average, real merchandise exports were 2.5 percent higher, while real imports were up 1.8 percent.

The Bank of Japan's (BOJ) Tankan business conditions index for all firms rose one point in September from its level in June.  Capital spending projections for 2005 were revised upward slightly in the Tankan survey.  Sales and profits forecasts were also revised upward, with large manufacturers now expecting domestic sales to exceed exports, underscoring the resurgence in domestic demand that has taken place this year.

Tokyo core consumer prices, which exclude fresh food but include energy, fell 0.4 percent in September from a year ago.  In August, nominal wages were up 0.4 percent on an annual basis, as the unemployment rate edged back down to 4.3 percent after a temporary uptick in July, and the job-offers-to-applicants ratio remained at a thirteen-year

high.  BOJ officials continue to state that they expect twelve-month consumer price inflation to turn positive by the end of 2005.  Monetary policy was unchanged, but longterm interest rates rose in the wake of comments by several BOJ officials that were interpreted as indicating that the Bank's policy of quantitative easing might end in the first half of 2006.

Parliament approved Prime Minister Koizumi's bills to privatize the postal savings system following the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) victory in the September elections.  According to the bills, in October 2007 Japan Post will be split into four stock companies which, under a holding company, will take over mail delivery, postal savings, life insurance, and the network of post offices.  The holding company must then dispose of its entire stake in the savings and life insurance companies by March 2017.  The plan will create the largest private bank in the world; Japan Post currently has $1.8 trillion equivalent in deposits.

In the euro area , recent data suggest that the pace of economic activity accelerated in the third quarter from its second-quarter lull.  In August, industrial output in the euro area

rose for the third consecutive month, and the pickup appears increasingly broad-based. Industrial orders remained strong in the euro area, especially in Germany where orders in July and August on average were up more than 1 percent from the second-quarter level. Household demand appears to have firmed.  Retail sales in the euro area rebounded strongly in August after dropping in July, and French consumption of manufactured goods in the third quarter was up almost 2½ percent from the second-quarter average.

Business confidence improved in the third quarter.  The European Commission measure of industrial confidence in the euro area increased in September, recording the highest reading since February.  In September, the euro-area PMI for manufacturing rose well above the 50 threshold indicating expansion, reaching its highest level in seven months; the PMI for services moved up as well.  In October, the IFO measure of business climate in Germany jumped to 98.7, a five-year peak.  Consumer confidence, in contrast, has shown no sign of improvement in the third quarter.  Even in France, the overall household confidence indicator continued to slip in September.

Increasing energy prices have contributed to the ongoing deterioration of the trade balance.  In August, the euro-area trade account showed a deficit of $0.9 billion in August, the first monthly deficit since 2000.

Labor market conditions in the euro area have remained weak.  The unemployment rate edged up to 8.6 percent in August and has fallen only 0.2 percentage point since the beginning of the year.  In addition, unit labor costs have accelerated a bit, as labor productivity growth has fallen.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation jumped to 2.6 percent in September from to 2.2 percent in August.  Higher energy prices contributed 1.2 percentage points to the headline figure.  In contrast, core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, remained moderate, edging up to 1.5 percent as administered prices for alcohol and tobacco were set higher . In October, according to the preliminary estimate, German consumer prices rose 0.4 percent from the previous month and the twelve-month rate of inflation remained at 2.7 percent.

GDP for the United Kingdom rose 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Total output from production industries fell 2.4 percent as a 24.2 percent drop in the mining and quarrying sectors more than offset a 1.6 percent increase in manufacturing output.  Services rose 2.4 percent, maintaining similar pace to that of the previous two quarters, and construction grew 2.0 percent.

Business confidence rebounded from negative territory in the third quarter.  The PMI for manufacturing squeaked above the 50 mark in August and increased a bit further in September.  The PMI for services remained essentially unchanged near its 2005 average of 55.  The PMI for construction activity rose to its highest mark of the year surpassing 57 in both August and September.

Month-to-month changes in house prices continue to be just slightly positive.  According to the Nationwide Building Society index, the twelve-month change of house prices was 1.8 percent in September, down from 2.4 percent in August.  The Halifax index of house prices showed a twelve-month increase of 3.7 percent in September, also down from 4.1 percent in the previous month.  Household net borrowing for house purchases remained stable in August.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation rose to 2.5 percent in September, well above the Bank of England's 2 percent target.  For the third consecutive month, the largest upward impact on the CPI came from transport prices, pushed up by rising gasoline prices.  Gasoline prices increased 4.3 percent in September from the previous month.

In Canada , indicators for the third quarter suggest that economic activity remained strong, although retail sales slipped in August after two months of robust advances.  The composite index of leading indicators posted another solid improvement in September, with household spending continuing to dominate.  Housing starts moved up strongly again in September after an August lull.  The nominal merchandise trade balance expanded in August for the fifth time in the past six months; much of the August increase was due to rising energy prices.  The value of manufacturing shipments, new orders, and unfilled orders all advanced strongly in August.  Leading the expansion in shipments were the petroleum and auto industries.

In September, overall employment declined slightly, the first dip since January. However, gains in full-time employment continued to be impressive, and growth in fulltime positions has accounted for virtually the entire expansion in employment thus far this year.  The unemployment rate stood at 6.7 percent in September, matching a 30-year low.

In September, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation moved up to 3.4 percent , due almost entirely to upward pressure from gasoline prices.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding the eight most volatile components, remained at 1.8 percent. With inflation edging higher and the economy operating at full capacity, the Bank of Canada increased its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points for the second consecutive time, bringing the rate to 3 percent at its October meeting.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Indicators have varied across the developing economies, but on balance, point to a moderate pickup in economic activity in the third quarter.  In Asia, acceleration in Chinese and Korean third-quarter GDP is tempered by a slowdown in some of the other Asian economies, particularly Singapore.  In Latin America, recent data suggest that the Mexican economy has not fully recovered from its weak second quarter, while performance appears to have moderated from the strong second-quarter growth rates in Argentina and Brazil.  Inflation rates in most of the emerging economies, with the notable exceptions of China and Mexico, have risen recently.  In many cases, these increases reflect a greater pass-through of higher crude oil prices to consumer prices following reductions in domestic fuel price controls.  The higher inflation has prompted several central banks in Asia to raise interest rates.

Chinese real GDP rose 8.2 percent in the third quarter, in line with staff expectations. The growth appears to have been broad-based.  Investment accelerated in the quarter, retail sales growth remained in double-digit territory, and exports continued to grow rapidly.  Industrial production accelerated in the last few months and was up more than 3 percent in the third quarter.  While Chinese exports grew rapidly in the third quarter, the rate of growth slowed slightly, and import growth picked up a bit.  The trade surplus for the third quarter was roughly the same size as in the second quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation slowed in recent months, as food prices held down overall inflation and state-controlled fuel prices were raised only minimally.

In Taiwan , industrial production rebounded sharply in August and September, more than offsetting the July decline, and new orders for electronics and other goods were also up. The unemployment rate inched down in recent months.  Exports surged to a new high in September, contributing to a sizeable monthly trade surplus.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell back some in September owing, in part, to a small decline in core prices.

Korean real GDP accelerated 7.5 percent in the third quarter, on the back of strong domestic demand, particularly private consumption, and a robust pickup in exports. The most recent data suggest sustained high levels of consumer and business confidence in September.  Exports of high-tech goods to the United States are down from recent peaks but sales to China are rising, and August high-tech industrial production posted strong gains.  Consumer prices jumped in September reflecting surging food, fuel, and transportation prices.  Citing concerns over higher inflation due to persistently high oil prices, Bank of Korea raised its target interest rate 25 basis points to 3.5 percent on October 11, ending an easing phase that had lasted more than three years.

Incoming data from the ASEAN countries suggest that economic growth generally moderated in the third quarter.  In Singapore, the advance estimate of third-quarter real GDP (unofficial) indicates a 3.2 percent expansion, down from 18 percent in the second quarter.  A strong electronics PMI reading for the third quarter suggests expansion in activity going forward.  Elsewhere in the region, the average industrial production for recent months inched down in Malaysia, but was up in the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand from the second-quarter level.  Recent trade data show the ASEAN economies continuing, on average, to run trade surpluses.  However, the August trade balance deteriorated in Thailand owing to high imports of capital goods, and in the Philippines due mainly to a high import bill for fuel products.

Consumer price inflation continued to be elevated in the region, reflecting higher imported energy prices, and in some countries, a reduction in fuel subsidies and higher food prices.  The exception is Singapore, where reductions in vehicle prices and accommodation costs earlier in the year contributed to containing inflation.  Citing concerns over higher inflation, central banks raised interest rates 100 basis points in Indonesia in early October, 50 basis points in Thailand on October 19, and 25 basis points on October 20 in the Philippines following a similar rate increase in late September.

The Indian economy surged in the second quarter and more recent data also point to robust conditions.  Output rose 11.6 percent in the second quarter, with gains widespread across manufacturing and services.  Industrial production recovered somewhat in August from a weather-related dip in July, and recent confidence and sales indicators are positive.  Oil imports continue to widen India's trade deficit.  In addition, wholesale prices have accelerated recently, reflecting higher oil prices and a reduction of some fuel subsidies in early September.  Citing concerns over higher inflation, the Bank of India raised its short-term benchmark interest rate 25 basis points to 5.25 percent on October 25.

In Mexico , recent data releases suggest that the economy has not fully recovered from the weak second-quarter performance.  Although overall economic activity improved in July and August, industrial production and manufacturing output have been weak on average in recent months.  Industrial activity was little changed in July from the previous month reflecting, in part, anemic performance in the auto industry, due to declining car and truck demand in the United States and some retooling in Mexican plants.  The improvement in industrial production for August, and reports from the auto industry in Mexico point to some recovery in activity.

Mexico's twelve-month headline and core inflation continued to decline in recent months as a result of the aggressive monetary policy tightening by the Bank of Mexico (BOM) from early 2004 to March 2005.  In September, twelve-month headline inflation fell to 3.5 percent, well within the 2-4 percent target range, and core inflation (not shown) fell to 3.2 percent.  Price regulations have prevented high international oil prices from passing through to domestic inflation.  The improved inflation prospects and a slowing economy led the BOM to begin easing policy in late August.  As a result, the rate on 28-day peso-denominated bills (Cetes), a widely used measure of the monetary policy stance, has fallen from 9.6 percent in early August to 8.9 percent in mid-October.

Data from Brazil since the last Greenbook have been mixed.  Although industrial production rose about 1 percent in August, the increase was concentrated in a few industries, including refining (petroleum and ethanol), and average production for July and August was down from the second-quarter level.  Retail sales for August were also weak.  The export sector has remained the bright spot, with Brazil on track to post a record trade surplus this year, due primarily to higher prices of exported commodities.  A hike in vehicle fuel prices in mid-September led to a rise in monthly inflation, but inflation remained at 6 percent on a twelve-month basis.  Survey-based measures of inflation expectations have continued to decline with twelve-month ahead expected inflation falling to 4.7 percent in mid-October.

Indications of weakening economic activity and subdued inflation prompted the central bank to reduce its policy rate 25 basis points in mid-September and again by 50 basis points in mid-October to 19 percent.  The scandals that have dominated the political agenda have continued, and in mid-October led to the resignations of two more members of Congress.  Although the scandals have further delayed progress on tax and other economic reforms, fiscal and monetary discipline has remained tight.  Citing the commitment to fiscal responsibility, changes in the government's debt structure, and a more competitive export sector, Moody's upgraded Brazilian foreign currencydenominated debt by one notch, from B1 to Ba3 on October 12.

In Argentina , real GDP jumped up at an annual rate of 10 percent in the second quarter after a weak first quarter, on the back of strong growth in consumption and investment. In the third quarter, average industrial production for July and August was up from the second-quarter level.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation has moved up this year, reaching over 10 percent in September, well above the central bank's informal target range of 5-8 percent for the end of 2005.  The central bank has continued to intervene to stem upward pressures on the peso.

In mid-September, the Argentine Congress passed the 2006 budget, which projects the consolidated primary fiscal surplus next year to be 4 percent of GDP, half a percentage point less than demanded in recent IMF statements.  Unlike in previous auctions this year, in its latest auction, the Argentine government was unable to place bonds at an interest rate it was willing to accept.  As a result, the government began to search for alternative sources of funding.

In Venezuela , monetary and fiscal policies have continued to be expansionary, supported by high oil prices.  Despite a fixed exchange rate and price controls on many products, twelve-month inflation rose to 16 percent in September.

Around early-October, President Chavez attracted attention when he asserted that the central bank had sold up to $20 billion in U.S. Treasury securities to buy foreign currency-denominated assets and transferred the funds from the United States to the BIS. That assertion was promptly contradicted by an official from the central bank, who later

modified his statement.  The central bank has not issued a statement to clarify the situation.  Treasury data indicate that Venezuelan public and private sector holdings in the United States amounted to about $25 billion at the beginning of this year, of which $7 billion was held in the form of U.S. Treasuries.  Total holdings had not changed through August.  Although $5 billion in short-term U.S. Treasuries were sold over the first half of this year, holdings of other short-term U.S. assets rose by a commensurate amount.
