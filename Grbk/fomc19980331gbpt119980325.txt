Although  we think  t ikely  hat eal DP  has  decelerated mewhat this  uarter, e i l t r G so q th evidence  on  that core s carcely  ompelling.

In  particular,  e ontinued  onfidence f  households th c c o and  businesses  n  the rospects  or ustained  rosperity s  been  reflected   big i p f s p ha in increases  n  consumer spending,  esidential  nstruction,  d  equipment  investment. i r co an Under the  circumstances, ployers  seem to e  hiring  ust  bout  every  qualified--or em b j a at least  rainable--worker y  can  grab  in  a  tight  abor arket,  and increases  n ayrolls t the l m i p and hours  worked have outstripped  l redictions. rtunately, though he  pressures al p Fo al t on labor upplies  ave  produced  an acceleration    wages over  the ast ear, rice s h in p y p inflation  s  remained  low--indeed,  as  been  virtually  l verall  n  the ast  couple ha ith ni o i p of  months as  a  result  f lummeting  crude  oil osts. o p c

Favorable inancial rket  conditions  ave  encouraged  the  growth  in  aggregate f ma h demand.  Although  bond yields  ave  risen    touch n  recent  eeks,  they ave h a i w h remained  low enough  to  encourage  private  nd  public orrowers o  seek  funding or a b t f new outlays nd to  refinance  ld  debts.

These  financial nditions  hould rovide ngoing  support or  domestic co s p o f demand in  the  near erm, ut  we nonetheless  ontinue o  expect  a  more significant t b c t deceleration   activity.   believe  hat,  onsistent th  many  anecdotal  eports, e of We t c wi r th effects  f  the sian  economic  slump and  a  high ollar  xchange  rate  n  the .S.  trade o A d e o U position  ave  yet o  play  out ully. n  addition, e ace  of  inventory  ccumulation h t f I th p a appears  to  have  remained  much higher han  would be  expected n  the teady  state. t i s Importantly, er  time, quity nvestors  re  likely  o  discover  hat  heir  xpectations ov e i a t t t e for  profit  rowth  have  been  unrealistic,    we have  built    modest  decline  n  share g and a i prices nto he  forecast--albeit  m  a  considerably  igher evel han efore.  All  told, i t fro h l t b we are  looking or  a  slowing f  real DP f o G growth  to  an  average  rate f  around o 2 percent  er  annum  over  the  next ew quarters, th  only  a  little  ckup  in  1999. p f wi pi That  path  for utput mplies hat  esource  tilization es  hould  ease  to  some degree. o i t r u rat s However, with  the abor arket  remaining elatively  ght--and l rices,  he  dollar, l m r ti oi p t and other  "special  actors"  ess avorable  oing  forward  than hey  have  been  recently-f l f g t we anticipate  at here ill e  an  upcreep n  the nderlying  rend f  inflation. th t w b i u t o

Key Background  Factors

We  have  maintained ur  assumption f  a steady ederal  unds  rate n  this  rojection. o o f f i p Regarding  longer-term  nterest tes,  e are  not  anticipating  y major  departures i ra w an from  the ange  of  recent  onths, ut  we continue  o  think hat  he redicted  oftening r m b t t t p s of  economic indicators   the  next  few  months may provide he  basis or t  least in t f a a brief  enetration   the  recent  ows  for reasury ond yields. he sizable  un-off  f p of l T b T r o Treasuries  n  the econd  quarter  hould  also e  constructive  r he arket,  although i s s b fo t m we expect  that  hese upply ffects  ill e  modest  for ixed-income ecurities  ices  s t s e w b f s pr a a  whole.

On the  equities de, entiment  ill e  tested  nce  again y the  upcoming i s w b o b round  of  quarterly rporate  eports, ich  we expect  will how a  considerable co r wh s deterioration    earnings  omentum. f m However, with  all  he  warnings  that  ave t h already een  issued y companies, specially   the  "high-tech" ctor,  he eports  ay b b e in se t r m not  supply  enough  negative urprises  rigger    major  market  reversal.  e  are s tot a W projecting  path  for orporate  rofits er  coming quarters at uggests a c p ov th s a considerable  hortfall  om  what analysts  re alking  bout  currently.  ut  we are  not s fr a t a B sure  that uch  an  outcome  will lone  be  sufficient    prompt  investors,  w convinced s a to no that   buy-and-hold  quity trategy  ill lmost  guarantee eturns  ell  into ouble a e s w a r w d digits,   turn o  what they  perceive  o  be  low-yielding  ixed-income  nstruments. to t t f i Consequently,  e have  built  nto ur  forecast  nly  a  modest  slippage  n  the arket, w i o o i m one  that ill eave hare  prices  hrough ext  year  well  above  those nticipated   the w l s t n a in last  reenbook and price-earnings  ltiples  t  historically h  levels. G mu a hig

Fiscal  olicy s xpected  to  remain  about  neutral  n  terms f  the mpetus o p i e i o i t aggregate emand over  the  next  two  years.  Although  the rospect f  budget  surpluses d p o has  sparked uch talk  f tax  cuts r  increases  n  spending,  e expect hat he m o o i w t t Congress  will nclude  ffsets  o  the  deficit fects  f  any  such  measures  it nacts.  In i o t ef o e this  reenbook,  we have  incorporated  upplemental  ppropriations  r  fiscal  ear  1998 G s a fo y to  fund  ongoing  military  perations  n  Bosnia  and  the ersian ulf  as  well s  an o i P G a increase  n  grants n  fiscal  999 to  state  nd local  overnments o  finance  ighway i i 1 a g t h construction d  mass  transit. e stronger  utlook or  economic  growth  and some an Th o f technical  eassessments  ave  caused  us  also o  boost ur  forecast  f  receipts,  d  we r h t o o an are  now projecting  udget  surpluses  f  $9 billion   fiscal  998 and  $5 billion   fiscal b o in 1 in 1999.

Regarding  compensation rends,  ecent necdotal  eports  ertainly dicate  hat t r a r c in t many  employers  are  offering  ore sizable  ay increases  n  order o  attract d retain m p i t an needed  workers.

The total  ebt  of  domestic onfinancial ctors  f  the conomy  is xpected o  grow d n se o e e t about  5-1/2 ercent his ear  and  4-3/4 ercent  n  1999. These  increases  xceed  the p t y p i e projected  ise  n  nominal  GDP r i in  each  year,  utting  he  debt-to-GDP  ratio  n an p t o upward path  after  lmost  a  decade  of  little  t hange. The uptrend ould  be sharper a ne c w still  ot  for he  modest  paydown of  federal  ebt,  hich reflects  e  small udget ifn t d w th b surpluses  hat e project  hrough  1999. Among t w t the  other ectors,  onfinancial s n businesses  re  expected o  be  recording  he  most  rapid ebt  growth, ut  we anticipate a t t d b that  he  debt f  households nd  state  nd  local overnments  will lso ncrease  ather t o a a g a i r briskly.

Nonfinancial  orporate  ebt  is  estimated  o  have  increased  t  an annual  rate f c d t a o 12 percent n  the  current  uarter, e  biggest  ulge  since 986.  In  part,  he ecent i q th b 1 t r borrowing  likely  as  been  fueled y  bond issues hat  ere  deferred  ast  all  ecause  of h b t w l f b turbulent  arket  conditions.  owever,  the  heavy demand for  credit, om  both  banks m H fr and  the  markets, lso eflects nger-term  nfluences.  n  particular, ger  activity a r lo i I mer shows no sign  of  abating,  nd we anticipate at  orrowing  will emain  brisk o a th b r t finance he  equity etired rough hese eals.  Also,  given  our  forecast  f  a  sharp t r th t d o deceleration   corporate  arnings,  irms ill eed  more outside  unding  to  bridge he in e f w n f t widening  gap  between  capital  utlays nd  internal nds.  Based on these o a fu considerations,   expect onfinancial siness ebt  to  expand 8-1/4 ercent ver we n bu d p o 1998 as  a  whole and  6-1/2 ercent ext ear. p n y

Corporate redit  uality  as given ints f  weakening a  bit n  recent  onths, c q h h o i m and  we anticipate at  his  rend ill ontinue s  firms ace omewhat heavier ebt th t t w c a f s d burdens.  In  this  nvironment,  enders  ay  selectively  ghten  heir  tandards, d e l m ti t s an borrowing  costs or ower-rated  irms  probably ill ove up.

Total ousehold  debt  is xpected o  rise   percent his  ear, atching  the h e t 7 t y m increase  ast  ear,  nd  then  to  advance  6-1/4 ercent  n 1999. Mortgage  debt as l y a p i h grown briskly  f  late, flecting  e  robust ace  of  home sales nd  what  appears  to  be o re th p a a  fair  mount of  "cash-out"  efinancing.  he growth  of  this ebt hould  edge lower a r T d s

This  pace  is ore i o t t m than  double  the rowth  expected or  consumer  credit, ich will e held  down, in g f wh b part,  y the ngoing  shift  o  mortgage  borrowing  and, n  1999,  by the  slower ise  n b o t i r i purchases f  consumer  durables. o

Although  household  debt  is rojected  o  grow more rapidly  han  disposable p t t income,  the  debt-service rden, hile  already levated,   not  expected o  move bu w e is t higher ver  the  forecast  eriod. ouseholds  will ealize  nterest vings rom o p H r i sa f mortgage  refinancing d will enefit  rom the  shift  oward  mortgage  debt, hich an b f t w stretches  ut  the  period or ebt  repayment  and  carries  ower  rates  han  consumer o f d l t credit. lthough  lenders  ay become still re cautious  n  taking n  exposure  to  the A m mo i o riskiest  rrowers,  e do not  foresee  he  kind  of  adverse hock  that  ould prompt  a bo w t s w wholesale ightening  f redit  onditions. t o c c

Recent Developments

Imports  in  the ountries  hat  ave  been  the ocus  of  the  Asian  financial ises  ave c t h f cr h fallen  ppreciably, using   significant  provement  in  external  alances. conomic a ca a im b E growth  has  also  slowed  sharply n  those ountries.  ut  policy eforms  are  moving i c B r ahead  in  most  of  the  affected  conomies, nd  financial rkets  in  Asian  and other e a ma emerging  market  economies  have  stabilized  mewhat since he  last  OMC so t F meeting. Japanese  economic  activity mains  weak,  with  confidence urther  ndermined  by  the re f u financial rmoil n  the  region nd falling ports o  Asia. Economic activity tu i a ex t in continental  urope  appears  to  have  picked p following    weak fourth uarter. E u a q

The dollar  as  appreciated  -3/4 ercent gainst  he en  since he  last  OMC h 2 p a t y t F meeting, eflecting  akening  growth  and  continued ncertainty out  fiscal  olicy n r we u ab p i Japan. The legislative  proval f  the  FY  1998-99  budget  is  almost omplete,  ut  the ap o c b terms  of  the uch-anticipated pplemental timulus  ackage  have  yet  to  be set. m su s p Interest tes re  down  15 to  30  basis oints  n  Japan. ra a p i

The dollar  as  risen  odestly  against  he  mark and other ontinental  ropean h m t c Eu currencies  ver  the  intermeeting riod.  Declining nflation    foreign  ndustrial o pe i in i countries, e  in  part o  lower  oil rices,  nd  anticipated illovers om  the  Asian du t p a sp fr financial ises  ave  contributed   declines  n  foreign  ong-term  nterest  tes. n cr h to i l i ra O average,  ong-term nterest tes  n  foreign  ndustrial  untries  re  down 25 basis l i ra i i co a points ver  the ntermeeting  eriod hile  comparable  U.S.  rates  re  little  anged. o i p w a ch The dollar  s own  2 percent gainst  terling  prospects  f  a further  ncrease  n  U.K. i d a s on o i i official terest  tes. n  spite  f  an expected lowdown in  growth, he  Bank of in ra I o s t England  concluded  in  its  ebruary nflation port  that   further  odest  rise n F I Re a m i interest tes  his ear  "is ore likely  han  not."  The Canadian  dollar  as  moved up ra t y m t h against  he  U.S.  dollar  ince he  increase  f  50 basis  oints  n  the ank of  Canada's t s t o p i B Bank Rate  on January  30. European  stock rices  ave  reached  all-time ghs  as  the p h hi prospects  f  good  economic growth  this ear ave  seemed more certain  nd long-term o y h a interest tes  ave  fallen. ra h

Preparations r  next ear's  aunch f tage fo y l o S III of  EMU are  on track. n  a I report  eleased  oday, he  European  Commission formally ecommended that leven r t t r e countries  articipate  om  the  start.1  cording  to  official  timates, ese ountries p fr Ac es th c had 1997 fiscal  eficits ual  to  or  less han  the  3  percent  f  GDP  reference  alue.  In d eq t o v

mid-March,  the  Irish punt was  revalued,  and the  Greek drachma joined the  ERM. Interest  rates  in the  European  countries  continue  to converge. Italian  short-term  rates fell  90 basis  points  over the  intermeeting  period while  those  of "core"  EMU  countries changed  little. Italian  and  Spanish  long-term  interest  rates  are  now less  than  20 basis points  above  comparable  German  rates.

Exchange rates  in most  Asian  emerging  market economies  have  appreciated against  the  dollar over  the intermeeting  period,  and  prices  in  their  financial  markets have  increased. This  reflects  substantial  progress  in  several  areas. The "exchange offer"  to  restructure  Korea's short-term  foreign  currency  bank debts  appears  to have been  a success. Korea has  closed  ten  of fourteen  suspended  merchant  banks,  and significant  progress  has  been  made  in labor  market  reform. The IMF approved  the release  of the third  tranche  of Thailand's standby  arrangement  and commended  the Thai  authorities  for  their  progress  in  implementing  reforms. Speculative  pressures  on the  Hong  Kong  dollar and  the  Chinese  renminbi  have  subsided. The  only major exception  to this  pattern  of improving  financial  performance  is  Indonesia. Suharto's choice  of a new cabinet  has reinforced  doubts  about the  path of economic  and financial  policy  in Indonesia,  although  some  progress appears  to have  been  made  in talks  with  IMF staff. While up  on balance  over the  intermeeting  period,  the foreign exchange  value  of the  rupiah  continues  to  be  highly  volatile.

The speculative  pressures  against  currencies  of emerging  market economies outside  Asia have  also subsided  over the  intermeeting  period.  Yield  spreads  on Brady bonds  issued by  Argentina, Brazil,  Mexico,  and  Poland,  adjusted for the effects  of credit  enhancements,  declined  25  to  100 basis  points over the  intermeeting  period. Domestic  interest rates  have generally  moved  lower  in these countries  in response  to slowing  economic  activity  and  easing pressure  on their currencies. One  exception  to this  pattern is  Mexico,  where  the  domestic  interest rates  have  moved  up as falling  oil prices  have  put downward  pressure  on  the peso. In  Russia, President  Yeltsin dismissed Prime Minister  Chernomyrdin  and the rest  of his  cabinet  on  Monday. Russian  financial  markets  initially  sold off on  the news,  but most of the  move  has been  reversed. Yield spreads  on  Russian  Brady  bonds  are  down  more  than  170  basis points  since  the  beginning  of February.
