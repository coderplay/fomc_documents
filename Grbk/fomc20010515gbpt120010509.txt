In  response  o ndications  at  he anufacturing  ector  s ontinuing  o  contract t i th t m s i c t and  that  he eakening  in  activity   aining    broader oothold  n  the conomy, t w isg a f i e we have  marked down  our  estimate  f rowth  in  real o g GDP in  the econd  quarter s to  3/4  percent  t n  annual ate,  /2  percentage  oint ower  than e projected  n a a r 1 p l w i the  March Greenbook.

Relative  o  the arch Greenbook,  we are  now anticipating  ore prolonged t M a  m period f  sub-par  rowth.  The shake-out  n  the igh-tech  ector  ppears o  be o g i h s a t deeper nd more  persistent  an  we had anticipated,   that  reater  eakness, a th and g w together  ith   more pronounced  softening   other  arts  f anufacturing, w a in p o m likely  s pilling  er  to verall  ncome  and  demand. In  addition,   have i s ov o i we marked down our  assumptions bout oreign  conomic  activity   this  orecast, a f e in f reflecting  e  global  ature f he igh-tech  lump  and  the ffects  broad  of he th n o t h s e a t slowdown in  the nited tates.  t  this  oint,  e think hat  he .S.  economy U S A p w t t U will void  slipping to ecession, t  economic  conditions e  expected o  be a in r bu ar t quite eak,  with oticeable clines  n  payroll  mployment continuing  or he w n de i e f t next  few  months;  to any,  the conomy will  ook  and  feel s  if  t s n ecession. m e l a i i i r

The aggressive  asing f onetary  policy  hat  as  already  ccurred, e o m t h o along  with  an  assumed  further ar-term  eduction  n  the  federal  unds ate,  s ne r i f r i anticipated    provide   lift  ggregate  emand that  hould  be  increasingly to a oa d s apparent  s  the ear oes  on.

Taking  all hese actors  ogether,   expect eal DP  growth  to ick p late  n t f t we r G p u i the  year nd  to  average -1/2 ercent  n  2002.

International Developments

Overview

Economic  growth  abroad appears  to have  slowed further,  as plunging  global demand for high-tech  products  and softening  domestic  demand in many countries  has weighed  on activity.  Relative  to the March  Greenbook,  we have cut our projections  of foreign growth  for the remainder  of 2001. These markdowns  have been  spread across  all major regions but have been particularly large  for the emerging  Asian  economies,  many of which have faced  a sharp drop in external  demand. We now expect that total foreign  growth  will trough at 13/4 percent  (annual  rate)  during  the first two quarters  of this  year.  However,  the projected  strengthening  of the  U.S.  economy,  lower oil prices  next year, and stimulative  macroeconomic  policies abroad  should allow  foreign  growth to recover  to about 3 percent  during the second  half of 2001  and  to 3-3/4  percent during  2002.

Foreign  consumer price inflation declined  sharply  during  the first quarter, moving in line with the weaker pace of activity, a step down in the level  of oil prices,  and a  sharp--and  likely to be reversed--drop  in Mexican  food prices. Inflation  is expected to move back to around  3 percent during  the second half of this year  and through  2002.

Summary of Staff Projections

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE. Changes for years are  measured  as Q4/Q4; for half-years,  Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2;  and for quarters,  from previous  quarter.

The  numbers for foreign  output reported  in the table  are calculated  with weights  that are based on  shares of U.S. total exports. (The March  Greenbook output figures are  recalculated.) In previous  Greenbooks,  weights were  based on shares of U.S. nonagricultural xports. e The change has only a small effect on aggregate  measures of foreign  growth.

Relative to  the March  Greenbook, we have  shifted up the starting point for the broad  real  dollar, as  the exchange value  of the  dollar in the second  quarter has been  higher than  what we  had projected in  the previous forecast.  We have also flattened the  dollar's path of depreciation. The dollar is now projected to edge down about  1-1/2 percent  over the forecast period but to remain  strong.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent data indicate that the growth  of activity in the foreign industrial  countries  has slowed. The Japanese  economy appears  to have sputtered yet  again, with  sagging external  demand further restraining an economy already  hobbled by weakness  in the household and construction sectors. Investment spending also  appears  unlikely to match  the sizable increase in the  fourth quarter  of last year. In the  euro area, recent data have been mixed, with the level of industrial  production  during the first two months of the year about unchanged  from the fourth-quarter  average  and retail sales  showing divergent performance  across  countries. Declines in key gauges  of industrialsector sentiment,  as well as in German  manufacturing  orders  and industrial production, also point to a moderating pace of activity.  Canadian  manufacturing output,  particularly  of motor vehicles and electronics  equipment  (both of which are heavily  dependent on U.S.  demand), has  shown marked weakness.  Sectors outside  of manufacturing,  however, seem to be holding up fairly well.

Slower growth  and declining  energy prices have contributed to a slight  easing in headline  inflation rates  in  Canada and the United  Kingdom.  In the euro  area, rising food prices  have kept inflation  about  1/2  percentage point above the ECB's 2 percent ceiling.  Japanese  consumer prices have continued to decline about  1 percent per year.

The pace  of activity in many of the major developing countries  has  also faltered, with sluggish external  demand  playing  a role.  In Mexico, industrial production declined  in both January  and February, and exports  were  down sharply during the  first quarter. Production has been particularly  hard hit in several  Asian economies  that are  reliant on  the production  of high-tech  products.  For example, in Singapore,  first-quarter industrial production  tumbled  10 percent (not annualized),  with an  especially pronounced  decline in export-related  industries. In  Taiwan,  a large decline  in industrial production  during  the first quarter was accompanied  by a 10 percent  (not annualized)  drop in exports.  In contrast, industrial  production  in Korea moved up in March  for the third straight month, but production remains  well below the peak reached in August of last year. China reported rapid  first-quarter growth,  and  the country's exports  showed surprising  strength.  Inflationary pressures  in  the major developing  countries have generally  remained muted.
