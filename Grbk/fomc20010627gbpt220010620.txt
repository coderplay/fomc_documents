Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S.  trade  deficit in  goods and services  was $31.2 billion  in  March, compared with  a deficit of $26.9  billion in February  (revised) and  $33.3  billion in  January. For the  first quarter,  the deficit  was  $365  billion  at an  annual  rate, $32  billion smaller  than in  the fourth quarter  of last year.

The value of exports  of goods and  services  declined  moderately in March  to about the same level recorded  in January, with  much  of the  decrease  in capital goods.  In the first quarter, the  value of exports  declined 3 percent  at an  annual rate,  the  second consecutive  quarter of negative  growth.  The largest  declines were in  automotive products (primarily  cross-border trade  with Canada), machinery  (both high tech  and other), and industrial  supplies. By region,  the recent  declines in  goods exports were largely  to Asia and Latin  America.  In contrast,  goods exports to Western  Europe  increased.

The value  of imports of goods and services rebounded in March from the sharp drop  in February,  to a level  that was nonetheless  lower than recorded  in  any of the  eight months  preceding February.  The jump in March was largely in imported  consumer  goods.  Consumer goods  were also the largest  single source of import decline  in February. In  the first quarter,  the value of imports fell 10 percent  at an  annual rate. Imports  had leveled  off in  the fourth quarter  of last year  following several  quarters of strong  growth.  The largest  declines  in the  first quarter  were in  high-tech  machinery (computers,  semiconductors,  and telecommunications  equipment),  automotive products  (primarily from Canada), and oil  (entirely  from a  drop in  price). In contrast,  there were moderately  strong increases in  imports of consumer  goods  and non-oil  industrial  supplies.

that Argentina may have traded  short-term relief for insurmountable  difficulties in  the  medium and  long term.  Late in  the  period,  Argentina introduced a de  facto dual  exchange  rate system, with a separate  exchange  rate based on  an equal basket of dollars and euros to be used  solely for international  trade. The announcement  raised fears  of an upcoming peso devaluation  among international investors.  Nevertheless,  on net  over the period,  short-term  interest rates  fell in Argentina,  as did  the spread  over Treasuries  of Argentine sovereign  debt.  In Brazil,  beset  by a severe  energy crisis  and  concern  over Argentina,  the real depreciated  more than 7  percent  against the dollar to  an  all-time  low, despite intervention  operations,  sales  of dollar-indexed  debt,  and an  increase  in the  main central  bank policy rate. The Mexican peso, in contrast, appreciated  1 percent on net versus  the  dollar, with much of the movement following the announcement  of the  purchase  of a major Mexican bank by a U.S.  money center bank.  The  same  news contributed  to a large increase  in Mexican  share  prices.
