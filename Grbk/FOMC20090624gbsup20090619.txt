In the box on page I-2 of Part 1, 'Explanations for the Rapid Rise in the Unemployment Rate,' the third sentence of the second paragraph should read: 'Although real GDP fell by more than real GDI in the first quarter of this year, that difference reversed only a small portion of the sharp rise in the statistical discrepancy since early 2007 (shown in the bottom right).

The International Economy

U.S. Current Account

The U.S. current account deficit was $406 billion at an annual rate in the first quarter of 2009, $214 billion narrower than in the fourth quarter (revised) of last year and the smallest deficit since the fourth quarter of 2001.  For the second consecutive quarter, the narrowing of the current account deficit was the result of a substantially narrower deficit in goods and services, as imports have fallen more than exports.  A somewhat smaller surplus in investment income in the first quarter offset a somewhat smaller deficit in other income and transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The balance of payments data also included more complete information on financial flows in the first quarter.  U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment into the United States both slowed notably, primarily reflecting weaker equity capital flows and reduced retained earnings (see lines 6 and 7 of the attached table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions').  On net, direct investment provided an inflow of $11 billion, about the same as in the past two quarters.  Other flows from non-bank

concerns, bank-reported data available only quarterly, and foreign acquisitions of U.S. currency on net provided a very small inflow (lines 9 and 10).

Despite the more complete information on financial flows in the balance of payments release, it is clear that the data collection systems are not capturing all types of transactions and all types of counterparties for cross-border financial flows.  Indeed, despite the substantial narrowing of the current account deficit, the statistical discrepancy in the first quarter was still a sizable positive $55 billion at a quarterly rate, similar to that recorded over the past several quarters.  A positive discrepancy indicates some overreporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial inflows.

With the release of the first-quarter data, the Bureau of Economic Analysis also published revised estimates of the current account for previous years.  The current account deficit was increased $33 billion in 2008, mostly in the fourth quarter.  The fourth-quarter increase primarily reflected higher income payments on foreign direct investment in the United States.  There were also large revisions to financial flows, especially in 2007 and 2008.  These revisions primarily reflect recent surveys of U.S. holdings of foreign securities and foreign holdings of U.S. securities.  Taken together, the surveys implied smaller net inflows through securities transactions, which contributed to a significant widening of the statistical discrepancy.
