Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Home Sales and Prices

Sales of existing single-family homes increased 6.2 percent in September to 4.62 million units, up slightly from the level of a year ago.  The flattening out of existing home sales over the past year contrasts with continued declines in sales of new homes and likely reflects the influence of increasing foreclosures, which tend to boost the supply of attractively priced existing homes for sale.  Sales increases in September occurred in most regions but were especially apparent in the West, where price declines have been the largest.  The months' supply of single-family homes for sale fell to 9.2 months in September, down from a peak of 10.7 months in January.

The average price of existing single-family homes sold fell 8.7 percent in the 12 months ending in September, about the same pace as in recent months.  The monthly version of the purchase-only repeat-sales index calculated by the Federal Housing Finance Agency (formerly, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight) declined 0.6 percent in August, leaving it 5.9 percent below its year-earlier level.  This index is down 6.5 percent from its April 2007 peak and stands approximately at its September 2005 value.
