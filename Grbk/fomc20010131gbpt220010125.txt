Foreign Exchange Markets

The exchange value of the dollar has changed little,  on balance,  against the major currencies  since the December FOMC meeting, as a 2 1/2 rcent pe depreciation  against the euro  was counterbalanced by an appreciation  of 4  1/4 rcent  against  the yen. pe Right after the FOMC's surprise 50 basis point rate cut, it was difficult to discern  what the longer-term  impact of the policy action on the exchange  value of the dollar against  the euro and yen  would be. While the dollar appreciated  against the euro  and depreciated  against  the yen in the immediate aftermath  of the announcement,  these  moves were largely reversed the following day.  However,  within  a few days  of the rate  cut market participants  became more confident that the downside  risks for the U.S. economy were moderate,  and the major currencies  index of the  exchange  value of the dollar recovered  its earlier losses.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent economic data suggesting that the growth rate of the U.S. economy is moderating more rapidly than that of the European economy  appears to have helped revive  the fortunes  of the euro at the end of last year.  In contrast, the downward  revisions in growth expectations  for Japan have been quite  modest compared to the change in assessment  of U.S. growth  prospects.  One factor behind the yen's weakness  may be market perceptions that the Japanese government wants a weaker currency, to help generate  an export-led recovery. Further adding to negative  sentiment towards  the yen  was the announcement  by Toyota that it would reduce the rate at which  it repatriates its  foreign earnings;

Share prices in the emerging  market economies in Asia, led by the semiconductor manufacturing  companies, rebounded  smartly following the FOMC's January 3 policy action, gaining  16 to 25 percent  over the intermeeting period.  The apparent  end to the political  uncertainty in the Philippines helped equities gain  20 percent.  Share prices in Latin America  also recorded strong gains during the intermeeting period, ranging from 14 to  31 percent,  with the sharpest upward movement occurring  shortly after the FOMC's January 3 rate cut. Short-term interest rates  in Argentina were dramatically lower, as the FOMC's rate cut and an earlier IMF loan  agreement improved  sentiment towards Argentina.  The yield spread of Argentine and Brazilian  Brady bond debt over U.S. Treasuries  also narrowed  substantially.
