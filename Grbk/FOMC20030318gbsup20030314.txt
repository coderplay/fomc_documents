The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Industrial Production

Industrial production rose 0.1 percent in February, following a sharp increase in January.  Utilities output rose 1.3 percent, pushed up by relatively colder weather, and mining production climbed 1 percent.  However, manufacturing production was pulled down by a sharp drop in motor vehicles assemblies.  With manufacturing capacity estimated to have edged up 0.1 percent last month, the factory operating rate moved down 0.2 percentage point to 73.4 percent, 6.8 percentage points below its long-term average.

Motor vehicle assemblies slumped 600,000 units (annual rate) in February to 12.3 million units, with all of the decrease in automobiles.  Despite this decline, we estimate that the stocks of light vehicles rose further, ending last month well above a level consistent with the average rate of light vehicle sales in the last six months and with manufacturers' desired days' supply.  Assemblies of medium and heavy trucks increased 21,000 units last month, but at 230,000 units, production remained weak.

The output of high-tech goods expanded 2.1 percent in February, a second sizable monthly gain.  February production of semiconductors rose sharply from an upward-revised January level.  The production of microprocessor units was especially robust.  The output of computers continued to climb, consistent with Gartner's near-term outlook, but the production of communications equipment slipped 1/2 percent after having risen noticeably in January.

Excluding motor vehicles and parts and high-tech goods, factory output was flat last month.  Refining activity rose 0.6 percent, but retraced only a fraction of the drop in the previous month.  Among the market groups excluding motor vehicles and parts, high-tech goods, and energy products, the production of consumer goods declined 0.2 percent, pushed down by sharp decreases in the output of food, beverages, and clothing.  The output of business equipment edged up 0.1 percent, boosted in part by an increase in the production of industrial and other equipment.  The production of materials was unchanged in February; a decrease in the output of durable materials offset a similar-sized increase among producers of nondurables.  The production of iron and steel products fell for the fourth straight month.  Inventories have begun piling up at steel service centers, while shipments have been moving down.  The inventory-sales ratio at steel service centers rose to 3.97 months in January, its highest level since the early 1990s.

According to updated estimates of the staff's flow-of-goods inventory measurement system, the inventory-consumption ratio for iron and steel,

wherever held, has moved up in recent months.  However, as noted in Part 2, the system shows that inventories overall are low, with a large fraction of industries having inventory-consumption ratios of their products below their historical averages.  The aggregate manufacturing ratio moved up in February, but this increase was primarily the result of sharp increases in stocks of motor vehicles and aircraft.  Excluding these industries, the aggregate inventory-consumption ratio ticked down.

Producer Prices

The producer price index for finished goods rose 1 percent in February, boosted by substantial increases in prices for food and energy items.  Over the twelve months ended in February, the PPI rose 3.5 percent, after having fallen 2.6 percent during the preceding year.

Finished energy prices surged 7.4 percent in February, following a 4.8 percent increase the previous month, as the run-up this year in spot prices for petroleum products continued to work its way through the supply chain.  Prices for fuel oil soared 25.2 percent, prices for gasoline jumped 18.8 percent, and prices for natural gas rose 4.8 percent.  Over the twelve months ended in February, finished energy prices were up almost 25 percent, more than retracing a decline of around 20 percent in the preceding year.

Food prices rose 0.6 percent in February, on the heels of a 1.6 percent jump in January.  Prices for beef and pork climbed substantially in February, but the rate of increase was below January's pace; that pattern is consistent with recent reports from spot cattle and hog markets that the spurt in meat prices has begun to subside.

Excluding food and energy, the PPI for finished goods fell 0.5 percent in February; averaging over the past three months, this index has been about flat. With dealer incentives having been reduced, prices for new cars and light trucks fell substantially in February, partly reversing January's surge.  Over the past twelve months, the PPI for core finished goods rose 0.1 percent, down from a 0.7 percent increase in the preceding year.

The PPI for capital goods fell 0.4 percent in February, reflecting both the declines for automobiles, noted above, and a 6.3 percent decline in computer prices.  February's drop in computer prices was substantially larger than has been typical in recent reports, and it brought the twelve-month decline in computer prices to almost 23 percent, compared with a decrease of about 29 percent in the previous year.

Prices for core intermediate materials rose 0.7 percent in February, as the run-up in energy prices continued to show through to energy-intensive intermediate

materials such as industrial chemicals, nitrogenates, and plastics.  The twelvemonth change in prices of core intermediate materials stood at 2.7 percent, compared with a decline of 2 percent the previous year.  At the crude level, prices other than food and energy rose 2.7 percent in February, and were up 14.5 percent over the twelve months ended in February.

Retail Inventories

The book value of retail inventories increased at an annual rate of $36.7 billion in January.  Excluding stocks held by auto dealers, retail inventories moved up at a $5 billion rate, following an $11.8 billion accumulation in the fourth quarter.  Non-auto retail sales increased 1.5 percent in January, and the inventory-sales ratio declined to 1.40 months, the lowest ratio since 1992 when comparable data are first available.

Inventory investment in January was paced by an accumulation at motor vehicles and parts dealers ($31.7 billion).  Elsewhere, stock building at clothing and accessory stores more than offset liquidations at retailers of general merchandise and building materials.  Apart from autos, only inventorysales ratios at furniture and appliance stores appear elevated relative to trend.

For the entire manufacturing and trade sector excluding wholesale and retail motor vehicles, book-value inventories declined at an annual rate of $1.9 billion in January, following a $21.5 billion accumulation in the fourth quarter.  Sales in this broad category increased in January, and the inventorysales ratio moved down to 1.30 months after having ticked up in December.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment fell again in early March to a level 5 points below the February reading. This index has dropped about 12 points since December and now stands at 75, its lowest level since late 1992.

The current-conditions component of the overall SRC index sank more than 8 points in early March.  Consumers' assessments of their current personal finances deteriorated owing to concerns about rising energy prices, weak labor markets, and falling stock prices.  In addition, appraisals of buying conditions for large household durables fell to the lowest level in more than ten years, with respondents citing concerns about job and income prospects. The expected-conditions component of the overall index decreased about 3 points, as households' assessments of their expected personal financial situation weakened a fair bit and assessments of business conditions over the next twelve months dipped.

Among those items not included in the overall index, expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened slightly in early March, and appraisals of buying conditions for homes fell considerably. In contrast, assessments of buying conditions for cars retraced a small part of their decline in preceding months.

In early March, the mean of expected inflation over the next twelve months increased to 3.6 percent, and the median rose to 3.1 percent.  These measures have climbed between 1/2 and 1 percentage point in the past two months. The mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years edged down to 2.9 percent, while the median was unchanged at 2.7 percent for the third consecutive month.

The International Economy

U.S. International Transactions

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In February, the price of imported non-oil goods and the price of imported core goods rose 0.4 and 0.5 percent, respectively.  Rates of increase have been on the rise in recent months and have not been this large since April 2002.  Within core goods, the largest price movement was an increase of 2.3 percent in the price for non-oil industrial supplies, prompted by higher prices for natural gas, fertilizers, steel, and precious metals.  Prices for capital goods rose 0.3 percent, whereas prices for foods, feeds and beverages fell 0.7 percent.  The level of imported core goods prices in January and February on average was about 3½ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level of last year, following a 1½ percent increase in the fourth quarter.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 8.2 percent in February after rising a revised 13.3 percent in January.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil also rose in February, averaging nearly $36 per barrel, about $3 per barrel greater than in January.  The spot price of WTI has remained elevated in March and closed at $36.03 per barrel on March 13, after falling $1.80 per barrel.  The recent increase in oil prices reflects the market's perception that military action in Iraq may occur soon, increased demand (owing to unusually cold weather in the United States and the shutdown of nuclear reactors in Japan), and low oil inventories.  Continued low oil production from Venezuela, relative to pre-strike levels, is also keeping upward pressure on oil prices.

Exports. In February, both the price of exported total goods and the price of exported core goods increased 0.4 percent.  Within core goods, the largest price movement was an increase of 1.9 percent in the price of industrial supplies, driven largely by higher prices for petroleum-based products, precious metals, and woodpulp.  Prices for foods, feeds and beverages fell 0.6 percent.  The level of exported core goods prices in January and February on average was about 2½ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level of last year, following a smaller increase of 1¼ percent in the fourth quarter.

U.S. Current Account through 2002:Q4

In the fourth quarter, the U.S. current account deficit was $547 billion (s.a.a.r.), an increase of $42 billion over the third quarter (revised).  The majority of the increase in the deficit was accounted for by a widening in the trade deficit on goods, with a moderate decline in the surplus on services also contributing.  The net outflow of income and unilateral transfers was little changed from the third quarter.

The current account deficit for the third quarter was revised down almost $3 billion (s.a.a.r.), with a downward revision to the deficit on goods and an upward revision to the surplus on services contributing equally.  For 2002 as a whole, the current account deficit increased to $503 billion, up $110 billion, and equal to 4.8 percent of GDP.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

On Friday, BEA released fourth quarter and year 2002 data on U.S. international transactions, including adjustments to securities transactions on line 4 of the Summary of U.S.  International Transactions table and preliminary data for direct investment and other capital flows (lines 6 through 9).  Because Treasury International Capital (TIC) reporting forms likely overstate inflows into U.S. debt securities and understate outflows into foreign equities and bonds, BEA

reduces debt inflows and inflates equity and debt outflows.  For the fourth quarter, BEA assumed an especially large overstatement for foreign net purchases of agency securities (line 4b).  As a result, private foreigners are now estimated to have made net purchases of agency securities of only $11 billion in the fourth quarter, a significant slowdown from the third quarter, and to have made small net sales of agency securities in December.  These adjustments reduce foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) to $343 billion for 2002 as a whole, down from the record pace of 2001.  Combined with other small adjustments to U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5), U.S. private net inflows through securities are now estimated at $343 billion for 2002, still above the sizable net inflows of recent years.

Foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) slowed further last year to only $30 billion, reflecting continued low merger activity and weak corporate profits, although the pace of inflows picked up a bit in the fourth quarter.  U.S. direct investment abroad amounted to $124 billion last year, about the same pace as in 2001 (line 6).  As a result, net direct investment recorded an outflow of $93 billion in 2002, following inflows of $3 billion in 2001 and $129 billion in 2000.  Foreign accumulation of U.S. currency remained relatively strong in 2002 at $22 billion.

The statistical discrepancy (the last line in the table) for 2002 was a positive $28 billion, reflecting a swing from a positive $79 billion in the first half of the year to a negative $51 billion in the second half.  A positive statistical discrepancy indicates some combination of over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial inflows.
