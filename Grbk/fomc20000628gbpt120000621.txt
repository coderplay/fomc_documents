A confluence f  weak indicators  s  sparked opes, mportantly ong o ha h i am financial rket  participants,  t  he conomy is oving onto  a  path  of ore ma tha t e m m moderate  growth--and  hat  he ederal eserve  may have  little itional rk t t F R add wo to  do  over oming months  to  hold nflation   heck.  In  our  view, his  s oo c i inc t i t optimistic.   do  believe  hat  omestic emand is ecelerating,  t  the  recent We t d d d bu data ikely  verstate e egree  of hat  lowdown.

Economic activity  abroad. The Japanese economy recorded  10 percent growth during the first quarter, after a sharp contraction  during the second half of last year.  The first-quarter  rebound was boosted an estimated 2 percentage  points by inadequate adjustment for leap year, but the data suggest some  strength in both private consumption  and private investment.  Indicators for the second quarter point to  continued expansion, albeit at a much slower pace.  In the euro  area, first-quarter  GDP growth slowed a bit from the 3-1/2 percent rate registered in the second half of last year, but activity appears  to have accelerated in the second quarter.  Canadian growth  during the first quarter was  on par with last year's strong pace,  and recent indicators  show that the economy continues to grow briskly.  In the United Kingdom, in contrast, incoming data suggest  that the effects  of past monetary tightening and the strong pound are weighing on activity.

Measures of twelve-month consumer price inflation  have eased a bit recently in most foreign industrial countries,  partially reflecting  fluctuations  of oil prices. In the euro area, inflation has  moved back below the target ceiling of  2 percent. Japanese  consumer prices have continued to decline, while inflation in the United Kingdom has remained well below the Bank of England's 2-1/2 percent ceiling.

A diverse  set of emerging-market  economies,  including Mexico and a number of developing  Asian economies, registered double-digit growth during the first quarter.  This strong performance  was fueled by the ongoing buoyancy of exports but was also marked by a firming of domestic demand in these economies.  More recent data, however, have indicated a bit of payback for this first-quarter surge, particularly in Mexico, China, Hong Kong, and some of the ASEAN economies.  In Argentina, the economy's sluggish recent performance has raised doubts about the vigor of its fledgling  recovery.

The recent expansion  of activity in the developing  countries  has not triggered significant  inflationary pressures. In Latin America,  twelve-month  inflation has trended  down in Mexico  and Brazil, and Argentina continues to experience deflation.  In  developing  Asia, incoming data have caused us to mark down our inflation  estimates  for the first half of the year for a number of economies, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan,  and South Korea.
