Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Industrial Production

Industrial production rose 0.4 percent in February after having increased a revised 0.2 percent in January.   Before that, industrial production had fallen in 1 fifteen of the eighteen months since its recent peak in June 2000; the cumulative decline between June 2000 and December 2001 was about 7 percent.  Output in manufacturing rose 0.3 percent in both January and February; manufacturing output in January was originally estimated as having been unchanged.  The factory operating rate in February, at 73.2 percent, was 0.3 percentage point higher than at the end of last year.

The recent improvement in manufacturing output reflected a step-up in production in several major industries, including steel, high-technology, paper, chemicals, and tobacco products.  Among high-technology industries, the turnaround in the output of computers and semiconductors, which began last autumn, continued into early this year.  In addition, the production of communications equipment, which had fallen precipitously for more than a year, held steady in February.  The output of motor vehicles and parts, which surged toward the end of 2001, has been little changed, on net, since December. Production in a few industries, such as aircraft and printing and publishing, posted further sizable declines last month.   Elsewhere in manufacturing, 2 results have been more mixed since the beginning of the year.

Outside of manufacturing, mining production fell further in February as activity in the oil and gas extraction industry contracted again.  Output at utilities jumped 2.7 percent; while still on the mild side, temperatures were closer to historic norms in February than during the previous few months.

Looking at the market groups excluding the high-technology, motor vehicle, aircraft, and energy industries, consumer goods production has been little changed over the past few months.  The output of consumer durable goods has been volatile recently, largely reflecting swings in appliances and televisions; smoothing through the bumps, output in this group, which had fallen sharply since the fourth quarter of 2000, has stabilized in recent months.  The output of nondurable consumer goods was little changed for a fourth successive month. Losses in consumer paper products, mainly periodicals, books, and cards, have been offset by gains elsewhere.

Capacity Utilization

(Percent of capacity)

<!-- missing-text -->

The output of  business equipment has been choppy recently, but, on balance, has continued to slide; the farm, metalworking, and special industrial machinery industries have been particularly weak.  The output of construction supplies has improved recently, with a cumulative gain of nearly 2 percent over the three months ending in February.  The production of business supplies edged up in February even though the output of job printing fell further.  The output of materials posted solid gains in both January and February, led by higher production in steel, paper, and chemicals.  According to our industry contacts, the recent increases in steel output likely reflect a pull-ahead in demand from steel service centers in an attempt to build inventories in advance of tariffrelated price hikes.

The diffusion index for the three-month change of production in total industrial output jumped to 58 percent in February.  This is the first time since July 2000 that this measure has registered above 50 percent and indicates that more than half of the industries posted increases in production from three months earlier.

Business Inventories

The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories (excluding motor vehicles) fell  at a markedly slower rate ($18 billion) in January than the steep pace of liquidation ($96-1/4 billion) in the fourth quarter of last year.  Sales in this broad category increased in January, and the inventory-sales ratio fell to 1.34 months, the lowest reading since June 2000.

Although manufacturers recorded another sizable drawdown of stocks in January, the rate of liquidation at wholesalers slowed, and inventories held by non-auto retailers increased at an annual rate of$20.8 billion rate.  The jump in retail stocks in January was surprising because it was accompanied by a sizable increase in non-auto retail sales.  The combined effect pushed the inventory-sales ratio down further to 1.45 months, the lowest ratio since 1992 when comparable data are first available.  Retail inventories increased in nearly every category, with the most notable accumulation recorded at motor vehicles and parts dealers ($46.3 billion).  Nevertheless, inventory-sales ratios remain at the low end of historical readings in every retail category.

At the wholesale level, the book value of inventories excluding motor vehicles edged down at an annual rate of $4.9 billion in January, after having declined at a $31.7 billion rate in the fourth quarter.  Wholesalers of electrical goods and metals and minerals continued to run off stocks in January, but distributors of professional and commercial equipment built stocks for the first time since last April.  Stocks held by distributors of nondurable goods were little changed in January.  Sales at non-auto wholesalers increased 1.2 percent in January, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector dropped to 1.26 months, the lowest

ratio since June 2000. Nevertheless, stocks remain high relative to shipments at wholesalers of machinery and metals and minerals.

The book value of manufacturers' inventories decreased at an annual rate of $33.9 billion in January.  Stocks held by manufacturers of durable goods declined in every major industry grouping except lumber and wood products, which accumulated inventories in January for the first time in six months.  The largest drawdowns occurred at producers of transportation equipment, primary metals, and machinery.  Notably, the pace of liquidation at makers of computers and electronic products abated considerably.  With the increase in factory shipments in January, the overall inventory-sales ratio dropped to 1.33 months in January-its lowest level since July 2000.  Nevertheless, stocks remain high relative to shipments at manufacturers of electrical equipment, chemicals, and leather and allied products.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's index of consumer sentiment jumped more than 4 points in early March.  The index stands at its highest level since December 2000 when the decline in consumer confidence began.  The current-conditions component of the overall index increased about 3 points in early March, continuing its rise from February and fully reversing the drop in January.  The expected-conditions component shot up 5 points this month and is 10 points above its December 2001 level.

Among those items not included in the overall index, expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved considerably and have now plunged about 40 points since October 2001.  Meanwhile, appraisals of buying conditions for cars fell slightly in early March, likely reflecting a further cutback in financing  rates on new car loans.  Appraisals of home buying conditions also ticked down early this month.

In early March, the mean and median of expected inflation over the next twelve months climbed noticeably to 3.1 and 2.6 percent, respectively. These measures have now retraced almost all of their sharp declines in October and November, but remain well below the levels reached in mid-2001.  The mean of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years inched up 0.1 percentage point to 3.2 percent, while the median was unchanged at 2.8 percent.

Producer Prices

The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.2 percent in February, boosted by increases in food and energy prices.  Over the twelve months ending in February, the PPI has declined 2.6 percent; this compares with a year-earlier twelve-month gain of 4 percent.  Excluding food and energy, finished goods

prices were unchanged last month; this left the twelve-month change in the core PPI at 0.5 percent, compared with a year-earlier increase of 1.3 percent.

The PPI for energy rose 0.4 percent in February, following a tiny increase in January and a string of sharp declines in earlier months.  Gasoline prices jumped 4-1/2 percent last month, following a 3.4 percent increase in January.  Fuel oil prices also rose last month; by contrast, prices for natural gas and electricity declined.  Overall, producer energy prices have tumbled more than 20 percent over the past year.

Producer food prices rose 1 percent, with prices of vegetables, fish, and beef and veal posting especially large increases.  However, the twelve-month change in the PPI for food stood at 1.9 percent in February, down a percentage point from a year earlier.

The PPI for core consumer goods edged down 0.1 percent in February.  Apparel and tobacco prices were flat, and a 0.2 percent decline in passenger car prices partly offset a 0.6 percent increase in light truck prices.  The PPI for core consumer goods rose 0.7 percent over the twelve months ending in February, and has decelerated nearly a percentage point over this period.

Producer prices of capital goods ticked up 0.1 percent last month.  Within capital equipment, prices for communication equipment moved up 0.5 percent, but this index was still 0.7 percent below a year earlier.  Computer prices dropped 4.1 percent in February, and were down 28-1/2 percent over the previous twelve months.

At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials was flat last month.  Core intermediate prices have decelerated about 3 percentage points over the past year, and the twelve-month decline in this index was 1.8 percent in February.  Core crude materials rose 1-1/2 percent in February, but were down nearly 7 percent relative to a year earlier.

The International Economy

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 3 percent in February, the second consecutive monthly increase after three months of steep declines. The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil, which also rose in both January and February, moved sharply higher in the first half of March. The current spot price of WTI is more than $24 per barrel, a level not seen since September. Factors generating the price increase include stronger signs of world economic recovery, production restraint by OPEC, and heightened tensions in the Middle East.

Non-oil imports . The price of imported non-oil (and core) goods fell ‰ percent in February after a small uptick in January, resuming the pattern of decline that began about a year ago. The February decrease occurred mainly in prices of food and non-oil industrial supplies. Prices of both consumer goods and capital goods (excluding computers) fell slightly, whereas the price of automotive products edged up. The price index for core goods on average in January and February was down 1.7 percent at an annual rate from the fourth-quarter average level, somewhat less than the 3‰ percen t annual rate decline that occurred in the fourth quarter.

Exports . Prices of U.S. goods exports (both total and core) fell slightly in February, continuing the general pattern of price declines that has prevailed over the past year. As with import prices, the sharpest fall was in prices of agricultural commodities. Prices in other major categories were little changed in February. The average level of the price index of core goods in January and February was down about 1‰ percent at a n annual rate from the fourth-quarter average level following an annual rate decline of about 3‰ percent in the fourth quarter.

U.S. Current Account through 2001:Q4

In 2001:Q4, the U.S. current account deficit edged up to $395 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (s.a.a.r.). The $1.2 billion increase in the deficit was more than accounted for by the one-time recording in the third quarter of estimated foreign insurance payments related to the events of September 11, which reduced reported service imports by $11 billion ($44 billion a.r.) in that quarter. Ignoring the estimated insurance payments, the current account deficit would have narrowed $42.8 billion in the fourth quarter.

For the fourth quarter, the deficit on goods narrowed $19.2 billion s.a.a.r. as the foreign economic slowdown decreased exports less than the U.S. recession reduced imports. Net services receipts decreased $38.4 billion, though

<!-- missing-text -->

disregarding the estimated insurance payment, the balance on services would have increased by $5.6 billion. The balance on income, which was negative throughout 2001, also narrowed $22.9 billion, as income receipts decreased less than income payments. Other income and transfers increased $5 billion, contributing to the widening of the current account deficit.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

On Thursday BEA released preliminary fourth quarter and revised third quarter data for direct investment and other capital flows (lines 6 through 9 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). Capital inflows for foreign direct investment in the United States in the fourth quarter continued the dramatic fall begun in the third quarter (line 7); these low inflows were associated with very low merger activity and weak corporate profits. Direct investment capital outflows were down somewhat in the fourth quarter from the strong first three quarters (line 6). For the year, direct investment outflows and inflows were virtually identical. Foreign accumulations of U.S. currency continued strong in the fourth quarter, owing primarily to strong demands from Argentina and Russia (line 8).

The statistical discrepancy (the last line in the table) continued to show large quarterly variations, reflecting the sizable swings in measured components such as those for banking (line 3). For the year, the statistical discrepancy totaled negative $39 billion, indicating some combination of underreporting of the current account deficit or overreporting of net capital inflows.
