RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Economic activity decelerated in  the second quarter and appears to  be growing at a  moderate pace this quarter. Consumer spending has picked up after its spring lull, and indicators of  business equipment investment remain quite favorable. However, manufacturing output was held down in July by  supply disruptions in  the motor vehicles industry, and the rapid accumulation of  business inventories over the first half of  the year is likely to restrain activity in a  few sectors. Although the unemployment rate remains at its lowest level in twenty-five years, price and labor compensation measures have shown no sign of  breaking out of  their recent subdued trends.

Real GDP

According to BEA's advance estimate, real GDP rose 2.2 percent at an  annual rate in  the second quarter, following a  downwardrevised 4.9 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. The reported deceleration in  activity last quarter reflected a sharp slowing in  the growth of consumer spending. In  addition, although inventory investment was up a  bit from its already rapid firstquarter pace, the swing in stockbuilding contributed much less to overall GDP growth last quarter than in  the first quarter. In contrast, gains in  business fixed investment and residential investment were larger than in  the first quarter, while real federal expenditures turned up sharply and more than reversed last quarter's decline.

Since the publication of the advance GDP estimate, we  have received the usual monthly flow of data, including book-value inventories for June. Taken at face value, the inventory data could add $12 billion, in chained 1992 dollars, to the advance GDP figure. However, the monthly inventory figures for wholesale and retail trade are often revised substantially. Moreover, the second-quarter estimate of nonmerchant wholesale and other nonfarm inventory accumulation--which is based on relatively few  hard data--seems much too high to us (especially coming on  the heels of an  even more

outsized increase in  the first quarter).2 Given these considerations, we  are inclined to assume that real inventory investment in  the national accounts will eventually be revised up only a  bit; Although BEA may report a  larger upward revision in  its preliminary GDP estimate later this month, our best estimate of second-quarter GDP growth is about 1/2 percentage point above BEA's advance estimate. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion of  secondquarter activity in the remainder of  this section of  the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions to the GDP data.

Labor Market Developments

Employment rose sharply in  both labor market surveys in  July, and the unemployment rate moved back down to  match its lowest level of  the current expansion. At  the same time, aggregate hours of production workers fell last month, implying a  considerable decline in  the average workweek to a  relatively low level. This pattern has been repeated in the initial months of  the past seven quarters, raising the possibility of  a  seasonal adjustment problem. We cannot identify the source of such a  problem, but we  share the view expressed by some other analysts that one should take care not to

read too much into the July decline. Thus, on  balance, we think that growth of  labor demand maintained considerable momentum as the third quarter began.

Private nonfarm payrolls advanced 260,000 in July, up from an increase of 151,000 in  June and  well ahead of the average monthly gain of 213,000 posted over the first half of the year. The service-producing sector more than accounted for the July rise in private payrolls; gains were widespread, and payroll increases topped their first-half averages in all five major industry groups. In particular, employment growth in the services industries rebounded smartly from its weaker-than-average June pace, and retail trade posted a large gain. In  contrast, employment dropped 4,000 in the goods-producing sector.

In  the household survey, employment grew 344,000 in July, more than offsetting the June decline. Netting out the effects of  the introduction of  new  population weights in January, employment gains in the household survey have averaged 220,000 per month over the first seven months of the year, only slightly below those in the payroll survey. The strong employment gains pushed the unemployment rate back down to 4.8 percent in July, 1/2 percentage point below the plateau of late 1996 and early 1997.

The labor force participation rate has held steady at 67.1 percent over the past three months after peaking at 67.3 percent in  March. Adjusting for changes in survey design and population weights, labor force participation is about even with its highest level in  the previous expansion. Evidence is mixed on  the prospects for further increases in the participation rate. On  one hand, the percentage of  workers not in  the labor force but saying they want a  job has declined sharply since early 1996 and now is the lowest since the series was first published in 1970. In  addition, anecdotal reports indicate that orders for temporary workers have been going unfilled because of a  shortage of  workers with the required skills. On the other hand, the increases in participation among some of  the groups that accounted for much of  the rise in  the aggregate rate over the past year--men and women aged 20 to 24 and aged 55 and older, and women who maintain families--show, as  yet, no sign of leveling off. This upward trend has been offset in recent months by  some slippage in labor force participation among teenagers and prime-aged men (aged 25 to 54). If  the labor market were to remain strong, these declines might not persist.

- 2.  Nonfinancial corporate sector includes all  corporations doing business in  the United States except banks, stock and  commodity brokers, and finance and insurance companies; the  sector accounts for  about two-thirds of  business employment.

Other indicators we track confirm that labor demand is quite strong. The Conference Board's index of  help-wanted advertising rebounded in June to a  level that, when adjusted for the sharp rise of  temporary help agencies, is above the level seen in the late 3 1980s. Similarly, workers perceive strong demand for labor; the difference between the percentage of households believing jobs are plentiful and those believing jobs are hard to get has widened in recent months to its largest gap ever. Finally, the level of initial claims for unemployment insurance has remained low, which is consistent with robust employment growth in  August.

Labor productivity in  the nonfarm business sector rose 0.6 percent at an  annual rate in the second quarter after an increase of 1.4 percent in  the first. Smoothing through the recent fluctuations, output per hour in the nonfarm business sector has risen almost 1-1/4 percent at an  annual rate in  the last eight quarters, compared with increases of less than 1  percent per year from 1990 to 1995. The better performance, even as highly qualified workers reportedly have become hard to find, hints at  the possibility of a  slight improvement in the underlying trend of late. However, this was also a  period of output acceleration, and a  pickup in  labor productivity would be  a  typical pattern in that environment.

As of Greenbook publication, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters continued its strike against United Parcel Service (UPS). The strike, which began on  August 4, reflects two key issues. First, UPS has offered its workers larger pension benefits in return for pulling out of  the multi-employer plan currently run  by  the union. But the union opposes this proposal, possibly out of  fear that, without UPS, the current Teamster-run pension plan may not be viable. Second, the Teamsters argue that UPS relies excessively on part-time jobs and would like the company to convert 10,000 parttime jobs to full-time positions; approximately 60 percent of  the 185,000 employees covered by  the Teamsters' contract are classified as part-time workers, who are paid substantially lower hourly wages than their full-time colleagues. If  the strike were to continue

through Saturday, which seems likely at this point, nonfarm payroll employment in  August will be held down, on net, by  disruptions from the strike.

Industrial Production

Industrial production rose 0.2 percent in  July after rising at nearly a  4  percent annual rate in the first half of  this year. Although a  return to  more normal weather boosted electric utility output in July, industrial production was held down by  a 2-3/4 percent decrease in  the output of  motor vehicles and parts. Manufacturing excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.2 percent for a  third consecutive month. Production of  nondurable consumer goods edged lower, while output of appliances turned up and business equipment posted another solid gain. The overall factory operating rate edged down to 82.1 percent in July, the lowest level since last October.

Production of  motor vehicles and parts has been a  volatile component of industrial production throughout 1997. In July, production fell short of schedules made at the beginning of  the month by  more than 1  million units at  an annual rate. Strikes at General Motors accounted for about 400,000 units of the underbuild; in addition, the company's start-up following the companywide shutdown was slower than expected, in  part because of quality concerns. General Motors and Chrysler also curtailed output of  a few  models whose inventories were excessive; however, these losses were more than offset by  stepped-up production at  transplants. At the end of July, stocks of  light trucks were at about 68 days' supply, just a  little on  the high side, while the days' supply of autos was running at a  lean 54 days.

After growing strongly in  the first half of the year, production of consumer durable goods outside of  motor vehicles surged another 2.1 percent in July, as  output of appliances and computers rose smartly. In  contrast, output of  consumer nondurables, which accounts for about one-fourth of  total industrial production excluding motor vehicles, contracted 0.3 percent in July.

The production of  business equipment has continued to grow briskly. Although output of industrial equipment was down for a third month, information processing equipment posted another substantial gain, jumping 0.7 percent in July after increases of more than 12 percent at  an annual rate in  the first half. Transit equipment, mainly civilian aircraft, also grew rapidly, in large part because of  Boeing's increased production. Although the media have reported that Boeing is facing difficulties in ramping up production further, our contacts at Boeing reiterated that current production is running as planned and that the 1997 schedules will be met. Construction supplies edged down again in July after growing moderately in the first half of  this year, but materials output posted a  strong gain, largely reflecting gains in semiconductors.

The various indicators of future production continue to  be upbeat. The new-order index from the National Association of Purchasing Managers for July was at a  historically high level. Likewise, new-order indexes from the  American Production and Inventory Control Society and Dun and Bradstreet also indicated that orders are growing. Additionally, recent data from the Bureau of the Census continue to show an uptrend in  new orders for durable goods.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of  new light vehicles in July, adjusted for shifts in reporting periods, were 15.5 million units at an  annual rate, well above the second-quarter pace of 14.7 million units. The dip in sales in the second quarter and the subsequent spurt in  purchases in July reflected, in part, the effects on supplies of several UAW strikes and the limited availability of some popular Japanese models during the spring. Cutting through the volatility in  the monthly data, the underlying trend of sales seems to  have remained near 15 million units--the rate that had prevailed since the second half of 1995.

Sales are expected to be  buffeted by  supply problems again this month. As  noted earlier, overall production in July fell well short

of plans at the  beginning of  the month because of  strikes and startup problems at General Motors. Although lean inventories may depress sales somewhat this month, these supply disruptions should be short-lived; General Motors resolved many of  its production problems by  the end of  July and is, for the moment, strike-free. 5

Based on  confidential data from General Motors and Ford, retail demand so far this year seems well-maintained; through July, the average pace of sales was nearly the same as in 1996.6 Overall fleet sales so far this year are also little changed from the strike-affected level in 1996, as some supply-related shortfalls in sales continued at GM; according to GM, these sales are expected to pick up later this year as these supply constraints ease.

The Michigan SRC survey indicates that consumers' attitudes toward car-buying conditions remained upbeat in  July, largely because of favorable pricing. We expect that pricing, from the consumers' perspective, will remain favorable in  the near term. Incentives offered by  the Big Three should continue to  be  generous as these firms attempt to regain, or at  least prevent further erosion of, market share. In addition, announcements of price increases for the 1998 models have been quite modest so far. For example, Ford's overall vehicle prices will be unchanged, while those for General Motors will increase an average of about 1.3 percent on  a  comparably equipped basis. Moreover, design modifications for some popular foreign nameplates will reduce their prices, putting additional pressure on the Big Three.

Consumption and Personal Income

After a  lull in  the early spring, consumer spending has picked up in  the past couple of  months. Moreover, the fundamentals driving consumption growth remain quite favorable: Real income gains have been strong this year, household net worth has continued to rise,

and consumer sentiment is buoyant. In addition, credit is readily available to  most consumers.

In  the second quarter, PCE edged up just 0.8 percent at an annual rate after an increase of  more than 5  percent in  the first quarter. The deceleration was most evident in  consumer durables, but spending on nondurables also dropped back after a  strong firstquarter advance. In  contrast, spending on services maintained the brisk rise observed in  the previous two quarters because a rebound in spending on energy services offset some slowing in consumption of non-energy services.

The only spending data available for the third quarter are for goods. Total nominal retail sales moved up  0.6 percent in July. Nominal outlays in the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and at  building material and supply stores, rose 0.5 percent. The July retail sales report, together with the data on  motor vehicles sales, suggests that real personal consumption expenditures for goods rose 1.2 percent in  July, to  a level about 1-1/2 percent above the second-quarter average.

Real disposable personal income rose at a  3-3/4 percent annual rate over the first half of  the year, but it likely was held down in July by  the  weakness in weekly earnings. Nonetheless, the substantial rise in payroll employment in  July suggests that the underlying trend in real income growth remains sound despite the monthly gyrations in  the data.

Over the past year and a  half, capital gains from the stock market have continued to push up the ratio of  household net worth to disposable income. The revised NIPA data now show a  decline in the personal saving rate over this span, consistent with the presence of a  wealth effect spurring spending. Moreover, with the wealth-toincome ratio moving up further recently, household financial conditions appear likely to remain a factor supporting spending over the coming quarters.

Consumer sentiment has also continued to climb in recent months, with the Michigan SRC index posting another historical high in  July. Respondents to this survey continue to  view their personal financial situations and business conditions very favorably. In addition, they remain optimistic about both business conditions and labor market prospects over the coming year. One factor presumably underlying consumers' buoyant outlook is  lower expected inflation. The mean expected inflation over the next twelve months continued

its recent downward trend and was 3.4 percent in  July, almost a  full percentage point below its July 1996 level. And although the median expected inflation over the next twelve months was down less than the mean, the latest reading, at 2.7 percent, in July is one of  the lowest in  the past twenty years. The Conference Board index of consumer sentiment pulled back a  bit in July but remained at a  very high level.

Housing Markets

Housing activity maintained a  healthy pace last quarter. Starts in  the single-family sector averaged 1.11 million units in June and for the second quarter as a  whole. This level is somewhat below the average for the two preceding quarters--a reference point that balances out most of  the weather-induced volatility in starts seen late last year and early this year--and might be interpreted as a  sign of some deceleration in this sector. However, permit issuance for single-family construction, which we  view as a  better indicator of construction activity, held at  a  robust 1.05 million unit rate in the second quarter.

Recent indicators of housing demand have also been relatively favorable. The Census report on sales of  new homes is still subject to some question. But, taken at face value, sales, which were at their strongest pace in eighteen years in the first quarter, fell back in April and May before rebounding in June. Cutting through the ups and downs, which may reflect, in  part, the swings in mortgage rates last spring, new-home sales in the second quarter averaged 785,000 units at  an annual rate, 3-1/2 percent above the 1996 pace. Sales of existing homes (measured mainly at settlement, rather than contract) declined a  bit in  June, but the average level of  these sales during the second quarter was up about 1-1/2 percent from the strong 1996 pace. Among the indicators for July, builders' rating of the strength of new-home sales and consumer attitudes toward homebuying edged down, although each of  them remained at a relatively healthy level. In  addition, applications for mortgages to finance home purchases reached a  record high in  mid-July and continued to  be strong in early August.

The strength of  home sales has reduced the stock of both new and existing homes for sale, but the decline in new-home inventories has been especially notable. According to Census data, the months' supply of new  homes for sale fell to 4.2 months in June, one of  the lowest observations on record. However, information from Census Bureau analysts suggests that the extent of  the inventory decline in recent months may be  overstated. Part of  the decline stems from the Census Bureau's new  data collection procedure, which identifies some units that were included in  the "for sale" inventory but that no longer were on  the  market. These units should have been removed from the inventory of  new  homes for sale in  years past, but Census was unable to identify them until it introduced its new procedures.

Multifamily housing starts jumped nearly 13 percent in June, offsetting most of the falloff that occurred in  May. For the second quarter as a  whole, these starts were about 5  percent above the average pace in  the preceding two quarters. However, permit issuance for multifamily units declined about 2  percent in the second quarter, suggesting that the recent strength in  these starts may  not be sustainable.

Business Fixed Investment

Real business fixed investment accelerated in  the second quarter, increasing at an  annual rate of 14-1/2 percent following a 8 downward-revised first quarter advance of 4  percent. The acceleration in  the second quarter owed almost entirely to a  surge in  real outlays for producers' durable equipment. Underlying the surge was continued healthy growth in corporate cash flow and the delayed effects of  the acceleration in  business output around the turn of the year, along with the ongoing price declines for computing equipment and a  pickup in aircraft deliveries.

Real business purchases of office and computing equipment posted another large gain in the second quarter, rising at a 32 percent annual rate. The rapid growth in  real outlays on office and computing equipment seems likely to continue into the current quarter: Demand for personal computers and networking equipment remains strong, and the steep price declines that have been driving

demand for some time are set to continue. In particular, Intel's recent round of price cuts for Pentium processors, which went into effect at the beginning of  August, will be even deeper than previously expected and will include price reductions of 40 percent on the newer MMX chips; computer manufacturers already have begun to cut prices aggressively on  complete systems.

Growth in real outlays for communications equipment slowed to a 5-1/2 percent increase at an annual rate in  the second quarter. However, orders for communications equipment were up sharply in  May and June, suggesting the potential for a  larger gain in outlays in the current quarter. Telecommunications deregulation should continue to  have a  positive impact on  spending on communications equipment. Although long distance providers have thus far realized little revenue from their local market operations, markets are opening and investment expenditures by  these companies have proceeded apace. In  particular, despite a  recent U.S. Appeals Court ruling against the FCC's pricing rules for the fees that local phone companies can charge competitors for access to local networks, Bell Atlantic-Nynex has agreed to follow FCC guidelines, a  move that is likely to speed up the process of increasing competition in local and long distance phone markets.

Outside of information technology, expenditures on  capital goods excluding motor vehicles took off in  the second quarter, expanding at  a  33 percent annual rate. This increase was partly due to a  sizable pickup in  domestic deliveries of aircraft; but even excluding aircraft, expenditures in this category--which had grown slowly over the previous two years--rose at a  22 percent annual rate. Orders for this category also remain strong, suggesting that the second quarter's robust growth of shipments will continue in the current quarter.

In  contrast to the strength in equipment spending, the growth of expenditures on  nonresidential structures has weakened this year. The annual revision to  the data on construction put-in-place showed some significant changes in  the timing of expenditures over the past year--revising expenditures up over the earlier part of 1996 and showing a  flatter pattern over the first half of 1997. As a  result, BEA's advance estimate shows little net change in outlays over the first half of  this year. In addition, June's construction put-inplace data--not available for BEA's advance estimate--reported a 2  percent decline for nonresidential structures. We  now estimate

that expenditures in this category fell at a  1-1/2 percent annual rate in the second quarter.

Available indicators paint a  mixed picture for future growth in nonresidential construction activity. Smoothing through their large monthly swings, contracts for construction have been relatively flat over the first half of  the year, with contracts for office buildings down noticeably from their peak of late last year. But other indicators remain strong: Vacancy rates have declined, and prices for commercial real estate are edging up.

Business Inventories

Nonfarm businesses continued to accumulate inventories at a rapid rate in  the second quarter. However, while this pace clearly is unsustainable, there are few signs of imbalances at  this juncture.

In manufacturing, inventory investment slowed to a  $16 billion annual rate (book value) in June--about half the average pace observed in  April and May. For the second quarter as a  whole, manufacturers invested a  robust $25 billion. However, the inventory situation varied somewhat by industry last quarter. Inventories held by  producers of  aircraft and parts continued to rise at a  brisk pace. Inventories of other nondefense capital goods also generally expanded over the second quarter, despite a  dip in June. Nonetheless, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods were generally robust, and  the June inventory-shipments ratio for goods in  this category was the lowest in recent years. Outside of  capital goods, stocks held by  producers of  motor vehicles and other automotive products were drawn down substantially, while inventories in several consumer goods-oriented industries--fabricated metal products, food, textile, and apparel--expanded. Although factory stocks at  midyear generally were well-aligned with orders and shipments, inventory-shipments ratios for several nondurable goods industries appeared a  bit high in  June.

In  wholesale trade, nonvehicle inventories rose sharply in  June after little net change in  the preceding two months. In  addition to a  substantial buildup in  stocks of  business equipment, inventories held by  some distributors of consumption goods--lumber, hardware and plumbing, alcoholic beverages, and drug store supplies--also posted significant increases. Despite a  sizable jump in  June, the inventory-sales ratio for the wholesale trade sector remained in  the relatively narrow range seen over the past year. In retail trade,

stores in the GAF grouping reported an inventory buildup of $1.8 billion in June, bringing the second-quarter accumulation to $5.5 billion; the buildup followed declines in the preceding two quarters. The  modest buildup in GAF stocks was apparently consistent with recent increases in sales: The inventory-sales ratio for this broad category of retail stores edged down further in June to 2.16 months--among the lowest in recent years.

Federal Sector

The incoming news on the fiscal 1997 deficit has once again been surprisingly good. Neither OMB nor CBO has officially released its usual summer budget update. However, President Clinton announced that OMB now expects a  deficit of $37 billion, and CBO announced an  estimate of  only $34 billion.

For the first nine months of fiscal 1997 (October 1996 to June 1997), the unified federal deficit, adjusted for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was $54 billion lower than for the same period in  fiscal 1996. Receipts were more than 9  percent higher than the yearearlier level; in particular, individual income tax receipts have continued to  be extremely strong. Adjusted outlays were up only 3.9 percent through June, roughly in line with their pace over the past couple of years. While defense has edged up  this year, after four years of decline, health spending has been quite subdued.

Two major pieces of legislation recently were enacted into law: the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Taxpayer Relief Act (TRA) of 1997. The legislation is expected to have only moderate effects on  the deficit through fiscal 2001 but is expected to reduce

Under the BBA, new  caps are established for discretionary spending.10 Although these caps raise discretionary spending above the OBRA-1993 caps by  roughly $8  billion in 1998 (according to CBO's most recent published estimate), total discretionary spending is cut roughly $100 billion over the 1998-2002 period (relative to  a baseline that has discretionary spending at the OBRA-1993 cap in 1998 and growing with inflation thereafter). The BBA cuts mandatory spending $118 billion over the five-year period, with the lion's share of  the mandatory cuts ($112 billion) from lower Medicare spending. Savings from  Medicaid cuts and increased spectrum auction proceeds approximately balance out increases in spending on a  child health initiative and other programs.

Finally, the TRA  provides $92 billion in  tax relief over the 1998-2002 period. Gross tax cuts, consisting largely of a  child tax credit and new education tax incentives, total almost $150 billion. These are partially offset by  about $55 billion in tax increases, representing about $40 billion in  increased excise taxes on air travel and cigarettes and about $15 billion in  miscellaneous small tax increases.

Earlier this week President Clinton struck three provisions of the BBA and TRA, inaugurating the use of  the line-item veto. 1 1 All together, these provisions would have cost about $600 million over five years. The line-item veto will likely be challenged in the courts on  the grounds that it is unconstitutional. In addition, several analysts have suggested that Congress may  be  able to protect provisions from the possibility of veto by  making minor technical adjustments to the way  that the legislation is introduced.

EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX OF  HOURLY COMPENSATION FOR  PRIVATE INDUSTRY WORKERS

State and Local Governments

Total real consumption expenditures and gross investment by state and local governments rose at a  1.3 percent annual rate in  the second quarter, about half the pace reported in the first quarter. In the second quarter, consumption expenditures increased 2.1 percent, while investment fell 1.9 percent after rising almost 6  percent during the preceding quarter. Construction put-in-place for June, which became available after the GDP report, rose 0.4 percent in  real terms at a  monthly rate, well below the figure assumed by  BEA. Meanwhile, employment in  July increased 55,000, after an even bigger rise in June. Both  months saw outsized increases in  the education component of local government employment: Apparently, school systems have been moving to  earlier start dates and year-round sessions, and the seasonal adjustment factors for the summer months have not yet adequately captured these shifts.

According to  the National League of  Cities, the fiscal position of the nation's cities has improved in recent years, because of  both favorable economic conditions and sound budgetary policies. Ending balances as a  percentage of  expenditures increased in every fiscal year between 1993 and 1996, and the balance is expected to remain high during fiscal 1997 (which still has not ended for many cities). As a  result, cities have been expanding programs and adding to their reserve funds, while revenue-raising actions have subsided. Despite the good news, many cities continue to  be pressed by  infrastructure and public safety needs and the demands of growing populations.

Prices and Labor Costs

According to the employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation of  private industry workers rose 3.4 percent at an annual rate between March and June, following a  2.5 percent rise during the first quarter. This pickup resulted from a  rebound in benefit costs, seasonally adjusted, in the second quarter and 12 mimicked a  similar pattern seen last year.

Because of this quarterly volatility, the twelve-month changes in these series are probably more meaningful. The rise in  hourly compensation over the twelve months ended in June was 2.9 percent-unchanged from the pace recorded in  the prior two years. Hourly

wages and salaries were up 3.3 percent during the year ended in June, while benefits rose 2  percent after an increase of 1.7 percent in the previous twelve months. Although increases in employers' costs for health insurance benefits have moved up a  little over the past year, their rate of increase is still subdued. In addition, declines continue to  be reported in contributions to  workers compensation plans and state unemployment insurance funds.

By  occupation, compensation growth has remained fairly steady in  white-collar and blue-collar jobs over the past year but has accelerated briskly in service occupations. By  industry, hourly compensation has picked up noticeably in  retail trade, the sector with the largest concentration of  minimum-wage workers, and in business services, where labor shortages for both temporary workers and computer specialists have been reported. In contrast to  these areas of wage pressures, compensation growth in  the health services, FIRE, and transportation industries has diminished over the past year. Some analysts have noted that the ECI may  be  understating labor cost increases because it  does not pick up some of  the methods firms reportedly have been using to attract or retain workers in this tight labor market. For example, stock options, hiring bonuses, and special training promises--the use of which reportedly has increased over the past year or so--are excluded from the ECI.

Indeed, one measure that eventually captures some of these alternative pay arrangements, hourly compensation in  the nonfarm business sector as reported in the Productivity and Cost release, has risen somewhat faster than the ECI over the past few  years. This measure of  compensation has increased 3.4 percent over the past four quarters, up about a  quarter point from the rate recorded a year earlier. Although more inclusive in  measuring pay gains, hourly compensation in  the Productivity and Cost data tends to lag on  the benefit side, and it  has been revised down in  the past two years to reflect a  reduction in estimated employer contributions for health insurance. These revisions have eliminated some--but not all--of the difference between the nonfarm and ECI measures of compensation growth in  the past two years. The faster growth in  the productivity and cost measure of  compensation relative to  the ECI is entirely in  the wages and salary components of  the two series. Although this difference is consistent with the greater use of some forms of compensation excluded from the ECI, it could also reflect

increases in hourly pay associated with the rise in increased use of overtime hours or a  higher incidence of job promotions.

Average hourly earnings of  production and nonsupervisory workers--the only wage data available for the third quarter--were unchanged in  July; the twelve-month change held steady at 3.5 percent. This series is also running slightly ahead of  the comparable ECI figure, likely reflecting the rise in  overtime hours evident over the past year.

The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in July, following four consecutive months of increases of  0.1 of  a  percentage point. On  a  twelve-month change basis, the CPI has remained steady at 2-1/4 percent in recent months, down from 3  percent in July 1996.

The CPI for energy was little changed for a  second month in July after falling sharply over the first half of  this year. An increase in the price of  natural gas in July about offset price declines for other energy products. However, in coming months, prices of  petroleum-based energy products may start rising. After bottoming out at roughly $18.50 per barrel in  mid-June, the spot price of  West Texas intermediate has averaged more than $20 per barrel thus far in  August. Furthermore, private survey data suggest that, on a  seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of gasoline turned up early this month.

Consumer food prices rose 0.3 percent in July. The price index for fruits and vegetables was up in  July for a  third consecutive month. Retail coffee prices also moved higher again in July, although futures prices and a  decline in  the PPI for coffee suggest that prices will move lower in coming months. Among other items, prices for beef and eggs moved up  in July, while the index for dairy products fell further. As of  July, consumer food prices were 2-1/2 percent above the level of a  year earlier; substantial deceleration in  the twelve-month rate of change has taken place since the end of last year. Although prices of crude foods edged up in July, these prices were more than 14 percent below the elevated levels of the previous year, when grain prices were peaking. Although dry  weather has hurt crops in some regions of the country since mid-July, the USDA still is forecasting large crops overall. Moreover, rain and cooler temperatures in  the last week or so have allayed some of the concern about crop conditions. Our translation of  the recent data on  futures prices suggests that year-to-year declines in crude food prices will persist into 1998.

CPI  AND PPI INFLATION RATES (Percent change)

<!-- missing-text -->

The index for consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent in July, the same as the average monthly increase in  the first half of  the year. On  a  twelve-month basis, core consumer prices increased 2.4 percent in  July, down from the 2.7 percent pace recorded a  year earlier, but similar to  the pace recorded in the previous couple of  months. Falling import prices have helped hold down the rate of change of core CPI commodities to 0.9 percent over the twelve months ended in July, while prices of services other than energy advanced 3.1 percent over this period.

PCE prices excluding food and energy have not decelerated over the past year as  have core CPI prices; in contrast, core PCE prices had decelerated considerably more in  the preceding year. Other broad measures of  prices show little sign of acceleration, and short-term inflation expectations are lower than a  year ago. Furthermore, prices at  earlier stages of processing remain relatively subdued. The PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy has edged up a  little over the past twelve months; although the PPI for core crude materials turned down in July, the index is now  about 3  percent above its year-earlier level. Since mid-July, the Journal of Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price indexes have turned up somewhat, reflecting the recent rise in metals prices; both indexes, however, are little changed on  balance this year.

APPENDIX

ANNUAL REVISION TO  THE NIPA

Background

On  July 31 the BEA published revised national income and product accounts for the period 1993:Q1 to 1997:Q1. The revision incorporated updated seasonal factors and more comprehensive source data. These data include federal budget data, IRS tabulations of tax returns, BLS data on  employer costs for health and life insurance, BEA price data for certain types of  high-tech equipment, and Census Bureau annual surveys of  consumption services, manufactures, merchant wholesale trade and retail trade. Most of these sources run through 1995, although preliminary figures for 1996 are available in some cases, such as  wages and salaries.

The revision also included an  important methodological change. When the BEA  introduced chain-weighted Fisher aggregation last year, it continued to use fixed prices to estimate real GDP for the most recent quarters. It  has now  decided to  eliminate this so-called Laspeyres tail by  using quarterly Fisher aggregat on  to construct the estimates of  GDP in  the most recent quarters. The new approach will produce estimates that are on roughly the same conceptual basis as  those for earlier periods. Before the change, output growth in the  most recent quarters tended to be  slightly overstated in the official statistics because the  weights for some fast-growing industries (notably, computers and semiconductors) had been fixed when relative prices in these sectors had  been falling. We  estimate that the elimination of  the Laspeyres tail lowered measured GDP growth about 0.1 to 0.2 percentage point over the past year.

Revisions to Real GDP and Its Components

Growth of real GDP  was revised up  a  bit in  1993, 1995, and 1996, but down in 1994. The estimate for the first quarter of 1997 was revised down a  full percentage point to 4.9 percent. For the period from 1992:Q4 to 1997:Q1 as a  whole, real GDP growth was revised up an average of just 0.1 percentage point per year. The new estimates of consumer spending on services and of investment in business inventories are higher, while the new figures for consumer

- 1. The BEA does not use the data for a given calendar year to construct annual weights until after they have passed through their first annual revision. Thus, the annual revision that just occurred made data for 1996 available for use as annual weights, which allows for annual Fisher aggregation through 1996:Q2. Under the previous procedures, spending aggregates for each quarter after 1996:Q2 would have been calculated using fixed weights based on 1996 prices. Now, the aggregates for each of  the recent quarters will be  constructed using weights from that quarter and the previous quarter.
- 2. The growth rates of the  major components of  output were overstated by  varying amounts, depending largely on  the importance of  high-tech equipment in the different sectors. For example, we estimate that the elimination of the Laspeyres tail lowered measured growth in  PDE for recent quarters by  more than 1  percentage point and lowered growth in  imports and exports by  an  even larger amount. In  contrast, measured growth in  PCE was likely lowered less than 0.1 percentage point.

spending on goods, business fixed investment, and government spending are lower. On  balance, the changes leave inventory-sales ratios for the revision period higher; in particular, the data no longer show a  sharp decline in the ratio of  nonfarm inventories to final sales of goods and structures over the past year.

Income-Side Issues

The revision only partially resolved the large and widening gap between the product and income sides of  the national accounts. The difference between gross domestic product and gross domestic income--the statistical discrepancy--remains large by  historical standards, amounting (in  absolute value terms) to 0.8 percent of  GDP in 1997:Q1. However, the revision did narrow the difference between the growth rates of real GDP and real GDI in  the past two years; the change owed about as much to  downward revisions to income growth as to  upward revisions to output growth.

The staff at  the BEA continues to believe that, at least for the most recent years, the product measures of output are more reliable indicators of  economic performance. However, they acknowledge that there are a  number of  places on both sides of the accounts where measurement is  especially difficult. Among other things, these include the amount by  which proprietors' income is misstated in tax data and, on  the product side, the volume of such consumer services as Internet access, cellular phone service, and gambling. Moreover, the source data throughout the accounts are much less complete after 1995, leaving open the possibility of  a future narrowing of the statistical discrepancy over the past year and a  half.

The level of nominal national income was revised up by increasing amounts in  each year from 1993 to 1996. Sizable increases in  the estimates of rental income, corporate profits, and net interest all contributed to this pattern. The revision to corporate profits accentuates the uptrend in  profits as a  share of GNP over the past several years. Compensation of  employees was revised down in 1995 and 1996 because of  a  reduction in estimated employer contributions for health insurance (which are part of "other labor income"). As a  result, the revised labor share of national income shows a  much sharper decline over the past four years, leaving the current level at the very low end of the range seen since 1970.

The combination of revisions to income and outlays significantly altered the contour of the personal saving rate over the past several years. Before the revision, the saving rate appeared to  have a  slight uptrend beginning in 1995, but the new data show a  decline from more than 5  percent in the first quarter of 1995 to  about 4-1/4 percent in  the second quarter of this year. Given the dramatic rise in  the stock market over this period, the behavior of the revised saving rate over the past two years is in

better alignment with what would be  expected based on  the historical relationship between wealth and saving.

Revisions to  Labor Productivity and Prices

The modest upward revision to output boosted the level of labor productivity in  the nonfarm business sector in 1997:Q1 by  only a small amount. Thus, average productivity growth since the last business cycle peak in  mid-1990 is little changed. However, the  new output data do hint at a  slightly stepped-up rate of growth beginning in  the middle of 1995--1-1/4 percent (annual rate) over the past two years, as compared with 1  percent in the first half of the 1990s. Although our econometric models cannot determine whether the higher growth rate is a  cyclical response to  the acceleration in output growth last year or a  more fundamental improvement in the productivity trend, the data are consistent with the observed faster growth of  the capital stock relative to  trend labor input as well as the many anecdotal reports of a  pickup in the trend rate of multifactor productivity growth in recent years.

Finally, the annual revision to the NIPA data boosted very slightly the average increase in the GDP chain-type price index over the past four years. Upward revisions to  prices for PCE services and government spending more than offset downward revisions to prices of some types of  high-tech equipment.

Long-Term

<!-- missing-text -->

Over the four weeks immediately following the July FOMC meeting, yields on intermediateand long-term securities declined as much as 1/2 percentage point. The rally was spurred by  incoming data indicating subdued inflation and also by  Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, which was read by  market participants as expressing the view that inflation might remain in  check without further System tightening.

In  the past two weeks, however, amid data for July indicating strength in  hiring and a  vibrant manufacturing sector as  well as  a weakening of the dollar on foreign exchange markets, bond rates moved sharply higher (chart, top panel). This souring of  market sentiment made it more difficult for dealers to place securities issued at  the Treasury's August midquarter refunding, which may  have exacerbated the downturn. On  net, much of  the decline posted earlier in the intermeeting period was rolled back, and yields on Treasury coupon securities ended the period about 10 basis points lower.

The recent rise in  interest rates contributed to a  selloff in equity markets (chart, lower panel). Still, major equity indexes have increased 3  percent to 10 percent since the July FOMC meeting, supported by  generally favorable earnings reports. Equity-price volatility over the intermeeting period has continued on  the slight upward trend that began in 1996.

Borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses was very strong in July: corporate bond issuance posted record levels, and growth of  business loans also remained relatively brisk. Of  late, the financing requirements of  nonfinancial corporations likely have been boosted by rapid expansion of capital expenditures even though, in the aggregate, growth of  internal funds has remained robust. By contrast, borrowing by  households shows further signs of  moderation; while home equity loans continue to grow strongly, the volume of such lending has not been large enough to offset the deceleration in consumer loans. Reflecting the decline in  the federal budget deficit. Treasury borrowing remains light, but issuance of  bills has recovered. Net offerings of  debt by state and local governments remain on  track for a  moderate advance this year. The expansion of M2 was damped in  July, in part because the strong performance of  the

stock market attracted inflows to long-term mutual funds at  the expense of  deposits.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of  nonfinancial corporate bonds set successive records in June and July (table) and remained brisk in the first half of  August. Investment-grade borrowers took advantage of  the drop in long-term interest rates in  July and boosted bond issuance to its highest level in recent years. A  number of companies issued 100-year bonds to lock in  those low rates and in  light of  the withdrawal of legislation that would have limited the tax deductibility of  coupons on such bonds.

Speculative-grade offerings soared in  July, almost matching the torrid pace of  June. Most of  these offerings were in the 144A sector, which exempts firms from certain SEC filing requirements if the securities are placed among only a  limited number of sophisticated investors. Over the first seven months of  this year, junk bonds have accounted for almost half of  total nonfinancial bond issuance, higher than any previous annual share (chart, lower left). The recent strength in junk bond financing largely reflects firms' needs to support ongoing capital spending--such as  building wireless and cable networks. Robust inflows to junk bond mutual funds have helped to  hold junk bond spreads to near historic lows.

Net issuance of  nonfinancial commercial paper remained positive in  July, though below the pace for the second quarter, when mergerrelated offerings accounted for more than half of  net issuance (chart, lower right). While merger-related commercial paper issuance remained strong in  July, paydowns of  existing paper with proceeds from bond offerings increased.

The news on corporate credit quality has remained quite favorable. In the second quarter, Moody's upgraded $15 billion more nonfinancial debt than it downgraded, and its Watchlist of  companies under review for a  rating action suggests that there will be little net change in ratings in the near term. Also, the default rate on speculative-grade debt fell in  the second quarter from an  already low  first-quarter rate. In  contrast, the rate of  nonfinancial

business failures so far this year has been somewhat above the low levels in  the preceding three years, with the failure rate in  July boosted by  the  bankruptcy filing of retailer Montgomery Ward.

Elevated price-earnings ratios have encouraged equity issuance by  nonfinancial firms, which was higher in  July than in  the first half of the year although below last year's rapid pace. The volume of initial public offerings in  July and the first week of  August was also up a  touch over the first-half pace, likely reflecting stronger investor demand, as signaled by  the uptrend in  first-day returns to IPOs (chart, top left). Nevertheless, net issuance of  nonfinancial equity remained firmly negative, as it  has been since 1994. Both retirements from mergers and announcements of share repurchases continued to  be strong in the second quarter, and the large number of transactions currently pending suggests that retirements from mergers and repurchases will remain robust in  the near term. 2

With more than 90 percent of  the S&amp;P 500 companies' secondquarter financial reports now  in, earnings rose about 10 percent over the past four quarters, again exceeding analysts' 3 projections. Although earnings growth slowed somewhat from its four-quarter growth rate of  nearly 15 percent recorded in  the two preceding quarters, the positive earnings surprises reinforced investor enthusiasm for equities, pushing major stock price indexes to  new records in  July and early August. As  has been true for some time now, prices have been boosted by  expectations of  higher longterm earnings growth. Indeed, the July reading on  expected earnings growth for the S&amp;P 500 over the next three to five years stood at its highest level since the start of  the series in  the early 1980s (chart, middle right panel). With the rise in share prices accompanied by  only a  small net decline in  long-term Treasury yields, equity valuations became even richer relative to  bonds over the intermeeting period (chart, lower panel).

Household Finance

The deceleration of personal consumption expenditures in  the second quarter of 1997 left its mark on demands for consumer credit.

After a  first-quarter spurt, borrowing in consumer credit markets returned to the moderate pace posted at the end of last year (table). Consumer credit outstanding was unchanged in June, on  the heels of  a  sluggish gain in May, and grew at  a  3-3/4 percent annual rate for the quarter. This continues a  trend of  moderation that began early last year (chart, top panel). Revolving credit-primarily credit card debt--grew at a  5-1/2 percent rate during the second quarter, its slowest advance since the second quarter of 1993.

Data on  consumer credit quality from the Call Report and the American Bankers Association are  not yet available for the second quarter. The limited information now  in  hand provides signs of stabilization or  even improvement in some market segments in  which payment performance had been problematic. Both Moody's and Standard &amp;  Poor's indicate that delinquency rates on securitized credit card receivables have been edging lower since February (chart, bottom left panel). In  addition, some of  the major bankcard issuers have cited improved or stable delinquency rates on credit card receivables in  their second-quarter earnings reports. For example, Citicorp reported a  delinquency rate of 2.7 percent, up  from 2.4 percent in  the year-ago period but unchanged from the first quarter. MBNA reported increased earnings and stable write-offs. Similarly, auto loan delinquency rates at  the finance "captives" of the three major domestic automakers declined in the second quarter after three years of  virtually uninterrupted rise (chart, bottom right panel). Still, while delinquency rates have flattened out, they remain on the high side of  what is  typical for an  expansion.

Information on  the growth in  home mortgage debt is still incomplete for the second quarter; partial data suggest that the net flow may  have edged off from the sizable first-quarter total. The rate of  mortgage purchases and securitizations at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac slowed measurably, but growth in  total real estate loans at commercial banks picked up, partly reflecting continued strength in  home equity loans. More recently, mortgage applications have strengthened, according to indexes compiled by  the Mortgage Bankers Association, as mortgage interest rates have declined on net. Applications for home purchase in  July were at the highest level recorded in  the four years the series has existed, and applications

for refinancing, although well below peak levels, have climbed noticeably.

Home equity loans in  the second quarter continued the rapid expansion in  train since the spring of last year. In addition to the strong increase at  banks, finance company holdings grew at a 14 percent rate. The biggest gains occurred in  pools of  securitized home equity loans, which expanded at an estimated 76 percent rate over the first half of  the year. Finance companies and mortgage companies have originated the bulk of  recently securitized home equity loans, most of  which are closed-end loans classified as "subprime" or "B and C" quality loans.5 The proceeds from these loans are frequently used to consolidate other debt. Indeed, securitization has been the primary funding source for many of  the firms specializing in subprime home equity loans. Heavy investor demand for the securities has ensured a ready supply of 6 financing.

At the end of last year, delinquency rates on securitized home equity loans were around 8  percent compared with less than 2  percent on  those on  bank books (chart, upper panel). The growing dominance of  lower-quality loans in securitized pools also shows through in the time paths of  delinquency rates for pool cohorts by  year of origin (chart, lower panel). The delinquency rate for closed-end loans backing pools created in  1995 was much higher after two years than it was for earlier cohorts at the same point in  their seasoning. Information on  more recently formed pools is still fragmentary, but anecdotal reports suggest that the credit performance of the 1996 cohort is similar to that of  the 1995 cohort.

Treasury, Agency, and State and Local Finance

The staff forecasts that the Treasury will borrow about $30 billion in  the market this quarter to fund a  budget deficit of similar size. The Treasury announced that it  will satisfy twothirds of  its borrowing need through the issuance of  bills and onethird through the issuance of  notes and bonds.

At its midquarter refunding in  August, the Treasury sold threeyear notes ($16 billion), ten-year notes ($12 billion), and thirtyyear bonds ($10 billion). Customer demand at the refunding was unexpectedly weak, and, as a  result, dealers were awarded more securities than they had expected, putting downward pressure on bond prices after the auction. Demand for the thirty-year tranche of  the refunding was particularly weak, with the yield on  that security in the  when-issued market shooting up 18 basis points after the auction.

The Treasury indicated that in October it will reopen the justauctioned five-year indexed notes and confirmed that it  will sell a thirty-year indexed bond next year. With regular quarterly sales of indexed debt all but guaranteed and net borrowing from the public projected to  be substantially smaller than in recent fiscal years, the Treasury appears committed to raising a  substantial fraction of its anticipated net financing need with indexed debt.

A proxy battle at  the Student Loan Marketing Association ended with the replacement of  the current management with a  dissident group of  directors. The new leadership favors direct origination of loans to  students, which the ousted management opposed. Sallie Mae is expected to  become fully private soon. Spreads between Sallie Mae issued securities and Treasuries have held steady over the intermeeting period.

Gross offerings of long-term municipal debt decreased to $15 billion in  July, from about $19 billion in  June, reflecting a typical seasonal decline in  new capital issuance at the start of the fiscal year of  many municipalities (chart, top panel). However, with long-term yields approaching the lows reached in  late 1993, refunding volume increased nearly 25 percent in  July. For the first seven months of 1997, gross issuance of long-term municipal debt was little changed from last year, while retirements declined about 15 percent, boosting net issuance from its 1996 pace.

The credit quality of  municipal debt continued to improve. In the second quarter, Standard and Poor's upgraded nearly $16 billion of  municipal debt and downgraded less than $1 billion, attributing the recent improvement in credit quality to  the economic expansion, coupled with better financial management on  the part of state and

local governments (chart, bottom panel). General obligation bonds, which are especially sensitive to the prospects for tax receipts, accounted for most of the net upgrades in  the second quarter.

Financial Intermediaries and Monetary Aggregates

The rally in the stock market over the intermeeting period was again accompanied by  heavy inflows to  mutual funds. Net sales of stock funds are estimated to have increased in  July, up 30 percent from their second-quarter pace (table). July net sales of  bond funds are currently estimated to be  at least twice as large as the monthly pace in the second quarter. Still, net sales of  bond funds remain small relative to those of stock funds.

Liquidity ratios for both domestic bond and stock funds were about 5-1/2 percent at the end of June (chart). For bond funds, this figure is close to  the average since 1990, while the ratio for stock funds is  well below the average. The declining liquidity ratio for stock funds reflects a  growing reliance on  backup lines of credit and expectations of  heavy future inflows of  cash from new investors, as  well as the acquisition of liquid fixed income securities with maturities beyond one year, which are not counted as liquid assets by  the SEC.

Credit provided by  commercial banks, adjusted to remove the effects of  mark-to-market accounting rules, expanded at a 9-1/2 percent rate in  the second quarter, fueled by  strong increases in both its business and real estate components (table). Most likely, some of that C&amp;I lending helped firms to finance a  further buildup of  inventories in  the second quarter, while real estate lending was supported by  the strength in housing activity and the attractiveness of  home-equity loans. Supply conditions also appeared to be accommodative: The  August Senior Loan Officer Survey indicated that a  large fraction of  banks eased terms on  both C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans, and a  significant share of respondents, for the first time, eased standards on commercial real estate loans. Consumer lending, in contrast, was subdued in the second quarter, even after adjusting for the effects of securitization, in  line with the marked slowdown in  personal consumption expenditures. Results from the  August Senior Loan Officer Survey showed that banks continued to tighten standards on consumer loans, especially on  credit cards, but by  notably less than the previous couple of surveys. Nonetheless, over 10 percent of

respondents reported increased willingness to  make consumer loans, the largest fraction since May 1995.

Data for July indicate that the growth of  total bank credit slowed to a  6-1/4 percent rate. A  deceleration across all major loan categories was, in  part, offset by  an  acceleration in securities lending. In  particular, real estate loan growth was anemic, except for the home equity component, and consumer loans slowed to a  2-1/2 percent pace. The expansion of  business lending eased off as  well, perhaps because firms turned to  market sources of finance.

Earnings reports for the second quarter for the top 150  bank holding companies suggest that profits expanded at about the moderate first-quarter pace, despite the negative effects of nonrecurring charges relating to the cost of  mergers and restructuring. Indeed, non-interest income increased, and the return on assets stayed at a  historically high level. Meanwhile, loan-loss provisions remained stable as  a  percentage of average assets even though the ratio of charge-offs to loans edged up.

M2 increased at a  4-1/2 percent annual rate in July, near its pace in  the second quarter (table). The growth of  M2 has been restrained by  ongoing sluggishness in  household deposits. Households continue to  favor assets such as retail money market mutual funds, which are included in  M2, and stock and bond mutual funds, which are not. Growth in  M2 from the fourth quarter of 1996 through July averaged just under 5  percent, near the upper end of its annual growth cone.

M3  was particularly robust in July, registering a 10-3/4 percent advance. Although bank credit slowed in  July, M3 was bolstered by  heavy offerings of  large time deposits at  U.S. branches of foreign banks, evidently to pay down borrowings from their overseas offices. Domestic banks also increased their issuance of large time deposits, in  part to  counter the falloff in government deposits held at these institutions. Institution-only money funds advanced rapidly in  July, as they have done, on  average, over the last year and a  half, apparently reflecting their appeal over inhouse money management by  businesses. Growth in  M3 from the fourth quarter of 1996 through July averaged 7-1/2 percent, well above its annual growth cone.

APPENDIX

THE  AUGUST SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES

The August 1997 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (covering, for the most part, changes over the preceding three months) posed questions about bank lending standards and terms, loan demand by  businesses and households, and securities backed by commercial mortgages. The responses suggest that banks became even more accommodative lenders to  businesses and that the tightening of  standards on  loans to  households slackened somewhat.

Increased competition for business credit apparently led large percentages of surveyed banks to  ease terms on  C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans over the past three months. Furthermore, a  small, but significant, share of  banks reported easing standards on commercial real estate loans. Demand for C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans strengthened at many of  the respondents.

Banks again reported tightening standards on  consumer loans, but  the percentage that tightened was lower than in recent surveys. Moreover, several banks expressed increased willingness to make these loans. Demand for consumer loans reportedly declined.

Lending to  Businesses

A  small net percentage of the domestic respondents--about 5  percent--reported easing standards for C&amp;I loans to large and middle market firms and to small businesses over the past three months (chart). About 40 percent, on  net, narrowed spreads of C&amp;I loan rates over their bank's cost of  funds on loans to large and middle market borrowers, and about 25 percent, on  net, narrowed spreads on loans to small businesses. Similar percentages indicated lower costs of credit lines, and smaller percentages eased other terms, including the  maximum size of credit lines, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements. The degree of  easing found in the August survey is similar to that found in  the January and  May surveys. Those banks that eased said they did so because of increased competition from other banks, and, to a  lesser extent, from nonbank lenders. Foreign respondents reported no change in standards for C&amp;I loans, and only a  few  indicated a  change in terms.

Increased demand for C&amp;I loans, on  net, from large and middle market borrowers and from small business borrowers was reported by 15 percent and 20 percent, respectively, of  the domestic banks. Respondents attributed the increased demand to greater customer financing needs for mergers and acquisitions, plant and equipment investment, and inventories. Foreign respondents reported essentially no change in  demand for C&amp;I loans.

The survey results suggest that banks are cautiously increasing their participation in the market for commercial real estate loans. More than 10 percent of  the domestic respondents, on net, reported easing standards for these loans over the past three months. The three preceding surveys also found small net percentages easing standards on  these loans, and the August results mark the largest, albeit still modest, net percentage easing since the question was added to the survey in 1990. In  addition, two-fifths of  the domestic respondents narrowed spreads on  these loans over the past three months, and smaller fractions increased maximum loan sizes,

extended maximum loan maturities, and eased pre-leasing or pre-sale agreements. The survey found little change in required loan-tovalue ratios, requirements for take-out financing, and debt-service coverage ratios. Foreign respondents reported essentially no change in standards and, other than a  few  that narrowed spreads, little change in  terms. Increased competition was reportedly the principal reason for the eased standards and terms, although many banks also cited improvements in  the condition of or  the outlook for commercial real estate. About 15 percent of the domestic and 25 percent of the foreign respondents reported increased demand for commercial real estate loans.

Lending to Households

The August survey was the seventh in a  row that found a tightening in standards for loans to  households. However, the net percentages tightening were smaller in August, suggesting that many banks may  now believe they have adjusted their lending stance appropriately to the deterioration in  the performance of these loans that occurred over the past two years. In  August, less than 25 percent of the respondents said they had tightened standards for credit card applications over the past three months and less than 10 percent, on  net, had tightened standards for other consumer loans. These percentages, while significant, are about half those found in  May. One-fourth of  the respondents also lowered credit limits on  credit card lines, although only small net fractions of banks tightened other terms on  consumer loans. Despite these tighter standards and terms, about 10 percent of  the banks, on  net, said that their willingness to  make consumer installment loans had increased over the past three months--the largest net percentage expressing increased willingness since the May 1995 survey (chart). About 10 percent of  the respondents, on  net, reported decreased demand for consumer loans.

Banks reported essentially no change in  their standards for approving applications for mortgage loans to purchase homes. Twenty percent of  the respondents, on net, reported increased demand for these loans.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities

Special questions on the survey asked about banks' issuance and holdings of commercial mortgage-backed securities, which have grown rapidly in recent years. About one-fourth of  the domestic respondents, concentrated among the larger banks, and one-fifth of the foreign respondents had securitized commercial mortgages. Almost all the respondents that had securitized commercial mortgages had done so, at least in part, through a  conduit program. These programs are typically arrangements sponsored by an investment bank to package loans originated by correspondent lenders. The investment bank establishes lending guidelines under which the correspondents originate their loans, thus promoting uniformity in the loans backing the securities.

About half of those banks that had securitized commercial mortgages retained at least some of the servicing responsibilities for them. Only a  couple of the banks retained junior or  senior classes of  the securities backed by the commercial mortgages they had originated. However, about one-fourth of  the respondents, especially the larger respondents, did hold some commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Exports of  goods and services expanded 3-1/2 percent in April/May, relative to the first-quarter level. The largest increases were in  exports of  machinery and in exports of aircraft and aircraft parts. Most of  the gains were due to increases in volumes rather than in  prices. In contrast, agricultural exports continued to fall, mostly because of  declines in  prices of agricultural products.

Imports of  goods and services grew 3 percent in  April/May, relative to the  first-quarter level. The strongest gain was seen in imports of  consumer goods, although imports of  computers and other capital goods (mostly machinery) also posted sharp increases. As with exports, most of  the strength in  these import categories was attributable to increases in  import volumes.

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  imported oil in  April/May was sharply higher than rates recorded during the first quarter of 1997 and well above rates recorded in 1996. Imports were driven by extremely strong consumption --up 3.4 percent from rates observed a  year ago. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil

imports remained strong in  June and July due to continued high consumption demand.

The price of  imported oil rose 2.4 percent in  June, following a  1.1 percent rise in  May. The  June price increase was induced by concerns about the renewal of  the Iraq oil-for-food arrangement. Despite these recent modest price increases, the price of  imported oil in June was significantly below the level at the  beginning of the  year, as sharp declines occurred between February and April in response to deliveries of  oil from Iraq and mild winter weather. Spot WTI rose $0.46 per barrel in  July, averaging $19.63 per barrel, reflecting continuing market concerns about Iraq's shipments under U.N. supervision and the interruption of  exports from Colombia due to repeated bombing of  the oil pipeline by  terrorists. Prices have been trading recently near the $20 per barrel level.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports increased slightly in  June. There were price increases in  most major import categories; the exceptions were imported prices of  computers and consumer goods. For the second quarter, non-oil import prices declined moderately, continuing a  downward trend that began in late 1995. Declines were recorded in  all major end-use categories, with the exception of imported food prices.

Prices of exports decreased slightly in  June, following slightly larger declines in  April and May. The decline was attributable to lower prices for agricultural products, and, to  a lesser degree, decreases in prices of computers and semiconductors. On  average in the second quarter, export prices decreased moderately. Prices of  agricultural products declined sharply. Prices of  nonagricultural exports were unchanged, on  balance, with decreases in computer and semiconductor prices offsetting price increases in other major trade categories.

Trade prices for July  will be  released on  August 19. U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign net purchases of  U.S. securities were very strong in  June and for the second quarter (line 4  of  the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).

U.S. agency bonds (approximately 1/3 of  line 4b) accounted for about one half of  the total; about $16 billion of  the  net private purchases of  Treasuries went directly to residents of  Japan. In addition to  the purchases of  U.S. government securities, foreign net purchases of  corporate bonds remained strong in  the second quarter, and  the revival of  foreign interest in  U.S. stocks continued (lines 4b and 4c). Net purchases of  U.S. stocks in  the second quarter were almost twice the total for the year 1996. Information on  Eurobond purchases in July indicates continued strong foreign interest in U.S. corporate bonds.

U.S. net private purchases of  foreign bonds were strong in June, although modest for the quarter as a  whole (line 5a). Considerable interest was shown in  Latin American bonds, most of  it coming in  June. U.S. investors continued moderate net purchases of foreign stocks, both in  June and for the quarter (line 5b); net purchases in  Japan accounted for the bulk of  the  total in  both June and the quarter as  a  whole.

Foreign official holdings in  the United States fell modestly in June and for second quarter (line 1). However, the net masked large changes in  the reserve holdings for several countries. Chinese holdings in the United States fell very sharply in  June --by  about 30  percent. It appears that China did not immediately liquidate these dollar holdings, but only transferred them outside the United States. By contrast, Mexican reserves increased strongly in  June, probably in  preparation for the planned prepayment in August of  notes backed by  oil revenues. Brazil, Russia, and Spain also had significant increases for  the second quarter. Preliminary information from the FRBNY for July indicates only modest changes.

Large outflows in  June from banks almost offset inflows during the rest of  the quarter, yielding a  small net inflow for the quarter (line 3). Monthly average data for July show continued outflows from U.S. banking offices to own foreign offices and IBFs (line 1  of the International Banking Data table).

Foreign Exchange Markets

The dollar has appreciated against most currencies since the first day of  the July FOMC meeting. The dollar's gains have come unevenly, with increases of  5-1/2 percent against the mark, 4-1/2 percent against sterling, and 1-1/2 percent against the yen. Among developing countries, the dollar has appreciated sharply against several Southeast Asian currencies although it  has depreciated 1-3/4 percent vis-a-vis the  Mexican peso. On  a  trade-weighted average against the currencies of 18 countries (using weights based on multilateral trade flows from 1992-1994) the dollar is  up  a  bit more than four percent.1

Continuing favorable economic developments in the United States appear to  have accounted for a  portion of  the dollar's appreciation over the intermeeting period. The July labor market report and other signs of strong growth and subdued price pressures have boosted the dollar. Late in  the period, the  dollar weakened with other U.S. asset prices on  talk of renewed inflation concerns, although the latest PPI and CPI releases appeared to allay these concerns.

Most noteworthy among developed countries has been the depreciation of  the mark and other continental European currencies against the dollar--a decline attributed to EMU-favorable developments and the absence of  official German action to curb the mark's fall. In  mid-July, the mark fell on  positive comments by German officials regarding French deficit-reduction proposals announced with the release of  an  audit of French government finances. Exchange market participants interpreted the continuation of  Bundesbank repo operations at  unchanged interest rates as evidence of  German officials' acceptance of  the  mark's depreciation. The  mark also weakened on  July's larger-than-expected increase in unemployment. The release of  the August Bundesbank report, which noted the risks to price stability presented by  recent currency developments, pushed the  mark up 1-3/4 percent against the dollar in the  middle of  this week.

Weighted Average Exchange Value of  the  Dollar

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Note. Change is  in  percentage points. P Preliminary.

Movements of  the yen against the  dollar have largely been attributed to two factors: prospects for the Japanese current account surplus and market perceptions of  weak Japanese economic performance. The dollar rose sharply against the yen immediately following comments by  Ministry of  Finance official Sakakibara that Japan has no  intention of  using the exchange rate as  a  trade policy tool. Suggestions of  flagging activity contained in  the quarterly report of  the Bank of  Japan and data releases for industrial production, retail sales, and domestic auto sales have also weighed on  the yen. Over the period, the Japanese 10-year interest rate has fallen 24  basis points.

Sterling has retreated from five-year and eight-year highs against the dollar and mark respectively on renewed concerns over the  prospects for British exports. Uneven GDP growth in  the second quarter that pointed to  a  slowing export sector initiated the decline in  sterling. Over the period, the Bank of  England's Monetary Policy Committee twice raised the repo rate 25 basis points. Following the second increase on  August 7, the committee noted the negative effect of  sterling's rise and suggested that exchange pressures should ease as interest rates have reached levels consistent with the inflation target. Since August 7, sterling has lost 1/4 percent of  its value against the dollar and 2-1/4 percent of  its value against the mark..

The dollar has appreciated against many Southeast Asian currencies which until recently were closely linked to  the dollar. After several episodes of  exchange rate pressure, the Thai baht was allowed to float on  July 2. The baht depreciated 18 percent initially and is  now down 28 percent against the dollar since the float. The  Philippines floated the peso on  July 11, with the peso depreciating 11 percent against the dollar since July 1. Indonesia widened and then abandoned the band on  its managed float and the rupiah has depreciated 14  percent. Finally, Malaysia has imposed capital controls and raised interest rates to counter pressures on the ringitt, which has fallen 10 percent over the period. Developments in  these countries are discussed in  Section IV. In contrast, the Mexican peso appreciated 1-3/4 percent against the dollar over the  past six weeks reflecting market satisfaction with an  election little tainted by  fraud.

The two interest  rate increases  in the United Kingdom over the intermeeting period have pushed up the three-month interest rate there more than  30 basis points. Three-month rates  in Belgium, the Netherlands, and  Sweden have increased a bit less in  response to domestic currency weakness. Interest rates  at the  10-year maturity have fallen in most countries, on average almost matching the  13 basis point decline of the 10-year  rate in the United  States. An exception is the  Canadian 10-year  rate, which has shed 34 basis points  as  the  federal budget moves  into  surplus. At the  same time, the Canadian dollar has  lost 3/4  percent of its value against the U.S.  dollar.

Over the intermeeting period,  gold prices have slipped more than  $6 per  ounce on balance, having partly recovered from the $10 per ounce decline in early July  following the announcement that the Reserve Bank of Australia had  sold  two-thirds of  its gold holdings in  the forward market over the first half of the year.

The Desk did  not intervene in the foreign  exchange market over the intermeeting period. Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Economic  activity in the major foreign industrial countries appears  to have continued to expand at a moderate pace in  recent months, with all  countries except  Japan registering  increases. Indicators  suggest that Canada and the United Kingdom grew at robust rates,  with falling unemployment, rising retail  sales,  and  strong business confidence. The German and French economies also  expanded, but consumption appears  to have been weak. In  Italy, second-quarter data point to  a pick-up in activity, following a first-quarter decline. The  Japanese economy, by contrast, has contracted in recent months,  due to the effects  of the April  1 hike  in the consumption tax.

Twelve-month increases  in consumer prices remained  below 2 percent  in all major  foreign industrial countries except the United Kingdom, where a rise  in  gasoline excise taxes pushed inflation (excluding mortgage interest) to 3 percent in July, a half percentage point above the government's inflation target.

Individual country notes. In  Japan, economic activity has weakened considerably, largely reflecting the effects of the April  1

increase in  the consumption tax from 3  to 5  percent. Household expenditure, retail sales, and new car registrations have all declined sharply in recent months, reversing increases recorded in the months before the tax hike, and  housing starts have declined for two consecutive quarters. Industrial production during the second quarter, however, was unchanged from its first-quarter level, as rapid export growth offset weak domestic demand. Machinery orders, an  important leading indicator, increased during the second quarter, suggesting rising investment expenditures in  coming months.

Unemployment reached 3.5 percent in  May and June, matching a record high set during the second quarter of 1996. Employment, however, continued to  register year-over-year increases, and labor force participation continued to rise. Inflationary pressures have remained subdued, despite a  jump in  the price level following the consumption tax increase.

Japan's current account and trade surpluses rose sharply during the second quarter. Import volumes declined, reflecting the weakness of  domestic demand, and export volumes surged as the lagged effects of  the yen's depreciation over the past two years strengthened the competitive position of  exporting firms. Notably,

Japanese vehicle exports increased over 30 percent from year-earlier levels.

Economic activity in  Germany continued to expand in the second quarter, with strong increases in industrial production and orders. Based on preliminary figures for June (which are anticipated to show a  significant upward revision) production rose 2-1/2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter from its level in the  first quarter. Real manufacturing orders surged, boosted by orders from both domestic and foreign firms. The IFO business climate survey, an indicator of  current and expected conditions in  industry, continued to improve, with the  index now  firmly in  the positive range. Conditions in  the labor market remain stagnant, however, with total unemployment above the 4.3 million (SA) level in  July and the  all-German unemployment rate at 11.5 percent. Consumer-price inflation for the year ending in  July rose to 1.9 percent, reflecting higher prices for medical drugs in  July due to  an increase in  the consumer's share of  medication costs.

On  July 11, the  German cabinet approved a  draft federal budget for 1998 and a 1997 supplemental budget. The supplemental 1997 budget involved no  new  measures to reduce Germany's general

government deficit to 3  percent of  GDP, the Maastricht Treaty's reference value. The supplemental budget is  necessary, however, because under Germany's constitution, the federal deficit may  not exceed government investment unless the higher deficit is necessary to correct an  economic imbalance. The supplemental budget thus declares that a  federal deficit of  DM71.2 billion (up  from DM53.3 in the draft budget approved last year) is required to combat the high level of  unemployment. The supplemental budget also authorizes additional privatization and the sale of government oil stocks in order to  reduce the federal deficit on  a  budget basis (but  not on  a national accounts basis, which is relevant for Maastricht compliance). Most analysts estimate that the deficit on  a Maastricht basis will be  about 3-1/4 percent of  GDP in 1997. The draft federal budget for 1998 pegs the deficit at DM57.8 billion and incorporates a  number of  new  tax initiatives, which are being reviewed in  a  separate legislative process. Following parliamentary debate and possible revision, the draft budget for 1998 is likely to be  approved in  early December.

In France, measured GDP in  the second quarter is expected to be  boosted by  favorable calendar effects and strong net exports. Recent indicators suggest, however, that domestic demand was relatively subdued. Continued firmness in  manufacturing output, largely reflecting robust foreign orders and a  strong bounce in energy production, underpinned the 2-1/2 percent increase in industrial production in  April-May over its first-quarter average. However, consumption of  manufactured products declined during the second quarter, due in  part to weakness in  car purchases. The unemployment rate edged up  in June, while consumer-price inflation remained subdued through July.

On  July 21, an  official audit of  France's public finances concluded that the 1997 trend deficit was on course to register between 3.5 and 3.7 percent of  GDP. The same day, the government

- 2. Percent change from  previous year.

announced a  series of  measures designed to contain the deficit to between 3.1 and 3.3 percent of GDP. Two-thirds of  the projected adjustment stems from a  temporary increase in  the rate of  corporate taxation (both the  basic rate and the rate applied to long-term capital gains). The remaining savings measures consist of  still unspecified spending cuts. Non-tax receipts are likely to  be enhanced by  contributions from profitable state-owned enterprises as well.

Economic activity in the  United Kingdom remained robust in  the second quarter, but the pace of  expansion continued to diverge across sectors. Real GDP increased 3.6 percent (SAAR), with service sector output estimated to  have increased 5.3 percent. Retail sales registered another quarter of strong growth, led  by  purchases of household goods. The unemployment rate has continued to fall, reaching 5.5 percent in  July, its lowest level in seven years. Manufacturing output was little changed during the second quarter, while industrial production as a  whole recorded a  moderate increase. After declining for several months, business confidence turned up in July, apparently reflecting increased optimism that domestic orders will offset weak export orders.

The twelve-month rate of  increase in  retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments jumped to 3  percent in  July, a  half percentage point above the government's target. Much of  the acceleration was due to higher gasoline excise taxes included in last month's budget. Although service-price inflation eased in July, it remained higher than goods-price inflation, which has benefitted from the strength of sterling. The underlying rate of increase in  average earnings declined somewhat in  May  to 4.3 percent and remained at  that level in  June. Nonetheless, the most recent rate is up from 3.75 percent a  year ago, reflecting the tighter labor market.

Chancellor of  the Exchequer Gordon Brown presented the Labour government's first budget on July 2. As promised, the cornerstone of  the budget was the announcement of  the "Welfare to Work" program financed by  a  windfall tax on  excess profits of  privatized utilities. The  budget deficit is  projected to  decline from 4 percent of GDP in  1996-97 to 1.5 percent in  the current fiscal year and 0.25 percent next year. In its quarterly Inflation Report released on  August 13, the Bank of  England projected a  likely slowing of  the expansion in  coming months due to recent monetary and fiscal tightening, as well as  to the appreciation of  sterling and

the unwinding of  windfall gains in  consumer income from building society conversions. The report concludes that the 100 basis point increase in  official rates since May  has left monetary policy in  a position "at which it should be  possible to  pause in  order to assess the  direction in  which the risks (to  inflation) are likely to materialize."

In  Italy, real GDP declined a  revised 0.7 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, largely reflecting a  drop in  net exports and  the fact that there were fewer working days than in  the previous quarter. On  the  positive side, household consumption increased, due to  tax incentives on  auto purchases, and business fixed investment rose modestly.

Inflation remains low. Consumer prices were up 1.6 percent for the year ending in July, a  slight increase from June due largely to statistical factors. Inflationary pressures are likely to  remain subdued given continued moderation in  producer prices, a  sizable output gap, and lagged effects of  lira appreciation.

Italian public sector balances are showing further signs of improvement. On  August 1, the government announced that the public sector deficit through the end of  July  was slightly under $17 billion equivalent. Although there is still uncertainty regarding fiscal performance during the remainder of 1997 (historically, about 40 percent of  total public expenditure is incurred during the last four months of  the year), the end-July balance is generally in  line with the three percent Maastricht budget deficit criterion.

The Canadian economy continued to expand strongly in  the second quarter. Real GDP at factor cost rose 0.3 percent (SAAR) in May after rising 0.9 percent in  April, bringing the average for the two months to a  level 1  percent above the first-quarter average. Employment gains boosted real disposable income, and consumer confidence and retail sales have been very strong. Business confidence reached a  new  high in the second quarter.

Preliminary indicators for the third quarter point to continued expansion. Employment, which rose substantially in  the second quarter, edged up  again in  July, while the unemployment rate

declined to 9  percent, the lowest since October 1990. The annual survey of  investment intentions reported an  11 percent expected increase in  firms' plant and equipment expenditures, which would be the biggest rise since 1993.

Consumer price inflation rose slightly in  June. Weakness in the Canadian dollar in  late June prompted the Bank of Canada to raise its Bank Rate by 1/4 percentage point to 3-1/2 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

In recent months, growth has generally remained strong in the major Latin American and Asian countries. Inflation rates in these countries have generally been stable or moderated further. Recent movements in  their external balance positions have been mixed, with incoming data tending to  show Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela moving toward deficit, while China and Korea move toward surplus.

There was intense exchange market pressure in  the ASEAN countries in July, resulting in de facto devaluations in  Thailand and  the Philippines, a  widening of  Indonesia's exchange rate band, and  downward pressures on  the currencies of  Malaysia and Singapore. These pressures spilled over, in  varying lesser degrees, to several other emerging market countries, including Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Venezuela.

Individual country notes. The turmoil in exchange markets in the five major ASEAN countries intensified in July. The central banks of Thailand and the Philippines announced they would permit greater market determination of  exchange rates; in  both cases, the announcements were followed by de  facto devaluations of  their currencies. Indonesia initially widened its exchange rate band from 8  percent to 12 percent, then allowed its currency to  float. The currencies of Malaysia and Singapore came under pressure. The currencies of  all five countries have depreciated over the past month, despite substantial increases in overnight interest rates in each of the countries.

Some of  these countries have sought technical assistance and financial help from international sources to  help overcome potential payments problems. The Philippines will be able to draw on $1.1 billion under an  extension of an IMF Extended Fund Facility. The Philippine authorities are also expected to reactivate a  financing arrangement with Japan's Export-Import Bank (JEXIM) for about $450 million. Thailand has been offered a  financial package of  $16 billion, including a  three-year IMF Stand-by Agreement totalling $4 billion, which is about five times Thailand's quota. JEXIM will provide $4  billion, and the remainder of  the financing comes from bilateral donors in  Asia, Australia, and multilateral agencies such as the World Bank and the  Asian Development Bank.

The announcement of  the financial support for Thailand came after its cabinet approved a  package of  measures, including actions to reform the  financial system. The overall framework of  the package is similar to  the one that the IMF had been working on  with the  Thai authorities, but all the  details of  the program have not been negotiated as yet. As part of  the reforms, the central bank and finance ministry announced the suspension of  operations of  42 finance companies, bringing the total suspended since June this year to 58. (There were previously 91 such companies.) The suspended companies are required to complete the process of  due diligence and submit a  rehabilitation plan within 60  days. Holders of  promissory notes and certificates of  deposit issued by  these companies can exchange them for those of  Krung Thai Bank, a  large commercial bank in  which the government has a  majority share. A  deposit insurance scheme is  being set up to  insure the liabilities of financial institutions "which can conduct their normal business." The Thai authorities stated that "the  Government will be  responsible for any financial obligations arising from this insurance undertaking." Other elements of  the plan to  restructure the financial sector include the setting up of  new  government agencies to rate the credit-worthiness of  Thai financial institutions in  an  attempt to separate healthy institutions from troubled ones. The setting up  of these agencies reduces the supervisory role of  the Bank of  Thailand.

On  the fiscal side, the plan endorses further cuts in  the government budget for fiscal year 1997/98 (starting October 1), an increase in  the VAT from the current 7  percent to 10 percent (effective August 16), an  increase in the excise tax on  luxury items, and reductions in subsidies to state enterprises. Other announced measures include a  government pledge not to let gross foreign reserves fall below $25 billion. Thailand will continue the managed float exchange rate regime introduced on July 2; the system of  capital controls imposed over the last several months will be removed. These steps are being taken with the stated goals of reducing the current account deficit to 5  percent of  GDP in  1997 and 3  percent in  1998 (compared with 8  percent in 1996), limiting the annual inflation rate to the 8  to 9  percent range, and achieving real GDP growth of  between 2  and 3  percent.

In Taiwan, growth has been strong while inflation rose only slightly in  the first seven months of 1997. Industrial production in  the second quarter continued the strength that started to become evident in  the second half of  last year. Consumer price inflation rose sharply in  July from the  rates of  earlier in  the year, reflecting poor weather that damaged crops, but remained relatively moderate on  a  year-over-year basis. Strong import growth contributed to a  narrowing of  Taiwan's trade surplus in the first seven months of  1997, compared with the comparable period last year. Exports rose 5  percent over this period, while imports increased 11 percent. Foreign-exchange reserves stood at $90 billion in  June, up less than $2  billion from the  beginning of 1997.

In the wake of  turmoil in  currency markets throughout Asia, Taiwan's exchange rate depreciated about 1  percent against the U.S. dollar in  the last week of  July ad the first week of  August. Taiwan's central bank has intervened actively in the currency market in  the past, but  has vowed not to  intervene now. Most analysts have not viewed the depreciation with alarm, seeing it as reflecting a reasonable market response to the weakness of  other Asian currencies.

Korean conglomerates ("chaebols") have continued to experience financial troubles. On  July 15, the  nation's eighth-largest chaebol, Kia Business Group, was placed under a  "bankruptcy protection pact" to prevent its imminent collapse. The creditors have decided to grant the troubled group a  two-month reprieve to repay its debts. This is the fifth chaebol to  experience financial problems this year. Citing the "deteriorating asset quality and heightening industry risks faced by  Korean banks" as a  result of the

financial difficulties of  the chaebols, Standard and Poor's has placed five banks on  credit watch, and S&amp;P has revised the Republic of  Korea's sovereign long-term rating outlook to  negative from stable. There has been some pressure on  the won in  the wake of  the currency crises in  ASEAN countries and the problems in the financial sector.

Korea's current account deficit narrowed sharply in  the second quarter. The trade balance posted a  surplus in June, the first since December 1995. Industrial production grew at a  robust rate in the second quarter. Inflation remained moderate in  July.

In China, growth in  the first half of the year remained steady, inflation continued to  moderate, and the trade surplus continued to  grow. In  the first half of  this year, the value of exports rose 26 percent from the year-earlier period, while the value of  imports was unchanged. International reserves have risen steadily over this period. In the first half of  1997, reserves rose $16 billion to $123 billion, the second highest in  the world after Japan.

<!-- missing-text -->

In Mexico, data on  industrial production and retail sales continued to  show strength, with domestic demand emerging as the driving force in  economic growth. Industrial production rose strongly in  May, confirming the rapid pace of growth shown in  the March-April period. Retail sales, which had shown negative year-onyear growth as recently as the first quarter, gained 6.6 percent in May  versus the same month in  the previous year. The trade surplus remained narrowly positive in  May and June. Monthly consumer price inflation remained just below 1  percent in  July, moderated by  the continued stability of  the peso and seasonal factors that usually suppress inflation in the summer.

As expected, the July 6  midterm elections resulted in  an historic loss of  majority for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in  the lower house of  Congress. The  main immediate impact of  the opposition's congressional gains will be  seen in legislative consideration of  the government budget this fall, with both opposition parties calling for a  reduction in  the value-added tax, while the PRI wants to  maintain a  nearly balanced fiscal position.

<!-- missing-text -->

On  July 30, citing the continued real appreciation of  the peso and the  possibility that this could reduce the attractiveness of investment in  the traded goods sector, the Mexican Exchange Commission announced an  increase in  the amount of  dollar put options auctioned at the end of  each month from $300 million to $500 million. As  before, if  at least 80 percent of  dollar put options

are exercised in  the first half of  a  month, there will be  another auction of  dollar put options, and that amount was also raised from $300 million to $500 million. If  all options are exercised, the Bank of  Mexico would acquire another $1  billion each month. In the first year of  the dollar put options program, which began in  August 1996, the Bank of  Mexico has acquired $3.26 billion in  reserves through the program.

In Argentina, growth in  economic activity continues to be strong. Industrial production in  the second quarter and real GDP in the first quarter both registered substantial year-over-year gains. Despite high growth, inflation has remained subdued, likely the result of  the economy still operating at less than full-employment.

The recovery has increased job creation and is finally beginning to  alleviate Argentina's stubbornly high unemployment rate. Bringing unemployment down further is  probably the  biggest economic challenge facing the government, but reaching an  agreement on  labor reform has thus far proved difficult. After failing to get labor reform legislation approved by  the Congress or implemented through executive decrees (which the court rejected),

President Menem, in late May, negotiated a  watered-down agreement with major unions. However, this agreement has been rejected by business leaders and some break-away unions. Polls indicate that Argentines regard joblessness as the  main problem facing the country, and this could hurt the government in  the upcoming congressional elections in  October.

Strong economic growth has raised imports, but, until recently, export growth, driven in  part by strong Brazilian demand, had been an  offsetting force. However, the current account moved from a  deficit of  $1.4 billion in  the first quarter of 1996 to a deficit of  $2.4 billion in the first quarter of  this year. Also, over the first half of  this year, the trade balance was roughly in balance, compared with a  surplus of $1.4 billion in the same period a  year ago. International reserves remain high, at around $19 billion (excluding gold) at  the end of  July, roughly 30 percent higher than a  year ago.

In Brazil, July 1  marked the third anniversary of  Brazil's stabilization program, the  Plano Real. Under the plan, inflation has fallen dramatically. Consumer prices in July  were only 4.9 percent above a  year earlier, which is a  marked contrast from the 2,000 percent inflation experienced in 1994. Economic activity, on the other hand, has been very uneven in recent months. After negative real GDP growth in  the first quarter, industrial output rose sharply in  April, declined in  May, and grew strongly in  June. The difficulty of  gauging economic activity in  recent months stems in  part from residual seasonal effects in  the  April data (because the Easter holiday fell in  March this  year). Industrial and retail sales figures show similar seesaw patterns. On  the whole, however, activity was stronger in  the second quarter than in  the first.

Brazil's external balance has continued to deteriorate. The trade deficit through the first seven months of  this year was already as large as it  was for 1996 as a  whole. The widening trade deficit plus higher interest payments has led  to  a  growing current account deficit, which reached 4.3 percent of GDP in  the first seven months of 1997. The deterioration in the external balance plus the fallout from the devaluation of  the Thai baht in  early July have led to a  rise in  Brazilian domestic interest rates. One-month CD rates have risen by about 2  percentage points since early July; most of this increase reflects investors' perceptions of  an  increased risk of  devaluation. Brazilian stock prices plunged by nearly 20  percent in early July but  have since recovered about half of  that decline. (The real/dollar exchange rate has depreciated only very slightly in recent weeks.) In late July, the Brazilian government also removed a  tariff exemption on 3,700 capital goods imports that had been

granted when trade liberalization began in 1990, making them subject to tariffs of  up  to 17 percent.

High domestic interest rates plus other factors have helped keep net capital inflows strongly positive. There have been some recent privatizations by  the federal and state governments. In early July, the federal government awarded the rights to  operate cellular phone services in  the Sao Paulo metropolitan region (the largest market in  Latin America) to  a  consortium led by  Bell South

for $2.6 billion. In late July, the state of  Bahia sold Coelba, an electrical utility, for $1.6 billion to a  Spanish firm. Aside from these developments, indications are  that firms in  the financial and nonfinancial sectors have been issuing a  sizeable amount of  bonds abroad. Central bank reserves stood at $60 billion at the  end of July, up  slightly from the end of  May.

On  July 29, Central Bank President Gustavo Loyola announced that he  will resign. President Cardoso nominated Gustavo Franco, head of  the International Affairs Department of  the Central Bank of Brazil, to  be the new central bank chief, and the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed Franco, despite concerns that were raised over the central bank's policy of  maintaining very high nominal (and real) interest rates. One-month CD rates have recently been about 20 percent, and some consumer credit rates have been recently as high as 80  percent. Franco has been an outspoken advocate of Brazil's fixed exchange rate policy and of  maintaining a  tight monetary policy.

In Venezuela, indicators of  aggregate demand continue to  point to a  pick-up in  economic activity. According to the  Minister of Trade and Industry, economic growth over the first half of  the year was around 1.5 percent. The twelve-month consumer price inflation rate in  July was around 40 percent. The pick-up in economic activity has been reflected in  increased imports, and the non-oil trade balance deficit was $2.5 billion in  the period from January through May  this year, compared with a  deficit of  $1.7 billion over the same period last year. Including oil, the trade balance over the  period from January through April showed a  surplus of  $11 billion.

<!-- missing-text -->

Largely as a  result of  increased expenditures by the government and the government-controlled state oil company, Venezuela's money markets are currently suffering from excess liquidity. In an  effort to  mop up the excess liquidity, the central bank has increased reserve requirements on  commercial banks twice in the last month and has tightened restrictions on  inter-bank currency trading.

The increase in  liquidity and the perception by  market participants that the  Venezuelan currency is overvalued have put downward pressure on  the  bolivar. The  bolivar depreciated 2  percent in  July, compared with a  depreciation of  just 2.5 percent over the entire first half of  the year. However, it  is still within the bands set by  the government, which slide over time in  line with the government's inflation target. Apparently as a  signal to the market that it intends to  continue its strong bolivar policy, the government, on  August 8, lowered its monthly depreciation rate on the foreign exchange bands to 1.16 percent from 1.32 percent. In

the short run, the government has adequate international reserves to maintain the  value of  the bolivar; reserves (excluding gold) at the end of July stood at $13.2 billion, unchanged from a  month ago, but roughly 60  percent higher than a  year ago.

In  Russia, recent data continue to present a  relatively favorable picture. After years of  decline, output and industrial production have stabilized so far this year. Official figures show real GDP in  the first half of  the year only slightly below the level in  the corresponding period last year. Inflation has stabilized in recent months, after declining earlier in  the year. In  June, the year-over-year consumer price inflation rate was 14.5 percent. The ruble-dollar exchange rate has remained well within the corridor set by  the central bank. In  an  attempt to  indicate confidence that financial conditions will remain stable, the government has announced its intention to redenominate the ruble at the beginning of  next year, with 1,000 old rubles equaling one new ruble.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent developments in  the fiscal situation have been mixed. On  the positive side, the government met its promise to  pay all pension arrears (worth $2-1/2 billion) by  the  beginning of  July, and total tax revenues in the first half of 1997 were up 50 percent from last year. On  the negative side, tax revenues in  the first half remained more than 10 percent below target, and substantial arrears remained in  many other areas (including tax  payments by  businesses and wages to local government workers).
