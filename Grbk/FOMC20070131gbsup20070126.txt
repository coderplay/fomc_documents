The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales of New and Existing Homes

The data on sales of new and existing homes in December provide further evidence that housing demand is stabilizing.  Sales of new homes climbed 4¾ percent in December to an annual rate of 1.12 million units following an upward-revised increase of 7½ percent in November.  Much of December's increase was concentrated in the Midwest and may have been related to the unusually warm temperatures in that region in December.  Total existing home sales ticked down ¾ percent in December to an annual rate of 6.2 million units.  Sales of single-family homes slipped 1¼ percent to an annual rate of 5.4 million units, but remained within the fairly narrow range of readings seen since mid-summer. Sales of existing condos and co-ops were up 2 percent relative to their November reading.

The stock of new homes for sale ticked down for the fifth consecutive month in December after having peaked in July.  Even so, these inventories amounted to 5¾ months' supply at December's higher sales pace, about 20 percent above the upper bound of the relatively tight range that this variable occupied between 1997 and 2005. 1 In the market for existing homes, the stock of single-family existing homes for sale ticked down in December and represented seven months' supply at December's sales pace-in line with the elevated readings seen throughout the second half of last year.

The average sales prices of both new and existing homes were unchanged in December relative to their levels twelve months earlier.  On a constant-quality basis, new home prices in the fourth quarter were 3½ percent higher than their level four quarters earlier, down from the 6½ percent appreciation posted in the preceding four-quarter period. The most recent reading of the purchase-only version of the OFHEO price index, which partially controls for changes in the structural characteristics and amenities of homes sold, was up 6 percent in the third quarter relative to its level four quarters earlier.

Manufacturers' Shipments and Orders

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined 0.3 percent in December while new orders rose 2.4 percent, partially retracing the declines registered in

October and November.  For the fourth quarter as a whole, both shipments and orders declined significantly after having posted solid gains in the previous quarters.

The weakness in shipments last month was centered in the nondefense communications equipment category, in which shipments plunged 10.5 percent.  However, this category is quite volatile, and the accompanying surge in new orders of more than 15 percent is encouraging.  Orders and shipments of computer equipment revised up significantly in November, and shipments increased 1.3 percent in December, slightly offsetting the weak news on communications equipment.  Outside of high-tech and transportation, shipments rebounded moderately from their November drop.  Overall, the sluggishness in this category appears to have become fairly widespread.

The three-month moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders stayed in negative territory for the third month in a row.  This series-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-has historically had some predictive power for industrial production.
