Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Economic activity appears to have decelerated considerably this quarter.  The labor market deteriorated further in July and August, as private payrolls declined and the unemployment rate moved sharply higher.  In addition, industrial output likely fell steeply in August, in part because of large cutbacks in motor vehicle assemblies and in energy output.  On the spending side, consumer spending appears to be weakening under the ongoing pressures from declining household wealth, sluggish real wages, tight credit conditions, and dismal sentiment.  Meanwhile, residential investment has continued to move down at a pace similar to that seen in recent months.  In contrast, business investment in equipment (other than motor vehicles) and structures appears to have held up early this quarter.  Consumer price inflation has moved up significantly in recent months.  However, some of the pressures driving up inflation seem to be easing.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market has continued to deteriorate.  According to the August employment report, private payroll employment fell 101,000 last month, a slightly larger decline than the average pace seen from January to July of this year.  Most major industry groups shed jobs last month; manufacturing posted a particularly noticeable loss of 61,000. Employment also fell by 37,000 in the related temporary help services industry.  In contrast, job losses in the construction industry diminished over the past two months despite the ongoing contraction in residential investment.  Nonbusiness services, which include the education and health industries, and natural resources and mining showed increases in line with those of recent months.  With the average workweek of production and nonsupervisory workers holding steady, aggregate hours have edged lower, and in August they stood 1.5 percent at an annual rate below the second-quarter average.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate jumped 0.4 percentage point, to 6.1 percent, last month.  Both adult men and adult women experienced large increases in their unemployment rates, while the unemployment rate of teens retraced only a small portion of its steep increase between April and July.  We think that part of the rise in the overall unemployment rate in August was due to the emergency unemployment benefits that went into effect in July.   However, the remainder seems indicative of a further 1 increase in labor market slack.  Another measure of slack, the fraction of workers who

are working part time for economic reasons, also continued to rise in August. Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate held steady at 66.1 percent.

Initial claims for unemployment insurance under regular state programs have moved considerably higher since the July/August Greenbook.  We think that the level of these claims has also been boosted by the emergency unemployment compensation program, as it was the last time such a program was in place, in 2002, because some individuals who apply for extended benefits turn out to be eligible for regular benefits (for which they must file a claim).  However, claims have remained elevated for longer this time than in 2002, an indication that the labor market may have weakened further over the past month.

Most other labor market indicators also suggest a further weakening of the labor market. With regard to separations, the short-term job losers rate has changed little on balance in recent months, but the layoffs and discharges rate, as measured by the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), edged up further in July.  In addition, announcements of downsizing plans compiled by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., remained at a high level in August.

With regard to hiring, both the JOLTS hiring rate and the JOLTS job openings rate have continued their downward trajectories.  Perceptions of job availability in the Conference Board survey edged down further in August, while the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) measure of hard-to-fill positions remained at a very low level last month.  The outlook for hiring remains gloomy.  According to the Manpower survey, firms have lowered their fourth-quarter net hiring plans appreciably.  And while hiring plans in the NFIB survey ticked up in August, the three-month moving average stands close to its nadir in the last recession.

According to both the Reuters/University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys, household expectations of future labor market conditions have improved a bit from their very low mid-summer levels.  Even so, these expectations remain at lower levels than at any time since the early 1990s.

With real GDP reported to have posted a sizable increase even as hours were declining, the staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 4½ percent last quarter after having increased at a rate of 2½ percent in the first quarter.   Over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of this year, productivity 2

rose 3½ percent.  In the nonfinancial corporate sector, the gain in productivity over the past year was somewhat smaller, at 2¼ percent.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) is on track to post another decline in the third quarter after having fallen at an annual rate of more than 3 percent in the second quarter.  Output in July edged up 0.2 percent, but the production indicators for August suggest that IP fell sharply last month.  In particular, aggregate hours of production workers in manufacturing declined 1.1 percent, and the available weekly production data, which cover about one-quarter of IP, point to a plunge in motor vehicle assemblies and declines in the output of refined petroleum products and electricity generation.  The factory operating rate in July, at 77.7 percent, was 2 percentage points below its 1972-2007 average and 2½ percentage points below its recent peak in July 2007; most major industry groups are operating at below-average rates. 3

Motor vehicle assemblies fell more than 1½ million units in August to an annual rate of 8.2 million units.  The drop in production reflects a decision by the automakers to scale back their production plans following the plunge in July vehicle sales.  At a 9 million unit pace, third-quarter schedules are now 1¾ million units below the level of assemblies in

Days' Supply of Light Vehicles

2007 and only a little above the second-quarter pace, when strikes severely curtailed production at General Motors.  Preliminary schedules for the fourth quarter are for production to remain at about this low level.

Although the number of new vehicles in inventory has not been particularly elevated by historical standards, days' supply reached an uncomfortably high level of 88 days at the end of July, due to the plunge in sales that month.  However, the cut in assemblies, combined with a recovery in the pace of sales, caused days' supply to drop back to 71 days in August, a level much closer to the automakers' target of 65 days.  The excess stocks that remain are concentrated in light trucks, where days' supply had jumped to an extremely bloated 115 days in July before dropping back to 80 days in August; days' supply of autos stood at a relatively lean 61 days last month.

Elsewhere in transportation, the production of aircraft and parts has jumped during the past few months.  As of August, Boeing had about 3,700 unfilled orders and was producing about 40 planes per month; Boeing's backlog, all else being equal, would support production for quite some time.  However, Boeing's machinists went on strike last week, which idled most domestic capacity for commercial aircraft assembly. Prospects for resolution of the strike are uncertain, but if the strike were to last one month, we estimate that it would take down manufacturing IP by roughly ½ percentage point in September and a small effect on October as well-similar to the experience with the previous strike in 2005.

Following a sizable gain in the second half of last year, the output of high-tech equipment decelerated to a modest annual growth rate of about 17 percent in both the first and second quarters of this year.  Computer production decelerated noticeably in the second quarter after having been boosted by strong server sales in the first quarter.  Reports from computer manufacturers are mixed, but, on balance, they indicate that foreign demand has been robust and domestic demand has been soft.  Looking ahead, International Data Corporation's projection for computer sales suggests that production is likely to increase moderately in the third quarter; however, the mixed tone of recent statements from manufacturers suggests a fair bit of uncertainty.  Production of communications equipment stepped up in the second quarter, consistent with a strong increase in revenue at Cisco.  However, capital spending guidance for telecommunications service providers (TSPs) suggests little impetus to third-quarter production. 4

The weaker demand from computer and communications equipment manufacturers contributed to a deceleration in semiconductor production in the first half of this year, after a considerable increase in the second half of last year.  For the third quarter, production gains will likely remain relatively subdued; for example, a major manufacturer reported that it is not seeing the usual seasonal boost to orders in advance of the holiday season.  In addition, although inventory-sales ratios for semiconductors do not appear excessive, they seem to be creeping up at contract electronics companies and at wholesale chip companies, and some recent reports have cited excess inventories of DRAM (dynamic random-access memory) and flash memories.

Elevated energy prices continue to spur drilling for oil and natural gas.  Output in this industry increased at an annual rate of 5½ percent so far this year.  Hurricane Gustav, which passed through the center of the Gulf of Mexico at the end of August, led to the evacuation of most oil and natural gas extraction platforms and rigs in the region as well as to the precautionary closure of some oil refineries.  These actions appear to have reduced the August change in IP by less than 0.1 percentage point but will have a more noticeable effect in September as the production stoppages extended well into the month. 5

Output excluding the production of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech equipment was little changed for a third month in July.  The output of consumer goods slipped further, continuing a trend that started in the fourth quarter of 2007.  The production of business equipment rose about ½ percent in July after having edged up, on net, over the previous two months, but much of the increase is attributable to a rebound in the volatile farm machinery category.  Elsewhere, the production of construction supplies has changed little, on net, over the past several months, as increases in the output of supplies more likely to be associated with nonresidential construction have provided some offset to further sharp declines in the production of supplies typically tied to residential construction.  The output of business supplies has continued to trend down, with notable negative contributions from printing and publishing.  Lastly, the output of materials to be further processed in the industrial sector was little changed in July.

Near-term indicators of production suggest that the industrial sector is likely to remain soft over the next few months, though output growth will undoubtedly be boosted at some point by a strike-related rebound in production at Boeing and the return to production of energy facilities in the Gulf of Mexico.  The new orders diffusion indexes

from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the various regional surveys have generally remained below 50.  While the three-month moving average of real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude industries for which reported orders have little information content for predicting shipments) has edged up a bit in recent months, it remains consistent with weak IP.  In addition, foreign demand, which has helped support IP for much of the past year, shows signs of slowing.  For example, a trade-weighted average of the industrial production indexes for some of the United States' major trading partners has been falling since late last year.

Motor Vehicle Sales

Demand for light vehicles improved last month but remained at a relatively low level. After having plunged to an annual rate of just 12.5 million units in July, light vehicle sales rebounded to 13.7 million units in August, about the same pace as in June.

.  The August increase in light vehicle sales likely reflected, in part, an expansion of customer incentive programs by the automakers.  In particular, sales at General Motors surged more than 800,000 units (annual rate), and the company cited a strong response to its 'EmployeeDiscount-For-Everyone' program.   More generally, the availability of cash rebates and 6 cut-rate financing has risen sharply in the past few weeks.  In addition, while concerns over gasoline prices remain high, they appear to have subsided a little as prices have eased; the percentage of respondents to the Reuters/Michigan survey who cited high gasoline prices or gasoline shortages as reasons for their negative view of car-buying conditions moved down somewhat in August, and demand shifted back towards trucks and away from autos last month.

Besides high gasoline prices and weak macroeconomic fundamentals, a number of other forces appear to be weighing on the demand for light vehicles.  In particular, lower tradein values for light trucks have reduced the cash that many consumers expected to have on hand to apply toward the purchase of new vehicles.  The lower trade-in values have also prompted several automakers to pull back from leasing, which typically has accounted for about 20 percent of sales, because their lending arms are accruing large losses when consumers return leased vehicles that have fallen out of favor, such as large SUVs. 7 Finally, consumers also face tighter credit conditions for more traditional financingboth from captive auto finance companies, such as GMAC, and from banks.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending has weakened noticeably in recent months against the backdrop of a deteriorating labor market, higher food and energy prices, lower equity and housing wealth, and depressed sentiment.  Moreover, the temporary boost to spending growth from the tax rebates seems to be waning.  Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) declined 0.4 percent in July after having edged lower in June, as a result of a precipitous drop in motor vehicle outlays and a substantial decline in spending on other goods in those two months.  The recent weakness in consumer spending on goods excluding motor vehicles contrasts sharply with surprisingly solid growth in the spring.  Meanwhile, outlays for services (excluding the volatile energy components) were reported to have increased modestly in June and July. 8

The weakness in real consumer spending reflects the challenging conditions that households currently face.  In the second quarter, lower equity prices and the ongoing declines in house prices pushed the ratio of wealth to income down for a third consecutive quarter to about its level in early 2004.  Subdued gains in wages and salaries, combined with sharply higher food and energy prices, have also restrained the purchasing power of households.  Excluding the temporary boost of roughly $90 billion (current dollars not at an annual rate) in tax rebates disbursed from May through July, real disposable income fell at an annual rate of ¾ percent last quarter and continued to move lower in July.  Consumer sentiment remains depressed, although readings from both the Reuters/Michigan and Conference Board surveys improved modestly in July and August. In spite of an apparent tightening of lending standards, credit card balances continued to increase at a solid pace in July as households likely borrowed to support their spending.

Housing

Residential construction activity continued to decline steeply through mid-year.  In July, single-family housing starts fell to an annual rate of 641,000 units, while adjusted permit issuance-a useful month-ahead indicator of starts-slid to an annual rate of 593,000 units.  At an annual rate of decline of 22 percent, the contraction in single-family starts over the three months ending in July was similar to the rate of decline earlier in the year. In the multifamily sector, starts fell to 324,000 units in July, mostly reversing the previous month's outsized gain.  June's spike in multifamily starts can be traced to more-

Home sales have moved sideways in recent months at very weak levels.  The Census Bureau's measure of sales agreements for new homes-at 515,000 units in July-has changed little in recent months, but is down 35 percent from a year ago.  Sales of existing single-family homes have been relatively flat since the end of last year, and recent readings of the pending home sales index suggest that sales will remain at a low level in the near term. 9

Recent cutbacks in new residential construction have further reduced the level of newhome inventories, and the flat pace of sales in recent months has allowed these inventory reductions to finally start to bring down the months' supply of new homes for sale.  Even so, the months' supply of new homes for sale remains extremely elevated at more than double the level that prevailed prior to the downturn in the housing market.

Tight conditions in mortgage credit markets over the summer continued to restrain housing demand.  The deterioration has been especially acute for mortgages that cannot be purchased by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs); securitization of such loans has virtually halted, and lending spreads remain very wide.  Conforming mortgage markets had also tightened over the summer.  As of last week, the average rate for a standard 30-year fixed-rate conforming mortgage had risen about 30 basis points since May to 6.4 percent; however, rates at some lenders have reportedly retraced most of this increase in the past few days in response to the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.  Non-price lending terms also tightened considerably over the summer as the GSEs' tighter lending standards made conforming mortgages more difficult to obtain. Moreover, down-payment requirements have become more binding for many potential borrowers (notwithstanding the first-time homebuyer tax credit described in the footnote above) because primary mortgage insurers have tightened standards and are charging higher fees, and because fewer lenders are willing to extend second mortgages that would allow borrowers to sidestep these requirements.

Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased 4.8 percent over the 12 months ending in June. By comparison, the national S&amp;P/Case-Shiller repeat-sales price index-which, unlike the OFHEO index, includes houses financed by nonconforming loans-fell about 15 percent over the past year.  As for new homes, the constant-quality price indexwhich attempts to control for changes in the quality and geographic composition of new homes sold-was down 3½ percent in the second quarter relative to its level a year earlier.  Although these lower prices may be starting to bolster sales, survey evidence and anecdotal reports suggest that expectations of further house price declines remain quite prevalent, a consideration that may make potential buyers reluctant to purchase homes until prices show signs of stabilizing.

Equipment and Software

We estimate that investment in equipment and software (E&amp;S) fell at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the second quarter, largely because of a sharp drop in business spending on motor vehicles.  In contrast, growth of real outlays for nontransportation E&amp;S held up reasonably well last quarter.  More recently, nominal orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose substantially in July, although some of the gain in nominal shipments reflected unusually large price increases.  Moreover, as in previous months, July orders and shipments may have reflected increased foreign demand.  Thus, the nominal shipments data likely overstates the true strength of domestic investment demand.

Along those lines, the fundamental determinants of E&amp;S investment appear consistent with weak domestic demand.  Although business output growth has not decelerated substantially over recent quarters, other determinants of business spending suggest gloomier prospects.  The user cost of capital has been rising, as corporate bond yields have edged up this year, despite declining Treasury yields, and capital goods prices have accelerated.  In addition, corporate profits have weakened, and cash flow moved down again last quarter.  And although monthly readings of business conditions-both national and regional-have edged up over the past few months, they remain downbeat for the most part.

Business outlays on transportation equipment fell sharply in the second quarter as business purchases of light trucks tanked.  Spending on light motor vehicles appears to have declined again this quarter, a result of automakers aggressively scaling back deliveries to daily rental companies in August; demand from other businesses remained sluggish as well.  Moreover, sales of medium and heavy trucks fell back a good bit in July from the already-subdued rate observed in recent months.  The pace of new orders

for these trucks also slumped in July, an indication that sales are unlikely to improve in the near term.  Domestic aircraft investment stepped up in the second quarter, but the Boeing machinists' strike, as mentioned above, seems likely to cause a drop in deliveries this quarter.

Spending on high-tech E&amp;S posted a moderate gain in the second quarter, as robust gains in investment in communications equipment were balanced by tepid growth of spending on computers.  In the current quarter, the lukewarm 2008 guidance from TSPs (as noted earlier), along with the decline of computer orders and shipments in July, suggests weaker spending may be in store.

Nominal orders and shipments of equipment other than high-tech and transportation jumped in July.  Although July's data partly reflected a large rise in prices and perhaps another increase in foreign demand, these factors are probably not large enough to explain the entire nominal increase. 10 Furthermore, orders outpaced shipments by a considerable margin in June and July.  July's increase in orders was relatively broad based, with particular strength seen in orders for measuring and controlling devices, heating and ventilation equipment, industrial machinery, and construction machinery.

Nonresidential Construction

Real nonresidential investment (other than drilling and mining) increased at a robust rate in the second quarter.  However, nominal expenditures declined in July, and market fundamentals and forward-looking indicators remain downbeat.  Vacancy rates in the office and industrial sectors moved higher in the first half of the year after several years of declines, and vacancy rates for retail space continued on an upward trajectory.  In the resale market, sales of existing commercial properties have plunged so far this year from 2007's record pace, and prices seem to be softening.  On the financing side, issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities has fallen dramatically this year, corporate bond spreads remain wide, and the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices reported a dramatic tightening of standards for commercial real estate loans over the first half of this year.  Meanwhile, construction costs are also surging:  The producer price index for materials and components of construction rose at an annual rate of 23 percent over the three months ending in July, and anecdotes from general contractors suggest that price increases for key construction inputs (like asphalt, steel, and plastic materials) are squeezing profit margins.  These developments appear to be depressing plans for new projects.  Indeed, the three-month average of the architectural

billings index has registered a string of weak readings that are suggestive of outright declines in nonresidential building outlays in the second half of this year.

Supported by rising energy prices, investment in drilling and mining structures increased at an annual rate of nearly 25 percent in the first half of the year.  Recent readings for footage drilled and the number of drilling rigs in operation suggest that investment continued its upward climb in July and August.

Business Inventories

Firms drew down their inventories at a rapid pace in the second quarter, and book-value data for the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors suggest that inventories declined further in July.  The indicators we track are not sending a clear signal regarding whether firms are holding excess inventories.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales (excluding motor vehicles) continued to trend down through June.  However, information from the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that months' supply excluding motor vehicles and parts remains elevated, particularly in areas such as construction supplies, business equipment, and, to a lesser degree, consumer goods.  Anecdotal reports of inventory imbalances have been limited to light trucks and some categories of semiconductors.  Meanwhile, purchasing managers reported that their customers' inventories were high in August, as the ISM's customers' inventories index came back up to about the elevated value it had attained in June.

Federal Government Sector

The deficit in the unified federal budget continued to widen in July as outlays surged, the last major wave of stimulus rebates was sent out, and tax receipts were about flat. 11 Adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, the unified budget deficit in July was $33 billion larger than the adjusted deficit in July of last year, with the stimulus rebates accounting for almost half the erosion. 12 The Congressional Budget Office, in its updated budget outlook released on September 9, anticipates an unadjusted

deficit for fiscal year 2008 of $407 billion and projects the deficit to widen to $438 billion in fiscal 2009, both about 3 percent of nominal GDP.

Federal outlays in July, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, were 10 percent above last July's level.  Nominal defense spending increased almost 18 percent from its year-earlier level and is consistent with a robust increase in real defense purchases this quarter as measured in the national income and product accounts. Transfer payments in July moved up briskly relative to a year earlier; they were boosted by outsized increases in outlays for Medicare and Medicaid and also by the portion of the stimulus rebates sent to households with little or no tax liability (such rebates are counted as transfer payments in the budget). 13

Excluding the effects of the stimulus rebates, tax receipts in July were about unchanged from their year-earlier level and increased only 2 percent in the 12 months ending in July relative to the comparable period a year earlier.  The slowdown in the inflow of federal tax receipts has been most pronounced in corporate taxes, probably because of the decline in corporate profits over the past year.  Net corporate receipts over the 12 months ending in July were 14 percent below their level in the year-earlier period.  Individual income and payroll taxes, excluding the stimulus rebates, posted a gain of only 4 percent, an increase likely consistent with the slowing pace of personal income.

The Congress has been slow to work on the annual appropriations bills necessary to fund discretionary federal spending programs in fiscal 2009, which begins on October 1.  So far, the House has passed only one of the 12 appropriations bills, and the Senate has passed none.  A continuing resolution will be needed to fund agencies covered by appropriations bills that have not been enacted by the start of the new fiscal year.

The placing of the GSEs Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship will likely lead to additional budgetary costs through purchases by the Treasury of the equity or mortgage-backed securities of the GSEs, which would be counted as outlays in the unified budget.  The Treasury reports that it will begin purchasing new GSE mortgagebacked securities in September.  The Treasury also has agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase up to $100 billion in senior preferred stock from each GSE in order to help keep each enterprise's assets greater than its liabilities.  At this time, however, the magnitude of these costs is highly uncertain.

State and Local Government Sector

The incoming indicators point to a modest rate of increase in real state and local spending in recent months after taking account of both the latest data and the substantial revisions to earlier figures for employment (downward) and construction (upward).  According to the latest labor market report, state and local employment rose 18,000 in August, the same as the average gain recorded so far this year. 14 Meanwhile, real construction expenditures now seem to have rebounded sharply in the second quarter after a steep drop earlier in the year.  In July, nominal construction spending rose to a level 1¾ percent (not at an annual rate) above its second-quarter average; this gain reflected sizable increases in all major categories but highways and set the stage for a further rise in real construction spending in the third quarter.

On the whole, state and local revenue flows have been reasonably subdued of late, although the available data point to a noticeable-though likely transitory-pickup in receipts growth in the second quarter.  Drawing on information from 45 states, the Rockefeller Institute of Government estimates that state tax revenues increased 5 percent on a year-over-year basis in the second quarter after having posted increases in the neighborhood of just 2 percent in the preceding two quarters. 15 Personal income taxes rose 8 percent-an increase that appears to have been boosted by a solid rise in final payments of previous-year tax liabilities and thus is unlikely to be repeated in coming quarters.  As for the other major categories, collections of sales and corporate taxes both declined over the year ending in the second quarter, while other revenues rose sharply, especially in energy-producing states like Texas and Alaska.

Prices

Headline consumer prices rose rapidly for a third consecutive month in July.  Driven by further large increases in food and energy prices, overall PCE prices rose 0.6 percent in July, thereby bringing the 12-month change to 4.5 percent, 2¼ percentage points higher than the year-earlier increase.  After some surprisingly low increases in the spring, core PCE prices saw larger increases in June and July, which likely reflected, in part, further cost pressures and higher import prices.  Indeed, prices for goods at intermediate stages of production continued to rise rapidly through July.  Nevertheless, some cost pressures

may be weakening:  The dollar has strengthened, and spot commodity prices for crude oil, natural gas, and other industrial raw materials have declined recently.

Consumer energy prices rose another 4 percent (not at an annual rate) in July after similarly large gains in May and June.  This recent string of increases in energy prices pushed up the 12-month change through July to 30 percent.  Recent declines in crude oil prices have eased the pressure on gasoline margins, which had been abnormally tight for some time, and are now leading to lower prices at the pump.  Indeed, survey data suggest that retail gasoline prices decreased considerably in August and early September.  Spot prices for natural gas have also moved down recently as inventories (seasonally adjusted) have remained ample.

Consumer food prices rose 1 percent in July, an even larger increase than the already elevated readings seen in recent months.  The 12-month change through July now stands at 5.7 percent, much higher than the 3.9 percent increase recorded over the preceding 12 months.  Although prices for almost all food commodities are substantially above their levels from a year ago, these prices have stepped down, on balance, since the July/August Greenbook (cattle is one notable exception).  However, prices for food away from home have accelerated in the past few months; these prices tend to reflect broader inflationary pressures and tend to be relatively persistent.

Core PCE prices increased 0.3 percent for a second month in July.  These increases pushed up the three-month change through July to an annual rate of 2.8 percent, up from a pace of only 1.9 percent during the three months ending in April. 16 The 12-month change in core PCE prices, at 2.4 percent, is up nearly ½ percentage point from the yearearlier increase.  This acceleration was widespread across prices for goods and most services; one important exception is housing services, for which prices have decelerated over the last 12 months, a slowdown consistent with the general weakness in this sector.

The cost pressures affecting finished goods prices are showing through even more clearly to prices of intermediate materials.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose 2 percent in July, which brought the three-month change to an annual rate of 23 percent.  These price increases have been widespread but are especially noticeable for metals and for energy-intensive categories such as chemicals, plastics, and paints. The string of recent advances pushed the 12-month change through July to 10 percent,

nearly 8 percentage points higher than the change over the preceding 12 months. Nevertheless, as with energy and many food commodities, prices of industrial commodities have moved lower in recent weeks.  Both the Commodity Research Bureau spot industrials index and the Journal of Commerce industrial commodities index have moved down since the July/August Greenbook, declining 6 percent and 10½ percent respectively.

Measures of inflation expectations are flat or down a little since the last Greenbook.  In the Reuters/University of Michigan survey, median expectations for year-ahead inflation moved down to 4.8 percent in August but still remain 1½ percentage points higher than they were late last year.  The Reuters/Michigan measure of median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years held steady at 3.2 percent last month, down from its recent high of 3.4 percent but still above its January reading of 3.0 percent.  As measured by the Survey of Professional Economists, expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years held steady at 2.2 percent in the third quarter.  Finally, inflation compensation derived from yields on nominal and inflation-protected Treasury securities has moved down since the last Greenbook, and the 5-year forward measure is now close to its level around the turn of the year.

Labor Costs

Hourly compensation has continued to increase moderately with no sign of acceleration. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector was revised down in the first half of the year on the basis of earnings data from unemployment insurance records through the first quarter.  We now estimate that compensation per hour rose at an annual pace of 3¾ percent in the first half-about the same as the increase over 2007.  More recently, average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in August and thus brought the 12-month change to 3.6 percent, down from 4.0 percent over the preceding 12 months.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Over much of the intermeeting period, financial markets were strained by concerns about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and about the prospect of continued write-downs and credit losses at financial institutions more broadly.  Some uncertainty was resolved on September 7, when the Treasury Department and the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had been placed into conservatorship and that Treasury would establish a backstop lending facility for Fannie and Freddie and initiate a program to purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS).  In the two days following the announcement, spreads on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt and on agency MBS decreased significantly, while share prices for their common and preferred stock plunged.

On net over the intermeeting period, investors pushed back their expectation for the onset of monetary policy tightening to the third quarter of next year and marked down their expected level of the federal funds rate at the end of 2010 about 60 basis points.  Yields on both intermediate- and long-term nominal Treasury securities decreased over the intermeeting period, and inflation compensation derived from yields on Treasury inflation-indexed securities fell in the near- and far-term.  Broad equity indexes moved a bit lower, on net, while risk spreads on corporate bonds increased somewhat.  Indicators of business and household credit quality pointed to a further deterioration, and the pace of borrowing generally continued to slow.

Financial Institutions and Market Functioning

Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's lower-than-expected second-quarter earnings results intensified concerns about the ability of the two housing government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) to raise fresh capital to offset mounting losses on their mortgage exposures.  Before the conservatorship announcement, prices for the GSEs' preferred and common stock had declined on balance since the August meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), while credit default swap (CDS) spreads on the GSEs' senior debt narrowed further, as market participants speculated that a possible government intervention regarding the GSEs could significantly dilute the existing shares but protect payments on senior debt.  In response to the announcement, risk spreads on the GSEs' debt and MBS dropped further, while the value of their common and preferred stock plunged.  Fannie Mae's auction of $1 billion of 3- and 6-month bills on September 9 was reportedly well-received by the market.

CDS spreads for U.S. investment banks widened over the intermeeting period, but generally remained well below their March peaks.  Lehman Brothers was the focus of much market commentary, as investors anticipated significant writedowns in the third quarter and speculated about the firm's ability to raise capital.  Lehman's stock price plunged in recent days and its CDS spread jumped.  CDS spreads for commercial banks increased somewhat, on balance, with spreads for regional banks remaining substantially above spreads for large banks, likely reflecting greater concern about asset quality at the former and the implications for their funding.

Conditions in short-term funding markets remained strained over the intermeeting period. Spreads of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) over comparable-maturity overnight index swap (OIS) rates edged higher from their already elevated levels.  In the commercial paper market, spreads on A2/P2 nonfinancial and asset-backed commercial paper fluctuated in a high range, as did spreads on financial commercial paper.  The repo market for Treasury collateral continued to function reasonably well over the intermeeting period, and there were indications that conditions in the repo market for agency debt and agency MBS may have improved a little after Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed in conservatorship.  However, over the intermeeting period as whole, median 'haircuts' on agency MBS and private-label subprime and alt-A MBS repo transactions increased slightly.

With regard to the Federal Reserve's liquidity facilities, the 28-day Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions conducted over the intermeeting period were again oversubscribed, and stop-out rates were well above the primary credit rate and just below one-month Libor rates.  The Federal Reserve conducted two auctions of 84-day TAF credit, both of which were oversubscribed.  Primary credit borrowing has climbed further since the August meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), likely because of the facility's relatively favorable terms.  However, no credit was extended through the Primary Dealer Credit Facility over the intermeeting period.  Demand was strong for the three Term Security Lending Facility (TSLF) auctions against Schedule 1 collateral held over the period, while, as in previous auctions, the TSLF auctions against Schedule 2 collateral were undersubscribed.  On August 27, the first auction was held under the TSLF Options Program (TOP):  dealers bid on the option to draw on the TSLF for a one-week term period bracketing the quarter-end.  Demand at the TOP auction was

Policy Expectations and Interest Rates

The market's expected onset of monetary policy tightening was pushed back to the third quarter of next year amid heightened concerns about the health of financial institutions and against a backdrop of deteriorating labor market conditions and a further decline in oil prices, which was seen as tempering inflation pressures.  Futures quotes suggest that market participants expect slightly more than 1 percentage point of policy tightening by the end of 2010, about 60 basis points less than at the time of the last FOMC meeting. Uncertainty about the expected path of policy decreased, as the option-implied distribution of the federal funds rate six months ahead narrowed somewhat and became less skewed toward higher policy rates.  FOMC communications over the intermeeting period elicited very little market reaction, as the Committee's decision to leave the federal funds rate unchanged at the August FOMC meeting, as well as the accompanying statement and the subsequent release of the minutes, were in line with investor expectations.

Yields on 2- and 10-year nominal Treasury securities declined about 25 basis points and 35 basis points, respectively.  Yields on 2- and 10-year inflation-indexed securities rose and were little changed, respectively, leaving inflation compensation notably lower across the term structure.  The decrease in inflation compensation was most pronounced at shorter horizons, reflecting the expected effects of the drop in oil prices.

Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads

Broad equity price indexes decreased about 2 percent over the intermeeting period, with shares of retail firms widely outperforming the market.  Financial sector indexes ended the period down 1½ percent, but were very volatile.  The spread between the 12-month forward trend-earnings-price ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-remained at the top of its range over the past 25 years.  Options-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index remained in the elevated range of the past year.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds decreased slightly, while yields on speculative-grade bonds were little changed.  Given the

relatively large decreases in comparable-maturity Treasury yields, risk spreads on investment-grade bonds rose to the top of their historical range, and speculative-grade spreads nearly returned to their March peaks.  CDS spreads suggest that compensation for default risk for investment-grade financial firms rose markedly since the August FOMC meeting, while that for investment-grade nonfinancial firms was little changed.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With nearly all second-quarter earnings reports in hand, earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 firms are estimated to have dropped about 25 percent from their year-ago level because of a plunge in financial sector profits.  Earnings per share for nonfinancial firms are estimated to have increased about 7 percent over the past year, with roughly half the gain accounted for by the oil and gas industry.  An index of analysts' expectations of earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms over the coming year showed a sharp downward revision in August, largely reflecting significant further markdowns for the financial sector.

The credit quality of nonfinancial corporations has deteriorated some in recent months. The net rate of nonfinancial corporate bond downgrades by Moody's in July was a little higher than in the second quarter.  The six-month trailing bond default rate and the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans at commercial banks have both risen noticeably since the spring, although they remain at low levels by historical standards.  The aggregate expected default rate over the next year projected by Moody's KMV rose in July, reaching its highest level since 2003.

Business Finance

Net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses picked up in August from the weak pace in July, with the increase accounted for by a jump in nonfinancial commercial paper (CP) outstanding.  Last month, some highly rated firms reportedly tapped the CP market to finance dividend payments and to fund, at least temporarily, a large acquisition. Investment-grade bond issuance moderated a bit further in August, while speculativegrade issuance remained very light.  Bank lending to business through C&amp;I loans was about flat during the July-August period, likely reflecting both reduced demand for bankintermediated credit and the tighter terms and standards on these categories of loans that banks have reported in the past several Senior Loan Officer Opinion Surveys.

Both seasoned and initial equity offerings by nonfinancial corporations remained weak in August, with almost no issuance outside the energy sector.  In the second quarter, equity retirements from cash-financed mergers fell a bit further, but announcements of new

deals continued apace.  Retirements from share repurchases are also estimated to have continued their decline in the second quarter.  As a result, on net, nonfinancial firms retired equity in the second quarter at the slowest pace since 2004.

Commercial Real Estate

The growth of commercial mortgage debt slowed sharply in the second quarter and appears to have come down further this quarter.  In August, the value of commercial real estate transactions slipped to its lowest level since early 2004, a decline reflecting the much tighter supply of financing for these transactions and lower prices of commercial properties.  In the second quarter, prices of transacted properties were about 10 percent below their year-ago peaks.  Issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) was zero in July and August, and yield spreads for CDS indexes of BBB-rated tranches of CMBS reached a new high in mid-August before moving down in recent weeks.

Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held by commercial banks climbed to 4¼ percent in the second quarter, the highest level since 1995, as delinquencies for construction loans, particularly those associated with residential projects, rose further.  In contrast, the delinquency rate for commercial mortgages held in CMBS remained quite low in August, and almost no loans held by life insurance companies were delinquent in the second quarter.

Household Finance

Before the GSE conservatorship announcement was made, interest rates on 30-year fixedrate jumbo mortgages and conforming mortgages had decreased about a quarter percentage point since the August FOMC meeting.  The decline in the conforming mortgage rate was less than that on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, thereby leaving the mortgage spread at the top of its range over the past two decades.  In part, the elevated primary market spreads reflected unusually high option-adjusted spreads for agency MBS amid unsettled conditions in the secondary market.  Following the Treasury announcement, option-adjusted spreads on agency MBS dropped substantially and reports indicated that some lenders lowered rates on conforming mortgages around 20 basis points.

The very soft housing market has continued to weigh on mortgage credit quality.  Two national indexes, one published by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight and the other by S&amp;P/Case-Shiller, of existing home prices declined further in the second quarter, albeit not as sharply as in the previous quarter.  In June, the delinquency rate on

prime (and near-prime) residential mortgages edged up 10 basis points, to 1¾ percent, and the delinquency rate on subprime mortgages increased about 45 basis points, to 18¾ percent.  Preliminary data (not shown) indicate that the delinquency rate on subprime variable-rate mortgages increased further in July.

Issuance of MBS by Ginnie Mae continued to move up in July, while issuance by the GSEs that month was somewhat below the pace earlier in the year.  No private-label MBS was issued that month.  In the second quarter, mortgage debt expanded at an annual rate below 1 percent, the slowest recorded pace since 1952.  The steep decline in total mortgage borrowing reflects a number of factors, including the tight supply of nonconforming loans, the rise in mortgage rates since the beginning of the year, the continuing drop in home prices, and sluggish home sales.

Delinquency rates for revolving and nonrevolving consumer loans at commercial banks edged up in the second quarter.  Delinquencies on auto loans at the domestic captive finance companies remained elevated in July, and the charge-off rate on prime auto loans estimated by Moody's (not shown) rose in June to its highest level since December 2003.

Growth of consumer credit stepped down a little in July.  Growth of nonrevolving credit slowed markedly, even as a large captive finance company launched aggressive auto financing incentives in July.  Since the August FOMC meeting, interest rates on credit card and auto loans were little changed, generally remaining below the levels seen earlier this year.  Separately, new government-backed funding facilities appear to have largely assuaged concerns about the availability of student loans for the autumn semester.

The secondary market for consumer loans continues to show signs of strain.  Issuance of asset-backed securities (ABS) collateralized by credit card receivables and by auto loans was substantially weaker in July and August than earlier this year.  Although issuance of student loan ABS has held up, on net, the August figure reflected a single deal that was not widely distributed among investors.  Spreads on consumer ABS jumped in August and now stand above their March peaks, suggesting that investors may have grown more concerned about the likely performance of the underlying loans.

As in July, long-term mutual funds saw sizable outflows last month, which reflected large withdrawals from equity funds and moderate inflows to bond funds.  For the second consecutive month, money market funds attracted inflows exceeding $40 billion in August.

Treasury Finance

During the intermeeting period, the Treasury conducted auctions of nominal coupon securities across a range of maturities, and these auctions were generally well received. Indirect bids, a rough measure of demand from foreign official institutions, stayed near the bottom of the range seen over the past several years.  However, foreign custody holdings of Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York-another indicator of foreign demand-increased notably over the intermeeting period, while such holdings of agency securities declined.

Liquidity in the secondary market for Treasury securities remained somewhat strained during the period.  Spreads between on- and off-the-run Treasury notes generally stayed elevated, an indication of continued high demand for the most liquid securities.  In addition, fitting errors from the estimated nominal yield curve remained sizable; that is, there continued to be unusually large differences between yields on Treasury securities with similar maturities.  However, there were some signs of improvement.  Average bidasked spreads for on-the-run nominal Treasury notes declined a bit further and now have nearly returned to levels seen before the onset of the financial turmoil last year, and trading volumes for on-the-run Treasury securities rebounded in early September from last month's low level.

State and Local Government Finance

Issuance of long-term municipal bonds for both advance refundings and new capital projects was sizable in August.  Short-term issuance was also strong last month, a result of greater-than-typical revenue shortfalls for state and local governments.

Nonetheless, credit quality in the municipal bond sector appears to have remained solid on the whole, as the number of rating upgrades continued to outpace the number of downgrades in the second quarter.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds decreased slightly over the intermeeting period, even as those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities moved down, pushing the ratio of a representative municipal bond yield to a comparable-maturity Treasury yield to the middle of this year's elevated range.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 contracted at an annual rate of 1½ percent in August after having expanded 6 percent in the previous month.  Smoothing through the monthly volatility, money growth has stepped down since the second quarter.  The August data showed a considerable reallocation among the components of M2.  Liquid deposits and retail money funds fell at

annual rates of 8¼ percent and 5 percent, respectively.  In stark contrast, small time deposits surged at a nearly 25 percent pace, as some banks and thrifts apparently continued to bid aggressively for these deposits to help stabilize their core deposit base. Last month, growth of currency slowed from the robust pace in July that had reflected unusual demand from abroad.

In July and August, commercial bank credit expanded at about the same pace as in the second quarter, as faster growth of securities holdings offset a slower expansion in loans. 2 Growth of commercial real estate and C&amp;I loans was tepid, on average, during the JulyAugust period, while residential real estate loans and consumer loans on banks' books grew at a pace similar to that in the second quarter.

Data from the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted during the week of August 4 indicated that the average spread on C&amp;I loan originations of less than $25 million-adjusted for changes in nonprice loan characteristics-was about unchanged since the May survey.   The absence of a pronounced widening of yield 3 spreads on those C&amp;I loans is broadly consistent with the recent NFIB survey, which showed that concerns among small firms about future credit conditions and current availability of credit have receded somewhat in recent months. By contrast, terms on large leveraged syndicated loans have remained very tight.

Commercial bank profitability, as measured by industry return on assets, fell to about 0.4 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 2008, the lowest level since the end of 1990.  This year's decrease has been somewhat more pronounced among the 25 largest institutions (as measured by assets), a segment of the industry in which a sharp increase in loan-loss provisions and large write-downs of asset values have weighed heavily on profits.  For the industry as a whole, loan-loss provisions increased to 1.3 percent of total loans and leases in the second quarter, about three times the year-earlier rate.  Despite the rapid pace of loan-loss provisioning, the ratio of loan-loss reserves to net charge-offs-a rough gauge of reserve adequacy-fell to a very low level.

International Developments

International Developments

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $56.8 billion in June, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a more moderate increase in imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

In June, exports rose 4 percent, supported by strength in exports of industrial supplies (particularly petroleum products), agricultural products, and capital goods.  Exports of automotive products were pushed up by increased shipments of trucks to Canada, while strong exports of pharmaceutical products boosted consumer goods.  Exports of services also climbed.

The value of exports in the second quarter increased 23¼ percent at an annual rate. Strong growth was recorded across most major categories; exports of industrial supplies and agricultural products were particularly robust.  In real terms, exports rose 13¼ percent in the second quarter, contributing 1.6 percentage points to U.S. real GDP growth.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of imports of goods and services rose 1.8 percent in June, as a strong increase in imports of oil (both on account of higher volumes as well as an increase in price) more than offset a sharp decline in non-oil goods.  Imports of capital goods fell, as computers slipped back after surging in May and other capital goods were weak.  Imports of consumer goods declined despite a jump in pharmaceutical products, whereas industrial supplies and automotive products were flat.  Services increased moderately.

The value of imports in the second quarter increased 17½ percent at an annual rate, led by an increase in oil imports, as an increase in the price of imported oil more than offset a decline in the volume.  In real terms, however, imports contracted 7½ percent, resulting in a positive contribution to U.S. real GDP growth of 1.4 percentage points.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In July, for the second consecutive month, prices of core imports rose 0.9 percent.  Compared with the June increase, July's rise featured a relatively large contribution from finished goods, mostly reflecting a 0.8 percent increase in the prices for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors.  Prices for consumer goods also accelerated, increasing 0.3 percent in July following 0.1 percent in June.  As in previous months most of the increase in the prices of core goods was due to material-intensive goods; prices for these goods increased 1.8 percent in July following 2.4 percent in June. Higher prices for chemicals and steel and iron products more than offset falling prices for nonferrous metals.  Higher prices for meat and vegetables also contributed to the increase.

Oil. The BLS price index for imported oil rose 4 percent in July, amid considerable volatility in underlying spot prices.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil surged to $145 per barrel in mid July but then reversed course, leaving the monthly average price for July unchanged from June's $133 per barrel.  Oil prices have fallen from an average of $117 in August to $103.26 as of September 9.  The rapid fall in oil prices that has occurred since mid-July appears to reflect a continued weakening of the outlook for global oil demand as well as increases in supply.  Part of this increase stems from Saudi Arabia, which raised crude production for the third consecutive month.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

This apparent easing of the global oil balance has more than offset any upward price pressure stemming from increased geopolitical tensions due to the conflict between Russia and Georgia, as well as tropical storm activity in the Gulf of Mexico.

Exports. Core export prices rose 1.9 percent in July.  Almost all of the increase was due to higher prices for material-intensive goods.  Prices for agricultural products soared 6.7 percent in July, reflecting sharp price increases for corn and soybeans.  Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies rose 2.6 percent, supported by higher prices for fuels and chemicals.  After increasing 0.1 percent in June, prices for finished goods rose 0.3 percent in July.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the July/August Greenbook, we have received data on U.S. international financial transactions for June and July, along with partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) through early September.

After slowing sharply in the second half of 2007, foreign official flows into the United States surged during the first half of 2008 (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Financial Transactions table and the chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows).  As market attention increasingly focused on concerns about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, official investors slightly reduced their holdings of agency securities in July.  However, these outflows from agency securities were more than offset by inflows into Treasury and other short-term securities.  All told, foreign official inflows were on trend in July, registering $41 billion, with nearly all coming from China, Russia, and members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that official holdings of agency securities continued to decline through early September, even as holdings of Treasuries continued to rise (see inset chart).  In the two days following the announcement that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be placed into conservatorship, foreign official holdings of agency securities at FRBNY increased slightly, but it is too early to tell if this signals a return to previous trends.

<!-- missing-text -->

Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities have continued to slow since the financial turmoil began in mid-2007 and were weak in the first half of 2008, averaging about half of those recorded in the second half of 2007 (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Financial Transactions table; see also the chart on Private Securities Flows).  Foreign private investors have been selling agency bonds since March, but the pace accelerated in July to a record $51 billion (line 4b).  There were also small outflows from net foreign private sales of corporate and municipal bonds and corporate stocks (lines 4c and 4d), but these were mostly offset by net purchases of Treasury securities (line 4a).  Overall, private foreign net sales of U.S. securities in July resulted in a record outflow of $53 billion (line 4).

Since early 2007, financial outflows associated with U.S. private investors' net acquisitions of foreign securities have been decreasing on average (bottom left panel of the chart).  In July U.S. private investors sold, on net, $30 billion of foreign securities (line 5), which resulted in an inflow.

The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered an inflow of $21 billion in June, which was followed by a large outflow of $83 billion in July.  Most of the outflow in July was due to decreased funding from affiliated branches in the Caribbean.

Complete U.S. balance of payments data for the second quarter will not be published until September 17.  However, some partial data have come in, including changes in quarterly reported custody holdings.  These data (which will be included in line 10 of the table) indicate a further $50 billion in inflows during the second quarter, primarily the result of a decrease in U.S. residents' deposits in the Caribbean.

Foreign Financial Markets

The dollar has appreciated sharply since the time of the last Greenbook in accordance with the deterioration of the foreign economic outlook.  The major currencies index increased by 6½ percent, with the dollar gaining over 12 percent against sterling and 10 percent against the euro after the release of weaker-than-expected macroeconomic data for Europe and the news of downward adjustments to the growth forecasts of the Bank of England (BoE), the European Central Bank (ECB), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).  The appreciation of the dollar against the yen has been modest.

Despite gloomier growth expectations, the BoE and the ECB left their policy rates unchanged over the period, citing concerns about inflation being well above target. Medium-term policy expectations have declined, however, since the July/August Greenbook, especially for the Bank of England.  The twelve month sterling overnight index swap (OIS) rate has declined by 44 basis points.  The comparable euro rate declined only 17 basis points amid statements by several ECB Governing Council Members that some of these expectations are premature due to continued inflationary pressures.  In line with expected easing by central banks, sovereign bond yields have declined since the end of July, reflecting declines both in real rates and in expected inflation.  Ten-year inflation compensation has declined by roughly 20 basis points in the euro area and 10 basis points in the United Kingdom.  Inflation compensation in Japan has declined as well, by 15 basis points.

Conditions in money markets deteriorated somewhat since the time of the last Greenbook.  Spreads between three-month sterling Libor and OIS rates increased by 11 basis points, likely driven at least in part by the worsening economic outlook for the United Kingdom.  U.K. housing prices have continued to fall, and Moody's downgraded $3.6 billion of nonconforming U.K. residential mortgage-backed securities in August due to rising delinquencies.  The United Kingdom's financial regulator, the Financial Services Authority, also fined Credit Suisse for incorrect securities valuations in midAugust and announced that next year it will start probing 'a large number' of London banks for similar problems.  Euro Libor to OIS spreads increased only modestly.  The demand for dollar funding in continental Europe still appears to be substantial.  The initial 84-day U.S. dollar auctions of the ECB and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), held in conjunction with the 84-day Term Auction Facility (TAF) auctions by the Federal Reserve, were substantially oversubscribed.  The ECB and SNB also held three 28-day auctions during the period, and these drew substantial bids as well.  On concern that some

European financial institutions might be taking advantage of the ECB's broad collateral rules, the ECB announced several changes to its rules.  These changes are scheduled to take effect in February 2009.

Apparently reflecting the same concerns about weakening growth abroad that boosted the major currencies index of the dollar, the dollar rose nearly 4 percent against the currencies of our other important trading partners.  Currencies throughout the emerging markets declined, most notably the Brazilian real and the Korean won, which are 13¾ percent and 8¼ percent lower against the dollar, respectively, since the previous Greenbook.  The renminbi, however, depreciated only modestly against the dollar.  These depreciations occurred in spite of the fact that the central banks of Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam tightened policy in an attempt to curb mounting inflation.  A number of countries, including Russia, Korea, and Indonesia, are believed to have intervened in foreign exchange markets to support their currencies in the face of downward pressures.

Despite the fact that stock markets rallied after the Treasury Department's actions regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, equity prices around the world have, on net, declined since the July/August Greenbook.  The Dow Jones Eurostoxx index declined by 2½ percent whereas the Nikkei index lost over 7 percent.  The Shanghai composite index fell by as much as 24 percent.  Financial stocks in the euro area have risen slightly over this period.  European banks reported second-quarter write-downs totaling around $40 billion, although earnings reports in early August were better than had been expected.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

Economic indicators received since the last Greenbook point to marked deterioration in the pace of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies.  Second-quarter GDP was flat in Canada and the United Kingdom and fell in both Japan and the euro area.  The weakness in the advanced foreign economies appears to have continued into the third quarter.  Confidence and survey indicators declined considerably in recent months in most of these economies.  In July, employment continued to weaken in Japan, and retail sales fell in the euro area and decelerated in the United Kingdom.  Headline inflation in the major advanced foreign economies stayed elevated, although it edged down in August in the euro area.  Since the last Greenbook, inflation excluding food and energy was generally little changed for the major economies.  No major central bank changed its policy rate during the intermeeting period.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

In Japan , real GDP contracted 2.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter following a downward-revised growth rate of 3.2 percent in the first quarter.  All major components of domestic demand except government consumption fell sharply.  Private consumption declined almost 2 percent, and private investment contracted more than 2½ percent.  Net exports also made a small negative contribution to growth.

<!-- missing-text -->

For the third quarter, trade data suggest a rebound in net exports.  After falling sharply earlier in the year, real exports grew steadily in May, June, and July, while real imports were up only slightly over the same period.  Elsewhere in the economy, recent data point to continued weakness.  Industrial production rose only 0.8 percent over the 12 months ending in July, well below the 2.2 percent in the previous 12 months.  Business and consumer confidence indicators have deteriorated sharply over the last year and are both at or near their 2001 lows.

The labor market has continued to weaken.  Although the unemployment rate fell back 0.1 percentage point to 4.0 percent in July, the job openings-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) declined to 0.89, its lowest level since October 2004.

Rising energy and food prices have been the primary reason for a 2.3 percent increase in Japanese consumer prices over the 12 months ending in July.  Consumer prices excluding fresh food (Japan's official definition of core inflation) rose nearly as much, but prices excluding food and energy were up only 0.2 percent from last year.  The timelier 12-month core CPI inflation for Tokyo slowed from 1.6 percent in July to 1.3 percent in August.

On August 29, the Japanese government announced a $106 billion stimulus package in response to the weakening economy.  Although details remain sketchy, the bulk of the stimulus is likely to be allotted to loan guarantees to small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the stimulus is likely too small to have a substantial impact on Japan's economy.  Japan's Prime Minister Fukuda announced his resignation on September 1 in an effort to break political deadlock.  His party, the Liberal Democratic Party, has called an election for September 22.

Euro-area real GDP contracted 0.8 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, with larger-thanexpected declines in France, Italy, and particularly Germany.  A collapse in investment was the main factor behind the second-quarter weakness.  Private consumption also posted a decline, partially offset by gains in government consumption.  The most recent ECB bank lending survey indicates credit standards in the euro area remained tight in the second quarter, mainly reflecting deteriorating expectations about the euro-area economic outlook.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent indicators point to continued softness in the third quarter.  Euro-area economic sentiment dropped further in August, reaching its lowest level in over five years. Purchasing managers' indexes (PMIs) for both manufacturing and services in August indicated that these sectors contracted for the third consecutive month.  Retail sales declined 0.4 percent in July.  Particularly worrisome is the clear deterioration in the German economy, which had shown resilience until recently.  The German Ifo business climate index dropped in August for the third consecutive month, the manufacturing PMI fell below 50, and manufacturing new orders have been decreasing sharply in recent months.

Euro-area 12-month headline inflation, as measured by the harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP), reached 4 percent in July, a record high.  Excluding energy and unprocessed food, inflation continued to hover around 2½ percent.  According to a preliminary estimate, headline inflation edged down to 3.8 percent in August.  The ECB Council left its policy rate unchanged at 4.25 percent at its August and September meetings.

In the United Kingdom , growth of real GDP in the second quarter was revised down to a meager 0.2 percent (a.r.), held down by flat consumption and plunging housing and government investment.  The fall in domestic demand was offset by positive contributions from net exports and inventories.  Recent data point to further weakness in the third quarter.  In July, retail sales stood below their second-quarter level, the claim-based measure of the unemployment rate edged up, and industrial production continued to fall.  Confidence indicators have weakened, on balance, since the last Greenbook to very low levels.

On September 2, the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a one-year suspension of taxes on housing transactions of £175,000 or less, a measure that will cost the government an estimated £600 million.  The Chancellor also brought forward £1 billion in spending to fund a series of measures aimed at accelerating public housing construction, encouraging first-time buyers, and assisting families facing repossession. House price indexes fell more than 10 percent in the year to August, and the value of loans for house purchases in July was only a quarter of its year-earlier level.

The 12-month rate of headline inflation climbed to 4.4 percent in July.  Food and energy prices, the largest contributors to the run up in inflation, rose 10 percent and 21 percent, respectively, over the same period.  Although inflation outside of energy and both processed and unprocessed food crept up in recent months, it remained contained at 1.9 percent.  Average earnings, both including and excluding bonuses, stood about 3½ percent higher in July than 12 months earlier.

In Canada , real GDP rose a tepid 0.3 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, after a downward-revised fall of 0.8 percent in the first quarter.  Second-quarter GDP was restrained by a large negative contribution from net exports (2.8 percentage points), as exports - particularly to the United States - continued to fall sharply.  Investment also fell, partly reflecting a decline in residential construction.  In contrast, consumption growth was strong, at 2.4 percent, although half of its 2007 pace.

Following a loss of 55 thousand jobs in July, employment increased 15 thousand in August.  Since the start of the year, employment has grown 0.5 percent, a much smaller increase compared to the first eight months of 2007.  The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 6.1 percent.

The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation rose to 3.3 percent in July, up from 1.4 percent in March, reflecting escalating energy prices and an end to the extremely low rates of food-price inflation over the past year.  The Bank of Canada's preferred measure of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components of the consumer price index as well as the effects of indirect taxes, remained muted at 1.5 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Data since the July/August Greenbook generally have showed continued slowing in emerging market economies.  Revised data for Mexico indicate that real GDP contracted in the first quarter and that growth was quite low in the second quarter as well.  In Asia, second-quarter output contracted sharply in Hong Kong and Singapore, and decelerated significantly in India, Malaysia, and Thailand.  However, in a few countries, including the Philippines, Indonesia, and Venezuela, output rebounded from below-trend rates in the first quarter.  In the current quarter, emerging market economies appear to have continued to grow at a subdued pace, weighed down by weak external sectors and varying degrees of weakness in domestic demand.

Headline inflation in the developing world may be beginning to crest.  Although inflation rose in some countries, it fell in several Asian economies including China, Korea, Singapore, Taiwan, and Thailand.  Inflation in Mexico edged just a touch higher in July. Monetary authorities in several emerging market economies, including Korea and Mexico, have raised policy rates since the time of the July/August Greenbook.

In China , data thus far in the third quarter have been mixed.  In July, industrial production contracted and bank lending expanded at about its second-quarter pace, which was the lowest since 2006.  On the other hand, the trade balance has jumped higher to average about $310 billion at an annual rate over July and August, well above the second-quarter average, as exports rebounded and imports contracted.  Exports were higher to all regions including the United States.  In addition, retail sales were up more than 23 percent from a year earlier.

In August, 12-month consumer price inflation fell to 4.9 percent, down from more than 8 percent early in the year, as food price inflation continued to wane.  Excluding food and energy, inflation has remained subdued at a little over 1 percent.  With headline inflation coming down, authorities have issued statements indicating a shifting of concern away from inflation and towards slowing growth.  Thus far, the authorities have taken limited actions aimed at aiding the export sector.  For example, in early August, China increased tax rebates for textile and clothing exporters.  Monetary authorities have also reportedly raised banks' lending quotas 5 percent, with the new funds to be directed toward small and medium-sized enterprises.

India's GDP growth fell in the second quarter to 5½ percent from 9 percent in the first. The slowdown reflected, in part, the response of domestic demand to three consecutive interest rate increases by the authorities.  Growth also slowed in agriculture and the export-oriented services sector.  Industrial production in the second quarter was flat. Both consumer and wholesale price inflation increased in July, although the pickup in wholesale price inflation was small compared with recent months.  On August 14, the government announced a 28 percent increase in employee salaries, which will likely stimulate consumption but also increase inflation pressures.  Imports grew faster than exports in July, and the trade deficit widened considerably relative to the first and second quarters.

In the NIEs 1 , second-quarter growth slowed in Taiwan and contracted in both Hong Kong and Singapore.  The slowing in Taiwan was broad-based and reflected weaker domestic and external demand.  The same was true in Hong Kong, only to a greater extent, with output falling 5½ percent.  Activity contracted 6 percent in Singapore, due in part to the volatile biomedical sector, but electronics also slowed, and a decline in government expenditures weighed on domestic demand.  In July, industrial production edged lower in Korea and showed a sharp contraction in Taiwan.  In contrast, production in Singapore rebounded in July.  Trade balances worsened in July except in Singapore, with Korean and Taiwanese balances moving from a surplus to a deficit.

12-month consumer price inflation remained elevated in Hong Kong, largely reflecting higher food and energy prices.  In Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan, there are some indications that headline inflation may have peaked.  Korean inflation jumped to 5.9 percent in July but moved down to 5.6 percent in August on lower energy prices.  On August 5, the Korean central bank raised its official rate 25 basis points, the first increase in a year, in order to contain inflation, which remains well above the country's target. 12-month inflation fell about 1 percentage point in Singapore in July and fell about the same in Taiwan in August.

In the ASEAN-4 , real GDP growth in the second quarter slowed markedly in Malaysia and Thailand, but growth rebounded from slow first quarters in Indonesia and the Philippines.  In July, industrial production in Thailand was flat, and the trade balance swung from a surplus to a sizable deficit.  Indonesia's trade surplus also narrowed in July.

Consumer price inflation rose significantly in all of the ASEAN countries in July, reaching about 12 percent on a 12-month basis in Indonesia and the Philippines.  In August, inflation in Indonesia and the Philippines was little changed but Thailand recorded a sharp drop, which was primarily due to increased government subsidies on energy.  Similarly, Malaysian authorities cut retail fuel prices a bit in August to quiet political unrest ignited by a massive fuel price hike in June.  To combat high inflation, the central banks of Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand raised interest rates in August.

The political environment in Thailand deteriorated rapidly in late August and early September.  The Thailand Election Committee found that the ruling People's Power Party committed election fraud in the December elections.  Following increased antigovernment demonstrations, Prime Minister Sundaravej declared a state of emergency, which allows the military more leeway to contain rioting in the capital.

In Mexico , real GDP growth in the first quarter was revised sharply lower, from about 2 percent to -½ percent, and output remained anemic in the second quarter, rising only 0.6 percent.  Manufacturing, mining, utilities, and the construction sector all contracted in the second quarter.  Retail sales slowed as employment fell and real disposable income deteriorated owing to the rise in consumer prices.  In July, the trade deficit widened as import growth outweighed the increase in exports.  Although overall exports increased in July, there was a significant contraction in automobile exports.

Headline and core inflation continued to increase in July, with both measures higher than 5 percent on a 12-month basis.  With inflation above its 4 percent target, the Bank of Mexico raised its policy rate ¼ percentage point in mid-August, bringing the rate to 8¼ percent.  This increase was the third consecutive one.

In Brazil , second-quarter real GDP rose 6½ percent following an upward-revised 3.4 percent increase in the first quarter.  Consumption was robust, up 4.2 percent, while gross fixed capital formation soared 23 percent.  Net exports posted a neutral contribution to growth, with both exports and imports rebounding after a weak first quarter when trade was depressed by a customs strike.  Rapid growth in credit and rising incomes from high commodity prices continued to boost domestic demand.  Headline consumer price inflation declined in August to 6.2 percent on a 12-month basis, driven in part by falling food prices.

In Argentina , industrial production recovered in the second quarter, and it increased sharply in July following a resolution to the conflict between farmers and the government over a proposal to tax exports; the conflict subsided after the Congress rejected the export tax bill.  The trade surplus narrowed in the second quarter, in part reflecting a strike-related fall in exports, but widened in July.  The financial condition of the government, however, has deteriorated.  The government borrowed $1 billion from Venezuela at a rate 2 percentage points higher than the average of its current outstanding debt, signaling that the government faces difficulty issuing new bonds at competitive rates in international markets.  In addition, Standard and Poor's downgraded Argentina's sovereign debt rating to B from B+.  To restore credibility, the government announced that it would use some of its international reserves to pay off $6.7 billion of Paris Club debt, which has been in default since the 2001-02 economic crisis.  Headline consumer price inflation remained around 9 percent in July on a 12-month basis, but the reliability of the official inflation data remains questionable.

In Venezuela , second-quarter real GDP rebounded following a large first-quarter decline. Output rose at an annual rate of 14 percent, despite a contraction in the volatile petroleum sector of 7 percent.  Headline inflation continued to be very high, coming in at more than 33 percent on a 12-month basis in August.  The bolivar declined 20 percent against the dollar in the parallel market over the second half of August.  A number of developments appear to have contributed to the currency drop.  These include the government takeover of Mexican-owned cement company Sidor and the announcement that the government will acquire Banco de Venezuela, the country's third largest bank (whose Spanish owners had been looking for a buyer)  Also, in early August, the Chavez-appointed Supreme Court ruled as constitutional the disqualification of roughly 300 opposition candidates from the upcoming November local elections.

Tensions remain high in Russia , after the invasion of Georgia in mid-August.  In early August, Georgia attempted to regain control over the breakaway region of South Ossetia by force.  The Russian response was to send its own troops to this region and to neighboring Abakhazia, also a separatist province, and then continue into the heart of Georgia to occupy strategic military locations.  The military conflict and political tensions have exacerbated concerns about the investment climate in Russia and stoked worries within the EU about the reliability of Russia as a source of energy.  Over several days in August and September, the Russian authorities intervened to support the ruble. As a result, international reserves fell about $14 billion in August.  Despite the intervention, the ruble has depreciated about 10 percent against the dollar since end-July. The Russian stock market has been on a downward trend since May.  Inflation remains uncomfortably high, coming in at a 12-month rate of nearly 15 percent in August. Falling oil prices and rising interest rates could weigh on activity in the future.

In Pakistan , the economic situation is precarious.  An overheating of the economy, together with the sharp rise in world oil and other commodity prices, took 12-month inflation to nearly 25 percent in July.  In its latest monetary policy report, the State Bank of Pakistan estimates that the government fiscal deficit rose sharply to about 8 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2007-08 (which runs from July to June), and the current account deficit rose to about 8½ percent of GDP.  Until recently, sufficiently high capital inflows easily financed the current account deficit, but with intense political uncertainty since late last year, investor sentiment has turned against the country.  The Pakistani rupee has moved sharply down against the dollar since last October, and there has been a massive loss of international reserves resulting from efforts to prevent a free-fall of the currency; reserves are at a critically low level.  President Musharraf resigned in mid-August under pressure from the new ruling coalition, but the coalition broke up soon after his resignation.  In early September, Mr. Zardari (the husband of the assassinated Ms. Bhutto) was elected President.  There does not appear to be a quick end in sight to political uncertainty, security problems, and severe economic difficulties.
