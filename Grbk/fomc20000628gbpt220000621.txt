NOTE Change  is rom  May  15 to  June  20/21 f

The Mexican peso depreciated 3  1/4 percent against the dollar after Francisco Labastida, presidential  candidate of the ruling PRI party, said that if he failed to win the July  2 election by a wide margin,  Mexico may experience  social  unrest. . Since the

May FOMC meeting, the Mexican Bolsa has risen 2  3/4 ercent. p

In contrast, most other emerging  market asset prices have benefitted from diminished market expectations  for higher U.S. policy rates in the future.  Bond spreads  in emerging  markets,  as measured by the J.P. Morgan EMBI+  index, have  shed almost 1 percentage  point since the May FOMC meeting, even as the U.S. Treasury curve  shifted down 25 to 60 basis points.  Equity price indices  in Argentina and Brazil climbed 2  1/2 and 13 percent, respectively.  Asian share prices were mixed, rising moderately in most countries, but falling more than 8 percent in Malaysia and 4 percent in Indonesia.  Hong Kong and Mainland Chinese  shares received a boost from the passage of Permanent Normal  Trading Relations with China by the U.S. House  of Representatives.  The Hang Seng rose  9 percent and Shanghai B  shares (open to foreigners)  rose 31 percent.

The price of gold rose nearly $12  per troy ounce over the intermeeting period to a level of $287. Market participants  attributed the sharp rise in the  spot price to short-covering  by producers, related  to the depreciation  of the U.S.  dollar. According to market participants,  gold producers had sold numerous  Australiandollar-denominated  call options on gold in recent months.  As the dollar depreciated sharply  against a broad  spectrum of foreign  currencies, including the Australian  dollar, the accompanying  fall in the Australian-dollar price  of gold forced these producers to cover their short positions in the spot market, driving up the  spot price  of gold.
