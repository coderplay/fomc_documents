Overview

Virtually  ll  igns oint o  a continuation  is uarter  f  the conomic  pattern  e have a s p t th q o e w been  witnessing  or ome time: strong rowth  of  real DP, huge gains  in  jobs,  nd-f s g G a despite  ome pickup  in  wage increases--low  ice nflation. t surprisingly    these s pr i No in circumstances, nsumer  sentiment as  remained  extraordinarily eat,  nd U.S. co h upb a financial rkets  have been  relatively  ghtly uched  by  the  storms  originating ma li to abroad.

Looking  ahead,  however,  it eems doubtful  hat  he  economy will scape  the s t t e Asian  turmoil nscathed.  While the  uncertainties    this  phere emain  vast,  vents o u in s r e t date  suggest hat he  adjustment  n  train  cross he acific  ill e substantially  eper t t i a t P w b de and  more prolonged han  we allowed  for  in  our  prior  orecast.  oreover,  the  dollar t f M has  experienced  enewed  strength  f  late gainst   wide  range  of urrencies; r o a a c if sustained,  is  hange  in  the erms  of  trade ill einforce e rag  on  U.S.  production th c t w r th d stemming from the  lower  level f  economic  activity road.  All  told,  hese o ab t considerations  ve led  us  to  mark down significantly   projection   net  exports  or ha our of f the  next  two  years,  y enough  to  slice  everal  ore tenths  f  percentage  oint ff b s m o a p o real GDP.

At the  same time, ecent evelopments  point o  a  noticeably  ower  path  for il r d t l o prices,  nd  the  strength  f  dollar  hould educe  prices  or ther mported oods  as a o s r f o i g well.  These factors, ong  with  the  greater  egative mpact  of he  foreign  ector  n al n i t s o domestic  activity d a downward  revision  o  our  estimates  f  plant tilization, an t o u suggest   more benign  outlook or .S.  inflation. us,  we have  eliminated  ur a f U Th o previous  ssumption f  monetary  policy  ightening,  d  we now  assume  that he a o t an t federal  unds  rate ill e  flat  ver  the  projection riod. lthough  we believe hat f w b o pe A t earnings  isappointments  ill ead o  lower  share  prices  ver  time, he  stock-market d w l t o t correction  nticipated    this  orecast  s lower nd ultimately aller  han  that  n  the a in f i s a sm t i November forecast.  his  lower  trajectory r nterest tes  nd  the  higher ath  for T fo i ra a p equity rices rovide ome additional pport or he  domestic  components  of  final p p s su f t demand.

Putting ogether  he  pieces,  e project   path  of eal t t w a r GDP growth  that s  lower i than  the  one in  our  last  orecast--with  tivity celerating  re abruptly  nd with f ac de mo a growth  averaging   little  re than  1-1/2  percent n  the  next wo years.  Reported  core a mo i t CPI inflation    now expected o  be  about  the  same in  1998 and 1999 as  this  ear--in is t y the  2 to  2-1/4 ercent ange.  This  projection flects r  assumption hat  pcoming p r re ou t u

technical  hanges  to  the  index  will rim he  acceleration tween 1997 and 1999 by c t t be 0.3  to  0.4  percentage  oint. p

Key  Background  Factors

Domestic  financial nditions  ave  been  quite avorable  ince he  time  of  the  last co h f s t projection d  appear  to  be  imposing  little  straint    real ctivity. spite enewed an re on a De r nervousness  his eek about  the  implications   the  Asian  slump  for he arnings  f t w of t e o some firms,  ost  major  indexes f  U.S.  stock rices  ave moved higher,  n net,  ince m o p h o s the  last  OMC F meeting.  Treasury  bond  yields  re  lower  than e anticipated    the a w in last  orecast,  rtly  ecause  of  a  flight   safety  y some investors t  probably lso f pa b to b bu a because  of  a growing  confidence  hat ggregate emand and inflation  ll emain t a d wi r sufficiently dued  to  obviate ed tightening. sub F

As noted  above,  a more favorable  nflation  tlook as  led  us  to ase  this i ou h b forecast  n  a flat  rajectory  r he  funds ate. reasury ond yields  nd  mortgage o t fo t r T b a rates  re  expected o  move down  a little    the  next  several  onths,  as  the  economy a t in m slows  and  hopes  of  Fed  easing re  aroused,  nd  to  drift  ack  up  thereafter--but  se a a b the movements are  not  of  great conomic significance.   the  business  ector,   added e In s an measure  of  restraint    likely  o ome from a  widening  of isk  remia  on  corporate is t c r p bonds and  less ggressive  ank  lending. ur prediction  f  a  decline  n  corporate a b O o i profits ntrasts th  the  optimism  of  market  analysts  nd underlies  ur  expectation co wi a o that hare  prices  ill ecline  ubstantially   1999--raising e  cost  of  equity apital s w d s by th c for  corporations d taking ack  a  good part f  the  wealth  gains njoyed  by an b o e households his ear. t y

Since  the  last  OMC F meeting, he  dollar  as  appreciated  oticeably ainst  he t h n ag t currencies  f  our  major  trading  artners, cluding  hose n  Asia.  In  part,  his ise  n o p in t i t r i the  dollar  eflects  creased  oncern  about  the  implications   the  intensified  stress r in c of di in the  Korean economy  and  doubts  about  the  willingness d  ability   the  Japanese an of authorities    deal  forcefully th  their  inancial ctor  roblems.  Looking  ahead, e to wi f se p w anticipate at  he  dollar  ill old  its  igher evel,  n average, ver  the orecast th t w h h l o o f period.  Meanwhile,  we have  marked down  our  forecast  or oreign  rowth f f g 1/4  percentage  oint n  1998 and in  1999. On an export-weighted  asis,  oreign  eal p i b f r GDP  is  now projected  o  increase  -1/2 ercent n  1998 and 3-1/4 ercent n  1999;  as t 2 p i p i recently  s  the  September  Greenbook,  these umbers were 4 percent  nd 3-1/2 ercent, a n a p respectively.

At  the  end  of  November, OPEC announced  an  increase  f  2-1/2 illion  arrels o m b per  day in  its  roduction  eiling.  lthough  the  adjustment onstitutes  inly  a p c A c ma

At the  same time, he emand for il s  being  damped by b p t d o i weakness  in  Asian  economies.

As in  recent reenbooks,  federal  iscal licy s  projected  o  be  an essentially G f po i t neutral  nfluence  n  aggregate emand.  We  continue o  assume  that aps  on i o d t c discretionary  ending ill e binding nd  that o  new tax-cut  r  spending roposals sp w b a n o p will e enacted ver  the  forecast  eriod.  However, our  projection r he  unified b o p fo t deficits    fiscal  998 and 1999 has  been  cut  noticeably.  ncoming  figures  ave  led  us in 1 I h to  raise  he  "effective"  x  rates  n  the  forecast;   the  same time, pending as t ta i at s h remained  relatively  ak and will e damped by  the  lower  interest tes  e are  now we b ra w anticipating.    now  project  eficits   about  $10 billion  n  both  fiscal  998 and We d of i 1 1999,  versus oughly 25 billion   the  November  Greenbook. r $ in

Recent Developments  and Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

Our guess  is hat eal DP  will ncrease  round  a 4 percent  nnual  rate n  the  current t r G i a a i quarter,  bit ore than  our  November  projection.  he labor arket  report  or a m T m f November  might  argue  for n even  higher igure. n  particular, regate  ours  of a f I agg h private  roduction  orkers  surged  last  onth,  and even  allowing or  decline  n p w m f a i December,  the  fourth-quarter  erage  will e  up sharply--perhaps  ound  4 percent av b ar (annual  rate). acking  on  a labor roductivity  in  remotely pproaching he  pace  of T p ga a t recent  uarters  ould imply  an  enormous increase  n  output. owever, such  an q w i H outcome seems  a stretch   this  oint,  iven he  available  pending  indicators. at p g t s

Data on retail les  hrough ovember indicate  hat ales f  goods got  off o  a sa t N t s o t slow  start  his  uarter; wever,  in  light  f  favorable  undamentals,  e  are  anticipating t q ho o f w a strong oliday ales  ace. In  addition, ending  for ervices  as  been  robust h s p sp s h recently.  verall,  e are  projecting at eal ersonal onsumption  expenditures  ill O w th r p c w rise -1/2 ercent annual ate)  n  the  current  uarter--well  f he  5-3/4  percent ace 3 p ( r i q of t p in  the  summer  quarter  ut  still  ough  to  hold  the ersonal  aving ate t  a low level b en p s r a even  in  the  face f  strong rowth  of  labor ncome. o g i

After  a  tremendous  surge  in  the ast wo  quarters, owth  of  real usiness p t gr b fixed nvestment  ppears o  have  moderated  somewhat this  uarter.  he statistical i a t q T basis or his  ssessment s  skimpy  because  we have  the  crucial  ata n  manufacturers' f t a i d o shipments f  nondefense apital  oods only  through ctober.

Incoming  data  on  prices  ave  been  broadly onsistent th  what was h c wi anticipated   the  November  Greenbook. We  project  hat he  CPI excluding ood  and in t t f energy  will ncrease  t  an  annual  rate f  about  2-1/4 ercent his  uarter  nd  that he i a o p t q a t total  PI will ncrease  he  same amount.1 At earlier ages f  processing, e  core C i t st o th intermediate  oods component of  the  PPI  has  changed  little    the  past everal  onths. g in s m Most recently, ices  f  a wide range  of  industrial  mmodities--along  ith  major pr o co w indexes  of  commodity prices--have treated,  flecting  ple supplies  nd,  perhaps, re re am a an expectation  f  softer  emand on  world  markets.  Average hourly arnings  ncreases o d e i averaged  1/2  percent n  the  past wo months. These  larger  ncreases  ikely  eflect, i t i l r in part,  he  recent inimum  wage hike,  s  well  as  the  technical oblems  with  the t m a pr measure  in  November  that re  discussed  n  Part . Nevertheless,  believe hat  age a i 2 we t w rates  ave  been  responding o ight  abor arkets,  s  indicated  y anecdotal eports  n h t t l m a b r i the  Beige  Book and  elsewhere.

The Outlook for  1998 and 1999

The revision  or  the  current  uarter  as  moved  the rojected  rowth  of  real DP f q h p g G for this  ear  close o  4 percent. e  are  predicting  marked deceleration    the  near erm, y t W a in t with  growth  over  the  course f  1998 amounting  to  1-3/4 ercent. he major  factors o p T explaining  he  slowing  of ggregate emand growth  are: (1)   slackening  n  world t a d a i economic  expansion hat,  long  with  the  appreciation   the  dollar, ould ubstantially t a of sh s restrain port  sales;  2)  a  moderation f he  current  apid rowth  in  household nd ex ( o t r g a business  nvestment,  hich  will e  encouraged i w b by the  substantial  cline  n  share de i prices;  nd  (3) a  diminution  n  the esired  ate f nventory  ccumulation  s a i d r o i a a businesses  erceive hat ales rends  ave weakened appreciably.  s indicated  bove, p t s t h A a this  rojection  ssumes  no  monetary  policy ctions  ver  the  forecast  eriod,  ut  shortp a a o p b term  real nterest tes  ay rise omewhat further  s  inflation pectations ve i ra m s a ex mo closer  o  the  prevailing w rate f  price ncrease. t lo o i

In  addition, usehold ealth  is l s f ho w projected  o  become a less ositive  actor  or eal  onsumption  than t as  been  over t p f f r c i h

the  past -1/2 ears.  With share rices ot  falling   much  as  in  the  previous orecast, 2 y p n as f the  lagged  effects   the  gains n  wealth  to  date  should ominate  in  1998 and  push  the of i d saving  rate own  further.  ut  we estimate  hat ower  stock rices  ill e a slightly d B t l p w b negative actor,   net, or onsumer  demand in  1999. f on f c

Although  we anticipate at ll road  categories   PCE  will ecelerate  n  the th a b of d i next  two years,  he  projected  lowing s specially sible  n  the  durable oods t s i e vi i g category,  here purchases  end  to  be  the  most  cyclically  nsitive d  spending as w t se an h been robust or ome time.  In  particular, es f  light  otor  vehicles  re  expected o f s sal o m a t slip o  about  14-1/2 illion  nits  n  1999,  down  from  the  15 million  nit ace  that  as t m u i u p h prevailed  or he  last  our ears r  so.

Residential  nvestment. i Demand  for ingle-family  using  has  remained s ho strong,  nd  we have  raised  ur  projection little    reflect e  lower  path  for  mortgage a o a to h rates  n  this orecast.  evertheless, sidential  nstruction ould ove down i f N re co sh m somewhat over  the  next  two  years s  slower  growth  in  employment and  income,  along a with  the  loss f  stock arket  wealth, olds ack  activity;  ngle-family  arts ll  rom o m h b si st fa f 1.14  million  nits n  1997 to  1.12  million  n  1998 and 1.10  million  n  1999. u i i i

In  the  multifamily  ector, cancy  rates  ave  edged  down  a  touch  lately, s va h on net, hile  real ents ave  edged  up. Even so, ith  a slower ace  of  economic  activity, w r h w p we expect  multifamily  tarts   slip  ack  below 300,000  units  n  1999.

Inventory  investment. With booming sales,  onfarm inventory  tocks ose n s r substantially  ring he  first ree uarters  f his ear.

As discretionary p w s d o n spending  caps  begin o  bind  in  fiscal  998,  we project  hat  ondefense urchases ill t 1 t n p w increase  ust  /4  percent  n  1998 and  then  drop  back  1-1/4 ercent n  1999. j 3 i p i

Real  purchases y state  nd  local overnments  are  anticipated    increase b a g to a little  re than  2-1/4 ercent er  year  over  the orecast  eriod,  ontinuing  he mo p p f p c t moderate  expansion f  recent ears.  Overall,  he  fiscal  osition  f tates  nd localities o y t p o s a is  quite ound,  and we see  no  reason or his  o  change  in  the ext  couple  of ears. s f t t n y Tax cuts  will e  enacted,  ut  they  are  likely  o  be  modest. And, labor arkets re b b t m a expected o  remain  relatively  ght, ggesting  ittle  ward pressure  n spending  from t ti su l up o welfare eform  during  the  projection riod. r pe

Net exports. We  have  marked down our  projection  f  net  exports,  argely o l because  of  our  more pessimistic ew of  prospects  or he  Asian  economies.

On  the  import ide,  eaker growth  in  domestic  demand in  the  next y s w two years  brings own  the  pace  of  increase  n  imports o  7-3/4 ercent d i t p by 1999,  about half he  rate f  growth  expected his  ear.  Overall,  nticipated  clines  n  net  exports t o t y a de i reduce  real DP  growth  nearly   percentage  oint n G 1 p i 1998 and  about  1/3  percentage point n 1999.

The dollar  lso trengthened  gainst  he  currencies  f  many of  our  developinga s a t o country  trading  artners  uring he  intermeeting riod.  After alling  harply n p d t pe f s i November, the  Korean won stabilized  mporarily  ollowing pproval f  the  IMF-led te f a o support ackage  for  Korea. p 2 Near the  end of  the  period,  he  won  again  fell t precipitously    response o  concerns hat he  planned  financial pport ould  prove in t t t su w insufficient  r  Korea's ear-term inancing  eeds; n balance,  he  won  has  fallen  2 fo n f n o t 4 percent ince  the  November  FOMC s meeting.  The Thai  baht  and Malaysian  ringgit declined bout  12 percent gainst  he  dollar  hereas  the  Indonesian upiah ropped  28 a a t w r d percent. he Hong  Kong dollar  as essentially  changed  although t ame under T w un i c

renewed  pressure  late in  the  period. In  contrast,  the  Mexican  peso  moved  up in  terms of the  dollar 3/4  percent.

Stock  markets  in  most  industrial  countries  largely  recovered  their  October  and early-November  declines  during the  intermeeting  period. Equity  prices  rose  7  percent in Germany  and 5  percent  in  the  United  Kingdom. In  Japan,  stock  prices  remained volatile  as  news  suggested  a moribund  economy  and deepening  problems  in  the financial  sector  intensified  market  concerns  about forthcoming  government  policy measures;  on  balance,  equity  prices  rose  2-1/2  percent  during  the  period. Korean stock prices  declined  28  percent  through  early  December  and  changed  little  on  balance subsequently. Equity  prices  in  Thailand  on  balance  fell  24  percent  since  the November  FOMC  meeting whereas  those  in Malaysia  and  Indonesia  were  down  almost 15  percent. In  contrast,  stock  prices  moved  up 5  percent  in  Hong  Kong  and  1-1/4 percent  in the  Philippines  over  the  period.

Yields  on  ten-year  securities  have  moved  down  in  all  the  major foreign industrial  countries  other  than  Canada  since  the  November  FOMC  meeting. Declines were  as  large  as  44 basis  points  in  Italy. Canadian  rates  rose  19  basis  points  as economic  activity  remained  robust and  the Bank  of  Canada  raised  its official  lending rate. Changes  in short-term  market  rates  were  mixed  for  these  countries  but,  on average,  changed  little.

The  Desk  did not  intervene.

In  most  of the  foreign  G-7  countries,  economic  expansion  remained  brisk  in the third  quarter  and,  based  on  the  few  indicators  available,  in  the  fourth  quarter  as  well. Real  GDP rose  at  an  annual  rate  of 3.2  percent  in  Germany  in  the third  quarter with net exports  again  contributing  most of the  stimulus. Industrial  production  rose  in October after  falling  during  the  two  previous  months,  and business  confidence  moved down  some but remains  high. In  the  United  Kingdom,  real  GDP  growth  was  3.6 percent  at  an  annual  rate in  the  third  quarter;  retail  sales  rebounded  in October,  and manufacturing  orders  rose  further  through  November. Economic  activity  continues  to be  robust  in  Canada,  with  housing  starts  increasing  strongly  in  October  and employment  growth  resuming  in  November  after  having  paused  during  the  previous two months. In  Japan,  GDP growth  resumed  in  the  third  quarter  as  private consumption  and  nonresidential  investment  grew  moderately,  but  residential  investment plunged. Housing  starts  appear  to  have  recovered  a  bit  in  the  most recent  months through  October,  but  industrial  production  declined  in  October,  and  new  car

Real GDP  in  Germany  is  expected o  expand at n annual  rate f  about  2-1/2 t a o percent hrough  the  end  of  1998 and to  accelerate   3 percent n  1999.

Monetary tightening at egan last  pring,  s  well  as  fiscal GD th b s a contraction,  ould  slow  domestic  demand  growth  while  net  exports eteriorate  er sh d ov the  forecast  eriod.

Domestic  demand should  slow as  deceleration i of private  pending  offsets  he  continuing  essening  f  the  drag  from government s t l o spending.

This  downward revision  lmost w a entirely flects  further  arking down of  our  forecasts  or sian  countries.  ur re a m f A O view is  that urther  eaknesses  in  their  inancial ctors  long  with  tightening f w f se a of macroeconomic policies  n  some cases  will xert   substantial  ag  on domestic i e a dr demand  next  year.  Continued  volatility    currency nd equity arkets  in  these in a m countries  uring  1998 is   risk nd  may  weaken growth  even  more.
