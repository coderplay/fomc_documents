THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY

In Japan, the  Liberal emocratic  Party  on March 26 announced  the  outline  f  a D o 짜16 trillion  .2  percent f  GDP)  fiscal  timulus ackage. This  preliminary  ackage  was (3 o s p p heavily eighted  towards  public nvestment,  ith  particular phasis  on the  environment, w i w em education,  nergy, nd disaster-relief ures. he LDP, however,  also  called or  swift e a meas T f consideration   sizable  uts  in  personal ncome and corporate  ax  rates.  The package of c i t included ome proposals or  further  tructural  forms.  Notably, t rged  policymakers o s f s re i u t develop  a global trategy  or  disposing f  the  banking  system's  ollateral-backed  loans s f o c bad and for  revitalizing  e  real state  arket.

The March 26 announcement was too  incomplete o  determine  what share  of  the t 짜16 trillion  adline igure ill ranslate to ctual iscal  timulus.

This  suggests  ew  effective  timulus f  짜6-8  trillion, ewhat  larger f n s o som than  what was  assumed in  the  March Greenbook. The LDP  will ammer  out  the  details  f h o its roposals uring  the  next  month.  After  these etails  re  announced,  the  proposals  ust p d d a m be adopted  by the  government  and approved  by the  Diet.
