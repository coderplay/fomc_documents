Overview

The striking oss-currents  fecting e cr af th U.S. and other conomies  have left  he e t financial rkets  uncertain  nd  volatile   recent eeks--and  made it ifficult ma a in w d to decide ow our  forecast  hould  be  modified.  In  the nd, he  outlook e are h s e t w describing  n  this  reenbook is he  same in  its  road  contours  s  that resented  n i G t b a p i May:  We  are  still oking t  a  decided  deceleration    activity   the  current  uarter lo a in in q and growth  at   subpar  pace  through 999. And,  with  labor arkets emaining ery a 1 m r v tight  hrough ext ear, nd  with  some heretofore lpful  special"  actors  urning t n y a he " f t unfavorable,  rice nflation  ill  rojected  o  trend pward. p i st isp t u

We  estimate  hat rowth  of eal DP  will ome in  somewhere in  the t g r G c neighborhood f  2 percent t  an  annual ate  n  the  second  quarter, f harply  rom o a r i of s f the  more than  5 percent  irst-quarter  e  the  Commerce  Department  is  likely  o f pac t announce  tomorrow. The major  element n  this  lowing  is   substantial  deration i s a mo in  inventory  nvestment  rom  the  inordinate ce  of  the irst arter; en  with  this i f pa f qu ev drop-off, wever,  stocks re  still owing  rapidly, d we therefore  nticipate at ho a gr an a th a further  ownshift n  the ace  of ccumulation ill e  restraining  oduction  ver  the d i p a w b pr o second  half f he  year  as  well,  Meanwhile,  the ncoming  bad  news on the o t i performance f  the  Asian  economies  and,  relatedly,    the  U.S.  trade alance as o on b h also  led  us  to  anticipate   ongoing  drag  from  the  external  ector--not    marked as an s so in  the irst lf f  the  year,  ut  more than  in  our  previous  orecast.  hese  forces f ha o b f T should  contribute   a  slowing  in  the  growth  of ayrolls  nd labor ncome,  in  turn to p a i contributing   a deceleration    domestic  final  emand; that eceleration    in  time to in d d is reinforced  y a  further  eakening  of he  stock arket  associated th  the b w t m wi deterioration   orporate  rofitability  t  ow  seems  to  be  in  train. inc p tha n

Our deceleration  ory ight  be more persuasive  f e could  already oint o st m i w p t an  incipient akening  in  labor emand.  But, ith  payroll  ncreases  f  300,000  per we d w i o month in  April nd  May, about  the  only  hint e have  of  a  softening  s he  reported a w i t slippage  n  the verage  workweek of  production  orkers  this  pring--a etty  hin i a w s pr t statistical  d.  Our low GDP  prediction plicitly  cludes    pause  in roductivity ree im in a p growth  after  he  first-quarter  ge--plausible,   ar rom  a sure hing. t sur butf f t

Be that  s  it ay, with  GDP  growth  running t bout  2  percent  n average a m a a o over  the  next ear  and  a  half,   we are  projecting,  ployment gains ill low  and y as em w s the  unemployment rate lmost  surely ill reep  upward. However,  we see  the a w c

jobless  ate  emaining elow 5 percent,  uggesting  hat orkers  will etain  ufficient r r b s t w r s market  leverage  o  secure urther zable  ains n  real ompensation er  hour.  We t f si g i c p expect hat he  emerging  cost ressures  ill anifest  hemselves n  the rice ide s t t p w m t o p s a well, nd  that  he  overall  PI inflation  te ill ncrease  o  about  2-1/4 ercent  n a t C ra w i t p i 1999,  versus  1.7  percent  n he ast welve  months--despite  few tenths  orth  of i t p t a w damping influence  rom  technical anges  to  the  index. f ch

Key  Background Factors

We  have again  conditioned  ur aseline  orecast  n  the  assumption hat  he  federal o b f o t t funds  rate ill emain  near  5-1/2 ercent hrough  1999. In  recent  eeks,  bond w r p t w yields  ave  eased  somewhat--absolutely  d  relative    our  expectations--as h an to the developments  in  Asia  have  prompted  some flight  ollar  ssets  nd allayed tod a a concerns hat he  Federal eserve  might  tighten  oney  market  conditions.  lthough t t R m A our  forecast  nticipates  at nternational e-haven  onsiderations  ll ecome less a th i saf c wi b important  s  time  passes, growing  perception  hat  he conomic  expansion as a a t t e h moderated  should aintain   firm  tone  to  the  bond  markets.  We  don't  oresee  ongm a f l term  yields  eturning  o  the pper  part f he  recent ange  on  a  persistent  sis ntil r t u o t r ba u next  year.

Our forecast  nticipates  ly  a  modest  further cline  n  share rices  ver  the a on de i p o next  couple  of  quarters  nd  no  change  during  1999. We  continue o  harbor a t considerable  oubt  about he  rationality    current  quity aluations,  d  we d t of e v an therefore  ould  not  be  surprised   see  a  considerably  eeper orrection   profits w to d c as fail  o  meet  the osy  predictions   private  nalysts.  ut  the  market  has  given t r of a B ground  only  grudgingly  n  response o  the egative  ews of  recent  onths,  and  the i t n n m economic scenario  e are  describing  oes  not  include ny events hat ould w d a t w obviously orce nvestors bued with  the  buy-on-dips/hold-for-the-long-term f i im mentality  o  abandon  their  ptimism. t o

Discretionary scal  olicy s  expected o  have  an  essentially  utral  nfluence fi p i t ne i on aggregate emand going  forward.  Although  the  House and Senate  have  put  very d different  scal  ear  1999 budget  proposals  n the able,  e assume that  he  final fi y o t w t legislation  ll ave  little  t  effect  n  the  federal  urplus. he incoming wi h ne o s T information  n receipts d expenditures  as  led  us  to  raise  ur  estimate  f  the o an h o o budget  surplus or iscal  998 a  bit urther,    around  $63 billion.   anticipate f f 1 f to We that n  fiscal  999 the urplus  ill dge  down to  $53 billion,  flecting  e  projected i 1 s w e re th slowing  in  the conomy.

With evidence  of  a further--and  obably ore prolonged--deterioration e pr m in  th Asian  economies  and  indications  ounting  difficulties ussia  and  Brazil,  e ofm in  R w have  marked down considerably  he  outlook or conomic growth  abroad.  We  now t f e expect  that oreign  DP,  on  an  export-weighted sis,  ill ncrease  round  1  percent f G ba w i a this  ear, ith  outright clines  orecast r  Japan  and for any  other sian y w de f fo m A economies;  the  overall  rojected  rowth  rate s  about alf  s  much  as  we thought p g i h a previously.  n  1999,  foreign  rowth  is xpected o  move up to  roughly I g e t 2-1/2  percent, 1/2 percentage  oint elow  the  May  Greenbook  forecast. p b

The dollar  ppreciated  harply gainst  he ther ajor  currencies  a a s a t o m on weighted  average  (narrow  index) asis  etween  the  May  FOMC b b meeting  and the middle  of  June  but as  since eclined  nd is ow  up  a  little  re  than  1  percent n h d a n mo o balance.  We  expect  the  dollar  o  depreciate  lmost  percent rom  its urrent  evel t a 4 f c l by the  end of  1999. Compared with  the  May  forecast,  e  level f  the  dollar  s th o i about  2 percent  igher n  the ear  term, eflecting  cent  evelopments,  ut  is h i n r re d b projected  o  reach   similar  evel t a l by the  end  of  next ear. y

Consequently,  e see  single-family  arts lding w st ho through  the  summer near  the trong .23  million-1.24 llion  nit  ace  of  the irst ve s 1 mi u p f fi months of  the  year.

- 1. OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the  enactment of the President's proposals) are $39 billion in  FY98 and  $54 billion in FY99. In  May 1998, CBO  revised its surplus estimates to  a range of $43 billion to $63 billion for  FY98 and  a range of $30 billion to $40 billion for  FY99. Budget receipts, outlays, and  surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus is excluded from the on-budget deficit and  shown separately as off-budget, as  classified under current law. The  Postal Service deficit is included in  off-budget outlays beginning in  FY90.
- 2.  OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the  enactment of the President's proposals), excluding deposit insurance spending, are $35 billion in  FY98 and $51 billion in  FY99.
- 3. Other means of financing are  checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and  changes in  other financial assets and liabilities.
- 4.  HEB is the NIPA current and capital account surplus in  current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and  outlays adjusted to  the level of potential output associated with an  unemployment rate of 6 percent. Real potential GDP growth is assumed to  rise from 2.3 percent in 1996 to 2.5 percent in 1999, reflecting CPI  modifications. Quarterly figures for  change in HEB  and  FI  are not  at  annual rates. Change in  HEB, as  a percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed in  sign.

International Developments

Recent Developments

Recent  developments  abroad have  been dominated  by  continued  disappointing  news from Asia. Export-weighted  foreign  GDP  growth  came  to  a standstill  in the  first quarter,  and  we  expect  only  a small  improvement  in  the second  quarter. This performance  is considerably  weaker  than  anticipated  in  the  May  Greenbook,  with the downward  revisions  concentrated  in the  Asian  economies. The U.S.  trade  deficit  has continued  to widen,  reflecting  the decline  in  demand  from Asia  and the  strength  of the dollar.

The dollar appreciated  sharply  against the other major currencies  on  a weighted average  basis  between  the  May  FOMC  meeting  and  the middle  of June but  has  since declined  and is  now  up  a little  more  than  1 percent  on balance. The recent movements  in the foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  have  largely  reflected  changes in  the yen,  which  reached  an  eight-year  low  against  the  dollar  on June  15  in  response to  additional  negative  data  on  the  Japanese  economy  and  to  intensified  pessimism about the  ability  of Japanese  authorities  to deal  with the  country's financial  sector problems. The yen weakness  also  put considerable  pressure  on  other  Asian  currencies, notably  the Hong  Kong  dollar and the  Chinese  renminbi. The  yen  appreciated  sharply following coordinated  intervention  by U.S.  and Japanese  authorities  on June  17, including  sales  of $833  million against  yen  from  the  accounts  of the  Treasury  and the System. (This was the  first U.S.  operation  since  August  1995.)

. The  sizable  impact  of the intervention  appeared to be  related  to Secretary  Rubin's  statement  that U.S. participation  was  "in  the context  of Japan's plans to  strengthen its  economy." However,  the  market  was  subsequently  disappointed  when  there  were  no immediate follow-up  actions;  the  yen weakened  again and  is  now  about  3  percent  lower against the  dollar than  it was  at  the  time  of the  last FOMC  meeting. Japanese  long-term interest rates  mirrored  the  movements  in the  dollar-yen  rate. The Nikkei  equity  price index  was  relatively  stable  over the  intermeeting  period.

The  dollar  has  shown  little  net  change  since  the  May FOMC  meeting  against the mark and  other continental  European  currencies,  as  long-term rates  in these countries  fell  in  conjunction  with  U.S.  long  rates  while  short-term rates  changed  little. In  contrast, sterling  has  appreciated  nearly  3  percent relative  to  the  dollar  in  response to  recent  information  suggesting  that the  economy  is  not  slowing  as  much  as  had  been anticipated. Concern  that  U.K.  inflation  may be  rising prompted  a  surprise  25-basis-
