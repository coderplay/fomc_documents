Concerns about Turkey's banking system  threatened to develop into a financial crisis.  Foreign  exchange reserves flowed out, putting pressure  on the country's crawling peg exchange  rate system,  and domestic  overnight deposit  rates for some banks  spiked as high as 1,950 percent in early December after the Central Bank of Turkey ceased to provide  emergency liquidity.  Rates later eased back to around 100 percent following the announcement  by the Managing  Director of the IMF that he  was prepared to recommend  a new Supplemental  Reserve Facility  for Turkey to the IMF Executive  Board.  Turkish EMBI+  spreads widened 312 basis points before the announcement,  but narrowed  111  basis points subsequently. The equity market fell 44 percent  ahead of the IMF announcement,  but later rebounded sharply.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the  accounts of the System or the Treasury.
