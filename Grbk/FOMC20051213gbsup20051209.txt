Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Erratum

On page I-17 of the December 7, 2005, Greenbook, in the discussion of the 'stronger aggregate demand' scenario, the text states that "the personal saving rate rises to only ½ percent by late 2007 under the baseline monetary policy."  In fact, in this scenario, the saving rate rises to ¾ percent by late 2007 under the baseline monetary policy.

Michigan Survey

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment jumped seven points in the first half of December to 88.7. Together with last month's seven point gain, this brings the index back to its level prior to Hurricane Katrina.

The December rise owed to gains in both the 'expected conditions' and the 'current conditions' components of the overall index.  Both of the 'current conditions' components and all three of the 'expected conditions' components rose, with the largest gain in expectations of personal finances.

Among those items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened a little, and appraisals of buying conditions for houses fell considerably.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars improved.

Mean inflation expectations rose a little in early December.  The mean expected inflation over the next twelve months ticked up to 4.2 percent, and the mean expected inflation over the next five to ten years rose to 3.5 percent.  In contrast, median expected inflation over the next twelve months fell a little, and median expected inflation over the next five to ten years was unchanged.

Unemployment Insurance Claims

Initial claims for unemployment insurance under state programs increased 6,000 to 327,000 for the week ending December 3.  The four-week moving average of initial claims remained at 323,000.  The level of insured unemployment under state programs fell 137,000 to 2.6 million for the week ending November 26.  The insured unemployment rate ticked down to 2 percent from the previous week's downward-revised level of 2.1 percent.

Excluding motor vehicles, inventories at wholesalers rose only $0.2 billion in October, and the inventory-sales ratio in this category edged down to 1.11 months.
