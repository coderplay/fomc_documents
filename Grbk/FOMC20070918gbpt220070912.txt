Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The incoming nonfinancial economic data, most of which pertain to the period before the recent turbulence in financial markets, suggest that economic activity advanced at a moderate pace early in the third quarter.  Notably, retail sales and orders and shipments of capital goods posted solid gains in July.  However, residential investment weakened further even before the recent disruptions in mortgage markets.  In addition, private payrolls posted only a small gain in August, and manufacturing production appears to have slowed.  Meanwhile, core inflation, although having risen a bit from the unusually low rates of increase in the spring, remained moderate through July.

Labor Market Developments

Private nonfarm payroll employment rose only 24,000 in August, and the levels of employment in June and July were revised down.  As a result, private-sector hiring now appears to have decelerated further over the summer: Increases averaged about 70,000 per month over the three months ending in August, compared with gains near 120,000 per month in the first five months of this year and gains of about 165,000 per month in the second half of 2006. 1

The weakness in job gains last month was spread fairly widely across industries. Employment in residential construction and manufacturing posted noticeable declines; employment in wholesale trade and transportation was little changed; and hiring at business services was well below recent trends.   With payroll employment up modestly 2 and the workweek flat, aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers in August held steady at a level 0.2 percent (not at an annual rate) above their secondquarter level.

However, in contrast to August's weak employment report, other indicators do not suggest any marked slowdown in labor market conditions.  Indicators of layoffs-initial claims for unemployment insurance, the short-term job losers rate from the household survey, and the announcements of downsizing plans as measured by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc.-moved up in August but remained no higher than readings of earlier

this year.  Indicators of hiring-hiring plans in surveys by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) and Manpower-were little changed so far this quarter. Auxiliary indicators of labor market tightness-the insured unemployment rate and survey measures from the NFIB and the Conference Board-also suggest little change.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.6 percent in August, 0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter level and equal to its 2006 average.  The labor force participation rate dropped back to 65.8 percent-a decline that occurred, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, because the relatively late survey reference week captured more of the outflow from summer jobs than usual.  Apart from a few months last fall and winter, the labor force participation rate has hovered between 66.0 percent and 66.2 percent for more than two years.

Productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the second quarter after a 0.7 percent rate of increase in the first quarter.  Even including this acceleration, labor productivity in this sector rose only 0.9 percent over the four quarters ending in 2007:Q2, Â¾ percentage point less than in the comparable period four quarters earlier.

Industrial Production

Industrial production for August will be published on Friday.  The information currently in hand suggests that total industrial production (IP) was boosted in August by a weatherrelated surge in electricity generation.  Meanwhile, production in the manufacturing sector appears to have slowed following widespread gains in the preceding two months. Manufacturing IP rose 0.6 percent in June and July, supported by solid gains in exports

and a diminishing drag from inventories; the advances in output in those months were fairly widespread.  Looking forward, although available indicators of manufacturing activity have been generally positive, scheduled cuts in motor vehicle production and continued weakness in residential construction should prove to be a material drag on manufacturing IP in the coming months.  As of July, capacity utilization in manufacturing stood 0.9 percentage point above its 1972-2006 average.

Light motor vehicle production has maintained an average pace a bit below 11 million units since June, a noticeable step-up from the low levels of production seen near the turn of the year, when automakers cut production to bring their inventories back in line with sales.  However, because sales have softened, on average, this summer, inventories of light vehicles are again somewhat elevated; days' supply for domestic light vehicles stood at 69 at the end of August, a fair bit above the standard industry target of about 65. As a result, industry schedules for September have been pared back to 10.9 million units. Moreover, initial assembly plans for the fourth quarter call for production to drop to 10.2 million units, as automakers expect sales to remain tepid through the end of the year. These schedules are preliminary and frequently revised.  Nonetheless, if realized, the substantial pullback in motor vehicle production could subtract up to 1 percentage point from the annual rate of change in total IP in the fourth quarter.

Output in the high-technology sector increased 1.5 percent in July and thus continued the modest acceleration of the preceding few months.  The output of communications equipment rose solidly in both June and July, in part because of robust enterprise demand for voice and data networking equipment.  In addition, recent industry anecdotes suggest that capital expenditures by telecommunications service providers, which had been running a bit on the soft side, will pick up in the second half of the year.  The acceleration in production of communications equipment was partly offset by a deceleration in computer production, which slowed to a monthly growth rate of 0.8 percent in June and July after an average monthly rate of 3 percent in the first five months of the year. Gartner's projections for the third quarter show a decline in unit sales of personal computers (PCs) as the boost from the retail release of Microsoft Vista unwinds.

Production in most categories of semiconductors rose in June and July after a period of uneven gains earlier this year.  The principal constraints on output appear to be diminishing:  Semiconductor inventories are now at more comfortable levels, and industry anecdotes point to rising chip demand at manufacturers of PCs, cell phones, and consumer electronics.  In particular, Intel recently revised up significantly its thirdquarter revenue guidance to reflect stronger-than-expected demand.  Nevertheless, gains

in semiconductor production during the next few months are unlikely to be as strong as they were last year.  Looking further ahead, the Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International book-to-bill ratio dropped in July to its lowest level since May of 2005, a sign that chip manufacturers are slowing their pace of capacity expansion.

On balance, production among the major market groups outside of motor vehicles and parts, energy, and high technology rose 0.3 percent in July after an increase of 0.5 percent in June.  The output of consumer goods increased for the second consecutive month, as a rise in consumer nondurables offset declines in consumer durables such as household appliances, carpeting, and furniture.  Production of business equipment popped up in July, on the strength of further advances in commercial aircraft and a rebound in the output of farm machinery, which had declined sharply in June.  The output of construction supplies edged down in July after four months of production increases that appeared to be driven by gains associated with nonresidential construction.  The output of industrial materials moved up 0.4 percent in July, and gains were recorded in both durable and nondurable materials.

The preliminary indicators of manufacturing activity in August, such as production worker hours and some physical product data, point to a slowdown in production after the strong gains in June and July.  In coming months, the direct and upstream effects of scheduled reductions in motor vehicle production and the ongoing contraction in residential construction will likely be a drag on IP.  That said, other indicators of nearterm manufacturing activity have been generally positive.  The August reading on the diffusion index for new orders, as reported by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), remained at a level consistent with moderate output gains in the coming months, and the three-month moving average of the change in real adjusted durable goods orders showed a modest increase in July.  Moreover, according to the staff's flow of goods inventory system, inventories in manufacturing outside of motor vehicles and parts appear well aligned with demand.  Finally, domestic production continues to benefit from robust foreign demand.  The export share of manufactured products-defined as the ratio of nominal exports to nominal shipments-moved up further in July from an already elevated level in June, and the export orders index from the ISM edged up further in August.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light vehicles bounced back to an annual rate of 16.2 million units in August after having plunged earlier in the summer.  The rebound in sales was concentrated at the

Detroit Three automakers, which introduced some targeted incentive programs over the course of the month that likely brought back some customers who had postponed their vehicle purchases while waiting for better deals.   Vehicle sales in August may also have 3 been boosted by the recent declines in gasoline prices after the steep run-up in preceding months.

Even with the upturn in August, sales have averaged 15.9 million units at an annual rate since the end of the first quarter, down from the robust rate that prevailed at the turn of the year.  The more moderate sales pace seems consistent with recent indicators of demand.  Consumers' perceptions of car-buying conditions in the Reuters/University of Michigan survey continued to recover in August from the dip in June.  However, sentiment in August was still less buoyant than during the first quarter of 2007, as consumers expressed dissatisfaction with vehicle prices and remained anxious about gasoline prices.  High gasoline prices continue to depress the demand for larger vehicles such as sport-utility vehicles and full-size pickup trucks.  The slowdown in residential construction also is reported to be damping sales of heavier-duty full-size pickup trucks, as a sizable portion of these sales are made to workers in construction-related industries. Given that weakness in housing activity is likely to persist well into next year, sales of these vehicles could remain at low levels for an extended period.  Because this segment of the market is dominated by the domestic producers, the domestic market share of the Detroit Three receded further, on balance, in July and August, from its level in the second quarter.  Meanwhile, sales by transplant firms have trended up this year, and data from the major Japanese automakers indicate that sales in early September were higher than in August.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending appears to have strengthened early this summer from its subdued second-quarter pace.  Although auto sales were weak in July, real outlays for other goods rose briskly.  At the same time, spending on services was up moderately despite a drop in outlays for energy services associated with relatively cool weather in the eastern part of the country.   In August, warmer weather likely caused an increase in energy usage, and vehicle sales stepped up.

Real disposable personal income (DPI) increased at an annual rate of 2Â¾ percent, on average, over the first half of this year despite the sharp increase in energy prices.  More recently, estimates for July by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) show a Â½ percent increase (not at an annual rate) in real DPI, as wages and salaries posted a strong gain and energy prices came down.   The personal saving rate fell back in the second quarter after 4 jumping in the first quarter on the strength of large bonuses.  Smoothing through these fluctuations, the saving rate has been on a gradual upward trend over the past year.  July's small increase continued this trajectory and brought the saving rate to Â¾ percent, about 1 percentage point higher than its year-earlier level.

Despite the robust income gains of late, household wealth is likely providing a diminishing impetus to the pace of spending.  The ratio of wealth to income flattened out in the first half of this year, as a deceleration in house prices appears to have largely offset a further rise in stock market wealth.  Thus far in the third quarter, the ratio of wealth to income has likely fallen, reflecting recent declines in stock market wealth and an apparent further deceleration in house prices.

Readings on consumer sentiment from both the Reuters/Michigan and Conference Board surveys turned down in August, thereby reversing their July gains.  The August level of sentiment was below the level that would normally be associated with the prevailing values of other indicators (such as inflation, labor market developments, and stock prices), an indication that sentiment may have been affected by concerns about the recent turmoil in financial markets.   Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the Michigan 5 measure has been drifting down since the start of the year, although the Conference Board survey remains in the range it has tracked since early 2006.

12 percent and 9 percent, respectively, from their averages over the second half of last year.  Demand this year has been restrained by deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market and by a net increase since early May of 30 basis points in rates for thirty-year fixed-rate conforming mortgages.  Recently, the availability of financing to borrowers in the nonconforming mortgage markets appears to have been crimped even further.  Nonprime mortgage originations (which include both subprime and alt-A categories) slowed to a trickle in July and August; spreads between rates for prime nonconforming (jumbo) and conforming thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages jumped to about 1 percentage point in August after having held steady near Â¼ percentage point since 2001; and lenders have apparently adopted tighter lending standards for these loans.

Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand point to a further deterioration in sales in the near term.  The index of pending home sales agreements-which tends to lead existing home sales by one to two months-tumbled 12 percent in July.  Although this drop followed an increase of 5 percent in June, July's reading is 17 percent below the level seen in the second half of last year.  The Reuters/Michigan index of homebuyer sentiment-which often anticipates substantial movements in home sales-dropped significantly in August and now shows a four-month decline that is comparable with the one seen when sales began to fall from their peak in the late summer of 2005.  Anecdotal reports from homebuilders suggest that sales of new homes fell appreciably in August and that a lack of confidence in the housing market would likely restrain demand considerably for the rest of the year.  The four-week moving average of the mortgage purchase index dropped back noticeably in early September but still stands well above its level in mid-April.  The net increase in this index since late spring may be somewhat misleading because of distortions related to recent developments in nonprime mortgage markets. 6

Single-family housing starts slid 7Â¼ percent to an annual rate of 1.07 million units in July-their lowest reading since 1996-and adjusted single-family permit issuance continued on a downward trajectory.  Although single-family housing starts have come down more than 40 percent from their peak, they have lagged behind the collapse in demand.  As a result, the months' supply of new homes has risen considerably, on

balance, this year, and in July it stood about 60 percent above the upper bound of the fairly tight range it had occupied between 1997 and the summer of 2005.

.  In the multifamily sector, starts were at an annual rate of 311,000 units in July, in line with readings thus far this year and at the low end of the fairly narrow range seen since 1997.

House prices have continued to decelerate.  The second-quarter reading of the purchaseonly version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was 2.6 percent higher than it was a year earlier, a considerably smaller gain than the 8.2 percent increase posted over the preceding fourquarter period.  The ten-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-price index has decelerated even more noticeably and shows an outright decline of 4 percent in the twelve months ending in June.    The average price of existing homes sold-which is 7 available on a more timely basis than are these other measures but is not quality adjusted-was about unchanged in July relative to twelve months earlier.  The constant quality price index for new homes-which adjusts for the geographic composition of sales, square footage, and other readily measurable attributes-was just 0.6 percent higher in the second quarter than four quarters earlier but down from the 3.9 percent appreciation posted in the preceding year. 8

Equipment and Software

We currently estimate that real spending on equipment and software (E&amp;S) increased at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter, moving back up after two weak quarters.  Smoothing through that period of softness and the subsequent rebound, spending gains have been modest on average since the middle of 2006 after a period of

more-rapid expansion.  The available data so far for the third quarter point to further moderate spending increases.

The slowdown in the average rate of increase in business outlays on E&amp;S over the past few quarters likely reflects the gradual deceleration in business output since early last year.  Although corporate cash reserves have shrunk over the past two quarters, they remain at high levels, and the user cost of capital goods has continued to decline.  More recently, however, the turmoil in financial markets has raised financing costs for lowergrade borrowers and may be clouding the environment for business decisionmaking more generally.  Surveys of business conditions-such as those conducted by the ISM, the Philadelphia Fed, and the NFIB-are some of the very few indicators timely enough to have been influenced by recent financial events.  These measures suggest that increases in business activity were somewhat slower in August than in the second quarter.  The August NFIB survey on loan availability showed some modest deterioration in current and expected credit conditions.

Real outlays on high-tech E&amp;S expanded at an annual rate of about 9 percent in the second quarter on the heels of an even larger gain in the first quarter.  More recently, July's data on computer industrial production and shipments point to solid increases, on net, early in the third quarter.  Shipments of communications equipment dipped somewhat in July, but orders remained above shipments, suggesting that additional gains should be in the offing.  The strength in communications spending seen so far this year seems to be centered outside of telecommunications service providers (TSPs) because it reflects gains mainly in items that are not usually purchased by these companies.  By contrast, the capital expenditures guidance for TSPs called for a more moderate level of spending this year, and industry anecdotes suggest that expenditures in the first half of the year were even a bit below the industry's expectations.

Real business outlays on transportation equipment dropped at an annual rate of nearly 25 percent in the second quarter, and data for July and August do not point to a rebound in the current quarter.  Indicators of business-sector spending for motor vehicles have been mixed in recent months.

sales of medium and heavy trucks fell in July, continuing a downward trajectory that began soon after the introduction of more-stringent regulations on truck engines at the beginning of the year.  However, new orders for medium and heavy trucks increased in June and July, signaling that the sales slump may be coming to an end.  That said, the outlook for spending on these trucks remains uncertain; freight shipping volumes have been weak in recent months, which our industry contacts largely attribute to the

slowdown in residential construction.  Aircraft spending remained at a high level in the second quarter after a surge in the first quarter, but aircraft shipments in July and information on Boeing's deliveries suggest that domestic spending on aircraft is retreating somewhat in the third quarter.

Real business investment in equipment other than high-tech and transportation bounced back strikingly in the second quarter, increasing at an annual rate of more than 11 percent after three consecutive quarterly declines.  However, the level of spending in the second quarter remained somewhat below its level a year earlier.  In July, imports of this broad category rose more than exports, and orders and shipments registered a robust increase, pointing to solid increases in business investment in the third quarter.  In particular, shipments of industrial machinery rebounded in July after two months of declines. Moreover, after having plummeted earlier in the year, shipments of construction machinery continued to recover, apparently because of increased demand from nonresidential construction and from abroad.

Nonresidential Construction

We currently estimate that real spending on construction of nonresidential buildings increased at an annual rate of close to 20 percent in the second quarter.  Data for the third quarter are limited, but the nonfinancial fundamentals remain generally solid.  Vacancy rates in this sector are lower than their averages of the past five years despite having edged up in recent quarters.  Furthermore, the three-month moving average of the architectural billings index-which is well correlated to spending six months hence-was at a high level in July, pointing to strong gains into early next year.  However, this rosy outlook is tempered by the recent turmoil in credit markets.  Spreads on BBB-rated commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) have risen 94 basis points since early August.  Although CMBS do not generally include construction loans, the higher cost of secondary market financing may put downward pressure on prices of existing commercial real estate, thereby discouraging new construction projects.

The BEA's preliminary estimate of activity in the drilling and mining sector jumped at an annual rate of 48 percent in the second quarter after a small decline in the first quarter. The second-quarter increase stands in contrast with incoming data for the number of rigs in operation, which registered only a small rise in the second quarter.   Gains in the 9 number of rigs in operation remained modest in July and August, suggesting that investment early in the third quarter has been little changed.  Looking forward, anecdotes in the most recent Beige Book suggest that incentives for further expansion of natural gas drilling have been damped by recent price declines and persistently high inventories.

Business Inventories

Real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles increased at a moderate annual rate of $9 billion last quarter, the same as in the first quarter.  Book-value data for the manufacturing and wholesale trade sectors point to a somewhat slower pace of inventory accumulation in July.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales in the manufacturing and trade sector, excluding motor vehicles, changed little in June after declining in previous months from the elevated levels seen in late 2006.  Information from the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that the months' supply of goods excluding motor vehicles and parts edged down in July.  Purchasing managers do not appear to see a problem with the level of their customers' inventories, as the ISM customers' inventories index moved back below 50 in August.

Federal Government Sector

After having declined steadily in the past three years, the federal budget deficit has leveled off in recent months, as receipts have decelerated a bit more than outlays.  For the twelve months ending in July 2007, the deficit (adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transaction) was $180 billion, or approximately 1Â¼ percent of nominal GDP. 10

Although receipts have been rising more slowly recently, revenues in July still were almost 7 percent above their year-earlier level.  Individual income and payroll tax revenues, which made up the bulk of receipts in July, were a robust 8 percent above their

10

The Congressional Budget Office released an update of its budget outlook on August 23 that projected the unadjusted deficit for fiscal 2007 to be $158 billion, which is lower than its estimate of

$177 billion in March, primarily because of greater-than-expected receipts.

level a year earlier.  In contrast, corporate tax payments were a little below their yearearlier level.  Data from Daily Treasury Statements indicate that individual income and payroll receipts continued to rise at a solid pace in August, but that corporate revenues remained below their level twelve months earlier.

Federal spending also has been slowing over the past year, but in July outlays rose briskly to a level more than 8 percent above their year-earlier level.  In particular, defense spending in July was more than 12 percent higher than the level a year earlier. Nevertheless, federal spending cumulated over the twelve months ending in July was up only 4 percent from its level in the year-earlier period.

Since returning from its recess, the Congress has continued to work on the annual appropriations bills necessary to fund discretionary federal spending in fiscal 2008, which begins October 1.  So far, the House has passed all of the twelve appropriations bills, but the Senate has only passed five, and none has been enacted.  A continuing resolution will be needed to fund agencies covered by appropriations bills that have not been enacted by the start of the new fiscal year.

State and Local Government Sector

Taken at face value, the incoming data point to very weak state and local purchases in the third quarter.  According to the most recent employment report, state and local employment fell 26,000 in August after having dropped 58,000 in July.  Much of the recent weakness is in local education, where employment is reported to have fallen a cumulative 100,000 between May and August after having increased substantially between mid-2006 and the spring of this year.  Given the usual volatility of these data in summer months-as well as their apparent inconsistency with other information on activity in the sector-we would not be surprised to see either significant upward revisions to the published data or a dramatic rebound in hiring in September.  Meanwhile, real construction spending appears to have retained considerable vigor in July after having risen appreciably in the first half of the year.

On the whole, state fiscal positions remain sound.  The preliminary State Budget &amp; Tax Actions 2007 report from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) suggests that states in the aggregate experienced a hefty increase in general-fund spending in fiscal 2007 (which ended on June 30 in most states) but still finished the year with sizable

balances in their reserve funds. 11 That said, current fiscal conditions do not have the luster that was evident a year ago, mainly because revenue inflows have tapered off after a period of outsized increases. 12 According to the NCSL, aggregate reserve balances at the end of fiscal 2007 were somewhat smaller than those at the end of fiscal 2006, and with spending slated to rise moderately in fiscal 2008 (and revenues expected to remain subdued), reserves may decline further over the coming year.  Moreover, several states are concerned about budget prospects beyond the current fiscal year.  For example, California adopted a budget in late August that is expected to be balanced for fiscal 2008; however, if current policies remain in place, the state is likely to face significant operating shortfalls in 2009 and 2010.

Prices

After rapid increases earlier this year, headline consumer price inflation was moderate in both June and July as energy prices fell.  Over the twelve months ending in July, total PCE prices were up about 2 percent, down from the 3Â½ percent increase posted over the previous twelve months.  Excluding food and energy, PCE inflation also has been moderate in recent months, although it has drifted up a touch from its very low rates this spring.  Despite the recent volatility in energy prices, long-run inflation expectations have remained within the range that has prevailed during much of the past few years.

Core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in June and 0.1 percent in July.  Although quite modest, these increases were enough to cause the three-month change in core PCE prices to edge up to 1.6 percent in July from 1.1 percent in May.  The latest three-month change was boosted by prices of apparel and housing services, both of which moved up after low readings in the spring.  On a twelve-month-change basis, core PCE inflation has decelerated from 2.3 percent in July 2006 to 1.9 percent in July 2007.  Step-downs in price inflation for prescriptions drugs, motor vehicles, and nonmarket services account for nearly all of the deceleration in core PCE prices.  Although owners' equivalent rent decelerated over the past year, this change was largely offset by an acceleration in tenants' rent and lodging away from home; on balance, changes in the prices of housing

services were not an important contributor to the past year's deceleration in core PCE inflation.

Energy prices declined 1 percent in July after having fallen Â½ percent in June.  Gasoline prices moved down 1Â¾ percent in July and appear to have dropped even more in August, even though inventories remain near the low end of their normal range.  These recent declines in gasoline prices have coincided with a sharp narrowing of the margin between retail gasoline prices and crude oil prices and their move to more-normal levels after reaching record highs in May.  Despite some large swings, PCE energy prices as of July stood only Â½ percent higher than their year-earlier level.  In contrast, energy-price increases ranged from 14 percent to 22 percent in each of the preceding three years.

In July, food prices continued their string of sizable increases observed since January. Some of this year's increase reflects the difficulty of quickly expanding livestock herds and flocks, which had been pruned earlier in response to low prices, but a significant portion of the step-up appears to be a pass-through of high corn prices, which have been boosted by strong demand for ethanol.  Corn prices have fallen back over the past few months, although the spot price remains about 40 percent higher than it was a year ago. Prices of some other grains, including wheat and soybeans, have surged as well, because output was reduced by adverse weather and a shift of acreage to corn production.  Over the twelve months ending in July, the PCE price index for food and beverages has increased 4 percent, compared with a rise of 2Â¼ percent in the previous year.  The acceleration has been most apparent for comestibles for which corn is a major input; for instance, beef prices in July were up 6Â½ percent from a year earlier, poultry prices were up nearly 8 percent, milk prices had jumped 18 percent, and egg prices had surged 34 percent.  By contrast, for food in purchased meals-a relatively stable component of consumer price inflation for which labor is a much larger share of overall costs-prices were 3Â½ percent higher in July than a year earlier, an acceleration of only about Â½ percentage point from the previous twelve months.

Measures of inflation expectations remain moderate.  As measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey, the median expectation for year-ahead inflation declined to 3.2 percent in August-still 0.2 percentage point above its level at the turn of the yearand the median expectation over the next five to ten years fell to 2.9 percent, the low end of the range seen in the past couple of years.  Readings on inflation expectations over the next ten years in the Survey of Professional Forecasters were mixed:  CPI expectations were unchanged in August, at 2.4 percent, while PCE price expectations-used in the FRB/US model-edged up to 2.1 percent.  Five-year inflation compensation derived

from TIPS ticked down since the time of the August Greenbook, but forward inflation compensation over the subsequent five years is unchanged.

Price increases for goods at earlier stages of processing have slowed recently.  The PPI for core intermediate materials increased 0.2 percent in July, to a level only 2Â½ percent above its level a year earlier; the modest rise was considerably less than the 8 percent increase over the preceding twelve months, as prices for most energy-intensive products have decelerated over the past year.  Since the August Greenbook, commodity prices have dropped, even though they remain considerably higher than their year-earlier levels. The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has fallen 3Â¼ percent since the August Greenbook, and the Commodity Research Bureau's index of industrial spot prices has dropped 7Â½ percent.

Labor Costs

Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter after having increased at an upward-revised rate of 6 percent in the first quarter.  The increase over the past four quarters-5Â¾ percent-is noticeably above the increase in the preceding four quarters and also well above the increase seen in the employment cost index (ECI) over the same period. 13 Combined with the deceleration in output per hour, the compensation data imply that unit labor costs have continued to accelerate, with the change over the four quarters ending in 2007:Q2 at 5 percent.  As a result, the markup of nonfarm business prices over unit labor costs has fallen back from its peak at the end of last year, although it remains above its long-run average.

More recently, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers increased 0.3 percent in both July and August, putting the twelve-month change in this measure of wages at 3.9 percent, only a little below the change for the twelve months ending in August 2006.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Amid heightened unease about exposure to subprime mortgages and about structured credit products more generally, conditions in short-term funding markets deteriorated significantly after the August 7 FOMC meeting.  Rates jumped on both asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) and unsecured commercial paper from lower-rated issuers, and the outstanding amount of paper contracted sharply.  Increased desire for liquidity put upward pressure on interbank lending rates and resulted in impaired functioning in term interbank funding markets.  In response, the Federal Reserve took several measures to support liquidity.  These actions and announcements seemed to improve conditions in overnight markets, but considerable stress has remained in the commercial paper and term funding markets.

Investors significantly marked down their expected path for the federal funds rate and now appear virtually certain that the FOMC will ease policy at this meeting.  Largely reflecting the change in policy expectations, two-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 50 basis points since the August 7 FOMC meeting, and ten-year yields decreased about 35 basis points.  In corporate securities markets, yields on investment-grade and speculative-grade bonds declined-albeit somewhat less than Treasury yields-and equity prices were volatile but about unchanged on balance.  In the household sector, securitization of nonconforming mortgages remained very limited and credit conditions tightened further for borrowers seeking those types of loans.

Money Market Functioning

Days after the August 7 FOMC meeting, U.S. and European commercial paper markets came under severe pressure after a large foreign bank suspended redemptions at some high-yield money funds it sponsored that held relatively large positions in ABCP.  As yields on ABCP spiked, investors sought the relative safety of short-term Treasury securities and yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped sharply.  Functioning in the bill market was notably impaired at times, with reports of exceptionally high bid-ask spreads.  In the repo market, the demand for Treasury collateral increased sharply, particularly in the bill segment, and overnight repo rates for general collateral fell far below the federal funds rate.  Unsecured bank funding markets also showed signs of stress, including volatile overnight interbank lending rates, elevated term interbank rates, and illiquidity in term funding markets.

The Federal Reserve responded to strained conditions in short-term markets in a number of ways.  On August 9 and 10, the Trading Desk provided significant levels of balances

to the banking sector, and on August 10, the Federal Reserve announced that it would 'provide reserves as necessary through open market operations to promote trading in the federal funds market' and noted that 'the discount window is available as a source of funding.'  On August 17, the FOMC issued a statement noting that financial market conditions had deteriorated and that 'tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward.'  That day, the Federal Reserve temporarily reduced the primary credit rate 50 basis points and announced changes in practices to allow the provision of term primary credit to large as well as small depository institutions.  Later, the Federal Reserve clarified the acceptability of some ABCP as collateral for discount window borrowing, and, to help ease pressures in the bill market, the Trading Desk announced a temporary reduction-from 100 basis points to 50 basis points-in the minimum fee for borrowing securities from the SOMA Securities Lending Facility.

These actions by the Federal Reserve reportedly helped improve conditions in the Treasury bill market and in overnight funding markets.  For example, the spread between the federal funds rate and the corresponding Treasury general collateral rate has returned to more normal levels.  Although the level of the effective federal funds rate has remained somewhat below the target rate, trading liquidity in the overnight federal funds market has appeared ample, with record levels of brokered volumes.  In contrast to overnight money markets, liquidity in term funding markets has remained poor and term premiums in short-dated securities have been quite elevated.  In addition, the spread between one-month libor and overnight index swaps has stayed exceptionally wide, suggesting a persistent reluctance among banks to commit term funds. 1

Interest Rates and Policy Expectations

Over the intermeeting period, ongoing developments in short-term credit markets and a few key data releases drove down the expected path for the federal funds rate.  The FOMC's decision at its August 7 meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged at 5Â¼ percent, the accompanying statement, and the subsequent release of the minutes were all about in line with market expectations, and reactions in financial markets were muted.  Neither the August 10 nor the August 17 statements by the Federal Reserve

elicited large changes in interest rates.  More recently, weaker-than-expected reports on housing activity and employment appeared to solidify market expectations for an easing of policy at the September meeting.  Binary options on the target federal funds rate after the upcoming meeting suggest that investors now assign roughly even odds to 50 and 25 basis point reductions in the target funds rate at the upcoming meeting.  The Desk's survey of primary dealers suggests similar expectations for the policy decision, and many dealers report that they expect the Committee's statement to indicate that downside risks to growth are the predominant policy concern.

Looking further ahead, futures market quotes imply that the expected federal funds rate at the end of 2008 is now about 4 percent, roughly 50 basis points lower than at the time of the August FOMC meeting.  The distribution of the expected federal funds derived from options widened considerably since early August, and Eurodollar-implied volatilities six and twelve months ahead hit multiyear highs in mid-August.  In line with this rise in volatility, several indicators suggest that term premiums along the Eurodollar curve jumped over the intermeeting period.

Two-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 50 basis points, on net, since August 6, as investors marked down the expected path of monetary policy.  Five- and ten-year nominal Treasury yields declined about 50 and 35 basis points respectively.  Quotes on TIPS suggest that almost all of the decreases in these yields can be attributed to real yields.  Thus, implied inflation compensation over the next five years and five to ten years ahead were both about unchanged.

Stock Prices, Corporate Yields, and Risk Spreads

Broad equity price indexes were volatile over the intermeeting period, but the net changes were small.  After reaching a peak in mid-August, options-implied volatility retreated, though it remained well above its range for most of the past several years.  The spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-opened up a bit more over the intermeeting period after having widened in late July and early August.

Conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated markedly over the intermeeting period.  The difficulties were triggered by apprehension about potential losses associated with mortgage-related assets in ABCP programs, but they then spread to other ABCP programs and to lower-rated unsecured commercial paper programs as well.  ABCP spreads soared to record levels, and some conduits, particularly those holding mortgage

assets, were unable to roll over maturing paper.  These developments led several programs to draw on backup lines, extend the maturity of their paper, or even to default. On a seasonally adjusted basis, total ABCP outstanding has dropped nearly 20 percent since the August 7 FOMC meeting.

Yields on investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds fell a little less than those on comparable-maturity Treasuries, leaving their spreads slightly above the already higher levels prevailing at the time of the August 7 FOMC meeting.  Both investmentgrade and speculative-grade bond spreads are near their highest levels in four years, although they are still far below the peaks seen in mid-2002.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Both the NIPA measures and S&amp;P earnings per share point to further increases in profits in the second quarter, although the pace was more moderate than it was a year ago. Revisions to analysts' year-ahead expected earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 were slightly positive through mid-August.  Since then, however, expectations have likely deteriorated after a number of financial firms warned that credit market losses would hold down their profits in the near term.  Among financial firms, profit expectations for investment banks were marked down further as analysts factored in a drop-off in fees from reduced leveraged buyout activity.

Over the intermeeting period, the available measures of corporate credit quality remained strong, but they generally reflect conditions before the onset of financial turmoil.  In the second quarter, the liquidity of nonfinancial corporate balance sheets stayed high by historical standards, while leverage rose slightly from low levels.  Rating downgrades on corporate bonds continued to be modest in July, and the six-month trailing bond default rate remained near zero through August.  KMV's aggregate year-ahead expected default rate also stayed near record lows in July.

Business Finance

After having been tepid in July, gross bond issuance by investment-grade nonfinancial corporations rebounded strongly last month, whereas speculative-grade issuance increased only a touch.  Speculative-grade bond deals and leveraged loans slated to finance LBOs have continued to be delayed or restructured.  Outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper dipped in August, although the contraction was small in comparison with that for ABCP.  C&amp;I lending surged in August, reportedly as some banks funded

leveraged loans that they had intended to syndicate to nonbank investors and perhaps as some firms substituted bank credit for commercial paper.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations slowed to a trickle in August; the drop probably reflected both seasonal weakness and the effects of recent volatility in equity markets.  Equity retirements continued unabated in the second quarter, and early indications are that repurchases remained robust through August, as did equity retirements associated with cash-financed mergers and acquisitions.  In contrast, announcements of new LBOs essentially came to a halt in August.

Commercial Real Estate

Over the intermeeting period, spreads of rates on investment-grade commercialmortgage-backed securities (CMBS) over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities widened substantially.  The recent increase in CMBS spreads reflects both concerns among investors and rating agencies over the higher leverage on recently securitized commercial mortgages and greater concerns about structured finance products in general.  The increase in CMBS spreads has reportedly caused interest rates on commercial mortgages originated for securitization to increase about 25 basis points.

In the second quarter, investor concerns about higher leverage led to an increase in the subordination rate-the share of the CMBS pool that must default before holders of a given tranche must absorb any losses-for newly securitized BBB-rated CMBS. According to measures of loan quality from rating agencies, most loans originated in the second quarter that were intended for securitization in the third quarter remained highly leveraged.  There are signs of improving loan quality for mortgages intended for securitization-the share of newly originated commercial mortgages with loan-to-value ratios at or above 80 percent, an indicator of the future quality of loans in CMBS pools, has shown some improvement in recent months.

Commercial mortgage debt rose briskly in the second quarter, amid continued increases in the price of commercial real estate properties and the uptrend in leverage observed last spring.  The elevated pace of borrowing appears to have carried into the third quarter, as a backlog of loans originated earlier this year has kept issuance of CMBS high.  There are indications that higher borrowing costs and tighter underwriting standards may be beginning to hold down the volume of commercial real estate lending.  These indicators include a notable increase in canceled sales contracts in July, slower growth of

commercial mortgages extended by banks in July and August, and a lighter calendar of CMBS slated for issuance in the fourth quarter.

Nonetheless, fundamentals in the commercial real estate sector continue to be solid.  In the second quarter, the vacancy rate on commercial properties remained low relative to its range earlier this decade, and commercial rents continued to post moderate gains.  As a result, delinquency rates on most types of commercial real estate loans have remained low.

Household Finance

On a year-over-year basis, growth of home mortgage debt slowed again in the second quarter, a decrease broadly consistent with the lower pace of home sales and the sharp deceleration in home-price appreciation.  Consumer credit continued to expand moderately through July.

Delinquency rates on most types of consumer loans have crept up in recent quarters, but the levels have generally remained in the lower portion of their historical ranges.  In contrast, the performance of nonprime mortgages has deteriorated further.  The delinquency rate on subprime variable-rate mortgages increased in July to a level well above the peak observed during the recession in 2001; the delinquency rate for variablerate loans in alt-A pools, although much lower, has also increased noticeably.  In the prime mortgage sector, the delinquency rate on the aggregate of all such loans remained low through June, even though the rate for the jumbo mortgages in this aggregate roughly doubled over the preceding year.  Foreclosure starts remained at an elevated level in the second quarter, with a further increase among borrowers with subprime mortgages offsetting a decline for prime borrowers.

The available evidence suggests extremely limited securitization activity for the nonprime and jumbo mortgage markets in recent weeks.  With their funding options constrained, lenders are reportedly offering prime jumbo mortgages with higher rates and more-selective terms and are holding the loans on their balance sheets.  Meanwhile, the supply of credit to borrowers who qualify for conforming mortgage loans has been relatively unaffected by developments in other segments of the mortgage market. Issuance of agency-backed MBS was strong through July, particularly in comparison with the level seen in the subprime, alt-A, and jumbo markets.

The OFHEO index of prices for purchased homes rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter, down from an upward-revised pace of 3Â¼ percent in the first quarter. According to the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller index, home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets fell 4 percent for the year ending in July, and futures quotes on that index suggest that market participants expect some further decline in coming months.

The ratio of household net worth to disposable income ticked up in the second quarter, but the net decline in stock prices since the beginning of July should reduce net worth in the current quarter.  Long-term mutual funds had sizable net outflows in August that may have signaled a decreased appetite for risk.  In contrast, money market funds received near-record monthly inflows last month.

Treasury and Agency Finance

During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned two-, five-, ten-, and thirty-year coupon securities.  Demand at the auction for the two-year Treasury note was reportedly quite strong, and the bid-to-cover ratio was well above average.  Bid-to-cover ratios at the other auctions were in their typical ranges.  Indirect bidding, an indicator of foreign demand, was roughly in line with recent levels.  Despite the recent financial market turmoil, the cash market for these securities generally functioned well, with fairly high trading volumes.  However, heightened volatility in the secondary market for Treasury bills reportedly caused dealers to be reluctant to bid at some bill auctions, which resulted in very low bid-to-cover ratios.

Yield spreads on debt issued by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) spiked notably in mid-August but then receded.  Net debt issuance by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has been light because of the portfolio caps imposed on these GSEs by their regulator.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds for new capital projects and for advance refunding declined somewhat further in August amid a jump in the ratio of long-term municipal bond yields to those of comparable-maturity Treasury securities.  Meanwhile, short-term issuance picked up in August-its typical seasonal pattern.  The perceived credit quality of municipal bonds appeared to deteriorate somewhat in August, even as the number of ratings upgrades outpaced downgrades.  The primary source of investors' concerns about credit quality was the possible exposure of municipal bond insurers to subprime mortgages, which contributed to the spike in the municipal bond yield ratio.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 increased at an annual rate of about 10Â½ percent in August.  The increase was led by a surge in liquid deposits and retail money funds as investors adjusted their portfolios in response to recent financial market turmoil.  Small time deposits, which had been rather sluggish, showed some notable inflows during the last two weeks of August, as some depository institutions bid aggressively to obtain this source of funds.

Commercial bank credit is estimated to have risen sharply in August, as total loans expanded vigorously-mainly at large banks.  In addition to the jump in C&amp;I loans, 'other' loans surged, in part because of short-term extensions to nonbanks and unplanned overdrafts.  The sharp increase in unplanned overdrafts appears to be consistent with some banks having extended backup financing to commercial paper conduits. Commercial real estate loans also expanded solidly last month, although the average pace over July and August was only about half that registered during the first half of the year. On the household side, banks' holdings of loans backed by residential real estate were about flat in August, held down in part by some loan sales, but originations of consumer loans rose noticeably.  Total securities held by banks increased moderately last month, partly because of a few large banks' purchases of commercial paper.

According to the latest Call Report data, the profitability of the commercial banking industry held about steady at a high rate in the second quarter, with a further narrowing of banks' net interest margin about offset by gains in non-interest income and reductions in non-interest expense.  Banks' rate of provisioning for loan losses moved higher for the third straight quarter, but the increase was smaller than in the previous two quarters.  The delinquency rate on all loans and leases moved higher for the fourth straight quarter, pushed up by a further rise in delinquencies on both residential real estate loans and loans to finance the construction of residential properties.   However, delinquency rates on 2 other major loan categories were little changed last quarter, and the overall delinquency rate on bank loans remained well below its long-run average level.

In July, the value of exports of goods and services increased 2.7 percent.  Sharp increases in exports of both aircraft and automobiles contributed importantly to the overall gain. Exports of agricultural products and consumer goods were also strong.  In contrast, exports of industrial supplies and semiconductors exhibited declines.

The value of exports in the second quarter increased 14.9 percent (a.r.), as exports increased briskly in June following strong growth in May.  Exports of agricultural goods, automotive products, and industrial supplies exhibited particular strength in the second quarter.  In contrast, exports of capital goods rose modestly, reflecting declines in aircraft and computers that partially offset strong growth in other capital goods.  In the preliminary NIPA release, real exports of goods and services were reported to have risen 7.6 percent, with both exports of goods and services exhibiting strong growth.

The value of imported goods and services rose 1.8 percent in July, boosted by a large increase in imports of automotive products.  Higher imports of oil and capital goods excluding aircraft, computers, and semiconductors also contributed to the overall gain in imports.  Imports of non-oil industrial supplies, consumer goods, and services all recorded moderate increases, whereas imports of aircraft, computers, and semiconductors declined.

In the second quarter, the value of imports rose 10.1 percent (a.r.), with imports growing only modestly in June following a large gain in May.  The increase in the second quarter entirely reflects higher import prices, as real imports, according to the preliminary NIPA release, actually declined 3.2 percent.  In particular, import prices for oil and other industrial supplies surged in the second quarter, driving up the nominal value of imports. In contrast, the value of imports of automotive products and consumer goods declined.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In July, prices for U.S. imports of core goods rose 0.3 percent, after rising 0.1 percent in June.  Material-intensive goods led the way after being flat in the previous month.  Prices for imported food shot up in July, and prices for non-fuel industrial supplies moved up after a slight decline in June.  The food price increase was almost entirely due to a sharp rebound in vegetable prices, which had plunged in the two previous months.  Within non-fuel industrial supplies, prices in a number of categories fell in July, including prices for copper and aluminum, but a spike in prices for imported building materials more than offset those declines.  Prices for imported finished goods rose 0.2 percent, with prices of capital goods accounting for most of the increase. Outside of core goods, prices for imported computers were flat, and prices for semiconductors fell modestly.

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil rose 7 percent in July, following a 4Â½ percent increase in June.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased about 9 percent in July.  Moving into August, the spot price of WTI fell rapidly before retracing much of this decline late in the month and into early-September.  Smoothing through these ups and downs, spot WTI averaged about $72 per barrel in August, just $2 per barrel lower than its July average.  On September 11, OPEC announced that it will increase its production target by 500,000 barrels per day.  Despite this news, the spot price of WTI rose to a record high of $78.24 per barrel, reflecting skepticism among market participants that actual OPEC production will increase significantly.

Exports. In July, prices for U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.2 percent, after rising 0.5 percent in June . Prices for material-intensive exports were flat in the month, as a jump in prices for agricultural products was offset by a fall in prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies.  As in June, higher prices for meat and grain led the surge in prices for agricultural products.  For nonagricultural industrial supplies, prices for iron and steel fell sharply and prices for aluminum also declined.  Prices for exported finished goods rose 0.3 percent, with higher prices for exported consumer goods registering the largest increase.  Prices for exported computers fell, whereas prices of exported semiconductors edged up.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

After recording very strong net purchases in the first half of the year, foreign private investors on net sold U.S. securities in July, the first outflow recorded in nearly four years (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).  Foreign demand was weak for all types of U.S. long-term debt securities, especially for corporate and municipal bonds (line 4c).  For these bonds, foreign residents sold, on net, $12 billion in July.  This was the first such net sale since July 1993, and a sharp change from purchases of $63 billion in May and $15 billion in June (middle-left panel of the chart on Private Security Flows).  Foreigners also sold, on net, agency bonds (line 4b), while their purchases of U.S. Treasury securities were close to zero (line 4a).  The largest sale of U.S. Treasury bonds was recorded against the Cayman Islands;

.  Large sales were also recorded against Japan, perhaps attributable to an unwinding of yen-carry trades.  There were net purchases recorded against Europe.  We note that the weakness in foreigners' acquisitions coincided with an unusually low issuance of U.S. corporate bonds during July and an increase in the number of downgrades of mortgage-backed securities.  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. equities also slowed in July but remained robust at $18 billion (line 4d).

Partially offsetting the sales of U.S. securities, the banking sector (line 3) posted an especially large net inflow of $67 billion during July; a significant portion of this inflow owes to an increase in banks' own liabilities against the Cayman Islands.  Further, half of the bank inflow reflects foreign purchases of short-term U.S. securities other than U.S. Treasury bills (which are included in line 4), including commercial paper ($12 billion) and certificates of deposit ($16 billion).

U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities totaled only $7 billion in July (line 5 and the bottom panels of the chart on Private Security Flows), roughly 1/3 of the total recorded in June.  Most of the weakening in July's acquisitions was recorded against the United Kingdom, which yields little conclusive information as to the ultimate destination of these flows as many non-U.K. securities trade on U.K. exchanges.  The weakening of U.S. demand was most notable for foreign bonds (line 5a) and may just reflect the significant contraction in international bond issuance by foreigners.

Foreign official inflows picked up to $44 billion in July (line 1 and top-left panel of the chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows).

.  However, for the past year, the timing of official purchases of U.S. securities (line 1) has roughly coincided with increases in the custody accounts at the FRBNY.

Combining official flows with private banking and private security flows yields a net inflow in July of $97 billion, above the pace of the second quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets

At the time of the August FOMC meeting, several banks, including the German bank IKB Deutsche Industriebank, had begun to come under stress as they were called to extend credit to asset-backed commercial paper programs that they had sponsored and that had been used to fund purchases of U.S. mortgage-backed securities.  Many banks increased their demand for liquidity on fears that there would be further draws on the credit lines that they had extended to commercial paper programs, placing pressure on overnight funding markets.  Amid these fears, news on August 9 that the French bank BNP Paribas was restricting redemptions on three of its investment funds triggered a sharp market reaction, sending overnight rates well above central bank targets in most of the advanced foreign economies. The Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Canada, and the central banks of Australia, Norway, and Switzerland all conducted special market operations over the following week to inject liquidity into overnight funding markets.

Although central bank actions helped to partially stabilize overnight interest rates, concerns over liquidity led to funding difficulties in money markets at any but the shortest maturities.  Premiums on 1- and 3-month interbank offer rates rose by as much as 60 basis points as financial institutions began to hoard the most liquid securities.  These disruptions to domestic money markets also sharply impaired funding flows between money markets in the United States and Europe.  According to market participants, bidask spreads in the foreign exchange swap market rose up to 20 times their normal levels on August 9 and 10 and volumes were about one tenth the normal amounts.  European firms accustomed to accessing U.S. money markets for longer-term funding and using the foreign exchange swaps market to convert that funding back to euros may have experienced especially painful funding problems as a result.  Term-money markets have yet to recover and premiums remain elevated, despite actions by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank to make longer-term funding available and decisions by the Bank of Canada and the Reserve Banks of Australia and of New Zealand to widen the set of securities that would be accepted as collateral.

Problems with asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) have surfaced in almost all of the major markets.  In Germany, in addition to IKB, Sachsen Landesbank was also unable to fund its ABCP conduit.  The British special investment vehicle Cheyne Finance was forced to liquidate its assets and HBOS and Barclays both announced that they would expend funds to aid ABCP conduits that they had helped to establish.  In Canada, a

conduit of the financial services company Coventree failed to roll its ABCP and numerous Canadian ABCP issuers requested to draw on their liquidity backstops. Commercial paper issuance slowed in most countries, particularly issuance of ABCP. Overall corporate bond issuance also fell markedly in the advanced foreign economies over July and August, and investment-grade corporate bond spreads have continued to rise modestly.  Despite the continued financial turmoil, spreads on sub-investment grade credit default swaps have stabilized, though at high levels.

The trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against its major trading partners has declined 1Â½ percent over the intervening period, but the dollar has appreciated a bit less than â percent against its other important trading partners.  The yen has appreciated almost 3Â¾ percent against the dollar as heightened market volatility has encouraged the unwinding of carry trades, and the Australian and New Zealand dollars, popular targets of carry trade funds, have depreciated 2 and 7 percent respectively against the U.S. dollar. Major global equity markets fell sharply over the first half of August, but have since partially rebounded as the stream of headlines related to credit troubles has moderated. Financial and bank stocks were particularly hard hit, even in Japan, which is believed to have only limited exposure to the U.S. subprime-mortgage sector and has had only small losses related to it.  Implied volatilities on the major equity indexes peaked in mid-August near levels last seen in 2002.

Emerging economy financial markets were affected by the turmoil in the advanced economies, with some illiquidity occurring in their foreign exchange and bond markets; however, investors appeared to discriminate among countries, and better performing economies have so far suffered fewer consequences.  The exchange values of many emerging market currencies declined against the dollar and most emerging market stock indexes declined in mid-August at the height of market turmoil, but in most cases have since at least partially reversed.  Although the Chinese renminbi depreciated against the dollar over the first half of August, it has since appreciated and is now â percent higher than at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  The Chinese stock market has been largely unaffected by the recent turmoil, increasing 11 percent since the August FOMC meeting. The People's Bank of China raised benchmark interest rates at financial institutions for renminbi deposits and lending again on August 21, but this has had little effect on stock prices.  In a move intended to help remove differences between on-shore and off-shore equity prices, the Chinese government announced that residents would be permitted to invest directly in Hong Kong-listed securities, but subsequently postponed the removal of controls.

.  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.  The Reserve Bank of Australia confirmed that it had intervened in currency markets on August 16 in what it said was an effort to restore liquidity to the foreign exchange market, but did not disclose the size of the operation or the currencies in which it had intervened.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

On average, economic indicators received since the August Greenbook have softened. Second-quarter GDP growth slowed in most advanced foreign economies, with the exception of the United Kingdom.  The step-down was most pronounced in Japan, where GDP contracted 1.2 percent at an annual rate, but was also substantial in the euro area, where total domestic demand rose only about 0.5 percent (a.r.).  Although growth edged down to 3.4 percent in Canada, data late in the quarter, including retail sales, indicated a more significant weakening in activity.  This softness appears to have continued into the third quarter in some economies.  In July, indicators in Europe generally have moderated on balance from their second-quarter levels; however those in Canada and Japan have slowed more notably.  Most of the readings available on economic developments after August 9, when financial turmoil intensified, are measures of confidence.  These measures dropped on average, but they are otherwise consistent with what was reported for July.

Headline inflation in most of the advanced foreign economies was close to 2 percent. Inflation rates held steady in Canada and the euro area, whereas in the United Kingdom the twelve-month rate dropped to 1.9 percent in July.  In Japan, headline inflation was flat in July.  No major central bank raised its policy rate during the intermeeting period, although as discussed above, most major central banks provided extra liquidity to overnight money markets in response to the recent turmoil in financial markets.

In Japan , real GDP contracted 1.2 percent in the second quarter, after two quarters of robust expansion.  The declines in both public and private investment steepened markedly from the previous quarter.  Also, consumption and export growth moved down noticeably, the latter bringing down the contribution from net exports substantially.

Recent indicators of economic activity suggest that the economy continues to show some weakness.  Industrial production, industrial shipments, real household expenditures, and retail sales all fell in July.  Temporary factors appear to have played a role, as an earthquake in northern Japan disrupted automobile production and bad weather weakened spending.  However, the lackluster performance could also be more persistent since industrial production has now fallen in four of the last five months.  Moreover, the continued decline in household earnings may also have contributed to weak consumer demand.

Notwithstanding the recent decline in output, the labor market continues to improve, with the unemployment rate falling to 3.6 percent in July, the best reading since February 1998.  The job offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) remained flat at 1.07, close to a fifteen-year high.  However, nominal wages continued to fall.

The nationwide core consumer price index (excluding fresh food only) fell 0.1 percent in July from a year earlier, the sixth consecutive month of decline, and the second-quarter GDP deflator fell 0.2 percent from a year ago.  Meanwhile, the core CPI for Tokyo, a leading indicator of prices, remained unchanged from a year earlier in August.

On September 12, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe resigned citing a lack of public trust that made it difficult to carry out government policies.  His decision came as the Democratic Party of Japan opposed the passage of a law that would allow Japan to continue providing logistical support to U.S. led operations in Afghanistan.  The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) announced that it will hold an election on September 19 to choose the successor to Prime Minister Abe.  The LDP's secretary general, Taro Aso, and former finance minister, Sadakazu Tanigaki, are seen as possible contenders for the job.

Euro-area GDP growth for the second quarter slowed to 1.4 percent at an annual rate, down from 2.9 percent in the previous quarter.  The slowdown was widespread across the major euro-area countries and owed primarily to a decline in fixed investment following two quarters of strong growth.  In addition, a drawdown of inventories subtracted Â½ percentage point from GDP growth.  In contrast, consumer spending rebounded after being flat in the first quarter as a result of the German VAT increase.  Net exports contributed Â¾ percentage point to GDP growth as export growth picked up.

Other indicators of activity that had been relatively strong in the second quarter have moderated.  German industrial production was almost unchanged in July.  Euro-area manufacturing orders picked up sharply in June, though German orders plunged over 7 percent in July.  The euro-area PMI for manufacturing declined from 54.9 in July to 54.3 in August but was still above the threshold for expansion.  A number of business confidence measures, whose surveys include at least some responses after August 9, moved lower, including the European Commission survey of euro-area industrial confidence, the German IFO business climate index, and the ZEW survey of German financial market participants.

generally remained at a somewhat elevated level, even as the surveys of future prospects of activity weakened.

Retail sales in the euro area ticked up 0.1 percent in July, matching their rise in the second quarter.  The euro-area unemployment rate continued at 6.9 percent in July; the unemployment rate has fallen about 1 percentage point over the past year.  Other indicators collected after the financial disruptions intensified show more moderation. The service sector PMI edged down in August, but remained above its level in the second quarter.  The European Commission survey of consumer sentiment declined fairly sharply in August, as consumers revised down their expectations of economic prospects. Nonetheless, consumer sentiment is still well above its long-run average.

Euro-area consumer prices inched up in August from the previous month, according to the preliminary estimate.  The twelve-month increase in consumer prices was steady at 1.8 percent.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP growth increased to 3.4 percent in the second quarter. Private consumption grew 2.9 percent, up 1 percentage point from the first quarter. Higher inventories added 1.8 percentage points to output growth.  Investment spending, which had been vigorous over the past two years, fell 4.3 percent.  Business investment remained strong, however, expanding 3.2 percent, but government investment more than offset this as it returned to a moderate pace after an exceptionally strong first quarter.

Recent data, including surveys that collected information partly after August 9, suggest that the economic expansion has continued at a moderate pace in the third quarter. Consumer confidence reached a two-year high in August, in part as households' expectations about their ability to save improved.  Retailers reported that total sales rose about 4 percent in August from a year earlier.  Business confidence firmed in August but, having plunged in July, remained well below its average over the first half of 2007. Among consumer services firms, optimism about the business situation tumbled in the third quarter.  Nevertheless, the PMI for services stayed elevated in August, and the PMI for manufacturing and construction were at their highest levels since 1994 and 1998, respectively.

The claimant count measure of the unemployment rate edged down to 2.6 percent in August, matching a thirty-year low achieved in late 2004 and early 2005.  The Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.4 percent in July. Average earnings including bonuses grew 3.8 percent in the twelve months to July, while unit wage costs in the manufacturing sector rose 0.8 percent over that period.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation fell sharply in July, dipping to 1.9 percent.  It was the first time since March 2006 that the headline inflation was below the Bank of England's target of 2 percent.  Core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, also fell to 1.9 percent.  Food products, household furniture, natural gas and electricity services made the largest contributions to the deceleration in inflation.

In Canada, real GDP growth edged down to a still-robust pace of 3.4 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter.  Personal consumption expenditure rose 4.9 percent, fuelled by gains in income.  After falling in the first quarter, business investment in machinery and equipment rebounded in the second quarter.  Exports of goods and services increased 2.9 percent as exports of energy products surged.  Exports of manufactured goods registered mixed results as automotive product exports plummeted and industrial goods and materials bounced back following a decline in the first quarter.  Imports also increased rapidly, resulting in an overall negative net export contribution.

The second quarter ended on a weak note, and data for the third quarter are sparse.  While consumer spending was strong in the second quarter, the trajectory coming into the third quarter is slower, as retail sales fell 0.6 percent in June.  Real manufacturing shipments fell 1.7 percent in June suggesting continued weakness in business fixed investment, and the manufacturing PMI remains below its second-quarter level despite recovering some in August.  After sliding 4 percent in both June and July, housing starts recovered 5 percent in August.  The nominal surplus of merchandise trade narrowed further in July. Although real exports improved from a dip in June, real imports rose 4 percent.

In August, employment growth increased slightly from its subdued July pace.  Unusually large increases in public-sector and education services accounted for most of the August increase.  Education services had experienced a larger-than-normal decline in July. Despite the August pickup, employment gains are still well below the pace of the first half of 2007.  The unemployment rate remained unchanged at its thirty-three-year low of 6 percent in August.  Twelve-month wage inflation increased to 4 percent from 3.8 percent in July.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation remained at 2.2 percent (n.s.a.) in July for the fourth consecutive month.  Core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, ticked down to 2.3 percent in July from 2.5 percent in June.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Data through July, before the recent financial market volatility, suggest that economic activity in emerging market countries remained robust.  Output in the Asian economies soared in the second quarter, with several countries posting at or near double-digit growth.  In Latin America, Mexican and Venezuelan output rebounded sharply from earlier weakness.  Chinese indicators for July point to only a modest slowing of output growth from its red-hot pace in the first half of this year.  The scant August data received thus far provide little indication that the turmoil in financial markets has had a significant negative impact on real economic activity in emerging market economies.  Data for the third quarter show some pickup in inflation, in part related to further increases in food prices.

In China , incoming data point to some moderation of economic activity in the third quarter.  Industrial production fell in July on a seasonally-adjusted basis, and there was a significant deceleration of exports (s.a.) in July and August, which has contributed to a narrowing of the trade surplus.  The slower export growth was expected, as its strength in prior months had reflected a pulling forward of shipments ahead of cuts in value-added tax rebates on many exports effective July 1.  Fixed investment for the twelve months ending in July posted a strong increase of 26Â½ percent, but this was slightly lower than the pace seen in recent months.

Consumer prices continued to accelerate in July and August, with twelve-month increases of about 5Â½ and 6Â½ percent, respectively.  As in recent months, the acceleration in prices can be explained entirely by a runup in prices of food.  In addition to the hog-disease cycle, which is still playing out, floods in parts of China are also pushing up food prices. While non-food price inflation remains low, at less than 1 percent, concerns about food price increases spilling into non-food prices have intensified, as money growth has picked up significantly to 18Â½ percent for the twelve months ending in July.  As expected, Chinese authorities undertook another round of monetary policy tightening in August, raising the benchmark one-year bank lending rate 18 basis points to 7.02 percent. The increase in inflation pushed real deposit rates further into negative territory.  In response, the Chinese government raised the benchmark one-year deposit rate 27 basis points to 3.6 percent and the reserve requirement ratio 50 basis points to 12.5 percent.

In a small but important step toward capital account liberalization in late August, China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange announced a pilot program giving permission to some individual investors in China to make overseas investments in Hong Kong-listed securities.  Under the program, such investments can be done only by opening an account with a Bank of China (BOC) branch that has an agency arrangement with BOC's Tianjin branch.  If the program, which has yet to implemented, becomes more widespread and investments are also allowed in other international markets, it has the potential to somewhat ease pressure on the renminbi to appreciate.  Anticipation of investments from mainland China led to a rally in the H-shares (Chinese enterprises) index of Hong Kong's market.

In Taiwan , output growth rebounded to 7.6 percent in the second quarter from a firstquarter trough.  After contracting in the first quarter, industrial production jumped nearly 8 percent in the second quarter and surged in July.  The unemployment rate remained at 3.9 percent in July, and the healthy labor market has helped support domestic consumption.  In addition, trade data thus far in the third quarter have shown strong growth in exports, particularly in August.  Although twelve-month consumer price inflation was near zero in the second quarter and July, prices rose 1.6 percent in August. Typhoons destroyed crops, which boosted food prices, and clothing prices increased.

Major economic indicators for Korea have remained strong so far in the third quarter. Industrial production jumped 2.1 percent in July, supported by surging high-tech production.  Korea's merchandise trade balance was sizable in July, and the current account balance recovered further.  Trade indicators for August also show continued strength.  In addition, July service activity and retail sales also strengthened.  Despite the recent financial market turmoil, August measures of business and consumer confidence, remained elevated.  Consumer price inflation dropped to 2 percent over the twelve months ended August, reflecting lower energy and food prices.  Inflation has held at or below the lower bound of the Bank of Korea's 2.5 to 3.5 percent target range; however, sharp increases in lending by financial institutions led the Bank to tighten the target interest rate for the second consecutive month in August to 5 percent.  The Bank of Korea held rates steady at its September meeting.  Broad money growth slowed slightly to 10 percent in July.

In India , output rose nearly 10 percent in the second quarter after a double-digit gain the quarter earlier.  Agriculture and construction output fell back after previous sharp increases, but manufacturing production continued to surge and service sector output remained robust.  The trade deficit, which had widened considerably in the second quarter, narrowed somewhat in July as imports shrank and exports expanded.  FDI inflows soared in the second quarter; and while foreign investors withdrew from the stock market in early August, equity prices have almost recovered to their late July peak.  Thus far in the third quarter, twelve-month inflation of both the CPI and the more closely watched wholesale price index have been below their second-quarter levels, in part

reflecting earlier administrative measures to lower prices of selected imported goods including fuels.  In August, key domestic and foreign lenders in India announced that an Indian credit bureau to evaluate individual borrowers will be operational in November, and the Reserve Bank of India announced it would launch an electronic reporting platform for derivative products starting at the end of August.

Across the ASEAN region, activity continued to expand at a strong pace in the second quarter.  Real GDP soared over 14 percent in Singapore, buoyed by the volatile biomedical sector, and rose strongly elsewhere in the region as well.  Growth was generally driven by domestic demand, notably private consumption.  In July, industrial production in Singapore rose sharply following a large contraction the previous month, and Thailand followed the same pattern but with a much smaller swing.  In Malaysia, industrial production contracted for the second consecutive month in July following strong growth in May.  Trade balances in the region were generally strong except in Thailand, where the closure of plants for maintenance contributed to a pronounced narrowing of the surplus.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation generally has risen in recent months across the region, owing mostly to higher food and/or energy prices.  A two percentage-point increase in the goods and services tax in Singapore further boosted July inflation.  In Thailand, however, the rapid appreciation of the baht and lackluster domestic demand continued to push inflation lower.  On August 19, a majority of Thai voters approved a referendum on a new constitution.  The adoption of the constitution sets the stage for general elections on December 23; a military government has been in power since the coup in September 2006.

In Mexico , real GDP growth rebounded to 5.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter from the weak first quarter, mainly on the strength of agriculture and services, particularly transportation.  Industrial production, which contracted in the first quarter, grew only 1.3 percent in the second as performance in the manufacturing sector remained subdued.  Mexico's consumer confidence index rose in August to its highest level this year, but it is unclear the extent to which the timing of the survey allowed consumer's reaction to the recent financial market turmoil to be incorporated.

Twelve-month headline inflation continued to hover around 4 percent in July and August, driven by increases in agricultural prices.  Twelve-month core inflation edged up to 3.9 percent.  Headline inflation has remained around the upper limit of the Bank of Mexico's 2-to-4 percent target range for a year.  Nonetheless, as it has since April, the central bank decided during its late-August meeting not to tighten monetary policy under the expectation that inflation will fall back within the target range soon.  Once again, the central bank signaled a further tightening of policy might occur if inflation does not recede as expected.

In Brazil , second-quarter real GDP growth (data received too late to incorporate into the forecast and tables of Part 1) slowed to 3.2 percent, as a moderation in services growth more than offset a pickup in industrial production.  In July, however, industrial

production fell 0.4 percent, weighed down by declines in production of capital and intermediate goods.  The trade surplus has narrowed thus far in the third quarter.  Imports in July and August grew 31 percent relative to the same period last year, while exports rose 7 percent.  Inflation jumped in August, bringing twelve-month inflation to 4.3 percent, up from about 3 percent early this year.  The rise in inflation reflects a rise in food prices, but other categories also saw increases.

On September 5, the central bank reduced its policy rate Â¼ percentage point to 11.25 percent, down 8Â½ percentage points since the current easing phase began in late 2005.  The move marks a more gradual approach relative to the 50 basis-point reductions at the two previous meetings.  The smaller cut appears to be in response to inflationary pressures from both soaring food prices and strong domestic demand.

In Argentina, the Index of Economic Activity (a monthly proxy of GDP) through June suggests that growth was strong in the second quarter.  Argentine industrial production increased 1.5 percent in the second quarter, primarily due to growth in the motor vehicles sector.  However, industrial production fell for the second consecutive month in July and the trade surplus narrowed.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation remained elevated in July and August, partly reflecting a combined run-up in fiscal spending related to the October presidential election and an increase in food prices.

Petroleum output partially rebounded from its 5 percent decline in the first quarter and rose by about 3 percent, while non-petroleum output rose 11 percent.  Inflation continues to be extremely high, but edged down to around 16 percent in August on a twelve-month basis.  In mid-August, the Chavez government unveiled a constitutional reform proposal that entails, among other things, the removal of presidential term limits and the central bank's legal autonomy.  A referendum on the proposal is expected in December.  In

response to these developments and as global investors retreat from risk, the bolivar in the parallel market depreciated 20 percent in August.  As of September 11, the bolivar had partially recovered to 4,800 VEN/dollar.  (The official rate is 2,144 VEN/dollar.)  In addition, the overnight interbank rate soared to 120 percent in early September, but declined to about 30 percent after the central bank opened its discount window.

In Turkey, industrial production was unchanged in the second quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation remained elevated at 7.4 percent in August, albeit below its level in the first half of the year.  At its August meeting, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey decided to keep its short-term lending rate unchanged at 25.5 percent.  The Central Bank suggested that aggregate demand conditions would continue to support the disinflation process.  On August 28, Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul was formally elected the next President of Turkey.
