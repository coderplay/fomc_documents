Trade in Goods  and Services

The U.S.  trade deficit in goods  and  services dropped sharply to  a little less than $19  billion  in September from  $27  billion in August.  However, the  decline was entirely  the result of the recording  of estimated future payments by foreign insurers related to the events of September  11,  which  reduced reported  service imports  by $11 billion.  Net  of this  effect,  the trade deficit  widened by about $2 billion in  September,  as exports  fell  8  /2  ercent  while imports  excluding the 1 p insurance payment  were down 4 percent

The events of September 11  had several  distinct impacts  on trade.  Both exports and imports  of services,  particularly passenger  fares and other travel expenditures,  were  down  significantly  in September.  Goods trade  also fell as a result of temporary  disruptions  after the 11 th and weakening  activity both at home and abroad.  Declines in exports  in September were widespread  among categories,  with  a particularly  sharp drop  in capital goods.  Decreases  were also recorded in  almost all  major categories  of imports, with the notable exception  of consumer goods, which rose slightly.

For the third quarter  as a whole  the deficit was $300 billion (s.a.a.r.), down  from $355  billion in  the  second  quarter.  About three-quarters  of this reduction ($44  billion  annualized)  resulted from  the  September insurance payment described above.

since  January  1998,  and marked  a resumption of the downward  trend that has been  evident since the beginning  of this year.  Prices  of both industrial  supplies and agricultural  exports  showed particularly  sharp declines  in October.  In the third quarter, the  price of exported  core goods  declined  2.1  percent at an  annual rate, a  bit steeper fall  than  in the second  quarter. Although the price of exported industrial  supplies fell more sharply  than in the  second quarter, this was partly offset by an increase  in the price  of agricultural exports,  which had fallen  in the second quarter.

U.S.  International Financial Transactions

Foreign official  assets held in the United  States  (line 1 of the Summary  of U.S. International Transactions  Table) increased  $17  billion  in the third quarter. Increases recorded  for the BIS  ($8 billion) and for Brazil,  China, and Taiwan ($3  billion) more than offset sizable  declines  in  the reserves  of Germany ($6 billion) and Venezuela  ($5 billion). Partial  data from FRBNY indicate that as  of mid-November foreign official  holdings increased  $13  billion since the end of September.  This increase was overwhelmingly  due to a further rise in Japan's holdings ($11  billion),  stemming from intervention  activity late  in the third quarter.

Foreign  private  net purchases  of U.S.  securities  (line 4) fell substantially  in the third quarter.  Foreign  sales of Treasury issues  (line 4a) accelerated;  however, the largest  declines in  net purchases  came in U.S. corporate  bonds and  stocks (lines 4c and 4d).  The falloff was particularly  sharp in  September  and likely came  in the wake of the terrorist  attacks; however,  our data do not provide information  on the timing of September market  activity.  In that month, purchases  of agencies  and corporate bonds trailed  down and foreigners  resumed selling U.S. Treasury  securities. In sharp contrast to previous  periods, foreigners also  sold $10  billion  of U.S.  equities in  September-the  first monthly  sales recorded  since September  1998. Although the sales were  widespread, they loomed  largest in the financial  centers  in Europe  ($5  billion)  and the Caribbean ($4 billion).  For the quarter, foreign demand  for U.S.  agency  bonds (line 4b) remained strong,  and net purchases  of agencies  are  on track to exceed last year's total.

The reduced  inflows  owing to smaller net foreign purchases  of U.S.  securities  in the third quarter  ($50 billion)  were more than  offset by a downward  swing in U.S. purchases  of foreign  securities  as U.S.  net purchases  of $44 billion  in the second quarter turned to sales  of $21  billion in the third.  Net sales of foreign bonds,  amounting to $25  billion  (line 5a),  were offset in small  part by net acquisitions  of foreign  stock, including  stock swaps. U.S.  residents  have been selling  foreign bonds  since March, but these  sales accelerated  markedly during the third quarter  and remained concentrated  in European  financial  centers.  U.S.
