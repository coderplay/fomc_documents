Key Background Factors

On balance,  ur  financial sumptions  n  this  reenbook  embody a  bit ore o as i G m impetus o  expansion han  did  the ssumptions n he ast  reenbook.

That  said,  ven  if su fro e talks  n  the timulus  ackage  end  in  deadlock,  ome elements f he ackage, o s p s o t p such  as  higher  nemployment insurance  enefits  nd  additional  ending n u b a sp o security,  uld  most  likely   enacted ater   the ear. lternative enarios wo be l in y A sc that  re resented  ater plore he  implications    couple f  possible  iscal a p l ex t ofa o f variations,  cluding  ne  that  akes he osition at  o  added  fiscal imulus in o t t p th n st will  e  forthcoming. b

International Developments

Early indicators for October and November  suggest that foreign  economic activity is likely to decline  again  in the current quarter, reflecting in part the continuing effect of the events  of September  11. At the same time, however, a few bright spots are appearing,  perhaps  signaling the emergence  of a turning point in the global growth cycle.  Economic  activity in some Asian economies particularly exposed to the downturn in the high-tech  sector appears to be stabilizing.  And financial  markets, though not  completely shrugging off the negative readings on recent  activity, may be pricing in a somewhat  stronger outlook than they had  at the time of the November FOMC meeting, with equity prices and longer-term  bond yields  generally higher.

We again project that foreign growth will resume early next year, as a number of factors appear set to boost activity.  These include the anticipated pickup in U.S. GDP, lower oil prices, the considerable  macroeconomic policy easing that has taken place in many countries,  and the eventual ending of inventory liquidations and high-tech investment  overhangs. As positive momentum develops,  average foreign  growth rates are expected  to approach  potential growth rates by the end  of next year and move somewhat higher in 2003, shrinking  output gaps a bit by the end  of the forecast period.  Inflation should remain  subdued,  however, with output remaining below potential throughout  the period.

Summary of Staff Projections

(Percent change  from end of previous period,  s.a.a.r.)

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE.  Changes for years are measured as Q4/Q4;  for half-years, Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2.

Over  the forecast period, we expect the arithmetic contribution of the external sector to U.S.  GDP growth to be negative.  After declining  significantly this year, both exports  and imports should pick up next year and expand further in 2003.

Oil prices. The spot price of West Texas intermediate  fell sharply in mid November following  OPEC's announced  decision to make additional  production cuts only if key non-OPEC  countries  limited their production as well.  Mexico, Norway, and Oman  have agreed  to cooperate with OPEC.  Russia has just

an elevated  amount of reserves with Japanese banks, keeping its aggregate  current account  position well above Y6 trillion and short-term interest rates near zero. Late in the period,  the Bank of Japan  temporarily pushed  reserves to  ¥14  trillion to help ensure liquidity for mutual funds whose depositors were concerned  that the Enron bankruptcy  would generate  fund losses  sufficient to impair access to deposits.

Equity prices in most emerging-market  countries  also rose, and  sovereign bond yield spreads generally  narrowed, including  those of Mexico  and Brazil,  despite the sharp deterioration  of financial conditions  in Argentina.  Argentine  equity prices fell  more than  12 percent, yield spreads  widened  1,000 basis points, and overnight  interest rates  on peso deposits  soared to 900 percent as residents scrambled to withdraw  their funds from the banking  system.  The government responded with a package of stop-gap measures  designed to reduce pressures  on the banking system and the currency regime by limiting bank deposit withdrawals, restricting  capital  outflows,  and  partially  dollarizing the financial  system.  The authorities  also  moved to complete the first part of a debt exchange, which reduces interest payments  and in many cases lengthens  maturities on public sector debt.  Figures on the amount of debt exchanged  so far total about $50 billion. These steps may provide  the banking  system with some breathing room and reduce  the probability of an imminent devaluation of the exchange  rate. Immediately  following  the imposition of these measures, bond spreads declined somewhat and equity prices moved off their lows.

. The Desk did not intervene  during the period for the  accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Foreign industrial countries. Recent indicators  suggest that average  real GDP in foreign  industrial countries  weakened further in the current  quarter after a small contraction in the third quarter.  We continue  to project  a gradual recovery next year, with growth of about  1 3/4 rcent in 2002 and nearly pe 3 percent in 2003, reflecting  the  projected revival in  U.S.  growth, lower  oil prices, monetary stimulus,  and an expected reduction  in inventory and investment overhangs. All the major foreign  industrial economies  follow this general  pattern, although the severity and the duration  of the slowdown  differ  across areas. Headline inflation rates in  these countries have moved  down substantially in recent months as a result of both lower oil prices  and the sluggish pace  of economic  activity. Inflation rates are expected  to edge up later in the forecast period.

The Japanese  economy remains very weak, with  a drop of nearly 2 percent (not at an annual rate) in the all-industry  index in the third quarter, suggesting that real GDP posted another sizable  decline in that period.  A further contraction in output is expected in the  fourth quarter, reflecting  declines  in both public and private

investment  nd  a  fall  n xports.  ecent  declines  n oth rders nd  shipments f a i e R i b o a o machinery  suggest  hat  nvestment  pending s ikely   continue  o  contract,  d t i s i l to t an record nemployment should estrain nsumption  spending. e  expect he u r co W t economy to  shrink omewhat more in  the  first lf  f ext ear s  private s ha o n y a investment  nd  exports  emain  weak,  but  it  hould tabilize  the econd  half  f a r s s in s o the  year nd  grow  in  2003 as  the hakeout n rivate  nvestment  pending nds  and a s i p i s e global ecovery  oosts xports.  he Japanese overnment  recently ssed r b e T g pa a supplementary  udget  that  ocuses n  increasing blic mployment  and  shoring b f o pu e up  the  unemployment safety  et,  nd  a  second  supplementary  udget s urrently n a b i c being  discussed.  he Bank of apan  is xpected o  maintain hort-term terest T J e t s in rates  ear ero  through he orecast  eriod  nd  to  keep  reserves  bove  the  target n z t f p a a level f  ¥6  trillion, rices  ontinue  o all  t  an  annual ate  f ore than  1 o as  p c t f a r o m percent.
