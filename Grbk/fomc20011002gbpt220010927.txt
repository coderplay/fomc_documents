Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. trade deficit in goods and  services  was $28.8 billion in  July,  little changed from  the $29.1  billion deficit (revised) recorded  in  June.  However, the level of both exports  and imports dropped  sharply.  From December of last year to July,  exports  of goods and  services fell 6 percent  and imports fell  8 percent, reflecting the weak state  of world-wide  economic  activity  this year.

(Billions of dollars, seasonally  adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports was 2.5 percent lower in July than in June with the decline spread  among  most trade  categories,  particularly  machinery  (high tech and other),  industrial  supplies,  and  automotive  products. A 12 percent annual  rate drop in exports in the second  quarter marked the third consecutive  quarter of decline.  Exports of semiconductors  and other machinery  accounted  for most of the decline.  The value  of exported  industrial  supplies also fell sharply.  The increase  in exported automotive  products  in the second quarter was partly reversed by  the decline recorded  in July.

The value of imports fell 2.1  percent  in July with  large declines  in the  value of oil  (both price and quantity),  semiconductors,  other machinery,  automotive products, and consumer  goods.  The  15 percent annual  rate fall in imports in the second quarter was  the second consecutive quarter of decline. As in the case  of exports, the bulk of the import decline  occurred  in computers,  semiconductors, and  other machinery.  Imported  industrial  supplies and consumer goods both  fell sharply in the  second quarter as  well.  The rise in  imported automotive  products in the second quarter was largely reversed  in July.

current  account balances  above its current target of  ¥6 trillion  and  lowered  the discount rate  from 25 to 10 basis  points.  Justifying these  changes,  the central banks mentioned  the current weak outlook  for global  growth as well  as the uncertainties  for financial  market stability  and consumer confidence  created by the terrorist  attacks. The Federal  Reserve  set up  temporary  swap facilities with the European  Central  Bank and the Bank of England  and augmented its existing swap arrangement with the Bank of Canada.  The European  Central  Bank drew on  its facility to provide  temporary  dollar liquidity to financial  institutions operating  in Europe. On September 24, the  Swiss National Bank lowered the target band  for its policy rate an additional 50 basis points to counter  upward pressures  on the  exchange  value of the Swiss  franc.

NOTE.  Change is from August 20 to September 26/27.

In response  to these  developments,  short-term market rates  fell  substantially  in most foreign  industrial countries. However, yields on bellwether government bonds declined only  19 basis  points in Canada and  14 basis points in Australia, were unchanged  in Germany, and rose 4 to 6 basis points in the United Kingdom and  Japan,  leading to marked steepenings  of yield  curves in all major industrial countries.

Share  prices  fell  sharply around  the world, in  industrial  countries  as well  as in emerging market  economies, for broad indexes  as well for indexes  of the technology,  transportation,  and insurance  sectors, both in the days  immediately following  the attacks when U.S.  exchanges  were closed,  and after September  17 when  U.S. bourses re-opened.  On balance,  broad equity indexes declined  12 to 18 percent  in Europe  and Japan over the intermeeting period,  generally outpacing equity price drops  in the United  States.  Share prices fell more than 20 percent  in Brazil  and Argentina  and  are down  in the  15-to-20-percent  range on  several  stock  exchanges  in East Asia.

Trading  in emerging market debt came  to a near standstill  for several days following  the terrorist  attacks,  as  important financial  infrastructure  installations located  in the World Trade Center were destroyed.  After active trading in Brady debt and global bonds resumed, their risk spreads jumped substantially.  On balance,  the EMBI+  spreads of Argentina, Brazil,  and Mexico are  up between 100  and 230 basis points  over the  intermeeting  period.
