The economic  expansion  continues  o  exhibit  lmost tartling  mentum. t a s mo Consumer spending  soared  in  the  first o months of  1999--boosted  y a w b remarkable  level f  motor  vehicle  ales--and using  starts se  to  still gher o s ho ro hi levels.

To round  out  the  good a r news,  inflation  mained  subdued  through ebruary. re F

Labor Market Developments
