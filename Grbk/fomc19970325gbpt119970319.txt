Domestic Developments

Summary

Contrary o  our  expectations--and  ose f  most other nalysts--the  onomic t th o a ec expansion  has  shown little,    ny,  sign  of oderating n  the ake  of  the  surge  in  the ifa m i w closing  onths of  1996. Most notably,  obs  continue  o  be  created  t  a brisk ace, m j t a p lifting rsonal ncome and consumer spirits;  d retail les eportedly  ave  been pe i an sa r h booming. Fortunately, gregate  upply  apparently  as  been  expanding  apace,  with ag s h the  labor orce ontinuing  o  grow rapidly  nd factory  apacity vidently  till f c t a c e s increasing  martly;  oreover,  an appreciating llar  as  helped  to  enhance  effective s m do h supply  by making imports vailable  ore cheaply.  As a consequence, nflation  s a m i ha remained  in  check, ith  scarcely  ny increase  n  the  prices f  manufactured  goods. w a i o

Conceivably,  his  avorable  attern  ould  persist r  while  longer.  But it s t f p c fo a i our  assessment hat,  bsent  a substantial  ar-term ightening   monetary  policy,  e t a ne t of w are  likely  o  see  mounting  pressures  n resources--particularly  r--and  he t o labo t emergence  of  a  significant  trend n  price nflation.   our  baseline  conomic up i i In e scenario,  eal DP  rises  t  a bit ore than  a 3 percent nnual  rate n  the  first lf f r G a m a i ha o 1997 and then  moderates  to  a 2-1/2 ercent  ace  in  the  second  half  nd about p p a 2 percent n  1998.  Such output  growth  pushes  the  unemployment rate elow i b 5 percent,  nd the  tightness  f  the  labor arket  causes  employers  to  bid  up wages and a o m benefits  o  attract rkers.  Core CPI inflation,  ich has  been  just -1/2 ercent ver t wo wh 2 p o the  past  twelve onths,  is  projected  o  move  up to  2-3/4 ercent his  ear  and m t p t y 3-1/4  percent n  1998,  the  magnitude  of  the cceleration ing  muted slightly i a be by planned  BLS  technical  hanges. Overall nflation  ould e damped relative   the c i sh b to core  rate y favorable  ovements in  food  and,  especially,  ergy  prices:  e  see  the b m en w total  PI rising  nly  3  percent ext  year. C o n

The outlook  for  inflationary  essures  ould be  more adverse ere it ot  for pr w w n certain  ey elements n  our  baseline  orecast.  irst,  the  demand side,  t  is  our k i f F on i expectation  hat he  deterioration    the  U.S.  terms  of rade ill e  damping the t t in t w b growth  of  exports nd encouraging ising  mport  penetration r  some time--even  f,  s a r i fo i a we've  anticipated,  e  run-up  in  the  dollar  as  run  its  ourse.  Second,  financial rket th h c ma participants  ve  shown some sensitivity    the  potential r ederal eserve ha to fo F R tightening,  pecially   light f  Chairman Greenspan's  ecent estimony. s they es in o r t A perceive nflationary  sks  o  be mounting  in  coming months,  intermediate- d longi ri t an term  interest tes  re  likely  o ove to  higher evels. hat  tendency  is  reinforced ra a t m l T in 1998 by an assumed  moderate  rise  n  the  federal  unds  rate.  The stock arket i f m probably  will ind  it ifficult    make any further adway in  such  an environment, f d to he and,  indeed, e  have  predicted   downturn  in  share rices  ext  year.  Thus,  financial w a p n

forces re  expected  to  curb  domestic  demand growth  to  a degree  over  time. Finally, a on the  supply  side,  e have  anticipated at nflationary  essures  ill e  muted by w th i pr w b continued bove-trend rowth  in  the  labor orce nd ample  expansion  of  factory a g f a capacity.

As always, here s  a considerable nge  of  uncertainty tending  ur  forecast. t i ra at o We  have warned previously  f  the  potential r  a sustained  oom  in  domestic emand, o fo b d supported  by a strong tock arket  and aggressive  ending.  Recent  developments  have s m l done nothing o  undermine  that ssessment. n the  other and,  we cannot  rule ut  the t a O h o possibility  at arious nfluences ll  prove  even  more favorable  or he  prospects  or th v i wi f t f low inflation  an  we  have  anticipated. e dollar  ould  break  out  into till gher th Th c s hi territory   the  basis f  optimism  about  U.S.  growth  prospects  elative   the on o r to economic struggles  n  continental rope, or  example;  there ay be some room for i Eu f m the  labor orce o  increase  ore rapidly  han  we  have  projected, though his  ould f t m t al t w involve iring ess ualified  orkers; nd it ay  be  that he  recent erformance  of h l q w a m t p prices nd profits  s  signaling e  emergence  of  a better  roductivity end,  erhaps a i th p tr p based  on the  realization    greater  fficiencies  om the  investments  hat ave  been of e fr t h made  in  new technologies.  e  would emphasize, owever,  that nless ggregate W h u a demand flags o  a greater  egree  than  we are  anticipating    there re  some positive t d or a supply  shocks, he  thrust  f  our  baseline  orecast  s  that ressures  n domestic t o f i p o resources  ill anifest hemselves n  a rising  nflation  te ver  the  next  few years. w m t i i ra o

Key  Background  Factors in the  Forecast

Over the  intermeeting riod,  inancial rkets  have been  whipsawed somewhat pe f ma by data  showing greater-than-expected  wth  and less-than-anticipated  ation.  net, gro infl On though,  30-year reasury ond yields  ave neared  the T b h 7 percent ark on perceptions m that   tightening  f  monetary  policy ight  occur  sooner ather  han  later.  Given  the a o m r t absence  of  immediate  policy ction  n  this  orecast,    expect ond prices  o  rally a i f we b t a bit n  the  near  term.  But the  yield urve  is  expected o  steepen gain  later  his  ear i c t a t y and in  early  1998 as  unemployment drops  and inflation  cks p--and he  markets pi u t place  greater  dds  on Fed tightening.  s noted, e  have  in  fact ssumed  that he o A w a t federal  unds  rate ill e  raised  oderately uring  1998,  essentially    match the  rise f w b m d to in  core  inflation  d thus o  prevent hat would otherwise e a decline n  real an t w b i short-term  ates. ond yields re  projected  o  remain  somewhat above  the  recent r B a t range  next  year,  ut  with  the  yield urve  flattening  nsiderably  s  the  System b c co a tightens.

Equity  prices  ave again  exceeded  our  expectations   fourth-quarter  rporate h as co reports  ere favorable,  nd  the  prospect  f  faster onomic growth  this  ear  has w a o ec y buttressed  ptimistic rnings  orecasts.  onetheless,  e believe  hat ith  the  bulk  of o ea f N w t w the  extraordinarily d economic news likely  ow behind  us,  the  stock arket  is  at goo n m least  lose o  topping ut. Given the  new policy ssumptions n  this  orecast,  now c t o a i f we anticipate  somewhat larger  orrection   share rices n  1998. But we still  not a c in p i do foresee  he  emergence of  a major  bear  market, nd  thus  the  changes  in  the  level f t a o wealth  and the  cost f  equity apital  re  not  so  great s  to  cut  deeply nto ggregate o c a a i a demand.

Credit  supply  conditions  re  not  expected o  exert ny meaningful  incremental a t a restraint   the  expansion f  economic activity er  the  forecast  eriod.  Banks on o ov p already ave  selectively  ghtened  heir  tandards  n credit-card  d certain  ther h ti t s o an o lending o  higher-risk rrowers,  nd some further  djustments  n  both  terms  and t bo a a i qualification  andards  re  likely  s  delinquencies   these ccounts ise. owever, st a a on a r H for  the  vast ajority  f  households,  redit  s till adily  vailable.  or  businesses, m o c i s re a F credit  emains elatively  sy  to  obtain t  low  cost.  Banks continue  o  compete r r ea a t aggressively r  new loans,  nd capital  arket  yield preads emain  quite arrow  in fo a m s r n historical  rspective;  e  forecast  oes  not  suggest rounds  for nticipating  ents hat pe th d g a ev t would greatly  eighten  oncerns  about  business redit  uality. h c c q

There  have been  a number of  important evelopments  in  the  fiscal ena  since d ar the  last reenbook. The President  ut  his  budget  proposal n  the  table n  early G p o i February,  nd the  initial  ngressional action  as less ntagonistic an  it as  been a co re w a th h

at  times n  the ast.  However, the  tenor f  the  discussion  ubsequently  eteriorated, i p o s d with  the  CBO judging he  Administration  umbers to  be too  optimistic d  the t n an Administration owing  no enthusiasm or  taking n the  COLA sh f o issue.  Prospects  or f agreement  on a  solid,  ultiyear, lanced udget  plan  are  widely  viewed as  having m ba b diminished.

In  any event, e have  revised ur  fiscal  ssumptions o  move closer  o  the w o a t t pattern  f  the  Administration an, nd  they  now  involve  14  billion ss  n o pl a $ le i deficit-reduction  ions n  fiscal  998 than  in  the  January  Greenbook and $26 billion act i 1 less n  fiscal  999.  Our new package  includes  n  extension f  discretionary  ending i 1 a o sp caps  beyond fiscal  998,  cutbacks n  Medicare  and Medicaid  spending  similar  o  the 1 i t President's  oposals,  well  as  sales f  spectrum  rights  nd other ssets  n  the  out pr as o a a i years; e have built  n  a  small  net  reduction  n  taxes,  ncluding  he  President's  ild w i i i t ch tax  credit. n balance, iscal  olicy s  expected o  be  only  modestly  restrictive r O f p i t ove the  forecast  eriod,  mposing  less estraint   aggregate emand than  in  the  January p i r on d Greenbook.

While we have incorporated ss eficit-reducing icy ction n  our  current le d pol a i forecast, e  upside  surprise  n  economic  activity s  had an  offsetting  fect  n the th i ha ef o outlook or  the  federal  udget.  The unified  eficit  rojected  o  edge down to  $101 f b d isp t billion  n  fiscal  997 (from  $107  billion   fiscal  996)  and to  move up to  $119 billion i 1 in 1 in  fiscal  998;  the  corresponding  igures  n  the anuary  Greenbook  were $109 billion 1 f i J and $117 billion.

The dollar  as  continued o  be stronger  n  exchange  markets han  we h t o t anticipated.  ts rade-weighted lue  against  ther -10 currencies s  risen  early I t va o G ha n 8 percent ince he  end of  1996 and is xpected o  remain  around  its urrent  evel s t e t c l through  most  of  this  ear.  Much  of  this ppreciation s  occurred gainst  he y a ha a t currencies  f  continental rope and  may reflect creasing  ncertainty rrounding o Eu in u su the  prospects  or MU. f E Viewed from a  longer-term  erspective,  e  dollar  eems p th s overvalued elative   the  levels  hat ould be needed  to  generate mprovement  in  the r to t w i U.S.  current  ccount  balance,  nd we continue o  anticipate at t  some point uring a a t th a d the  projection riod he  trend oward  greater  eficits ll eigh on market  sentiment, pe t t d wi w contributing   some reversal  f  the  dollar  ally.  owever, with  the ighter  onetary to o r H t m and easier  iscal  onditions  n his orecast,  e  dollar  eclines  nly  slightly xt  year f c i t f th d o ne and remains  above  the  prior  ath hroughout he  projection riod. p t t pe

Economic activity road  accelerated   the  end of  last  ear, nd we are ab at y a projecting  oreign  eal DP  to  rise round  4 percent n  1997 and 1998--similar   the f r G a i to pace  in  1996.  Oil  prices  ave  declined  ore sharply han  expected n  the  first arter, h m t i qu reflecting  seasonably arm  weather  in  many parts f  the  Northern emisphere  and un w o h some increase  n  world  supply.

Recent Developments  and the  Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

Our point rediction  or  real DP  growth  in  the  current uarter  s  3-1/2 ercent t  an p f G q i p a annual  rate--down  rom  the  4-1/4 ercent rowth  that e now estimate  or  the  fourth f p g w f quarter.  he recent ehavior f  the  labor arket  certainly pears o  be indicating T b o m ap t a continuation  f  a  strong utput rend.  Most notably,  rivate  ayrolls  xpanded  briskly o o t p p e in  the  first o  months of  the ear, ven  after  aking allowances or he  possible tw y e m f t distortions    the eported  igures  esulting om weather  and seasonal djustment of r f r fr a problems.  And  the  low level f  initial  aims or obless  enefits  uggests hat  he o cl f j b s t t strength  n  hiring  as  carried  nto arch. i h i M

On the  expenditure  ide,  here re  many important oles n  the  available s t a h i current-quarter  ta.  It s  fairly  lear,  owever,  that ersonal  onsumption da i c h p c expenditures  ill ost  a large ncrease, obably  in he  vicinity   5 percent annual w p i pr t of ( rate). ales  of  light  ehicles  re  up,  and  non-auto etail les ave  risen harply n  the S v a r sa h s i past  two months. A hefty  increase  n  labor ncome has  supported emand, but  it  may i i d also  be  that e are  seeing ome response o  the  huge  accretion  f  stock arket  wealth. w s t o m The willingness  f  households o  spend  likely  as  been  bolstered  y  the  more positive o t h b perceptions  f  employment prospects  evealed n  recent urveys--perceptions t ay o r i s tha m also  explain he  rise  n  labor orce articipation t as  helped  to  stabilize  e t i f p tha h th unemployment rate n  the  face  of  the  rapidly  rowing  demand for orkers. i g w

Single-family  ousing  starts eraged  1.17  million nits  annual ate)  n h av u ( r i January  and February,  ell  above  the  fourth-quarter  vel.  Although  strength  n  this w le i sector  s  not  surprising   light  f he revailing onomic  and financial nditions, i in o t p ec co activity obably as boosted  significantly favorable  eather, hich  permitted pr w b w w a catch-up or  production  elayed  by rains  n  December and an  early tart  n work that f d i s o might  otherwise  ave begun in  March.  Meanwhile,  the  jump in  multifamily  tarts h s in February  only  partially  fset  n odd plunge  in  January,  nd we expect  such  starts of a a to average  300,000  units n  the urrent  uarter--short    the all  ace. On  balance, i c q of f p residential  vestment utlays robably ill ise lightly is  uarter. in o p w r s th q

Business apital  pending  seems  to  be  on track  or  substantial  crease. c s f a in Recent  trends n  orders nd shipments  suggest  further  izable  ain  in  outlays  or eal i a a s g f r producers'  urable quipment, ed  by ongoing  strength  n  purchases f  computers  and d e l i o with  some further  ncrease  n  communications quipment. Outside  of  these reas, i i e a spending  on motor  vehicles  nd other ess-high-tech  uipment  looks o  be  flat. a l eq t Regarding  nonresidential  nstruction,  e  trends n  contracts  ave  remained  favorable co th i h for  most  market  segments, nd construction  t  in  place ose n  January o  a level ell a pu r i t w above  the  average  of he  fourth  uarter. t q

A  key element  in  the  GDP forecast  or he  current  uarter  s he  anticipated f t q i t unwinding  of  the  special  actors  hat oosted eal et  exports n  the  fourth  uarter: f t b r n i q residual  easonality   the  data,   bunching  in  exports,  nd the  auto  strikes.  n s in a a I addition, e  rapid rowth  in  domestic  demand also s rojected  o  be  partially th g i p t absorbed  by  increased  mports f  goods  and services.  ll  told,  he  deterioration i o A t in real et  exports ay hold  down real DP  growth  by 1-1/2  percentage  oints n  the n m G p i first  uarter, ter  oosting rowth  2-1/4 ercentage  oints  n  the  fourth uarter  f q af b g p p i q o 1996.

Stocks  have  become quite ean  in  a number of  sectors,  nd a near-term  tep-up l a s in  business nventory  nvestment ppears  likely.  anufacturing nd  trade nventories i i a M a i were up  modestly  in  January, nd with  manufacturing  utput rojected  o  increase  t  a a o p t a 4  percent nnual  rate his uarter, me additional ventory nvestment s xpected  in a t q so in i i e February  and March.  Overall,  e have nonfarm  inventories sing  t  a  2-1/2  percent w ri a annual  rate n  the  first  uarter, ntributing out  1/3  percentage  oint o  real DP i q co ab p t G growth.

The latest  ews on inflation s  been  favorable. here  have  been no signs f n ha T o inflation    finished  oods  prices  t  the  producer evel or any months,  and the  CPI in g a l f m rose  an average  of  0.2  percent  er  month in  January  and February.

Retail  nergy  prices  re  beginning o  respond o  the  decline  n  crude  oil e a t t i costs nd substantial  clines  re  anticipated   coming months. Excluding  food  and a de a in energy, he  CPI rose  only  0.1  percent  n  January nd 0.2  percent n  February; t i a i assuming  another .2  percent  ncrease  n  March,  core  consumer prices  ould increase 0 i i w at  only  a 2-1/4 ercent nnual  rate n  the irst  uarter. n  the  wage front,  verage p a i f q O a hourly  earnings dged up  0.2  percent n  January nd February,  ollowing  arger e i a f l increases  n  the  fourth uarter  f  1996 that ere  related  n  part o  the  increase  n  the i q o w i t i minimum  wage.

The Outlook for  the  Economy beyond the  Current  Quarter

Reflecting  ainly  the  upside  surprise  n  the irst arter,  have  raised  ur  forecast m i f qu we o of  real GDP growth  in 1997 by 1/2  percentage  oint o  2-3/4 ercent. he projected p t p T growth  rate or  1998--at  ust  ver  2 percent--is  e  same as  the  January  Greenbook,  as f j o th higher  real nterest tes nd the  higher ollar  ffset  he  multiplier-accelerator  cts i ra a d o t effe of  the dded growth  this ear  and a less estrictive cal  tance.  In  light  f  the  recent a y r fis s o favorable  ehavior f  prices,  ncluding  he ontinuing  ignificant  wnward  tilt b o i t c s do of import  prices,  e have lowered  the  forecast  f w o CPI inflation  rough he  first lf  f th t ha o this  ear, ut  there as  been  no  material  hange  in  our  projection   core  or  total y b h c of inflation in 1998.

Consumer  spending. Real PCE is  forecast  o  rise t 3-1/2 percent ver  the  four o quarters  f o 1997 and another -1/2  percent n  1998--just  lightly ceeding he  growth 2 i s ex t of  real isposable  ersonal ncome. We  continue o  believe  hat he  run-up  in d p i t t t household  net  worth  over  the  past ew years  ought  to  be  boosting onsumption.  And f c it  may indeed  be  doing  so,  explaining  ome of he  reported  trength  n  spending n s t s i i

upscale etail  arkets.  Yet,  there re  only  the  faintest nts  hat,  n  the  aggregate,  he r m a hi t i t household  sector  as  been inclined  o  spend  a greater  roportion  f  its  ncome. h t p o i Possibly,  uture  evisions  f  the  national  ncome  accounts ill lter  his  icture, t f r o i w a t p bu for  now it  remains  our  working  assumption hat here imply  have  been  other actors t t s f offsetting  e  wealth  effect. th

Increased ebt-service rdens, specially ong  households ith  belowd bu e am w average  incomes,  are  one of  these.  Rising elinquencies ggest hat any consumers d u t m have  gotten n  over  their  eads, nd though  a sizable  umber have  been  finding  elief i h a n r from their  ebt  obligations rough esort  o  bankruptcy,  hey  may  be  feeling  ore d th r t t m constrained  n  their  pending  now.  Probably  more important n  explaining  he pdrift i s i t u in  the  personal  aving ate ver  the  past wo years s he  likelihood at  he s r o t i t th t acceleration   income and the  surge  in  wealth as  not  yet  been  fully  ncorporated  n in h i i people's  erceptions  f  their  ermanent  income. Another  possibility t e have p o p tha w noted  repeatedly  s  that here ay  be an increased  esire  o  save  for etirement. i t m d t r Discussion f  the  problems  of  the  social  ecurity d Medicare  systems  has  reinforced o s an the  already ncreased  ttention ven  in  the  media and elsewhere o  the  widespread i a gi t inadequacy  of  personal rovision  or etirement  ncome. The baby-boom generation  s p f r i i now in  its  rime  asset-accumulation  ars, nd the  bull arket  in  equities s p ye a m ha provided  an  extra ncentive  o  save. i t

We  continue o  believe,  owever,  that he  marked run-up  in  the  household t h t wealth-to-income  atio  ver  the  past ouple  of  years arries  ith  it he  potential r r o c c w t fo a considerable  levation  f  spending,  nd that his  s ne of  the  major  upside  risks  o o a t i o t aggregate emand in  the  near  term. Of course,  ne might  also eason hat  deeper d o r t a stock arket  setback han  we have  anticipated   this orecast  ould  have a  significant m t in f c adverse  effect  n the ense  of  well-being  f  many  families, th  contractionary  fects o s o wi ef on spending.

Residential vestment. ousing construction    expected o  drift  own  over in H is t d coming quarters, flecting  derating  growth  in  employment and the  projected  ise  n re mo r i mortgage  rates. otal ousing  starts,  ich were 1.47  million  nits n  1996,  are T h wh u i forecast  o  fall  o  1.41 million  n  1997 and 1.34  million  n  1998.  Some slippage  s t t i i i expected  in  multifamily  tarts,  t  the  bulk  of  the  decline  s  likely  o  occur  in  the s bu i t single-family  gment,  with  these tarts lling  o  a 1.12  million  nit ace  this ear se s fa t u p y and 1.06  million  nits n  1998. u i

These are  still ite ealthy evels f  construction  historical  andards. e qu h l o by st W believe hat  he  combination f  strong ob  gains  over  the  past ew years,  he  large ain t t o j f t g in  stock arket  wealth, nd the  favorable  ash-flow ffordability    home  ownership m a c a of

Under these  assumptions,  roductivity ows slightly low  trend n  1997 and p gr be i 1998--a  typical  attern  ate n  a  business  ycle xpansion.  While we do not  think hat p l i c e t there as  been a "stocking  p" of  workers  who will e unneeded  as  output ecelerates, h u b d there ave been  numerous reports  f  declining  orker  quality  nd the eed for h o w a n remedial raining  rograms. t p

International Developments

Recent  Developments

The  weighted-average  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  in  terms  of the  other  G-10 currencies  has appreciated  2-1/4  percent  further  since  the  February  FOMC  meeting. Continued  signs  of stronger-than-expected  real  output  growth  in  the United  States raised  the  perceived  likelihood  of tighter  U.S.  monetary  conditions  and  contributed  to upward pressure  on  the  dollar.

Much of the  dollar's rise  during  the  intermeeting  period  has  been  in  terms  of the  mark  and  other  European  currencies. Early  in  the  period,  indicators  of sluggish economic  activity  in Germany  raised  concerns  that  the  German  government  deficit will not  meet  the  Maastricht  standard  and contributed  to  downward  pressure  on  the  mark. Subsequently,  data  showing  strong  growth  in  German  M3  and  increased  speculation about the  prospects  for  a  delay  in  EMU  boosted  the  mark. On  balance,  the  dollar  has appreciated  a  little  more  than  2  percent  against  the  mark  and  French  franc  since  the February  FOMC  meeting  and  considerably  more  against the  lira  and the  Swedish krona. The  dollar  has  appreciated  1 percent  against  the  yen  since  the  February  FOMC meeting. In  early  February,  reports  of difficulties  at  Japanese  financial  firms contributed  to  yen  depreciation. Since  then,  data  showing  stronger  economic  activity in  Japan  and  a  larger-than-expected  increase  in  the  January  current  account  surplus have  lent  support  to  the  yen. The  dollar  has  appreciated 1-1/4  percent,  on balance, against  the  Mexican  peso  as  uncertainty  about  the  final  re-certification of Mexico  as a drug-fighting  ally  weighed  on  the  peso.

Both  short-term  and  long-term  market interest  rates  in  the  major  foreign industrial  countries  rose  about  15  basis  points,  on  average,  over  the  intermeeting period. Long-term  rates  rose  more  than  50 basis  points  in  Italy  in  response  to concerns  about  the  passage  of a mini-budget  to  lower  the budget  deficit  further  and  the prospects  for  Italy's participation  in  EMU;  Spanish  rates  moved  up  somewhat  less  on EMU  concerns. Long-term  rates  fell  about  10  basis  points  in  Japan,  as  passage  of the fiscal 1998  budget  dashed  hopes  for less  fiscal  contraction,  and  about  20  basis  points in  Switzerland,  as  economic  activity  remained  sluggish. Comparable  U.S.  long-term rates  rose more  than  25  basis  points  during  the  period.

. The Desk did  not  intervene.

Data  for  the  first  quarter  suggest  that  economic  activity  has  continued  to expand  moderately  on  average  in  the  foreign  G-7  countries;  output  growth  has  been strong  in  Japan,  Canada,  and the  United  Kingdom,  but was  considerably  weaker  in  the

In 1998,  domestic  demand is  expected  to p t g strengthen  hile  the  contribution om net  exports  essens,  aintaining  rowth  in  real w fr l m g output  at  nearly -1/2 ercent. n  the  United  Kingdom, real DP 2 p I G growth  is xpected e to  remain  healthy ver  the  forecast  eriod,  ut  to  slow  from 3 percent his  ear  to o p b t y about  2-1/4 ercent ext  year  as  domestic  demand  moderates  in  response o  projected p n t monetary  tightening.  n  Canada,  continued apid rowth  in  investment pending I r g s should  support igorous utput xpansion ver  the  forecast  eriod.

We  expect  1997 real n a ou GDP  growth  in  Argentina nd  Brazil o  be  about  4 percent nd  3  percent,  espectively; a t a r in 1998,  growth  in  Argentina hould  strengthen  n  response o  assumed passage  of s i t structural  forms n  the  labor arket.

Real  output n  our  major  Asian  trading  artners  s xpected  to  expand  6-3/4 i p i e percent n 1997,  slightly wer  than  the  forecast  n  the  last  reenbook;  our  forecast  or i lo i G f real rowth  during  1998 remains  7 percent. n  the  case  of  South  Korea,  the  6-3/4 g I percent rowth  forecast  or  1997 is  subject  o  some downside  risk ue to  possible g f t d renewed  labor nrest nd an unfolding inancial  candal. u a f s
