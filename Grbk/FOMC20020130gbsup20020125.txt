The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Federal Budget

The CBO has released a summary of The Budget and Economic Outlook:  Fiscal Years 2003-2012. Having incorporated the incoming economic information since last January, CBO's near-term economic forecast shows a mild recession followed by a modest recovery.  Real GDP is projected to increase 2.5 percent over the four quarters of 2002 and to accelerate to 4.3 percent in 2003.  The level of real GDP in 2003 is substantially lower than projected a year ago.  Over the period from 2004 to 2011, real GDP growth is assumed to average 3-1/4 percent per year-a touch faster than in last January's budget outlook. Despite the lower level of real GDP over the projection period, the CBO has not altered its longer-term assumption that the unemployment rate will level out at 5.2 percent.  This implies that the CBO has revised down its estimate of the rate of growth of potential GDP by about 1/4 percentage point.

Sales of Existing Homes

Sales of existing homes edged down 0.8 percent in December, with the decrease essentially coming all in the South.  Sales have remained flat, on balance, for about three years.  The number of existing homes for sale also decreased in December, leaving the months of supply roughly unchanged at about the average level that has prevailed for two years.

The average price of existing homes sold rose 6.5 percent in December from a year earlier, and the median price rose 8.4 percent-both faster rates of increase than have been seen in recent months.  The most recent figure for the repeat-sales price index for existing homes-which holds constant some of the compositional shifts that can affect average and median prices-is for the third quarter, when it was up 8.3 percent from a year earlier.
