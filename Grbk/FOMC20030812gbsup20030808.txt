Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Productivity and Costs

Output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 5.7 percent in the second quarter; that figure is based on the BEA's advance estimate that output of the nonfarm business sector (excluding the rental value of owner-occupied housing) rose at an annual rate of 3.4 percent last quarter while hours of all persons declined at a 2.2 percent rate.   Productivity is now shown to have risen at a 2.1 percent rate 1 in 2003:Q1.

With Thursday's report, the BEA revised the historical productivity and cost series to incorporate new estimates of hours worked.  Those new estimates folded in the recent benchmark and methodological revisions to hours from the establishment survey, revised estimates of data from the household survey that adjust for the 2000 Census population controls, and new survey-based adjustments to convert hours paid to hours worked.

Taken together, the changes to the data on hours worked had little effect on the previously published estimates of productivity and costs for the period before 2001.  That is, the newly reported level of hours in 2000 is little changed from the earlier estimate.  However, hours are now reported to have declined much more sharply in 2001 than previously estimated.  That revision can be traced largely to the methodological revisions that were made to data from the establishment survey data-specifically, the introduction of sample-based estimates and the conversion to the North American Industrial Classification System.  As a result,  output per hour in the nonfarm business sector is now reported to have risen 3.2 percent over the four quarters of 2001 compared with the 1.9 percent rise shown earlier.  Since then, hours are now estimated to have declined a bit more than previously reported, boosting the rate of productivity increase by roughly 0.3 percentage point over the period from 2001:Q4 to 2003:Q1 to an average of 4 percent.

Taken by themselves, the revised estimates of hours currently imply little change in the staff's view of the rate of increase in potential real GDP in recent years.  Although productivity has increased faster, on average, than previously reported, hours worked have declined more steeply.  Our initial review of the new data suggests that we would leave the level of potential output at the end of 2003 unchanged from that assumed in the August Greenbook.

The release also reported current and revised estimates of compensation per hour.  In addition to the revised estimates of hours, the hourly compensation figures were revised to reflect updated data on worker compensation from the National Income and Product Accounts as a result of the BEA folding in more current information on payrolls from the quarterly unemployment insurance tax records.  Hourly compensation is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the second quarter of 2003 after having increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the first quarter.  Nonetheless, the year-over-year change in hourly compensation last quarter was 2.8 percent, little different than the year-overyear changes reported for 2001 and 2002.

International Developments

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Foreign official inflows (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) slowed from the record $50 billion in May to $8 billion in June, owing primarily to a reduction in inflows from Japan, Russia, and Norway. Despite the slowdown in June, official inflows set a record for the second quarter.  In July, official holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York decreased, but this apparently owes to transfers to another U.S. custodian. Looking through these transfers, it appears that reserves increased modestly in July.

Private inflows into U.S. securities (line 4) also slowed from the May record-owing entirely to a shift from net purchases to net sales of agency bonds-but at $54 billion remained at exceptionally high levels.  Private foreign purchases of Treasury securities and corporate bonds continued at recent strong paces, while demand for U.S. equities picked up yet again.  For the second quarter as a whole, private foreign purchases of U.S. securities set a record ($164 billion), owing to record purchases of corporate bonds and the largest purchases of Treasury securities and equities since the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of 2002, respectively.

In June, U.S. investors sold foreign securities (line 5), as sales of foreign bonds exceeded purchases of foreign equities.  For the second quarter as a whole, net sales of foreign bonds of $21 billion more than offset foreign equity purchases of $17 billion.

Net capital flows through the banking sector (line 3) amounted to an outflow of $22 billion in June, bringing second quarter net banking inflows to $23 billion and year-to-date net flows to near zero.
