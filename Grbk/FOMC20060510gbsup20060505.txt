Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Private nonfarm payrolls increased 131,000 in April-a somewhat more moderate rise than in previous months-and the March level of employment was revised down 30,000. Aggregate hours rose a solid 0.5 percent in April, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.7 percent.

By industry, manufacturing employment increased 19,000 last month, boosted by a gain of 12,000 in the motor vehicle and parts sector, and the March level of factory jobs was revised up 15,000.  In industries related to manufacturing, wholesale trade employment continued to increase in April, but temporary-help employment was flat.  In other goodsproducing industries, recent increases in energy prices continued to boost mining activity and employment, while the construction industry saw its second consecutive month of moderate job gains following large advances earlier in the year.

Employment increases in services-producing industries were widespread in April, with the notable exception of retail trade, where payrolls fell 36,000; a downward revision to this industry's level of jobs in March accounted for much of the overall revision to private payrolls.  On net, retail trade employment has changed little since last summer. Elsewhere, robust job gains occurred in professional and technical services (21,000), financial activities (26,000), health care services (23,000), and leisure and hospitality (20,000).

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls ticked up 0.1 hour to 33.9 hours last month.   The increases in the workweek and employment led to an increase of 0.5 percent in the aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers, and aggregate hours now stand 0.7 percent (not at an annual rate) above their first-quarter average.

In the household survey, both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate were unchanged last month, at 4.7 percent and 66.1 percent respectively.  Two other indicators of labor market slack-the number of individuals working part time for economic reasons as a percent of employment and the number of individuals who are out of the labor force but would like a job as a percent of the labor force-were also little changed last month, though both have moved down over the past year.

-

The average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls increased 0.5 percent in April.  Last month's gain brings the increase over the last three months to an annual rate of 5.2 percent and the increase over the past twelve months to 3.8 percent, up from an increase of 2.7 percent over the preceding twelve months.

Productivity and Costs

The staff has updated its estimate of output per hour in the nonfarm business sector, and we now show an increase at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter.  Our estimate is noticeably higher than the one published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on Thursday.  The BLS report was based on the advance estimate of output published with the first-quarter GDP data; we have incorporated the incoming information on output-notably, the March data on outlays for construction put-in-place and manufacturers' inventories-that suggests a larger gain in first-quarter real GDP.

We estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 5¾ percent in the first quarter.  Quarterly changes in this measure of worker compensation have fluctuated noticeably, and, in the first quarter, hourly compensation was up 3¾ percent from a year earlier.  That pace marks a considerable step-down from the rate of increase over the preceding four quarters, which appeared to include a bulge in stock option exercises and large bonuses at the end of 2004.
