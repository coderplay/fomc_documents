The euro  came within one cent of parity with the dollar in the middle of July, but rose quickly afterwards  as signs of economic  recovery in France  and Germany became more abundant.  Ten-year government bond yields rose more than 30 basis points in the euro area over the intermeeting period, while the yields on comparable U.S.  Treasuries were little changed.  Expectations  that the European Central  Bank would raise interest rates 50 basis points or more during the year 2000 became more prevalent;  these interest rate expectations  were  seen as a factor behind the slight decline in share prices in Germany  and France.

During the period,  as data pointing to recovery in the United Kingdom were released, market participants  also came  to believe that the next interest rate move by the Bank  of England would be up, rather than down, which had been the prevailing opinion  in late June. These beliefs  were tempered by projections that inflation would remain below the Monetary Policy Committee's target for the next two years. British assets generally  outperformed euro-area assets, with ten-year gilt yields increasing only about  15  basis points,  and share prices  in London up slightly on balance.

In Latin America, financial markets  appeared particularly sensitive to prospects for rising  interest rates  in the  United States. The Brazilian real depreciated  6-1/4 percent, but the Mexican peso appreciated  slightly, supported in part by rising crude oil prices. Concerns over the viability of Argentina's currency board did not abate, as the recession  appeared  to deepen  and political  uncertainty increased ahead  of this fall's  presidential  election. Equity prices fell close to 13 percent in Brazil,  8 percent  in Argentina, and 6 percent in Mexico.  Brady yield spreads over Treasuries  widened  appreciably during the intermeeting period, with the Emerging Market Bond Index spread increasing  100 basis points on balance.
