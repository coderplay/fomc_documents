Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Employment gains have stepped down in recent months, reflecting to a large extent the weakness in the housing market.  Last month, private nonfarm payrolls rose 64,000, little different from the average rate over the three months ended in October, but down nearly 60,000 from the pace over the preceding three-month period.  In November, residential construction shed 20,000 jobs-its fourth month of sizable declines-and employment in housing-related sectors such as finance, real estate, and building material and gardensupply retailers continued to trend down.  Elsewhere, factory payrolls declined again, while employment in most service-producing industries continued to move up.

Because the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers has been unchanged, on balance, over the past year, the rise in aggregate hours has slowed in line with employment.  In November, the index of aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers inched up to a level 0.3 percent above its third-quarter average (not at an annual rate).

Indicators from the household survey also point to some recent softening in the labor market.   After having increased 0.2 percentage point over the third quarter, the 1 unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent for a third month in November.  Although the labor force participation rate moved back up to 66.1 percent last month, it remains about Â¼ percentage point below its recent peak earlier this year.

Other indicators of labor market activity point to some further slowing of labor demand in coming months.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance continued to trend up, but remains in a range consistent with modest employment gains.   In addition, the index of expected unemployment change over the 2 next twelve months in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers jumped in early December to its highest level since the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in September 2005.  Moreover, the National Federation of Independent Business reported that its index of net hiring plans continued to move down in November.

Average hourly earnings rose 0.5 percent in November following smaller increases in the previous two months.  Over the twelve months ended in November, average hourly earnings rose 3.8 percent, off a bit from the 4.1 percent pace over the previous twelve months.

Consumer Sentiment

The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment ticked down further in early December as a result of respondents more pessimistic views of the outlook for their personal finances and for business conditions in the year ahead.  Households' assessment of current conditions turned up a touch reflecting more a favorable opinion of buying conditions for large household durables.  Their appraisal of current buying conditions for cars slipped further, but, citing lower prices, their views of buying conditions for houses improved.

Respondents' median expectation for year-ahead inflation edged up further in December to 3.5 percent, and their median expectation for inflation over the next five to ten years moved up to 3.1 percent.  Both readings are at the high end of the range of the past two years.
