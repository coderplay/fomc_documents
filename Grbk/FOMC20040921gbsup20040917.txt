The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Prices

The consumer price index rose 0.1 percent in August, reversing the decline in July.  On a twelve-month change basis, overall CPI inflation was 2.7 percent last month, up 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier.  Excluding food and energy, the CPI ticked up 0.1 percent in August for the third month in a row; the August increase in the core was in line with our expectations and left the twelve-month change in this index at 1.7 percent, up 0.4 percentage point relative to a year earlier.

Consumer food prices edged up 0.1 percent last month as a decline of 1-3/4 percent in dairy prices partly offset increases in a number of other components.  Over the past twelve months, the CPI for food has risen 3.5 percent after having posted an increase of 2.5 percent over the preceding twelve-month period.

Energy prices declined 0.3 percent in August.  Motor fuel prices fell 1.5 percent last month following a 4-percent drop in July; moreover, available survey data point to a further decline in these prices in September.  Among other energy categories, prices of heating oil surged 5-1/4 percent, while natural gas prices rose 1 percent.  In all, consumer energy prices have jumped 10-1/2 percent over the twelve months ending in August, compared with an 11-3/4 percent increase over the preceding twelve months.

Core goods prices ticked down 0.1 percent last month.  These prices have fallen more than 1 percent over the past year, about a percentage point less rapidly than their decline over the preceding year.

Prices of non-energy services edged up 0.1 percent in August.  Shelter prices were flat, as a 1.7 percent decline in the index for lodging away from home offset a 0.3 percent increase in rents for owner- and tenant-occupied housing. Outside of shelter, prices of core services rose 0.2 percent, pushed lower by a drop of 3.7 percent in airfares.  Over the twelve months ending in August, prices of non-energy services rose 2.9 percent, 0.2 percentage point faster than their year-earlier rate of increase.

The chained CPI, or C-CPI-U, rose 2.1 percent over the twelve months ending in August, 0.6 percentage point less than the change in the official index.   The 1 corresponding change in the core C-CPI-U was 1.2 percent, 0.5 percentage point lower than the official core CPI.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment was unchanged in early September at 95.8, about equal to its average level since the beginning of the year.  An improvement in the 'expected conditions' component of the overall index was offset by a decline in the 'current conditions' component.  Within the 'expected conditions' component, households' assessments of business conditions rose, while their view of expected personal financial conditions worsened.  Within the 'current conditions' component, consumers' assessments both of their current personal financial situations and of buying conditions for large household appliances slipped.  Among the items not included in the overall index, households' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars and houses strengthened.

Inflation expectations edged up in early September.  The mean and median of expected inflation over the next twelve months rose to 3.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.  In addition, the mean and median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years edged up to 3.2 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively.
