RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Consumption, housing, and  business equipment spending appear to have advanced briskly this quarter. Were it not for the likelihood that net  exports and inventory investment have dropped off from their fourth-quarter rates, we  would be anticipating real GDP growth at least as strong as that seen in 1997. Indeed, growth in production worker hours in January and February was more robust than over the four quarters of  last year. The pressures on labor supplies have forced many employers to offer workers higher pay or other inducements. But, thanks in large measure to a  glut of oil this winter, price inflation has been almost negligible of  late. Labor Market Developments

Payroll employment gains averaged more than 340,000 in  the first two  months of  1998. Construction jobs continued to rise rapidly--even faster than in the fourth quarter. In  addition to  the strong fundamentals in  this sector, unseasonably warm  weather in much of  the country and the need to repair damage from ice storms and heavy rains appear to have provided some extra lift to employment. This should reduce the amount of additional hiring this spring, when the seasonal step-up in  construction typically takes place. Service-producing industries continued to post major job gains in  January and February. In  manufacturing, however, employment increases averaged 20.000 per month, off from double that pace in  the fourth quarter.

With two  months of strong growth in  payroll employment and further increases in the  workweek, aggregate hours of  production or nonsupervisory workers on  private nonfarm payrolls in  February were estimated by  BLS to  have been 1.6 percent (not at an  annual rate) above their fourth-quarter average. Reporting problems associated with variations in  the number of  workdays in the month appear to have biased the published quarterly pattern of  hours significantly. 1 Even adjusting for these problems, the February level of aggregate hours still would be 1.1 percent above its

- 1.  The BLS adjusts for  monthly variations in the number of workdays in  a  pay period for employees paid on  a  monthly or semimonthly basis. However, some firms have been reporting hours (and payrolls) for such employees as  though each month were of  a "typical" length. This reporting problem, which dates back to 1988, has led to an  overstatement of  hours in  months with fewer workdays and an  understatement in  months with more  workdays. In June, the BLS  will correct these reporting problems and  will revise the hours data back to 1988 accordingly.

fourth-quarter average, putting hours on  track to grow at least as fast in  the first quarter as they did in  the fourth quarter (on  an adjusted basis). 2

The household survey also portrayed a  robust labor market in early 1998. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.6 percent in February, and the participation rate rose to a  record 67.3 percent in  January and  held at that level in  February. Since the first quarter of 1997, the participation rate has risen 0.2 percentage point, with about half of  the increase reflecting a  further rise in participation among adult women who maintain families--an obvious group to  be  affected by  strong labor markets and  welfare reform.

With the January data, the BLS introduced new  composite estimation procedures intended to reduce the variance in  household employment. The new  method has very little effect on estimates of the unemployment rate, but it results in somewhat lower estimates of employment, the civilian labor force, and the participation rate. Had these new  procedures been in  place in  1997, we  estimate that the participation rate would have differed little from the published figures in  the first half of  the year but would have been nearly 1/4 percentage point lower in  the second half. This correction does not affect the 0.2 percentage point rise in  the participation rate over the past year.

Among other indicators, initial claims for  unemployment insurance have remained in the very low range of  300,000 to  320,000. The  Manpower Employment Outlook Survey index of expectations for  net hiring in  the second quarter of 1998 edged down from the first quarter but remained in the high range that has prevailed over the past year. The various surveys of companies' hiring experiences are all reporting tightness in  the labor market. In  addition, the index of  the expected change in  unemployment in  the preliminary Michigan SRC consumer survey for  March remained at one of its most optimistic readings.

<!-- missing-text -->

The strong gains in  employment and the workweek in  the fourth quarter of  1997 were accompanied by  an  increase in output per hour in  the nonfarm business sector of 1.6 percent at  an  annual rate. The reporting problems in  measuring the  workweek mentioned above probably caused published productivity growth in  the fourth quarter to be  understated by  between 1/2 and 1 percentage point, and we expect published productivity growth in  the first quarter of  1998 to be  understated by  a  similar amount. Over the four quarters of 1997, productivity rose 2.1 percent; this figure probably was not greatly affected by  the workweek measurement problems.

Industrial Production

After growing at  a  torrid pace in  the second half of  last year. industrial production decelerated noticeably over the first two months of  this quarter. In part, the slowdown reflected the effects of  the unusually warm weather on  utilities output. But signs of  a tapering were also apparent in manufacturing, where output rose only 0.3 percent in  January and was unchanged in  February--trimming the factory operating rate to its long-term average of 81-3/4 percent.

To some extent, the recent deceleration in  manufacturing production reflects developments in  the motor vehicle sector, where output had been boosted in late 1997 by  the make-up of  assembly shortfalls that occurred last spring and summer due to strikes and plant startup problems. With the adjustment apparently complete, assemblies fell back to  a  12.4 million unit annual rate in  January and to 12 million units in  February, reducing industrial production growth 0.1 percentage point in  each month. While inventories are

high for a  few  models of  light vehicles, days' supply, on  balance, is well aligned with demand. Looking ahead, the scheduled assembly pace for  March through June averages just a  bit above 12 million units--consistent with light vehicle sales remaining in  the vicinity of 15 million units, where they  have been for several years now.

The output of  business equipment excluding motor vehicles and parts has also slowed after having risen rapidly in 1997: It fell 0.6 percent in  January and was little changed in  February. Production of  industrial, communications, and photographic equipment has been weak, and aircraft assemblies have flattened out as  Boeing 4 nears completion of its ramp-up. As for other final products, the  production of non-automotive consumer goods has slowed a  bit recently after a  fourth-quarter spurt, while the strength in  the building sector has continued to  lift output of  construction supplies. The production of  non-automotive materials edged up 0.2 percent in  February after having increased just 0.1 percent in January--well off the pace set last year.

Leading indicators of  industrial production point to growth over the next few  months. On  a three-month moving average basis, the staff's estimate of  real adjusted durable goods orders advanced about 1 percent in  February. The  new  orders index from the NAPM also has turned up in  recent months, while the new orders index from the Dun and Bradstreet Manufacturing Survey remains at a high level.

While overall orders remain positive, reports from manufacturers indicate that export orders from  Asia are declining. In  addition, the diffusion index for export orders in  the NAPM survey was modestly negative in  both January and February--the first consecutive negative readings since the question was introduced in 1988. The role of  the Asia crisis in explaining the slowing in industrial output over the past couple of  months is unclear: Although production in  industries that export an  above-average share of their output to  Asian countries has slowed recently, output in

industries that export less heavily to  Asia also has decelerated (chart). 5

Finally, we  estimate that manufacturing capacity will grow 5.4 percent in  1998. 6 This preliminary estimate suggests that appreciable gains in  industrial demand can be  accommodated without straining productive facilities.

Personal Income and Consumption

Consumer spending surged in  early 1998. The factors that fueled the robust increase in consumption last year have, if anything, become more positive in  recent months: Growth in real disposable personal income has been very strong; households have continued to enjoy extraordinary gains in  net worth; and consumer sentiment has reached new  highs.

In  February, nominal sales in  the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 0.6 percent following an  upward-revised gain of more than 1 percent in  January. (The gain in  January had originally been reported as 0.4 percent.) Sales were especially strong at apparel and general merchandise stores and at stores selling "other durable goods," which include jewelry, books, and sporting goods. Based on  the February retail sales and consumer price reports, we estimate that real personal consumption expenditures for goods other than motor vehicles rose 1.4 percent in  January and 0.6 percent in February.

Adjusted for shifts in  reporting periods, sales of light motor vehicles averaged 15 million units at an annual rate in  January and February. This pace has been sustained in  part by  more attractive selling terms, including cut-rate finance charges and relatively generous price incentives. In recent weeks, General Motors has boosted its incentives to counter the richer packages offered by

Ford and Chrysler, and Toyota announced modest incentives on  the Camry and Corolla models--two of its leading sellers.

Real expenditures on  services rose only 0.2 percent in  January as  warmer-than-average temperatures reduced energy consumption sharply. In  February, real outlays for electricity and natural gas likely rose: According to  data from the National Weather Service, February also was warmer than average, but temperatures were closer to seasonal norms than they were in  January. In  March, temperatures thus far have been colder than average, suggesting another increase in  energy outlays this month.

Data on  personal income are available through January, when total nominal income increased 0.6 percent. Disposable personal income rose faster than  total income in  January--up 0.8 percent in nominal terms and 0.7 percent in  real terms. DPI growth was boosted in January by  a  federal pay increase for civilian workers, cost-of-living adjustments to several federal transfer programs, and the annual adjustment of  tax withholding schedules for inflation. Although such changes occur at the same time every year, the  BEA does not seasonally adjust them, which distorts income growth each January. In  addition, personal tax payments were reduced in January by  the tax changes legislated last year (for example, the child tax  credit). All told, these factors boosted DPI growth in January by  about $20 billion, or  0.3 percentage point. According to the latest published data, the saving rate rose to 4.2 percent in  January; however, these data do not reflect the huge upward revision to  January consumer spending, which, all else equal, would push the saving rate 0.2 percentage point below the published number. Turning to February, income growth likely remained strong, reflecting the increases in  production worker hours and wages reported in  the February employment release.

According to  the preliminary report of  the Michigan Survey Research Center, the index of  consumer confidence fell back in  early March after a  surge in  February. Nonetheless, consumer confidence,

as  measured by  both the SRC and Conference Board, has remained at extremely favorable levels.

Housing Markets

Housing activity has strengthened in  recent months, spurred by further gains in  employment, income, and  wealth as  well as by  the drop in  fixed mortgage rates. Single-family housing starts were at an annual rate of 1.27 million units in  February, up from January's 1.22 million unit pace; the average for these two months was more than 9  percent above the fourth-quarter average. Adjusted permits for single-family units, which we  view as  a  better indicator of underlying activity, rose close to 1 percent in  February and  have been on  a  solid uptrend since last September. Moreover, despite the strong readings on  starts in recent months, the backlog of unused permits, which has some utility as a  forward indicator for starts, has edged up since November.

The effects of  unseasonable weather on starts can  be quite pronounced during the  winter months, and they are difficult to pin down this year. For the nation as a whole, temperatures were well above average in  January and February--a clear plus for builders-but  precipitation, which tends to slow construction, has been unusually heavy since November. Our  best guess is that, on  balance, starts were boosted to some extent by  this winter's weather, but that much of  the strength in the single-family sector so far this year is attributable to strong fundamentals.

Indeed, indicators that are  less affected by  weather than starts all point to a brisk pace of  housing demand. The thirtyyear, fixed-mortgage rate, which averaged 7.9 percent in  the first half of  1997, fell sharply in  the second half of  last year and has averaged just a  shade over 7 percent so far this year. Partly in response to the decline in long-term interest rates, mortgage applications--both for home purchase and refinancing--surged to record levels, and  home sales responded accordingly. Sales of existing houses in  February were at a  record-setting 4.75 million unit annual rate, up  sharply further from the strong January reading. New  home sales in January came in  just shy of  880,000 units, about equaling the record posted in 1986. More timely indicators have also shown continued strength. Builders' ratings of both current and expected new  home sales, which have climbed

steadily during the past year or so, edged up  further in  March. Consumers' assessments of  homebuying conditions this month were upbeat. Finally, although mortgage applications for home purchase have receded in  recent weeks, they are still at a very high level.

Multifamily starts were at  a  366,000 unit annual rate in February. During the first two months of  this year, these starts averaged 346,000 units, down noticeably from the 390,000 unit pace posted in  the fourth quarter of last year and only a  touch above their 1997 average. Although the fundamentals for this sector--such as rents and vacancy rates--have improved during the past year or two, they do  not suggest that rental markets have tightened appreciably. As a  result, the drop in construction of these units during the first two months of  this year was not surprising. Business Fixed Investment

Available indicators suggest that real business fixed investment--which declined in  the fourth quarter--will rise briskly in  the current quarter. Although the spending indicators for nonresidential structures have been surprisingly lackluster, the combination of  rebounding shipments and plummeting computer prices points to a  sizable gain in  real equipment outlays.

A  huge increase in real outlays for office and computing equipment appears to  be under way this quarter: Nominal shipments surged 9  percent in  December and tacked on  further increases of 2  and 3  percent in  January and February respectively. Meanwhile, the producer price index for computing equipment fell nearly 10 percent over the first two months of 1998. In  part, the plunge in  prices reflects heightened competition at  the low  end of  the microprocessor market, which has contributed to the boom of sales of low-end PCs. Also important, manufacturers are offering significant discounts to clear out inventories of a broad range of computers. In  some cases, they are cutting prices to facilitate a  shift to the build-to-order practices used by  Dell, which holds inventories equal to only one week's sales. In  addition, many producers of  high-end servers and  workstations apparently did not  move quickly enough to match the steep cuts at  the lower end of the market and are now slashing prices to  clear out their distribution channels.

The outlook for communications equipment has also improved. After having declined in  the fourth quarter, shipments and orders for communications equipment rose substantially, on average, in January and February. More generally, widening use of  the Internet,

upgrading of cable systems, and long-distance telephone companies' plans for entering local phone markets suggest the potential for further healthy gains in expenditures in this category this year.

Transportation equipment expenditures are likely to  hold down business investment in the first quarter. The drag comes mostly from the aircraft industry. As  noted, production has flattened out, and our sources indicate that a very high percentage of  this quarter's output will be  exported, implying that domestic expenditures on aircraft are likely to  fall.

Recent indicators for spending on  equipment outside of  the high-tech and transportation sectors have been  mixed. Shipments have edged up, on  balance, so far this year, but orders have bounced around and their three-month moving average has dropped back  from the very  high readings in  the second half of 1997. Nonetheless, lagged accelerator effects should remain a  plus for growth in expenditures over the coming months.

The evidence on  nonresidential construction activity continues to  be  puzzling. The fundamentals in  some key segments appear very strong, and anecdotal reports seem quite upbeat. Vacancy rates are continuing to decline, and real estate prices are accelerating: According to  the National Real Estate Index, prices for both office and retail buildings rose 8  percent over the year ended in 1997:Q3 (the  latest available data), up  from a  4  percent rise for office buildings and a  1-1/2 percent increase for retail buildings over the year-earlier period. However, nominal private nonresidential building construction has not changed much, on  balance, since last summer. Private construction contracts rose 21 percent in February, reversing their January plunge, but, on a  six-month moving average basis, they remained almost 6  percent below last September's peak. Taken together, these data suggest limited potential for expansion in  real outlays on  nonresidential structures in  the first 10 quarter.

The surprising lack of strength in  nonresidential construction activity might be  due to problems with the source data for the official estimates. When choosing a  sample of  construction projects on  which to  base its estimates of construction put-in-place, the

Census Bureau uses F.W. Dodge's data on  construction contracts. Recently, Dodge altered its data collection methodology, moving toward electronic reporting, while Census changed its sample construction technique. These changes arouse suspicions, but they do  not clearly point to a  downward bias in  the construction put-inplace data.

Business Inventories

In  book-value terms, business inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at  an $18 billion annual rate in  January, after an accumulation of $43 billion in  the fourth quarter of 1997. For most manufacturing and trade groupings, inventory-sales ratios in  January were near the  middle of  their recent ranges. On  the whole, business inventories appear to  be  at comfortable levels.

Manufacturers' stocks excluding aircraft and parts rose $14 billion in  January, about the same as in  the fourth quarter. Among sectors that export heavily to  Asia, the pace of stockbuilding picked up  a  bit at  producers of  electrical machinery, but stocks rose only moderately at producers of  instruments, and inventories in the nonelectrical machinery sector declined, reflecting a large drop in stocks held by  office and computing manufacturers.

Refiners' inventories fell sharply further in January, probably reflecting the steep reduction in oil prices. 11 However, nominal shipments of  petroleum declined even more, and the inventoryshipments ratio for this sector remained at  the high end of the past year's range.

Wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles fell $18 billion at an  annual rate in  January. The drop was in stocks of  nondurable goods and largely reflected a  return of  farm products inventories to more normal levels and a  sharp drop in tobacco stocks (on  a  not seasonally adjusted basis).

Inventories at  non-auto retailers rose at  nearly a  $20 billion annual rate in  January. This increase came on  the heels of a similar-sized buildup in  December, though the stockbuilding in January was more evenly spread across categories. Retail sales were also very strong in  January, and the inventory-sales ratio edged down toward the lower end of  the range that has prevailed over the past year.

Federal Sector Developments

<!-- missing-text -->

Federal Sector

The incoming news on  the federal budget has remained very favorable. Bolstered by  continued strong revenue growth, the  budget showed a  small surplus over the twelve months ending in February, and a  surplus for fiscal 1998 is looking increasingly likely. Indeed, in  early March, the Congressional Budget Office released updated estimates that showed a  surplus of $8  billion for fiscal 1998; in  January, the CBO had projected a  deficit of  $5  billion. 1 2

According to the  Monthly Treasury Statement, receipts in January and February were 8  percent above a year earlier. Individual income and payroll taxes rose 9 percent; by  comparison, personal income rose 6 percent over the twelve months ended in January. Rising liabilities owing to  bonuses, capital gains realizations, and real bracket creep appear to  have more than offset the downward pressures on  receipts from legislated tax reductions that are now  kicking in. Personal income tax refunds--including the portion of  the earned income tax credit that is scored as an outlay for income security--were 13 percent higher in  January and February than in  the same months of 1997. The surge in refunds largely reflects faster processing by  the IRS owing to  increased use of electronic filing. The  amount of  the average refund rose only 3  percent to about $1400.

Outlays grew slowly in  January and February. Contributors included the effects of declining inflation on the social security COLA and many other transfer payments, slower growth of  net federal debt and thus debt service payments, a  decline in  the use of lowincome support programs, and the  phase-in of  cuts made to  Medicare last year. In  addition, nominal defense outlays, adjusted for payment timing shifts, fell about 4  percent in  January and February from the same period last year. Taking a  longer perspective, defense expenditures have been moving sideways over the past two years.

State and Local Governments

Recent indicators of spending by state and local governments have been mixed. Growth in  employment averaged 25,000 in  the first two months of  the year, well ahead of  the fourth-quarter pace but

about matching the average rise during all of 1997. Real construction spending in  January was about 1 percent below the fourth-quarter average.

Most states are currently in the process of  preparing their fiscal 1999 budgets. With robust revenue growth, ending balances in state general funds are at their highest levels as a  percentage of expenditures since 1980, and governors in almost half the states are proposing tax cuts. However, according to  the National Conference of State Legislatures, this year's tax changes are unlikely to  be much bigger than  the small to  medium-sized reductions seen in  recent years. Once again, the emphasis is  expected to  be  on  cuts in personal income taxes. Some states are also considering facilitating reductions in  property taxes, which are primarily local taxes, by  increasing state grants to localities for K-12 school 13 programs.

Local governments also appear to be  doing well. According to a 1997 survey by  the  National League of  Cities, more than two-thirds of cities were better off financially in  fiscal 1997 than in  the previous year; that percentage has been rising for five years. Local governments whose revenues come in large part from income taxes and state grants seem to be  better-off than those more dependent on  property taxes.

Prices

The consumer price index was unchanged in January and edged up only 0.1 percent in  February, as  large declines in  energy prices nearly offset increases elsewhere.14 Over the twelve months ending in  February, the CPI rose only 1.4 percent, the smallest twelve-month increase since December 1986. (The  oil-induced low in CPI inflation that year was 1.1 percent.)

The CPI for energy has dropped considerably since late 1997, mainly reflecting the slump in  crude oil prices. After averaging more than $21 per  barrel in  October, the spot price of  West Texas intermediate fell substantially through mid-March before rebounding

Daily  Spot and Posted Prices  of est Texas Intermediate W

<!-- missing-text -->

Monthly Average  Prices of  West  Texas Intermediate

<!-- missing-text -->

somewhat in  recent days. It  now stands at around $15-1/2 per barrel. As a  result of  the decline in  crude oil prices, gasoline and heating oil prices plunged in  January and February, and private survey data suggest that, on  a  seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of gasoline dropped further in  March. The indexes for natural gas and electricity have declined as  well, as  warmer-than-usual weather weakened demand. Electricity prices were also depressed by legislated price cuts in  January associated with the initial stages of deregulation in  California and a  rebate in  February to California customers for the lower-than-expected fuel input costs by  utilities in 1997. 1 5

The CPI for food rose 0.3 percent in  January but was unchanged in  February. The price index for fruits and vegetables fell back somewhat last month after having risen sharply in January. Excluding fruits and vegetables, food prices were up 0.1 percent in the latest month, the same as in  each of  the previous two months. El  Niño probably has played a  role in  the recent volatility of fresh produce prices, with flooding having temporarily disrupted field operations in both the  West and the South. More generally, though, El  Niño's effects are less clear, as  the  mild winter has spared agriculture from many of  the normal adversities of  the  winter season. Livestock operations, for example, were less strained than usual by  the winter this year, and production has thereby been increased--perhaps more so than producers might have wished, given the degree to  which livestock prices were pushed down in  the first two  months of the year. Meanwhile, crop prices have not achieved their customary seasonal gains so far this year, partly because of concerns that the problems in  Asia will limit exports. Reflecting these developments, the PPI for crude foods--an index that includes both crops and livestock--fell 4 percent over the first two months of  1997 to a  level more than 5  percent below that of  a  year earlier. And, futures prices for farm commodities have weakened, on  balance, since the January Greenbook.

For items other than food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in  January and 0.3 percent in  February. On  a  twelvemonth basis, core consumer prices rose 2.3 percent in  February, down

slightly from the 2.5 percent pace recorded a  year earlier but up a touch from the  pace recorded in  the previous couple of  months. Core services prices advanced 3.1 percent over the past twelve months-about the same as over the preceding year. Falling import prices likely were a factor helping to  hold the rate-of change of  core CPI commodities to 0.4 percent over the year ending in  February. Prices of  new vehicles, which have been restrained by  the strong dollar and competition for market share, were unchanged on  balance in  the first two months of  this year after having declined in  1997. And  while used car and truck prices have moved up in  the past three months, they remain 4  percent below their year-earlier level. Apparel prices, while volatile on  a  month-to-month basis, were down on balance in January and February and unchanged from a  year ago after having risen somewhat in  the previous twelve-month period. In contrast, tobacco prices have accelerated sharply; the index's 10 percent increase over the past year reflects three large wholesale price hikes and a  number of  hefty increases in state excise taxes.

Broad measures of  prices in the NIPA decelerated last year. For example, the chain price indexes for GDP and for PCE excluding food and energy rose 1/2 and 3/4 percentage point less over the four quarters of 1997 than they did during 1996. As  with the CPI, the chain price index for core PCE was held down in 1997 by  a decline in  durable goods prices and a  deceleration in services other than energy and housing.

Prices of  capital equipment in  the PPI edged down 0.1 percent in  both January and February, reflecting further declines for motor vehicles and a  very large drop in  computer prices. In  contrast, reports of  price pressures in  trucking and rail transportation have begun to surface recently. The PPI for railroad transportation was up 1.1 percent in  the twelve months ending in February, the largest increase since May 1994. The PPI for trucking and courier services also moved up  in  the first two months of this year, although the twelve-month change in  the index--2.3 percent--was still 1/4 percentage point below the twelve-month change last February.

Prices at earlier stages of  processing remain quiescent. The PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy edged down 0.1 percent in  both January and February, and the index in  February was unchanged from its level a  year earlier. The PPI for core crude materials fell 2.2 percent in  January but edged up  in  February, the

first increase in six months. Since the mid-February pricing date for the PPI, the Journal of  Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price indexes have ticked up, on  balance, but remain below their levels at the end of  last year.

After having dropped in 1997, short-term inflation expectations have fallen further this year. As  measured by  the Michigan SRC index, one-year-ahead inflation expectations--both the  mean and the median--fell about 1/2 percentage point in  the first quarter. Longer-term inflation expectations, measured by  either the Philadelphia Fed's survey of  professional forecasters or the Michigan survey, edged down in  the first quarter.

Subdued price inflation and declining inflation expectations notwithstanding, the BLS's Productivity and Cost report shows that compensation per hour in  the nonfarm business sector rose at  a 5.2 percent annual rate in  the fourth quarter of last year. Over the four quarters of 1997, compensation per hour grew 4.1 percent, up  about a  quarter point from the rate recorded in 1996. The Employment Cost Index for compensation--which controls for occupational and industry mix shifts but excludes some forms of remuneration such as stock options and sign-on bonuses--rose 3.4 percent last year, also about 1/4 percentage point faster than the increase recorded in 1996.

Despite the acceleration in compensation in 1997, the pickup in productivity growth last year limited the increase in  unit labor costs to 1.9 percent. Even so, the rise in  unit labor costs was about 1/2 percentage point greater than that in  output prices, and the price markup over unit labor costs in  the nonfarm business sector continued to edge down.

Readings of labor costs this quarter are primarily limited to the BLS monthly data on  average hourly earnings of  production or nonsupervisory workers. In  January and February, hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent and 0.6 percent respectively. The published data, however, have been distorted by reporting problems with the  workweek data. 1 6 After adjusting for this distortion, average hourly earnings would have increased 0.3 percent in January and 0.4 percent in  February.

APPENDIX

THE FISCAL 1999 BUDGET

On  February 2,  President Clinton submitted his fiscal 1999 budget to the Congress. In  early March, CBO released a  preliminary analysis of  the President's budgetary proposals, which also included an  update of  its January baseline budget estimates. The CBO analysis incorporated recent budget data, but the economic assumptions were unchanged from those published in  January. The Administration's and the CBO's budget and economic outlooks are quite similar.

I. Baseline Budget Projections

The Administration estimates that the budget will record a $10 billion deficit this fiscal year and  move into surplus next year--if the discretionary spending caps enacted in  1997 are adhered to  and if  no  new tax  or  mandatory spending policies are enacted (table 1). The baseline surplus is projected to grow  to $89 billion (3/4 percent of GDP) in  fiscal 2003. This improvement in  the budget balance occurs despite a  fall in  receipts as a  share of  GDP because the outlay share falls even faster. The Administration projects that the surplus will widen further to 2  percent of  GDP by  2008 as outlays continue to shrink relative to GDP and the receipts share holds steady.

CBO has released new  estimates that show an  $8  billion surplus in  fiscal 1998, mainly because of  the continued strength in receipts. CBO's projections are essentially the same as  OMB's through fiscal 2000. But CBO is less optimistic about the outlook for subsequent years, and their projected surplus grows to only 1 percent of  GDP by  2008 (table 2). The chief difference between the OMB and CBO  baseline projections is the expected pace of Medicare spending.

The  key factor damping outlay growth in  both OMB's and CBO's baseline projections is the restraint implied by  the statutory caps on  discretionary spending, which would cause discretionary outlays to  fall from 7  percent of  GDP in  fiscal 1997 to around 5-1/2 percent of  GDP in  fiscal 2002 when the current caps expire. The projections hold discretionary spending constant in  real terms after 2002, which lowers its share of GDP further. Net interest outlays also are expected to decline as a  share of GDP throughout the projection, mainly because of a  decline in  the debt-to-GDP ratio, while mandatory spending will continue to grow faster than GDP under current policies.

Meanwhile, OMB and CBO expect the receipts share of  GDP to remain near 20 percent over the next couple of  years, but to drift down to roughly 19-1/2 percent by  2001 and hold steady thereafter. The projected decline mainly reflects: (1) the 1997 tax changes, which boost revenues in  fiscal 1999 but subsequently reduce them  by

an  amount equal to 0.3 percent of  GDP; (2)  an  anticipated fall in the "high-tax income share" (the  sum of corporate profits plus wages and salaries as a  percent of  GDP): and (3)  an  assumed gradual unwinding of some of  the  factors (including the extraordinary run-up in  capital gains realizations) that have elevated receipts in recent years.

II. Economic Assumptions

The broad contours of  OMB's and CBO's economic assumptions are about the same. OMB and CBO  both finalized their economic assumptions in  early December, and neither anticipated the continued strength in  economic activity in  late 1997 and early 1998 or  the sharp declines in  oil prices and domestic interest rates since late last year.

OMB expects real GDP growth to slow to a  2.0 percent rate in 1998 and to remain there until the  unemployment rate moves back to the Administration's point estimate of  the  NAIRU, 5.4 percent, in 2001 (table 3). In subsequent years, real GDP is projected to rise 2.4 percent per year--matching the  Administration's estimate of real potential GDP growth. The projected increase in real GDP reflects 1.1 percent annual gains in  the labor force and 1.3 percent productivity growth. Inflation, as measured by  the CPI, is projected to remain subdued. Although high resource utilization rates in  the near term  are expected to put upward pressures on prices, low  import prices and technical changes to the CPI are expected to  hold down measured inflation.

CBO's projections are similar to those of  OMB. The chief differences are the following:

- * CBO projects real GDP growth to stay below potential longer, allowing the unemployment rate to rise a  bit above its 5.8 percent NAIRU estimate.
- * CBO expects inflation to pick up  more than does OMB and assumes that the  wedge between CPI inflation and the GDP deflator will be  larger. All else equal, a  larger wedge implies a  smaller budget surplus because the CPI is used to index spending programs and the GDP deflator is a  component of  income and thus tax growth.
- * CBO assumes that the high-tax income share will fall more rapidly than does OMB.

III. Policy Proposals

The President outlined a number of  initiatives for receipts and outlays. According to OMB, these changes would have small budgetary effects and be roughly deficit-neutral in  the aggregate. However, the President wants to  modify current budget guidelines by  using increases in taxes to lift the caps on discretionary spending as

well as  to fund some additional mandatory spending. CBO  expects that the Administration's policies would reduce the surplus by $9 billion in  fiscal 1999, relative to  current services, and by $5 billion to $15 billion in  each of  the next four years. The difference between the two estimates stems from different views about the speed at  which the proposed budget authority would translate into outlays.

Discretionary spending. Under last year's budget agreement, nominal discretionary spending was slated to rise 1-1/2 percent in fiscal 1999 and then remain essentially flat through 2002 when the caps expire (table 4). In real terms, defense spending was expected to fall in each of  the  next two fiscal years, while nondefense spending was expected to edge up  in  fiscal 1999 but shrink in fiscal 2000. According to  OMB estimates, the Administration's proposals do not change the path of  defense spending relative to  last year's budget agreement. However, nondefense discretionary outlays would grow  more in  real terms in fiscal 1999 and fall more slowly than previously anticipated in  subsequent years.

- * OMB estimates that discretionary spending would be  $5  billion higher than the existing caps in fiscal 1999 and $16 billion higher in  fiscal 2002.
- * According to CBO calculations, the President's plans would boost spending even further above the existing caps owing to CBO's evaluation of  how  quickly new  budget authority is converted into outlays, particularly for defense and subsidized housing. CBO's anticipated "spendout rates" raise outlays $4  billion to $7  billion per year above OMB's estimates.

Mandatory spending. On  net, OMB estimates that the President's proposals would boost mandatory spending about $4 billion per year. Most of  the increase would be for provisions expected to  be authorized in  the tobacco legislation--namely unrestricted grants to state governments and a  variety of  health initiatives. In addition, the President wants to raise spending on education programs, child care, and food stamps. The President's plan to extend Medicare to certain individuals under age 65 is expected to  have little effect on the budget, at  least in  the near term; this plan would allow persons aged 62 to 64  to  purchase Medicare on  an  actuarially fair basis (some of  which may  be  paid after age 65 though increased premiums) and allow previously insured displaced workers over age 55 to buy into Medicare at set rates. Elsewhere, the Administration expects to save nearly $17 billion over five years by  reversing a ruling concerning veterans' compensation for tobacco-related illnesses; last year they  were ruled to  be  service-related disabilities. CBO estimates that the President's mandatory spending initiatives would be  more costly than the OMB expects, reflecting

- 4.  Two budget control mechanisms are in  place; discretionary spending caps and the PAYGO system which controls mandatory spending and taxes. In  the past, there have been shifts in  budget resources between discretionary and mandatory spending, but there have not yet been instances of  interchanging resources between taxes and discretionary spending.
- 5.  In  prior years, discretionary spending caps have been adjusted to  offset the  budget effects of  changes to  mandatory spending programs that were included in  the appropriations bills. The President proposes to raise the  budget caps in  a  similar manner to reflect higher receipts from the tobacco settlement, restoration of Superfund excise and income taxes, and increased airport and airway user fees.

different judgments about the cost savings that would emanate from this change in  veterans' compensation. CBO's estimates for the expansion of  Medicare are similar to those of  the  Administration.

Receipts. Both OMB and CBO  estimate that the President's proposals would add about $19 billion per  year (0.2 percent of  GDP) to receipts once the changes are fully phased in. Most of the increase would come from legislation that the  Administration anticipates will arise out of last year's tobacco settlement. Other key proposals affecting receipts include the following:

- * Tax cuts amounting to about $5  billion per  year when fully phased in, including an  expanded child care credit, personal and business tax credits to promote energy efficiency and school construction, an  extension of  the research and experimentation tax credit, and  tariff reductions.
- * Tax increases on  businesses, including limits on  the use  of foreign tax credits, restrictions on  rules for corporate-owned life insurance, and changes in  the tax treatment of  reserves set aside for annuity contracts. Restoration of  the expired Superfund excise and income taxes and conversion of  the airport and airway trust fund excise taxes to user fees, but at higher effective rates.

Most interest rates are unchanged or a  little higher, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting. Market participants generally interpreted Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony as signaling that Fed policymakers were less inclined toward easing than had been thought. With incoming data on  the strong side, rates rose in  late February but retraced a good bit of  that advance in early March. Although some economic reports this month came in stronger than anticipated, others showed inflation to be low, and declining oil prices may  have reinforced expectations that inflation would remain in  check. Federal funds futures rates are flat through the summer, suggesting (after allowance for a small term premium) low odds of a  policy easing later in  the year (chart). Despite some evidence of slipping corporate credit ratings and  weaker profit prospects, quality spreads have held steady and equity prices have advanced sharply.

Borrowing, except by  the federal government, has been substantial of  late. With long-term interest rates at relatively low  levels, businesses have issued a  considerable amount of  bonds, but they have also tapped the commercial paper market and banks in volume. Low interest rates have spurred mortgage debt growth, which rose toward year-end and seems to  have remained strong this quarter. Some of  this mortgage borrowing has probably replaced consumer loans, damping growth in  consumer credit. State and local governments have taken advantage of  improved budget positions and a favorable rate environment to finance long-needed investment projects and to refinance more costly debt. The continued improvement of  the fiscal position of  the federal government has held down Treasury borrowing.

The rapid growth in  the monetary aggregates in  the final quarter of  last year has extended into the early months of this year. M2 is growing rapidly relative to estimates of nominal income, even though its opportunity cost has not changed much. Growth of  M3  has been boosted by  funding needs arising from the rapid expansion of  bank assets, reflecting the overall strong demand for credit.

of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations was a  strong $9 billion in February (table), after extremely heavy issuance in January, and partial data suggest continued brisk issuance this month. Speculative-grade bond offerings were strong in  both January and February and only slightly less so in  early March. Proceeds were used partly to finance investment in  the capital-intensive telecommunication sector. Net issuance of  nonfinancial commercial paper was heavy in  February, though below the torrid January pace; data for the first part of  this month show some cooling off. Borrowing from banks by nonfinancial corporations continued at a double-digit pace last month but has probably slowed a  bit in  March.

Recent indicators hint at a  slight deterioration in  corporate credit quality. Over January and February, Moody's downgraded $53 billion more of nonfinancial corporate debt than it upgraded, at an annual rate (chart). Looking forward, Moody's has $20 billion more nonfinancial debt under review for a  possible downgrade than it has under review for a  possible upgrade. In  addition, the percentage of total business liabilities accounted for by failed businesses moved up in  January and February mainly because of  the bankruptcy filings of  two large retailers (chart).

Still, overall credit quality remains good, and debt markets have absorbed all this borrowing by businesses with little effect on rate spreads. After moving up late last year, spreads between investment-grade bonds and thirty-year Treasuries have held fairly steady so  far this year. The junk-bond spread over Treasuries has come down after rising in  January and is just above historic lows. Spreads on  bank business loans have been little changed recently.

Market reports on the outlook for corporate profits have been mixed over the intermeeting period. The Institutional Brokers Estimate System (I/B/E/S) "bottom-up" forecast of year-ahead earnings for the S&amp;P 500--an aggregation of projections from individual company analysts--was revised down sharply in  February (chart). This owed mainly to analysts' expectations of  the negative impact of  lower oil prices on energy companies, the looming effects of the Asian crisis, and greater competitive pricing pressures on prominent technology companies. Preliminary data for March indicate substantial further downward revisions. Even after these revisions, the "bottom-up" outlook has 1998 profit growth at an  optimistic 9 to 10 percent. In contrast, I/B/E/S's "top-down" forecast of  yearahead S&amp;P 500 profit growth--an average of  the macro projections of

strategists--has been revised down only slightly. This outlook has been well below the "bottom-up" forecast, and it continues to project 1998 profit growth of  about 6  to 7  percent. At  the same time, long-run corporate profit expectations have not  been revised down at all. I/B/E/S's "bottom-up" forecast of five-year earnings growth remained at its record level in  March (chart).

Perhaps reflecting the still-optimistic long-run forecasts of earnings, the stock market as a  whole has been largely impervious to short-run profit concerns (chart). Indeed, major indexes have risen 8-3/4 to 10 percent in  the intermeeting period, leaving priceearnings ratios at  or  near all-time highs. Meanwhile, volatility of equity prices has subsided in recent weeks from the very  high levels reached at  the onset of  the Asian crisis (chart).

Gross equity issuance increased in  February, to $5-1/4 billion, swollen by  issues to finance mergers and acquisitions and a  step-up of initial public offerings, as pricing conditions for new shares improved. Partial data for March suggest that gross issuance has remained healthy. Net equity issuance, however, continued to  be negative, as mergers and  acquisitions retired nearly $18 billion of equity over the first two months of  the year. This amount was a  bit above the strong average monthly pace of last year. Share repurchases also likely remained brisk, as announcements have totaled $22 billion so far this year.

Household Finance

Current indicators point to solid growth in  household debt this quarter, near the brisk pace of  late last year. According to our flow of  funds estimates, growth in  home mortgage debt climbed to an 8-1/4 percent annual rate in  the fourth quarter of 1997, and information on the first quarter suggests little slackening: Real estate loan growth at  banks and information on  mortgage pools, coupled with increases in reported home sales and high readings on the application indexes of the  Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA), all point to continued strength. Though off its peak early in  the year, the MBA  purchase-money index has remained in  historically high territory throughout the first quarter (chart). The  MBA refinancing index also remains high, although below its peak in  early January (chart). 1

Delinquency  Rates on Household Debt

(Seasonally adjusted, quarterly)

Consumer credit expanded about 2-3/4 percent at an  annual rate in  January (table), extending the gradual slowing trend that began in 1995. Some slowdown is fairly typical for consumer credit in  the more advanced stages of  an economic expansion.2 Last year's deceleration, however, was amplified by  households stepping up  their use of  home equity debt (included in  the mortgage debt statistics) as an  alternative to consumer loans. The staff estimates that this substitution shaved roughly 3  percentage points from consumer debt growth and added 1 percentage point to  mortgage debt growth in 1997. This year, cash-out refinancings of home mortgages may be substituting for both consumer and home equity credit.

Recent trends in  household debt quality generally have been encouraging. Call Report data for all domestically chartered banks, which leveled out last year, showed only a  small rise in  delinquency rates on all consumer loans and on credit card loans in  the fourth quarter (chart). Data from the American Bankers Association (ABA) showed a  slight drop in  the delinquency rate for all closed-end consumer loans and a  steep drop for credit card accounts in  the fourth quarter (chart), but these results are considered less reliable than Call Report data. 3

Other performance measures were mixed. After reaching record highs in the first part of 1997, delinquency rates at the captive auto finance companies dropped sharply at  year-end. In contrast, the ABA series on auto loan delinquencies rose noticeably in the fourth quarter (chart). The MBA  reported small increases in mortgage delinquency rates in  the fourth quarter, but these rates had  been hovering near their lowest levels in twenty years (chart). Meanwhile, the rating agencies reported declining charge-offs in January and February on  credit card receivables backing asset-backed securities. Finally, the steep rise in personal bankruptcies that

Federal Government Finance

The Treasury ran down its cash  balance last quarter and is doing so again this quarter, thereby limiting its borrowing from the public. Nonetheless, to  bridge seasonal needs for social security payments and  early tax refunds, the  Treasury auctioned two shortterm cash management bills, which settled in  mid-February and early March. The  Treasury has chosen to  absorb most of  the effects of surprisingly strong tax  inflows and increased issuance of  indexed debt in the bill sector, leading to redemptions that have shrunk the stock of regular (three-month, six-month, one-year) bills by  more than $100 billion since the beginning of  last year. At  the midquarter refunding in  February the Treasury sold $35 billion of three-year, ten-year, and thirty-year securities, the same total amount as  in  November's refunding.

To contribute further to the development of the  market for indexed debt, the Treasury announced plans to sell a  thirty-year indexed bond in  April 1998 but did not announce a  planned auction size. About $41 billion of indexed debt, amounting to 1  percent of all marketable Treasury debt, is outstanding.

Shortly after the onset of the Asian currency crises, the prospect of sizable liquidity needs in  the region sparked fears of massive sales of Treasury securities. There was a  moderate amount of selling among Asian holders just after the crisis began in  the fall of last year, and in  December 1997 public and private Asian holders (mainly Japanese) were big  net sellers, liquidating about $15 billion of Treasury securities. Treasury data for January 1998, however, show that net sales slowed to about half that amount.

Spreads between rates on  noncallable federal agency securities and Treasuries remained steady over the intermeeting period, even as government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) continued to issue lots of debt. In global issues alone, GSEs marketed bonds worth nearly $18 billion, with the bulk of that denominated in  U.S. dollars. A further spur to GSE offerings has been reduced issuance by  the Treasury.

placed to expand their balance sheets to take advantage of this opportunity.

State and Local Government Finance

Though somewhat off last quarter's rapid pace, gross issuance of long-term municipal debt was strong in January and February (table). A  generally favorable interest rate environment kept refundings moving along at a  good clip. Strong economic growth has improved the fiscal position of state and local governments and has made governments more comfortable about taking on additional debt. Authorities have, therefore, responded to relatively low rates by raising a  substantial amount of  new capital in  February, especially to finance outlays for transportation, education, and health care. Even though the sector as a  whole experienced larger operating surpluses, most state and local governments have been contemplating cutting taxes or saving for a  rainy day, rather than reducing debt, as the best uses of  the higher surpluses.

On  balance over the intermeeting period, municipal bonds underperformed Treasuries, with the tax-exempt to  taxable yield ratio rising to  0.91, near the high end of its range over the past two years (chart). This ratio has moved up since mid-1997, as interest rates have fallen and investors have priced into outstanding municipal securities the increased likelihood of  calls or advance refundings.

Credit quality in  the municipal market has continued to improve. Ratings changes by  Standard &amp;  Poor's since the beginning of 1998 show upgrades exceeding downgrades by  a  large margin. The net upgrade has been widespread across sectors--health, housing, infrastructure, and power--and across geographic regions.

Money and  Financial Intermediaries

The  broad monetary aggregates grew rapidly in February. M3 expanded at an  8-1/2 percent annual rate, despite sharp declines in RPs and  Eurodollars. M2 accelerated to a  9-1/4 percent annual rate. Only part of  the pickup can  be  attributed to a  more rapid pace of mortgage refinancing and somewhat elevated tax refunds, both of which can initially add to liquid deposits.

The rapid growth of  M2 so  far this year follows strong expansion in  the second half of  1997. Over this period, nominal GDP was strong; however, M2 outpaced GDP, and its velocity fell, even as its measured opportunity cost (the three-month Treasury bill rate less the own rate on  M2) was essentially unchanged.

surprisingly strong M2 growth may have owed partly to  a  continued rebalancing of  household portfolios away from directly held instruments and toward M2 but was apparently not a  reflow out of stock and bond mutual funds.

Preliminary data indicate strong net sales for both stock and bond mutual funds in  February (table). Household interest in stock funds recovered from the reduced December-January pace, with domestic funds leading the way and international funds remaining out of  favor. Disaggregated data provided by the Investment Company Institute indicate that stock funds specializing in  Asian markets have seen very small positive net sales since the beginning of  this year, in contrast to the net outflows experienced by  these funds over the second half of last year. Although net inflows to  bond funds dipped from  January's high reading, they remained well above the monthly average of  the past year. Press accounts have ascribed some of  the strength in  mutual fund sales to the popularity of  the new  Roth IRAs. This effect cannot be ruled out, but  with IRAs accounting for only 5  percent of  total fund sales in recent years, the current surge in  Roth IRAs may  not be  responsible for much of the recent strength. Moreover, the flow of  assets into Roth IRAs may  owe more to a  reallocation of  household portfolios than to increases in  household saving.

The rapid growth of  stock funds and the sharp gains in  the stock market over the past several years generated huge capital gains distributions by  mutual funds last year, mainly in  December, the month in  which most distributions for the year are  made (chart). Although some of these distributions were posted to tax-favored accounts, such as  IRAs and 401(k) plans, a  large portion is likely to  be  taxable, further swelling the Treasury's coffers this spring. Higher final income tax payments from this source, however, are unlikely to  reduce consumer spending very much, either because the distributions and accompaning tax liabilities had been expected or because those receiving them  have above-average income and assets with which to  buffer any tax surprises.

Commercial banks maintained credit growth at around a  10 percent annual rate in  January and February (table), and partial data suggest rapid growth again in  March. Securities holdings, which were a  major factor in  asset expansion late last year, have increased less rapidly this year. Total loans, on  the other hand, have accelerated, with the notable exception of consumer loans,

which have been weak thus far in 1998 even after adjusting for securitization. Unlike last year, there is  little evidence that home equity loans have substituted for consumer loans. Cash-out refinancings, however, may  have damped growth in  both consumer and home equity loans. Real estate loans surged in February, with commercial mortgages reviving after two months of  little change and residential loans responding to a  strong housing market and perhaps being boosted by mortgage refinancings.

Business loans continued strong in  the first two months of  the year, in  part boosted by  mergers and acquisitions, but this growth was achieved with little effect on loan pricing as recorded in the February Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL). The  average rate on commercial and industrial loans was about the same as in  the November survey, and the spread of  the average rate above the intended federal funds rate remained at about the level for most of last year, following a widening in 1996 and early 1997 (chart). 5

Call report data (chart) show another highly profitable year for banks, notwithstanding some fourth-quarter losses at  large banks resulting from events in  Asia. Narrower net interest margins were offset by  lower noninterest expense and higher noninterest income. Provisions for loan and lease losses as a  fraction of assets edged up last year but remained in  check, reflecting low overall chargeoff rates. For categories other than consumer loans, delinquency and charge-off rates turned in another excellent performance in the fourth quarter (chart).

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. International de Tra in Goods and Services

In  January, the U.S. trade deficit in  goods and services widened to $12 billion as exports declined more than imports. The deficit was the largest since the monthly series for goods and services was first published in  January 1992. Trade data for February will be  released on  April 17.

<!-- missing-text -->

Exports were 2-1/2 percent lower in January than in  December. Most of  the decrease was in  civilian aircraft (reversing much of  the sharp increase recorded in  December) and other capital goods. Declines were recorded in  total goods exports to  Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan. The level of  exports in January was 2-1/2 percent lower than the average for the fourth quarter of  1997. Real exports grew at  a  8-1/2 percent annual rate in  the fourth quarter, with the largest increases in  aircraft, machinery-otherthan-computers-and-semiconductors, and automotive and agricultural products. By  area most of  the increase in  the fourth quarter was to Western Europe, Canada, and Latin America; there were also increased exports to  countries in  Asia part of  which were increased deliveries of  aircraft.

The decrease in  imports in  January was in  oil (there was a small decline in quantity, and the  price dropped to about $15 per barrel from an  average of  nearly $17.50 per barrel in the fourth quarter), as  well as in  capital goods and automotive imports from Canada. The level of imports in January was about the same as the average for the fourth quarter. Real imports grew at  a  5-3/4

percent rate in  the fourth quarter, with  most of  the increase in consumer goods and machinery other than computers and semiconductors.

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  oil imported declined 2-1/2 percent during the fourth quarter of  last year to  a  rate of  10.7 mb/d. Oil imports remained flat at that rate in January. This decline followed two consecutive quarters of  strong imports, driven by  extremely robust consumption in  the second and third quarters. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil imports declined in  February due to  a  fall in  consumption that is  most likely weather related.

The price of  imported oil declined significantly in  February for the fourth consecutive month. For January-February combined (shown in  the table that follows), prices of  oil imports exhibited their greatest decline since the first quarter of 1991.

Declines in  prices since November followed increases in the previous three months. The run-up in  prices from late summer through early fall reflected production disruptions in  Colombia and the lagged effect of Iraq not exporting for two months. Spot WTI prices have declined sharply since November as the market reacted to increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the UAE. weak demand in  Asia, relatively warm weather in  the northern hemisphere, and the resumption of oil production for export by  Iraq. By  February prices were more than 15 percent below yearend levels. After dropping below $13 per barrel earlier this month, when it appeared that OPEC would have difficulty restraining production in  order to accommodate increased shipments from Iraq, prices have risen by about $3.50 per barrel to  around $16.00 per barrel on the news of  an agreement among major oil producers to  restrain production by  more than 1.0 mbd.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in  February for the fifth consecutive month. This decline was attributable to decreases in  all major trade categories, with  the exception of

consumer goods, and automotive products. For January-February combined, the decline in prices of  non-oil imports was 4.4 percent at  an  annual rate, somewhat larger than in  the fourth quarter of 1997; the larger decline was attributable primarily to  a  substantial drop in  prices of  non-oil industrial supplies.

Prices of  exports declined slightly in  February for  the third consecutive month. The decline was due to lower prices for agricultural products. Prices of  nonagricultural products remained unchanged on  average. For January-February combined, the decline in prices of  exports resulted from lower prices for agricultural products, nonagricultural industrial supplies, computers, semiconductors, and consumer goods.

services (exports rose more than imports) was more than offset by  an increase in  the deficit on  investment income and increased net unilateral transfers. For investment income, there were small declines in  income from both net direct investment and net portfolio investment. The increase in  net unilateral transfers was more than accounted for  by  U.S. government grants to Israel which normally occur in  the  fourth quarter of  each year.

For the  full year 1997, the U.S. current account deficit increased to $166 billion, $18 billion larger than in 1996. Almost all of  the greater deficit came from  a  shift from a  surplus to  a deficit on  investment income and largely reflected growing net income payments as a  result of growing U.S. international indebtedness. There were only small changes in  net trade and unilateral transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Net purchases of  U.S. securities by  private foreigners were a record $346 billion in  1997, up $59 billion or 20 percent over 1996 (Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table, line 4). Net private purchases of  Treasury securities and corporate and other bonds remained strong, but the increase was  more than accounted for by  the record net purchases of  corporate stocks totaling $67.8 billion in 1997 (line 4c). U.S. stocks attracted investors from Japan and financial centers in  Europe and the Caribbean, probably as a  result of  the booming U.S. economy and increased uncertainty abroad. Net purchases of  U.S. stocks continued at  a  robust pace in January.

Net purchases of  corporate and other bonds by private foreigners were up in  December and January (line 4b). New  Eurobond issues by  U.S. corporations and government agencies were strong in January and showed continuing strength in  February. About one-third of  the bonds purchased by  private foreigners were bonds of  U.S. government agencies.

In  January, there was little net change in  private foreigners' holdings of  U.S. Treasuries, following a  sharp decline in  December (line 4a). Sizable net purchases of  Treasury bonds and notes in January were countered by  net sales of  U.S. Treasury bills. Japanese holders recorded large net sales in  December and January, probably as a  consequence of the large premium that Japanese banks

were forced to  pay in  the interbank market to  obtain funds. In  the rest of  Asia, there were small net private sales in  December and January.

U.S. purchases of  foreign securities were down in  1997 primarily because of  net sales of  foreign stocks in  the fourth quarter (line 5). Net sales of stocks in  Japan of  $4.2 billion and in  Mexico of $1.2 billion accounted for the  bulk of  the fourth quarter sell-off. In  Asia, the  picture was mixed. Investors took advantage of  sharply depressed stock prices in  dollars to purchase stocks in some  Asian markets but continued selling in others. In January, net sales of foreign stocks were near zero, in  part owing to  net purchases in  Japan, which reversed the fourth quarter trend.

Foreign official assets held in  the United States increased in January by $2.5 billion, following an  outflow of  $14.8 billion in December (line 1). Spain, China, and Singapore more than accounted for the increase in  January. Japan was responsible for much of  the outflow in  December.

There were large net  inflows into banks at the end of 1997, after large net outflows earlier in the year (line 3). By  the end of  January, these inflows were partially reversed. Monthly average data on  net claims of  U.S. banking offices on  own foreign offices and IBFs suggest that  there were outflows in  February (International Banking Data Table, line 1).

U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment in the  United States reached record levels in 1997. Direct investment outflows were up  36 percent from 1996 (Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table, line 6), and direct investment inflows were up 40  percent (line 7). The strong growth in direct investment resulted from the continuing boom in cross-border mergers and acquisitions over the year. The fourth-quarter flows reflected transactions such as Merrill Lynch's purchase of  Mercury assets and ING's purchase of  Equitable of  Iowa.

The large negative statistical discrepancy in 1997 implies that net payments in  the current account or  net outflows in  the capital account have gone unrecorded. Large negative discrepancies have become common in  1990s for reasons that are not  well understood.

Foreign Exchange and International Asset Markets

Since the February FOMC meeting, the dollar has strengthened 3 percent against the yen. The yen's depreciation vis-à-vis the dollar is generally attributed to  reports of  continued weak economic activity in  Japan together with a  growing market sentiment that Japanese authorities would either delay further or  put off completely a  sizable fiscal stimulus package. The  Japanese longterm bellwether bond yield fell 30  basis points during the intermeeting period, and the major Japanese stock market indices declined 2  percent on  balance. Yields on  short-term debt instruments also fell, as  the Bank of Japan provided substantial liquidity in  advance of  the end  of the Japanese fiscal year.

The exchange value of  the dollar has moved in  relatively narrow ranges against the  mark and sterling since the  February FOMC meeting, appreciating 3/4 percent against the mark and depreciating 2 percent against sterling. The appreciation of  sterling against the  mark  was supported by  a  modest widening, of  4  to 6 basis points, in  the short-term and long-term interest rate differentials in  favor of  sterling. While official interest rate hikes in  Germany are perceived to  have become less likely in  view of falling German inflation, signs of  continued robust growth in the United Kingdom have kept  markets guessing about the possibility of  another rate increase by  the Bank of  England.

The release in  late February of official 1997 government budget figures for the  EU  member countries, which showed that all countries except Greece satisfied the key  Maastricht reference value of  a budget deficit of  no  more than 3  percent of  GDP, strengthened expectations that 11 countries will participate in  launching the euro in January 1999. The EMU  convergence reports of the European Commission and the European Monetary Institute published on  March 25 validated these expectations. Spreads between the long-term interest rates of  the prospective euro member countries have narrowed further, with the Italian and Spanish rates falling 12 basis points more than those of  Germany and France. Italian threemonth rates fell about 90 basis points over the  period, while equivalent German and French short-term rates were little changed. European equity market indices have risen between 7  and 13 percent, to record highs, since the February FOMC meeting.

On  March 15, it  was announced that Greece would devalue the drachma and enter the  ERM, in  preparation for possible future membership in  the monetary union. On the same day, the Irish punt's central parity within the ERM  was revalued 3  percent, reflecting the ongoing strength of the currency relative to that of  the other ERM members and making it  more likely that the punt will be  converted to the  euro at its established central parity.

The dollar depreciated 2-2/3 percent against the Canadian dollar over the period, reversing earlier appreciations. The Canadian long-term bond yield was little changed.

The  dollar has depreciated between 15 and 20  percent since the February FOMC meeting against the currencies of  Korea and Thailand. as  markets perceived that the governments of  the two countries were coming to  grips with their financial sector problems. Malaysia's currency appreciated about 10  percent against the dollar. The exchange value of  Indonesia's currency underwent several gyrations as  talk about introducing a  currency board system appeared to lift the rupiah temporarily. Subsequent criticism of  the currency board plan, together with a  perception that Indonesia possesses neither sufficient foreign exchange reserves nor the  macroeconomic policy resolve to implement such a  system credibly (at  proposed exchange rates considerably appreciated from current levels), led to depreciations of  the rupiah. On  balance, the dollar depreciated 19 percent against the rupiah over the intermeeting period. Share prices in  the Southeast Asian economies turned in  mixed performances; increases were recorded in Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and the Philippines, while decreases occurred in  Thailand, Korea, and Indonesia.

The price of  gold has fluctuated between $290 and $302 per fine ounce since the  February FOMC meeting. Gold prices briefly came under pressure on  March 18  when it  was revealed that the Belgian central bank had sold 300 metric tons --  the equivalent of about $2.9 billion --  of  its monetary gold reserves during January and February. On  March 23, the price of  gold jumped $7  per fine ounce on  technical market factors; it fell back slightly over the following two days.

The Desk did not intervene. Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Partial  data for the first  quarter suggest that  the pace of economic expansion has picked up in the European countries and remains  strong on balance in Canada, while the Japanese economy continues to be weak. Although there are signs that the southeast Asian crises have begun to show up  in monthly trade data. particularly for Japan, the full  impact on the foreign industrial economies remains to be seen. Fourth-quarter GDP data are now available for all  the major foreign industrial countries. Growth continued at a healthy pace in France, moderated somewhat in the United Kingdom and Canada, and proceeded at only a modest pace in Germany and Italy. In Japan, economic  activity contracted  slightly in the fourth quarter,  leaving the level of activity little changed from one year ago.

Recent declines  in oil prices have helped reduce CPI inflation in all  the foreign G-7  countries. Inflation is around one percent in France, Germany, and Canada and is under two percent in Italy. After netting out  the  effects of tax increases,  inflation remains near zero in Japan. In  the United Kingdom, however, consumer price inflation  remains  slightly above the government's  target of 2-1/2 percent.

On March 25, the European Union Commission released  its convergence report, stating that each of the eleven countries that is  striving to enter monetary union when it  starts in  1999 has satisfied requirements  for first-round entry. The European Monetary Institute also  released its convergence  report on March 25. The EMI noted that major improvements in terms of convergence have been made by the EU nations, although a permanent resolution to the problems of high public  debt and deficits needs to remain a priority for several countries. The EMI also stated that  although the Italian lira has been participating in the Exchange Rate Mechanism for  only 15  months,  the currency has been broadly stable over the two-year reference period.

Individual country notes. In  Japan, GDP contracted slightly during the  fourth quarter, with a  3 percent (SAAR) decline in domestic demand partially offset by  a  2.3 percentage point contribution from  net exports. Consumption fell 3.6 percent, while plant and equipment investment grew 2.3 percent. Residential investment fell to its lowest level since 1987, registering its fourth consecutive quarter of double-digit decline. The  public sector made a  slight negative contribution to growth, as a  reduction in  public investment more than offset an  increase government consumption.

<!-- missing-text -->

Economic indicators for the first quarter suggest that the economy remains weak. Industrial production and household expenditure have recovered only slightly from significant declines in the fourth quarter, while auto registrations have continued to decline. Housing starts have remained near ten-year lows, and labor market conditions show signs of  further deterioration. Consumer price inflation, net of  the effects of  fiscal measures, remains near zero.

Japan's trade surplus during January and February averaged $8.8 billion, slightly above the fourth-quarter average. Effects of the Asian crises are now clearly visible. Exports to  Korea and Thailand plunged 40 percent from a year earlier, while exports to

other Asian countries declined almost 5  percent. By  contrast, Japanese exports to the United States and the  EU  were up  by  about 15 percent from the first two months of 1997. Japanese import prices in February were down 8.4 percent from a  year earlier, led by  25 percent declines in  the price of  oil products and lumber.

The government has recently gained legislative approval for several of  its policy initiatives. The  FY  1997-98 supplementary budget, which includes a  temporary tax  cut plus new  spending on public works and disaster relief, was approved by  the Diet on February 4. On  February 16, the  Diet approved the government's plan to provide ¥30 trillion to  help stabilize the  banking system. The FY  1998-99 budget was approved by  the  Diet's lower house on  March 20 and  is  now being reviewed by  the upper house. (The  budget becomes law  thirty days following lower-house approval, if it  has not yet been approved by  the upper house.)

In  mid-March, prosecutors arrested a  senior Bank of  Japan employee on charges that he  had provided confidential data regarding BOJ money market operations to several large commercial banks in exchange for lavish entertainment. The arrest led to  the

resignation of  BOJ  Governor Matsushita, as Matsushita took responsibility for  the scandal. The government has appointed Masaru Hayami, a  former BOJ  Executive Director and financial sector executive, to  head the central bank.

Real GDP growth in Germany slowed in the fourth quarter of last year to 1.1 percent at an  annual rate, bringing growth over 1997 (Q4/Q4) to 2.3 percent. The slowdown in  fourth-quarter growth reflected a  sizable drop in net exports, as  export growth dropped back from its double-digit pace. Machinery and equipment spending continued to post healthy gains in  the fourth quarter, although total investment continued to be  held back  by  troubles in  the construction sector. Inventories made a  sizable contribution to fourth-quarter growth, but they are a  residual in  the national accounts and are subject to significant revision.

Indicators for the first quarter suggest a  pick-up in growth from its lackluster pace in  the fourth quarter. In  January, industrial production jumped 2.5 percent and manufacturing orders surged 3.3 percent, led by  strong increases in domestic orders. Business confidence has remained at its recent high. Conditions in the  labor market have improved marginally so  far this year, with the all-German unemployment rate edging down from 11.8 percent in

December to 11.5 percent in  February. Consumer price inflation is currently near one percent, benefiting from lower prices of  food and energy.

In France, fourth-quarter real GDP increased 3.1 percent (SAAR), the third consecutive quarter of  strong growth. Domestic demand underpinned continued economic expansion for the second straight quarter. Although export growth slowed sharply, net exports made a  small positive contribution.

Data for the first quarter suggest that on  balance the growth in  French domestic demand remains robust. In  January, consumption of manufactured products increased 2.6 percent; the broad-based rise reflected strong seasonal purchases associated with post-holiday discounts and continued strength in  durable goods purchases. Industrial production declined in  January, but recent business surveys suggest that business confidence remains high. The surveys also provide further confirmation that the impetus to  growth has shifted from foreign to domestic demand as a  modest decline in

<!-- missing-text -->

export orders has  been offset by  higher domestic orders. The rate of  unemployment declined to 12.1 in January reflecting cyclical improvement and the increased use of temporary contracts. Inflation is  near a  40-year low: in  February, consumer prices were 0.7 percent above their year-earlier level.

The expansion of economic activity in  the United Kingdom eased in  the fourth quarter, as real GDP growth dipped to 2.5 percent (SAAR). However, the growth of  domestic demand remained strong, led by robust consumption growth and renewed strength in fixed investment, while net exports subtracted 2.7 percentage points from total GDP growth.

Indicators for the current quarter are mixed, but on  balance point to  moderate growth. Industrial production declined in January, as  manufacturing output was unchanged and  mild temperatures again led to lower output of  utilities industries. However, recent survey data suggest somewhat more strength in  the  manufacturing sector. Business sentiment has remained positive, as  the outlook for  domestic orders continues to offset weakness in  export orders resulting primarily from the strength of  sterling. Consumer spending remains strong on  balance. The average volume of retail sales in  January and February was up 1.1 percent from the fourth quarter, as the surge in  post-holiday sales in  January was only partially reversed in  February. Conditions in  the labor market remain tight. The official claims-based unemployment rate fell below 5 percent in  February for the first time since 1980, and

survey evidence points to  continued shortages of  skilled workers. Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.6 percent over the year to February, after meeting the government's inflation target of  2-1/2 percent for underlying inflation in January for the first time since last May.

In its February Inflation Report, the Bank of  England noted that while growth is expected to slow sharply over the coming year and the strength of  sterling has depressed retail price inflation, domestically-generated inflation is "significantly above the  target level" and concluded that "the balance of risks in  the projection implies that it  is more likely than not that a  modest further rise in  interest rates will be  necessary at  some point to  meet the inflation target looking two years or  so  ahead."

Chancellor of  the  Exchequer Gordon Brown released the Labour government's second budget on  March 17. The budget introduces some new  initiatives for addressing long-term unemployment as part of the "Welfare to Work" reform and provides tax relief for low-income working families, but the overall impact is  neutral. The general government fiscal deficit, on  a  Maastricht basis, is  projected to decline to £1.3 billion in  FY  1998-99, or 0.1 percent of  GDP, and to be in  balance in  the following year.

In Italy, GDP rose only 0.7 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter. Both  household consumption and  business fixed investment declined, and net exports contributed negatively. A  large increase in  inventory accumulation more than accounted for fourth-quarter GDP growth. The  data indicate that the positive effects on  household consumption of  the government's tax-incentive program on  new auto purchases have started to subside.

<!-- missing-text -->

First-quarter indicators are limited but point to  a  pickup in growth. In January, business sentiment soared, and industrial production rose 1.0 percent. In  January and February, consumer confidence exceeded the fourth-quarter average.

Italian inflation has ticked up  recently but remains low. In March, preliminary data from eleven Italian cities, which carry a cumulative 76  percent weight in the  national index, increased 1.8 percent over the year earlier. The slight pickup in  CPI inflation in recent months in  part reflects the passthrough effects of  the  VAT hike in October.

Canadian real GDP grew a  moderate 3.0 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter, slowing down from an  average pace of  about 4-1/2 percent over the first three quarters. Final domestic demand edged up  only 1.2 percent, but GDP growth was supported by  an  improvement in net exports. Consumer spending grew 2.3 percent, less than half its third quarter pace, as personal income growth suffered from strikes by  postal workers and Ontario teachers. Business fixed investment was little changed in  the fourth quarter, following seven quarters of robust growth.

The Canadian unemployment rate fell back to 8.6 percent in February, the same level as in  December, retracing the upward blip in January caused by  the ice storm in Quebec and eastern Ontario that stalled employment growth. For January and February on average, employment growth was fully as strong as that in  the last two  months of  1997. Lower energy prices have helped keep consumer price  inflation near one percent, he  bottom of the  Bank  of  Canada's t target range.

The Bank  of Canada  raised  ts  key Bank  Rate i 50  basis points to 5  percent on  January 30. The  move was aimed at defending the Canadian dollar, which had fallen 2 percent in  the previous two weeks to a  new record low  of just above 68 U.S. cents. The Bank indicated that the easing of  monetary conditions associated with the depreciation was  not appropriate.

The Canadian government announced on  February 24 its forecasts of  a  balanced budget for  the current fiscal year ending March 31 as well as  for the next two fiscal years. This would mark the first balanced budget since FY  1969-70 and the first time in  almost 50 years that the  budget would be  balanced for three years in  a  row, the  culmination of  four years of  fiscal restraint aided by  recent strong economic growth and taxes paid on  capital gains in  the stock market. In  the current fiscal year, the C$5 billion surplus over the first nine  months has been allocated largely to a number of  new spending plans, with the largest share going to  improve access to post-secondary education. In  the  next two  fiscal years, the projected budget is kept from going into surplus by  a C$3 billion contingency fund and conservative assumptions for economic growth and interest rates. Given the  projected budget balances, the government forecasts that economic growth will lower the debt/GDP ratio to 63 percent in  1999-2000 from 72 percent in  1995-96.

The  target range will remain from 1  to 3  percent, defined in  terms of  12-month CPI inflation, and the operational guide for policy will continue to be  the CPI excluding food and energy and adjusted for the effects of indirect tax changes.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

Korea and Thailand continued their resolute steps toward implementing reforms under their respective IMF programs, despite pronounced slowdowns in  economic activity. The course of  reforms in Indonesia remains highly uncertain, and the economic and financial situation continues to  deteriorate. Economic activity showed signs of  slowing in  Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore, putting further pressure on  policymakers in  those countries to  intensify their reform efforts. Inflation picked up  considerably in  the  ASEAN region--particularly Indonesia--and in  Korea.

The impact of the slowdown in  Korea and the  ASEAN region on economic activity in  other emerging-market countries was not very pronounced. Exports slowed substantially in  Taiwan but remained strong in  China. Among Latin American countries, growth remained strong, except in  Brazil.

Individual country notes. In Korea, financial markets appear to  have stabilized since the  beginning of  this year, with the won appreciating and the stock market showing a  substantial rebound (albeit from very depressed levels). However, there is evidence that the financial crisis has generated a  sharp downturn in activity. Although Korea does not publish seasonally-adjusted GDP estimates, we  estimate that real GDP contracted 1.7 percent (SAAR) during the fourth quarter. Moreover, the unemployment rate jumped to 4.1 percent in  January 1998 from 2.1 percent in  October, reflecting both corporate restructuring efforts and-a surge in bankruptcies.

Korea's current account moved dramatically into surplus, following two years of sizeable deficits. During January-February, the current account showed a  surplus of  nearly $7  billion (not an annual rate), compared with a deficit of  $5-1/2 billion a  year earlier. Most of  this swing reflected a  sharp contraction of imports, due to  very tight credit conditions and a  high degree of economic uncertainty. Imports fell 35 percent in  the first two months of  this year from their year-earlier level. Exports rose 9.5 percent, but most of  the growth was attributable to  a  temporary surge in gold exports.

The recent stabilization of  Korea's financial markets has reflected in  part the success of  a  rollover arrangement in  which Korea's foreign bank creditors agreed to  extend their maturing claims on  Korean banks. In  late January, the  Korean authorities proposed a  longer-term restructuring of  the external liabilities of Korean banks. This "Exchange Offer" allowed creditor banks to exchange most of their short-term claims on  Korean banks for restructured notes that carried a  sovereign guarantee. The restructured notes have maturities ranging from 1 to  3 years, and interest rates between 2.25 and 2.75 percent above LIBOR. Creditor banks have agreed to exchange $21.7 billion of $22.35 billion in claims that were eligible to  be tendered. The formal debt exchange will occur on  April 8.

The reserve position of  the  Bank of  Korea has improved markedly since the  beginning of  this year, with the  BOK's useable foreign exchange reserves rising from under $6  billion on December 31 to  $20.3 billion on  March 16. In  addition to disbursements from the multilaterals (which totaled $5  billion over the period), the  increase in  reserves has reflected repayments to the  BOK's support window by  Korean banks, and  a  gold campaign that has contributed over $1.5 billion to  the BOK's reserves.

Korea has continued to implement financial sector restructuring measures called for in  its IMF program. In  early February, Korea closed 10 of  the 14  merchant banks it  had suspended in  early December. Two additional merchant banks were closed at the end of  last month, Korea allowed foreign investors to purchase securities issued by  Korean corporations without restriction as of February 16 and it  has announced that it  will lift remaining

restrictions on the purchase of  money market instruments issued by Korean financial institutions by  the end of  this year.

Significant progress has been made in labor reform. The Korean National Assembly passed legislation in  February that will ease the ability of  employers to lay off workers. The legislation included provisions to increase substantially the funding of Korea's nascent unemployment compensation scheme.

In the ASEAN region, the substantial increases in  interest rates since the onset of  the crisis, along with the effects of  the currency depreciations and associated declines in  investor confidence, have slowed domestic demand growth considerably. In Indonesia, real GDP growth in  1997 slowed to  under 5  percent, compared with nearly 8  percent in 1996. In  Malaysia, industrial production in  January was less than 3  percent above its year-earlier level. In  the Philippines and Singapore, there was a marked slowdown in real GDP growth in  the fourth quarter of  1997. Thailand continued to show the strongest effects to date from the crisis: industrial production in  the fourth quarter was nearly 13 percent below its year-earlier level.

<!-- missing-text -->

Inflation has been rising in  most economies in  the  region, driven in large part by the sharp depreciation of  their currencies. In Indonesia, consumer prices in February were 32 percent higher than the year-earlier level; a  long drought has exacerbated the inflationary pressure. The inflation rate picked up  noticeably in February in  both the  Philippines and Malaysia and showed a  further uptick in Thailand.

<!-- missing-text -->

Trade balances continued to improve in  most economies in the region as a  result of  the real depreciation of  their currencies, the slowdown in  their growth, and strong industrial country growth (outside of  Japan).

Implementation of  economic reforms varied quite a  bit across the  ASEAN region. The IMF approved the release of  the third tranche of $270 million for Thailand and commended the Thai-authorities "for resolutely implementing the economic program in  very difficult circumstances." In contrast, the IMF delayed a  scheduled review of Indonesia's current program, thereby holding up the release of  the next tranche of IMF funds. However, newly-reelected President Suharto and his economic team are negotiating with IMF staff on  a revised program. Amidst signs of  increasing stress in  their financial sectors, there was some acceleration in  reforms in Malaysia and the Philippines. In  Malaysia, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar announced a  package of  reforms on  March 24-25. While complete details are not available as yet, the  measures appear to have fallen short of  expectations, particularly since Anwar did not outline concrete steps towards a  previously announced expansion of stock ownership rights for ethnic-Chinese Malays and

foreign individuals. The Philippines agreed to further banking sector reforms in  a  letter of  intent submitted for the IMF Board's review. If  approved, the two-year stand-by agreement will give the country access to $1.6 billion in  credit from the IMF, and additional funding from  the  World Bank and the ADB.

In  Hong Kong, pressure on  the currency has abated considerably, and the stock market has recovered substantially from its early January lows. The yield spread between Hong Kong government debt and U.S. Treasuries at a  10-year maturity fell from 550 basis points in  mid-January to around 210 basis points on  March 24. Over this same period, Hong Kong's stock market rose more than 40 percent. Hong Kong authorities, as  well as  Chinese officials, continue to stress Hong Kong's commitment to  the fixed peg against the dollar. Foreign exchange reserves were $98 billion at the  end of  January, up  about $5  billion from December.

In  China, export growth continued to  be  strong and inflation quiescent in  the first two months of  1998. China's trade surplus of $7.1 billion in  the  first two  months of  1998 compares with a  surplus of  $3.8 billion in  the year-earlier period. Exports rose 16 percent, while imports were virtually unchanged. (Because of  the Chinese New  Year--which fell in  January this year but February last year--it is useful to  combine data for the first two  months of  the year). This sizable surplus suggests that China's net exports have not yet  been significantly affected by  the Asian crisis; Chinese authorities did report, without providing details, that exports to Asia declined, while exports to  Europe and the United States grew rapidly. China's exchange rate has continued to appreciate slowly against the U.S. dollar over the past year, despite the substantial depreciation of other Asian currencies since the  middle of  1997. In 1998, Chinese leaders have consistently pledged not to allow its currency to  depreciate. Foreign-exchange reserves remained stable in  the first two months of  1998 at $140 billion.

At  the annual National People's Congress in  March, authorities announced several major reforms. China will substantially reduce its government bureaucracy, eliminating 11 out of  its 40  ministry-

level bodies. China will issue about $33 billion in  bonds to increase the  capital of  the four major banks. China is also considering a  large infrastructure spending program in  order to  try to prevent the economy from slowing sharply as  a  result of  the  Asian crisis. Although the Asian crisis has had  only a minimal direct effect on China so far, authorities have repeatedly stressed that they expect their trade surplus and capital inflows to  be adversely affected.

On  March 24, China cut interest rates, with lending rates falling by  an  average of  60  basis points, and deposit rates falling by  an  average of 16  basis points. The Chinese government continues to  set the interest rates that banks and other financial institutions can charge, and the  rate cut appears to reflect concerns about China's slowing economy. In  a  related move, the People's Bank of  China (PBOC)--China's central bank--also cut reserve requirements on  deposits from 13 percent to 8 percent; the PBOC pays interest on  these reserves, but it reduced the interest rate by  230 basis points, reducing the incentive for depository institutions to hold excess reserves with the  central bank rather than making loans.

Taiwan's exports have slowed substantially, while industrial production remains robust and inflation remains low. Taiwan ran a rare trade deficit of $610 million in  February, following a  small trade surplus in January. The  deficit in  February was the largest monthly deficit since the 1970s. In January and February together, exports fell 10 percent from the  year-earlier period, while imports were unchanged. The sharp fall in  exports suggests that the Asian crisis may  be  having an  adverse effect on  Taiwan, whose exchange rate has depreciated by  less than that of  most other developing

Asian economies. As  of  March 24, the Taiwan dollar had appreciated about 5  percent against the U.S. dollar since its lows in early January; the stock market had risen about 8  percent from the beginning of  the year. International reserves were $84 billion at the end of  February, up about $1  billion since the beginning of  the year.

In  Brazil, real GDP growth slowed to 2 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter and industrial output declined. Unemployment rose from 4.8 percent in  December to 7.3 percent in  January, the highest level in 13 years. The slowdown in economic activity has contributed to a  narrowing of  the trade deficit in  recent months. The  trade deficit for the January-February period stood at $0.8 billion, about half the deficit over the same period a  year earlier. In early March, the central bank reduced the overnight rate from 34.5 percent to 28  percent, partly in  response to  the slowdown in economic activity in  recent months.

The decline in  domestic interest rates may also reflect perceptions of  reduced risk of  a  devaluation in  the near term. In recent weeks, stock prices have risen and as of  March 24  the Bovespa had  nearly regained its level in late-October 1997. Since the beginning of  the year, the spread between stripped yields on Brazilian Brady bonds and  U.S. Treasuries has dropped by  about 140 basis points, to  about 440 basis points on  March 23. International reserves (liquidity concept) have risen in recent weeks to $59 billion at  the end of  February, putting them nearly back to their level in late-October 1997.

In  Mexico, the economy continues to  be  strong but there are some signs that the pace of economic activity has slowed somewhat. Industrial production grew  by  7.6 percent in  January from its year-earlier level, compared with a 9.2 percent rise in  December. The unemployment rate rose to  3.6 percent in  January and remained near that level in  February.

The Mexican current account deficit was $7.3 billion in 1997, up  from $1.9 billion in 1996, and it  widened throughout the  year. The  trade balance continued was in  deficit in January, at  a  slightly higher rate than in  the second half of  1997; the growth of  both imports and exports slowed sharply.

<!-- missing-text -->

The rise in consumer prices accelerated in January and February due the depreciation of  the peso, adjustments to the basic wage rate, and increases in  prices of  basic foodstuff. In  early March, the Bank of  Mexico tightened monetary policy, hoping to  keep inflation under control and to prevent the rapid depreciation of  the exchange rate. In addition to  more restrictive monetary policy, it is expected that fiscal policy may have to  be  tighter as oil prices continue to decline, reducing dramatically the revenue of  the Mexican government.

Mexican financial markets continue to  be  affected modestly by the  Asian crisis and declining oil prices. The peso value of  the dollar, which opened the year at 8.1 has fallen to 8.5, and has remained volatile. At  the most recent Treasury auction on  March 24, 28-day interest rates were 19.85 percent, above their end-January level reflecting tighter monetary policy.

In Argentina, economic growth continues to  be  robust. Real GDP grew 8.2 percent in 1997 (Q4/Q4). In  February, industrial production (SA)  was up  7.5 percent over a year ago. Consumer price inflation picked up significantly in  January-February. However, this rise was partly accounted for by  seasonal factors and partly by an  increase in public transport fares approved by  the government; the 12-month inflation rate for February was around half a  percent.

The accumulated 12-month trade deficit in  January was about $3.5 billion, compared with a  trade surplus of around $1.4 billion in  the previous twelve months. This outcome took the trade deficit beyond the limit agreed upon  with the IMF for any 12-month period. This limit was set under the terms of a  $2.8 billion three-year Extended Fund Facility that was officially approved earlier this year. The  widening of  external balances is a  reflection of strong imports of  capital goods, a  fall in commodity prices, and a  slowdown in  exports to  Brazil.

At  present, there are not many direct indications that spillovers from  Asia have slowed down the Argentine economy. While the stock market is still roughly 20 percent below where it  was at the onset of  the Asian crisis, interest rates on  peso and dollar deposits and the spread between them are now  below their pre-crisis levels. International reserves (excluding gold) stood at  over $21

billion at  end-February, up  over 10 percent from their level at end of  September last year, before the  Asian crisis erupted.

In  Venezuela, preliminary real GDP data confirm that economic recovery took hold in 1997 as real GDP grew 5.1 percent in  1997, with the  oil sector growing 8.8 percent and the non-oil sector 3.3 percent. Consumer prices rose 2.2 percent in  February, roughly in line with market expectations. The recovery has  widened external balances; the non-oil trade deficit moved from about $4.8 billion in 1996 to about $6.1 billion in 1997.

The  recent slump in  oil prices spells trouble for  the Venezuelan economy in  the  near future. So far this year, the  price of  the Venezuelan oil basket has averaged over $4  per barrel less than last year. The oil sector currently accounts for about a  third of  total output and over half of  government revenues; each dollar decline in  the oil price translates into about $1  billion loss of revenues to the government. The effects of  the oil prices are also reflected in  the stock market and international reserves. The Caracas stock exchange has fallen by  over 15 percent since the start of  this year and international reserves (excluding gold) were just over $13 billion in  mid-March, roughly 8  percent lower than at  the end of last year.

In other developments, the Central bank  has allowed the depreciation rate of  the bolivar to increase somewhat since the

(Percent  hange  from  year c except here noted) w

<!-- missing-text -->

start of  this year, and the Venezuelan government has reached an informal agreement with the  IMF on  a monitoring program which would involve technical assistance but no  actual disbursements.

In Russia, recent data indicate a possible slowing in  the pace of activity. In February, real GDP  was flat on  a  year-over-year basis after recording small gains in  January and late last year. The  twelve-month inflation rate in  January eased further to just over 10 percent.

The  exchange market pressure on  the ruble which developed in January, mainly as a  result of  spillover from the Asian financial crises, intensified in  early February but  has since receded. The ruble strengthened after monetary authorities reaffirmed their commitment to support the currency and expressed a willingness to raise interest rates to achieve this end, even at the cost of weaker economic growth. The central bank raised its key refinancing rate to a  peak on  42 percent in  early February, but subsequently has  been able to  reduce this rate in  three stages to 30  percent as  pressure on  the ruble has subsided. Foreign exchange reserves, which declined $2  billion in  January to $16 billion, have shown no further net reduction since then. The March 11 announcement by  Moody's of  a downgrading of  its ratings of  Russian debt (citing rising short-term debt, diminished export earnings and excessive budget deficits) has had little apparent negative impact on  the ruble exchange rate. In early March, Russia returned to the  international debt market for the  first time since last October, with a  $150 million eurobond

issue by  the  Moscow city telephone network. The three-year issue was placed at  690  basis points over Treasury securities.

On  March 11, the opposition-controlled State Duma (parliament) finally passed a 1998 budget, nearly six  months after the government submitted a  budget proposal. The new  budget represents a significant improvement over budgets of recent years in  that its estimates of  revenues and expenditures are  relatively realistic. The  projected fiscal deficit is about 5 percent of GDP (compared with an  actual deficit of  about 7 percent last year).

On  March 23, Russian President Boris Yeltsin dismissed Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and his entire cabinet. In  explaining the  move, President Yeltsin stated that it is ". . . an effort to make economic reforms more energetic and effective, to  give them a political push, a  new  impulse." As interim Prime Minister, President Yeltsin named outgoing Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, a  young technocrat generally seen as supportive of economic reform. Russian financial markets initially reacted negatively to  the announcement of  the government's dismissal, but soon recovered.
