Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

The pace of economic activity slowed in mid-summer and has remained sluggish, on balance, since then.  Although housing demand has remained strong, business fixed investment has continued to languish and consumer spending on motor vehicles has been well below its summer level.  Consumption outside motor vehicles also flagged in the late summer, though spending turned up in October and early readings on spending in November have been reasonably favorable.  Payroll employment remained flat and industrial production continued to fall through October.  Most major price series show declines in inflation over the past year.

Labor Markets

Labor demand remains tepid.  Private nonfarm payroll employment edged down again in October and has changed little, on net, since July.  Employment in manufacturing and related industries has remained especially weak.  Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers also fell in October, nearly back to their July level.  In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point in October to 5.7 percent, the same as its third-quarter average.

The movements in payroll employment and the unemployment rate since the spring appear to be sending different signals about labor market conditions. Payroll employment rose an average of only 0.03 percent per month between June and October.  Such a small increase in payrolls normally would be associated with a slight increase in the unemployment rate, but the unemployment rate instead fell 0.2 percentage point over this period. Interestingly, similar departures from the average historical relationship occurred after each of the four previous recessions.  Although we lack a good understanding of the reasons for this pattern, we continue to put a good deal more weight on the signal from payroll employment.  That measure traditionally has been the more reliable indicator of cyclical developments in the labor market, and, in the current instance, the relative weakness of payroll employment has been more consistent with other information, which, on balance, has depicted stagnant demand for workers.

Recent indicators generally have pointed to continued sluggishness, although most appear a bit brighter than they did a month ago.  Using seasonal adjustment factors calculated without data from the post-September 2001 period, initial claims for unemployment insurance averaged 401,000 per week over the four weeks ended

November 23. 1 This was down 30,000 from late October but still 30,000 higher than the lows of the summer.  At 3.62 million (for the week ended November 16), the level of insured unemployment adjusted using the alternative seasonal factors also stands above its summer lows but has been falling in recent weeks. Among recent survey evidence, a small increase in first-quarter hiring plans was reported both in Manpower's quarterly survey of employers and in the National Federation of Independent Businesses' poll of small businesses in October. Furthermore, households' expectations for future employment conditions improved slightly in both the Conference Board survey and the Michigan survey in November.  On the negative side, layoff announcements as tracked by Challenger remained high in November.  In addition, the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising edged down in October, and the organization's survey of job availability as perceived by households weakened in November.

According to the report on productivity and costs released December 4, productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 5.1 percent in the third quarter of 2002.  Over the four quarters ended in 2002:Q3, productivity is now estimated to have advanced 5.6 percent, the largest fourquarter increase since 1973.  The BLS report also included the first estimate of output per hour for

nonfinancial corporations for the third quarter of 2002.  Productivity in this sector rose at an annual rate of 5.7 percent last quarter and has advanced 6.7 percent over the four quarters ended 2002:Q3.

Motor Vehicles

Recent swings in motor vehicle sales and production have strongly influenced the incoming data on aggregate economic activity.  Although sales of light vehicles moved up to an annual rate of 15.9 million units in November, this increase only partially retraced the large declines in September and October. Sales have averaged 15.6 million units through the first two months of this quarter, 2 million units lower than the exceptionally strong pace in the third quarter. The fall in demand reflects both higher effective prices and a payback from the surge in demand in the summer, when consumers likely brought forward their purchases to take advantage of unusually generous incentive deals that they viewed as temporary.

According to J.D. Power and Associates, the average value of customer incentives per vehicle in September and October was well below the record high posted last August.  More of the vehicles sold were 2003 models, on which the incentives were less generous than on the 2002 leftovers.  As a result, the consumer price index for new vehicles jumped 0.5 percent in September and 0.4 percent in October, reversing nearly all of its declines earlier this year. 2 In November, however, incentives appear to have edged up again.  Although the decline in incentives in recent months has eroded consumers' positive attitudes toward car-buying a bit, sentiment remained very positive in November, with much of the optimism still attributed to low financing rates and good buys.

Responding to the recent softening in sales, automakers reduced assemblies in September and October.  The available weekly data for November suggest that production for the month stepped up noticeably to a rate higher than automakers announced schedules at the beginning of the month.  However, industry schedules for December show production dropping back to near October's rate. All told, production in the fourth quarter is currently scheduled to average 12.5 million units at an annual rate, down about Â½ million units from the thirdquarter pace.  If realized, such a decline in output would directly reduce the change in total industrial production in the fourth quarter by more than 1 percentage point (annual rate); the indirect effect of this reduction on products such as tires and stampings

might reduce fourth-quarter IP growth by a similar amount. After allowing for associated changes outside the industrial sector such as sales and transportation costs, and allowing for differences in seasonal adjustment, the scheduled reduction in motor vehicle production would reduce fourth-quarter GDP growth by nearly 1-1/4 percentage points. 3

1. Production rates reflect Ward's Communications' latest estimates for Q4, November, and December.

Even this reduced level of assemblies has been running well ahead of sales. Accordingly, inventories of light vehicles have moved up sharply in the last three months.  Stocks increased more than 300,000 units in September and October (not at an annual rate), while days' supply jumped to 69 days, somewhat above the target level of about 65 days.  Assuming that sales remain near their November pace, the automakers' production schedules imply that inventories will rise further through year-end.  As a result, the automakers are faced with the choice of cutting production, lowering prices, or both.  When faced with excess inventories at this time of the year, manufacturers have often reduced assemblies by extending the duration of regularly scheduled holiday shutdowns.  Reports from industry contacts suggest that similar plans are under discussion this year. If such plans are implemented, the assembly rate would drop further in early 2003.

Industrial Production

Industrial production dropped 0.8 percent in October after having moved down 0.2 percent in each of the preceding two months. 4 Roughly half of the October decline was due to the reduction in motor vehicle assemblies and related parts production.  Aside from the jump in motor vehicle assemblies in November, available physical product data retraced only a little of their October decline, and related indicators suggest that the industrial sector remains weak.

Conditions in the high-tech sector have been mixed.  Computer production has risen 1-3/4 percent per month on average over the past four months, supported by ongoing strength in demand for notebook computers and a recent spurt in sales of mainframes.  On the other hand, the recent increases in the output of desktop PCs have been modest, and Dataquest expects that unit sales will contract in the fourth quarter.  Industry analysts report that businesses have slowed the rate at which they are replacing their PCs in light of their reluctance to commit new capital generally and the perception of many firms that there are no new software applications demanding an upgrade in hardware.  The relative weakness in the personal computer subsector is also evident in the recent slide in shipments of microprocessor units (MPUs) and the weak outlook for Intel's revenue in the fourth quarter.  The output of semiconductors other than MPUs has continued to increase but at a slower pace.  Production earlier in the year was supported by strong demand from manufacturers of cell phones for digital signal processors and flash memory chips, but the outlook for worldwide sales of cell phones has recently been marked down.  Although shipments have not yet turned down, orders for equipment to manufacture semiconductors have plummeted.  Furthermore, the production of communications equipment fell 1.8 percent in October after having decreased 1 percent in September, and no indications of a pickup in demand are in the offing.

Outside of the motor vehicles and parts and high-tech industries, manufacturing production edged lower in August and contracted 0.4 percent in both September and October. Some of the recent pullback in this broad category (representing 85 percent of total manufacturing) reflects decreases in the production of motor vehicle supplies, such as engines, stampings, and original-equipment tires that are not counted as part of the motor vehicles and parts industry. 5 Even so, production declines were widespread and were especially pronounced among manufacturers of business equipment and, to a lesser extent, producers of materials.

Indicators of future activity in the industrial sector do not yet provide signs of recovery.  In October, the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders retraced part of its steep declines during the previous two months.  This series is volatile, however, and the three-month moving average of real orders fell.  The diffusion index of new orders from the Institute of Supply Management ratcheted down in July and has hovered around 50 since then, a level roughly consistent with a flat path of orders; this same pattern is evident in the regional purchasing managers indexes.  In addition, the staff's series on announced manufacturing layoffs fell in November, though it remained above its levels of the summer.

Consumer Spending

The pace of consumer spending has been quite sluggish in recent months after brisk gains earlier in the third quarter.  Much of the earlier strength and current weakness is attributable to large swings in spending on motor vehicles.  Apart from motor vehicles, PCE softened in August and September following noticeable increases in June and July, but it rose a solid 0.3 percent in October.

The October gain in real outlays excluding motor vehicles was supported by a pickup in spending on nondurable goods, which reversed its decline of the preceding two months.  More recently, the volatile data on weekly chain store sales have been consistent with modest increases in retail spending in November

and suggest a reasonably upbeat beginning to the holiday shopping season over the Thanksgiving weekend.  Spending on services has been comparatively steady and advanced a modest 0.2 percent in both September and October, about equal to the average rate of increase so far this year.

Advances in real disposable personal income have slowed substantially since the first quarter, when tax cuts provided a sizable boost to households' income. Abstracting from tax cuts, gains in income have been moderate for most of this year.  In October, real DPI was flat, reflecting that month's decline in payroll hours.  The saving rate this year has remained well above its average over the preceding several years, consistent with the erosion in household wealth since early 2000.

According to both the Michigan and Conference Board indexes, consumer confidence turned up in November after having reached its lowest level since 1993 in the previous month.  An improved outlook for business conditions accounted for most of the gain; households' expectations for labor market conditions over the coming year also improved noticeably.  By contrast, the current conditions portions of the indexes remained quite low in November.

Housing

On the whole, residential investment has held up well this year.  Although the multifamily sector weakened somewhat at the beginning of the fourth quarter, activity in the single-family sector remained strong.

Even though single-family housing starts were down 7 percent from their extraordinary level in September, the October pace of 1.35 million units matched the average rate seen during the first three quarters of the year.  Furthermore, unusually wet weather across much of the country probably restrained starts a bit in October.  Permit issuance for single-family construction-adjusted for activity in areas where permits are not required-was above starts in October, suggesting that homebuilding will continue at a vigorous pace through the end of the year.

New and existing home sales continued to be buoyant in October.  Sales of existing homes increased about 1 percent to an annual rate of 5.63 million units (using staff seasonal factors). 6 New home sales in October came off their September high, but the 1.01 million unit annual pace of sales was still very strong.

We believe that the robust pace of construction is roughly consistent with prevailing fundamentals.  Most important, mortgage rates have remained near their lowest levels in more than thirty years.  The average rate on a thirty-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 6.1 percent in late November, and the average initial rate on a thirty-year adjustable-rate mortgage was 4.2 percent. Households' assessments of homebuying conditions stayed quite favorable in November, and the Mortgage Bankers' Association's index of mortgage applications for the purchase of a home remained solid.

The continued strong demand for housing has helped produce large gains in house prices, although the various price measures have sent different signals as to whether the pace of increase has moderated.  Prices for existing homes, as measured by the repeat-sales price index, have decelerated significantly during the past year.  This measure of house prices rose 5-1/2 percent over the four quarters ended in 2002:Q3, down from 8-3/4 percent over the comparable period four quarters earlier. 7 By contrast, no underlying trend is discernible from the volatile pattern of quality-adjusted prices for new homes.

In the multifamily sector, starts fell 30 percent in October to an annual rate of 250,000 units, the slowest pace in almost six years.  Apartment vacancy rates have increased significantly, on balance, during the past year, and anecdotes suggest that the demand for apartment space has been hurt by the booming performance of the single-family market.  However, the ratio of new multifamily permits to starts in October was well above the historical average, suggesting that starts in this sector may rebound in November.

Equipment and Software

Real outlays for equipment and software advanced moderately in the third quarter; increases were posted for all major spending categories except aircraft, where expenditures fell sharply.  However, the last few months' data on orders and shipments of capital goods have been somewhat weaker, on balance.  In particular, new orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft dropped in August and September, and despite an upturn in October, new orders and shipments remained below their July levels.  The weaker trajectory for equipment and software in recent months is consistent with the rather downbeat anecdotal reports from businesses themselves.  Indeed, investment spending appears to be somewhat worse than would be predicted by the fundamental determinants of business investment, such as the growth of business output and real corporate cash flow.

In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computing equipment jumped markedly in October, but shipments of communications equipment dropped again.  Even though domestic shipments of communications equipment have continued to trend down this year, real spending on communications equipment edged up in the first three quarters of this year, a move reflecting surprisingly robust imports and, to a lesser extent, falling prices. 8 Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments rose at a modest pace in October, with generally small increases in most subcategories.  New orders in this broad-based sector also moved up, led by double-digit gains in construction equipment and industrial machinery.  Nevertheless, new orders have continued to run substantially below shipments, indicating that producers continued to draw down their backlog of unfilled orders.

Business demand for motor vehicles has cooled, on balance, since the summer. Fleet sales of light vehicles edged down in September and October (based on confidential data), and some of the decline in retail sales likely reflects softer demand from business customers.  However, sales of medium and heavy trucks have held up thus far.  Demand for heavy (class 8) trucks has been supported for several months by a desire to purchase vehicles with engines produced under old EPA emissions regulations.  New rules that took effect October 1 set tighter emissions standards and are anticipated to result in higher operating costs. However, the new rules allow engines produced before October 1 to be installed even after that date, and industry analysts indicate that most trucks assembled in November and early December will be fitted with old-rule engines.  As a result, while we continue to anticipate a payback for the surge in purchases preceding October 1, we now expect that payback to occur mainly in the first quarter. After having plunged in September, net new orders for medium trucks (classes 5 to 7), which are not subject to the new EPA regulations, rebounded in October, and the three-month moving average of new orders moved up slightly.

Nonresidential Construction

Nominal nonresidential construction spending increased about 1 percent in October after having fallen sharply during the third quarter. 9 The increase-the first since April-was concentrated in the retail, wholesale and institutional sectors, though spending on hotels and other buildings also edged up. Investment in office and industrial buildings continued to fall in October, but the declines were less severe than they were in the third quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

Some other recent indicators, though remaining quite weak overall, may also be hinting at a moderation in the rates of decline in nonresidential construction.  In the office sector, vacancy rates moved up again in the third quarter, but the increase was considerably smaller than in the previous two years.  In addition, although office property values and rents continued to decrease last quarter on a year-over-year basis, losses in office-building values have moderated significantly since the beginning of the year.  Property values for retail space were actually higher last quarter than they were a year earlier, though rents continued to fall.  But the warehouse market showed little sign of improvement last quarter.  In the industrial sector, vacancy rates moved up again in the third quarter, but, as in the office sector, the increase was quite small compared with those seen during the previous two years.

Outside the buildings component of construction, a small increase in the number of petroleum drilling rigs in operation in October and November partially offset a decline in natural gas rigs in operation.  These data suggest that spending for drilling structures used with the rigs has been little changed so far in the fourth quarter.

Business Inventories

Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of $9.3 billion in the third quarter after having declined $15.4 billion in the second quarter.  This positive swing in inventory investment added about 1 percentage point to the growth of GDP in the third quarter.  In October, manufacturing inventories were little changed, as continued drawdowns for many types of durable goods offset modest stockbuilding of nondurable goods.  The book value data provide no evidence of substantial inventory overhangs outside of motor vehicles and parts.  In addition, the West Coast dock disruptions do not appear to have been large enough to affect the level of aggregate inventories.

Using the staff's flow-of-goods system, which measures stocks wherever held and values them at factory-gate prices, inventories jumped by 2-1/2 days' worth of consumption during September and October.  Most of this increase was due to a sharp run-up in stocks of motor vehicles and parts.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, the ratio of inventories to consumption remained near its average of the past few years, with only scattered imbalances evident across industries.

Federal Government

The federal budget situation has continued to deteriorate.  The federal government recorded a $54 billion unified deficit in October; this compares with a $31 billion deficit a year earlier (after adjusting for timing shifts).  October receipts dropped $9 billion, or 7 percent, from last October on an adjusted

basis. 10 The decline was concentrated in individual income and payroll tax receipts and reflects the reductions in income tax rates implemented this year. Meanwhile, outlays in October rose $14 billion, or 9 percent, from last October. Contributing to this jump were large increases in outlays for defense, Medicare, and unemployment benefits.  The increase in total outlays was held down by a reduction in interest payments that was induced by lower interest rates.

Ongoing disputes over nondefense spending continued to impede progress on fiscal 2003 appropriations during the lame duck session, and the Congress passed a continuing resolution that provides funding for nondefense agencies through January 11, 2002.  Subsequently, the Republican Congressional leaders appear to have reached agreement with the Administration on the level of total discretionary spending, although the details of the plan will need to be worked out in January.  Congress has not yet extended the temporary extended unemployment compensation (TEUC) program, which is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2002; however, most analysts expect this program to be renewed after the turn of the year.  The recent creation of a Department of Homeland Security is largely a reorganization of existing agencies and will have little immediate impact on the budget.

State and Local Governments

Available information indicates that growth in state and local spending for consumption and investment remained subdued in the early part of the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment in this sector increased only 11,000 in October, down from the 18,000 monthly average rise during the first three quarters of the year and well below the 38,000 average monthly gain during 2001.  Much of the weakness in employment in recent months has been at state governments and appears to reflect widespread fiscal difficulties.  Real construction put in place fell back in October.  But state and local construction has been on an upward trend since early summer, and the October level stood a bit above the thirdquarter average.  In October, highway construction dropped substantially, but real outlays for education facilities rose to a new record.

The fiscal pressure on state and local governments is intense.  Since the November elections, some state governors and governors-elect have announced proposals to deal with worsening imbalances in their general-fund budgets, which, except in Vermont, are all under various types of balanced-budget requirements.  Program cuts so far appear to remain the predominant ingredient in most of these proposals, but tax hikes have begun to garner more attention.

<!-- missing-text -->

Because budget stabilization funds are depleted in some states, less funding is expected to come from such rainy-day funds this year compared to last year. Rather, many governments are expected to transfer funds from other types of reserve accounts into their general funds to help cover prospective shortfalls. Meanwhile, revenue inflows for the state and local sector as a whole have begun to strengthen a bit.  Own-source revenue-that is, the sum of personal, corporate, and indirect business tax and nontax receipts-rose 2.7 percent over the four quarters ending in 2002:Q3, the largest advance since the end of 2000; however, the increase is still well below rates seen in the mid-to-late 1990s.

Prices

Inflation for consumer goods and services other than food and energy has continued to edge lower.  The core CPI rose a moderate 0.2 percent in October, bringing its twelve-month change to 2.2 percent, 0.4 percentage point lower than its increase in the comparable period twelve months earlier.  The 1.8 percent rise in the core PCE price index over the twelve months ending in October was marginally less than the rise over the previous year; this deceleration would have been more pronounced if not for an acceleration in the erratic nonmarket component of these prices.

The CPI for services excluding energy increased 0.3 percent in October and is up 3.7 percent over the past twelve months-the same rate of increase as over the preceding year but down from the twelve-month changes of 4 percent that prevailed last winter.  The price index for commodities excluding food and energy edged down 0.1 percent in October, as sharp drops in tobacco and used motor vehicle prices more than offset a 0.4 percent rise in new motor vehicle prices.  As noted earlier, these motor vehicle price increases reflected smaller incentives on 2003 model-year vehicles. 11

The chained CPI excluding food and energy-which takes better account than the official CPI of consumer substitution among different items-shows inflation running at 1.7 percent over the past twelve months, unchanged from a year earlier.  However, month-to-month changes in the chained CPI have been more erratic than in the official CPI, and smoothing through this monthly volatility, inflation as measured by the chained CPI also appears to have edged lower over the past year.  Some deceleration in inflation appears as well in the core market-based PCE price index which, like the chained CPI, uses a superlative aggregation formula that takes consumer substitution into account. Core market-based PCE prices rose 1.3 percent over the twelve months ending in October, 0.4 percentage point less than a year earlier.  More rapid increases for prices of nonmarket

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

services-items for which accurate prices are difficult to estimate-accounted for the smaller deceleration in the overall core PCE price index noted above.

Consumer energy prices rose notably in October.  In particular, the CPI for gasoline jumped 3.4 percent, reflecting temporary interruptions of oil refinery operations caused by Tropical Storm Isidore and Hurricane Lili.  But wholesale inventories are gradually returning to normal levels, and survey data suggest that gasoline prices declined in November.  Meanwhile, food prices edged up 0.1 percent last month.  Over the past twelve months, overall food prices have increased less than 1 percent after rising nearly 3-1/2 percent over the preceding year.  Much of this deceleration reflected declines in prices of livestock products following large supply-related increases during the earlier period.

Broader price indexes have decelerated more than consumption prices over the past year.  After abstracting from the adjustments that the BEA made to the data for 2001:Q3 to account for insurance payments associated with the terrorist attacks, the price index for GDP has increased 1 percent over the past four quarters, its smallest increase since 1963 and down from a 2.4 percent increase over the preceding year. 12 About half of this deceleration reflects movements in food and energy prices.  In addition, there has been an especially sharp deceleration over the past year in prices for construction of residential and nonresidential structures.  Some of that slowing reflects erratic movements in the prices of structures in the drilling and mining sector, but price increases for the construction of buildings have slowed sharply as well.

Near-term inflation expectations from the Michigan survey have moved somewhat lower in the past two months.  The median expectation for inflation over the coming year edged down to 2.4 percent in November, continuing a gradual downward slide from 2.8 percent in April.  Mean one-year expectations also fell for a second month in a row after a substantial uptick in September. Expectations of inflation over the next five to ten years were little changed in November and, at 2-3/4 percent, remain within the range observed during the past year.

Prices at earlier stages of processing have increased.  The PPI for intermediate goods other than food and energy inched up 0.1 percent in October and was 1.0 percent above its year-earlier level.  The PPI for core crude materials rose 0.9 percent in October.  Since the last Greenbook, broad-based spot commodity price indexes have moved higher; the Journal of Commerce industrial price index and the Commodity Research Bureau index of spot industrial prices are each up about 1 percent.

We have received little new information on labor costs since the last Greenbook. Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter, bringing the four-quarter change in this series to 3.3 percent.  These figures are only slightly different from the estimates reported in the last Greenbook supplement.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Investors apparently have become more optimistic about economic prospects since the last FOMC meeting, as evidenced by rising equity prices, narrowing credit spreads, and increasing Treasury yields.  The FOMC's policy easing on November 6 was larger than expected, and the shift to a balanced assessment of risks also surprised market participants.  Those actions, in concert with economic data that were somewhat stronger than expected, seemed to reassure investors that economic activity will accelerate after coasting through the current 'soft spot.' Consequently, futures rates imply little probability of a policy move at the upcoming meeting, and market participants have marked up their expected path for the funds rate beyond the middle of next year.

Business borrowing has strengthened slightly in recent weeks, as firms have tapped the bond market in greater volume.  In the household sector, mortgage borrowing has continued to be brisk, maintained by near-record low mortgage rates.  Debt issuance by state and local governments has continued to be supported by low interest rates and weak tax revenues, and federal borrowing has remained substantial.

Interest Rates, Stock Prices, and Corporate Risk Spreads

The FOMC's announcement prompted a notable drop in money market yields that afternoon but only small changes in longer-term yields and equity prices. Over subsequent weeks, economic news was apparently read as generally positive, bolstering investors' confidence that the economic recovery was not likely to stall and prompting both equity prices and Treasury yields to rise on balance over the intermeeting period.  Judging from options prices, uncertainty about the near-term path for both short- and long-term interest rates appears to have declined, on net, since the last FOMC meeting.

Two- to ten-year Treasury coupon yields finished the period up about 15 to 25 basis points.  The increase was greatest in two- to five-year rates, as investors marked up the expected path of policy beyond the next few months. Both survey- and market-based measures of inflation expectations were little changed over the period, implying that the bulk of the increase in Treasury yields represented a rise in real interest rates.

Share prices fell early in the intermeeting period on concerns about earnings in the tech sector and at banks and securities firms but later rallied on the perceived positive tone to economic data and favorable reports from the retail sector, although this positive glow may have diminished somewhat in recent days. Since the last FOMC meeting, broad equity indexes are up 1/2 percent to 1 percent and have risen substantially from the lows of early October.  Greater investor confidence in the economic outlook also helped to reduce uncertainty

about near-term share prices, with implied volatility on the S&amp;P 100 declining on balance over recent weeks to its lowest levels since June.  Rising share prices, coupled with a small downward revision to year-ahead earnings, nudged the forward earnings-price ratio for the S&amp;P 500 lower in December, but its spread over the real Treasury yield-a crude measure of the equity premium-remains wide in comparison with recent years.

Liquidity in the corporate bond market has reportedly improved from the relatively poor level seen in October, and risk spreads on higher-quality investment-grade corporate bonds narrowed somewhat over the intermeeting period.  The risk spreads on BBB-rated corporate bonds-the lowest-rated investment-grade issues-declined more.  Part of this decline is the result of spreads on Ford and GM bonds retracing their steep ascent of early October. Risk spreads on speculative-grade bonds, particularly those in the telecom, energy, and utility sectors, fell more than those on investment-grade issues but remain quite elevated by historical standards.

In the commercial paper market, year-end premia are smaller thus far than they have been in the past few years, owing at least in part to the exit of many of the riskiest issuers from the market.  The improved tone in corporate debt markets is also reflected in an appreciable narrowing of credit default swap spreads (not shown) for many large commercial banks, investment banks, and finance companies.

Business Finance, Corporate Credit Quality, and Earnings

Equity issuance by nonfinancial firms picked up a bit in November, mainly because of seasoned offerings from utilities attempting to reduce leverage.  In contrast, activity in the IPO market remained quite weak despite the recent rise in share prices, reduced volatility, and some brightening in investor sentiment. Based on firms' announcements, share repurchases likely have continued at a moderate pace; the equity retirements from share buybacks and mergers still appear to be outpacing gross issuance, though by a smaller margin than earlier this year.

Gross bond issuance rose to $21 billion in November after an average monthly pace of less than $14 billion from July to October, with speculative-grade firms accounting for most of the pickup mainly because of two large deals to finance the purchase of subsidiaries of telecom firms. Total borrowing by nonfinancial firms turned positive in November after several months of negative readings, partly reflecting the recent tapering off of declines in commercial paper and C&amp;I loans.

Most third-quarter earnings reports were in hand by the time of the November FOMC meeting, with the exception of those of most retailers, which typically

lag.  Their earnings have since come in and mostly exceeded analysts' forecasts, and as a result the estimate of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share for the third quarter rose slightly, putting year-over-year growth at about 14 percent-a growth rate that appears large only because last year's earnings were near a cyclical low. Downward revisions to the year-ahead outlook have slowed a bit recently, and analysts are still looking for sizable gains in the coming year.

Despite the rise in earnings, corporate credit quality shows only faint signs of an improvement.  Recent measures of defaults and delinquencies continue to suggest that severe financial stress persists for some firms.  The twelve-month average default rate on corporate bonds has declined from the July peak, but it remains high.  The observed prices on defaulted bonds imply low recovery rates, with current estimates for the year just under 25 percent, near the low end of recovery rates over the past ten years.  Ratings downgrades of nonfinancial firms were again significantly higher than upgrades in October, and while a forward measure of expected defaults inched down, it too remained quite elevated.

Commercial Real Estate Finance

Despite the ongoing decline in nonresidential construction spending, commercial mortgage debt grew a brisk 8 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Some of this growth reflects the extraction of equity from existing properties. Although most fixed-rate commercial mortgages are difficult to refinance because of prepayment penalties, variable-rate mortgages and mortgages coming due within a short time can be refinanced, and recent deals have often involved the extraction of equity. Yield spreads on commercial-mortgage-backed securities over swap rates widened during the intermeeting period, mainly in anticipation of an upsurge in CMBS supply before year-end. Potential creditquality problems do not seem to have played a major role in these widening spreads, although some market participants have voiced concerns. To date, commercial mortgage delinquency rates have remained stable.

In late November, the President signed legislation that limits the exposure of commercial property and casualty insurers in the event of future terrorist attacks. As a result, Moody's and Fitch may reverse their September downgrades of securities backed by only one or a small number of large properties, which could cause spreads on these large-loan deals to narrow.  However, these deals do not account for a major share of market transactions, and the staff does not expect the new law to boost commercial mortgage demand substantially.

Household Finance

Mortgage rates briefly dipped again to record lows during the intermeeting period, sustaining the wave of mortgage origination and refinancing.  Residential mortgage debt surged in the third quarter, and borrowing likely has remained strong in the current quarter.  The amount of mortgage debt refinanced  in November maintained its torrid pace from October, and the elevated MBA index (not shown) suggests robust refinancing activity at least through year-end.  The surge in refinancing may help explain the tepid growth in consumer credit if households have been using equity withdrawn from their homes to pay down some of their higher-interest debt.

In the third quarter, the household debt-service burden was essentially unchanged at its recent high level, and delinquency rates on consumer and residential real estate loans edged lower. The rate of personal bankruptcy filings was little changed, on balance, in November, but it remains at an elevated level.

The increase in stock prices since early October, if maintained, would imply a rise in the ratio of household assets to disposable income in the fourth quarter. The rebound in stock prices also appears to have induced net inflows into equity mutual funds in November after five consecutive months of outflows.  At the same time, investors have continued to make substantial net contributions into bond mutual funds, extending the pattern seen throughout this year.

Treasury and Agency Finance

The deficits in October and November reflected the trend of deterioration in the federal budget.  While seasonal patterns in tax receipts usually result in a deficit in October, this year's reading was significantly larger than that of a year ago, and current estimates suggest the increased borrowing continued in November as the deficit deepened.

The duration mismatch on the books of the mortgage GSEs continued to attract market attention over the intermeeting period.  The use of derivatives and the addition of new mortgages to their books trimmed the duration gap somewhat, prompting the yield spreads on agency debt over Treasuries to decrease further over the intermeeting period.  These spreads are now at the low end of the year's range.

State and Local Government Finance

In November, the issuance of short-term state and local government debt fell back substantially after the spike in October that reflected fiscal difficulties in California.  However, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained strong; most of these bonds were issued to finance capital spending, but some also represented advance refunding to take advantage of low interest rates.

III-13

Although more municipalities have been downgraded than upgraded this year, the situation may have stabilized recently; in November, twice as many bonds were upgraded as downgraded.  However, the yield spread of insured BBB-rated over AAA-rated municipal bonds was little changed at about 65 basis points, a somewhat elevated level compared with that of recent years.

Money and Bank Credit

After a sharp slowing at the end of the third quarter, M2 expanded rapidly over the first two months of this quarter.  The growth of M2 was likely supported by the low opportunity cost of holding M2, as well as the continued wave of mortgage refinancings, the proceeds of which are placed temporarily in liquid deposits before disbursement to holders of mortgage-backed securities.  The low level of interest rates also seems to have caused households to shift funds from retail time deposits into liquid deposits.

Bank credit continued to grow briskly in November.  Low mortgage rates encouraged strong growth in real estate loans, much of which were swapped for mortgage-backed securities.  Consumer loans originated at banks have risen at a moderate pace in recent months, while bank loans to businesses continued to fall in October and November, albeit at a slower pace than in the third quarter.

Commercial banks' returns on assets and on equity slipped a bit in the third quarter but remained high by historical standards.  Third-quarter profitability was hindered by small declines in both net interest margins and noninterest income as well as by an uptick in loss provisioning.  Loan delinquency rates, however, edged down in the third quarter, in response to better performance of real estate loans and consumer loans combined with a stable delinquency rate on commercial and industrial loans.

Trade in Goods and Services

The deficit in U.S. international trade in goods and services was $38.0 billion in September, slightly lower than in August (revised).  For the third quarter, the deficit was $446 billion at an annual rate, little changed from the second quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

Exports of goods and services edged down in September for the second consecutive month, reflecting a decline in exports of services.  Exports of goods were little changed for the month, as increases in machinery and telecommunications equipment offset declines in automotive products, industrial supplies, and semiconductors.  For the third quarter, the value of exported goods and services increased $16 billion (s.a.a.r.), a gain of 6.8 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter level.  Exports in nearly all major categories of trade rose in the third quarter, with aircraft showing the largest gain.  Real NIPA exports, which grew at 14.2 percent (s.a.a.r) in the second quarter, expanded just 3.3 percent in the third quarter.

Imports of goods and services eased somewhat in September, with both goods and services moving lower.  Within goods, increased imports of automotive products partially offset lower imports of oil, computers, semiconductors, and consumer goods.  For the third quarter, imports of goods and services rose $20 billion (s.a.a.r.), or 5.8 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter level. Imports of goods accounted for most of the increase in the third quarter, with higher imports of consumer goods, industrial supplies, and automotive products more than offsetting lower imports of aircraft, computers, and semiconductors. Real NIPA imports, which surged 22.2 percent (s.a.a.r) in the second quarter, also slowed to just 2.3 percent in the third quarter.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

The price of imported non-oil goods ticked down 0.1 percent in October following four consecutive months of modest increases.  The price of core goods edged up 0.1 percent in October, while the prices of computers and semiconductors continued to drop.  For core goods, the largest increase was in the price index for non-oil industrial supplies, which rose 0.5 percent.  In October, the price index for the food sector dipped 0.3 percent after having risen every month in the third quarter.

The BLS price of imported oil rose 1.1 percent in October after climbing 6.0 percent in September.  The price of imported oil has risen every month this year except June.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil has also risen on average since the beginning of the year and is currently around $27 per barrel, up from its average value near $19 per barrel last December.  In the second half of October, the spot price fell from above $29 per barrel to near $26 per barrel, reflecting higher production from OPEC and the acceptance by Iraq of a new U.N. resolution allowing unfettered weapons inspections.  More recently, spot WTI has edged back up with indications of renewed OPEC production restraint, the possibility of military action in Iraq, political turmoil in Venezuela, and tight oil inventories in the United States.

The price of total U.S. exported goods remained unchanged in October, and the price of exports of core goods moved up 0.1 percent.  Within core goods, the largest price movement in October was a 1.8 percent decline in the price of agricultural products, an about-face after four consecutive months of increases. Prices in other major categories were generally little changed.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Foreign official inflows were again modest in September, bringing the total for the third quarter to $8 billion (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).  While this is in line with the typical quarterly amount over the past year, it is sharply lower than the $47 billion recorded in the second quarter.  The large official inflows in the second quarter were associated with attempts by some countries-notably Japan, China, Taiwan, and Korea-to prevent appreciation of their currencies against the dollar; for Japan, this accumulation of dollar assets took the form of official intervention.  Russia's official holdings also increased sharply in the quarter as revenues from oil exports surged.  These countries continued to acquire dollar assets in the third quarter, but to a much lesser extent.

The decline in official inflows between the second and third quarters coincided with a nearly offsetting increase in net private inflows through securities transactions, which increased from $89 billion in the second quarter to $120

billion in the third quarter (line 4 plus line 5).  A small portion ($15 billion) of the net private inflows in the third quarter owed to U.S. investors' sales of foreign securities (line 5).  U.S. investors' reduced appetite for foreign securities extends back to late last year; after averaging over $100 billion annually through the middle of last year, in the past five quarters U.S. investors have on net purchased only $10 billion in foreign securities.

The bulk of the net private inflows, however, were due to continued sizeable ($105 billion) private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4).  If maintained, the pace of private inflows into U.S. securities of the past two quarters would represent a return to the high level of inflows of the first half of 2001.  There was also a noticeable shift in the composition of private inflows from corporate securities to Treasury and agency securities.  Prior to the third quarter, the bulk of private inflows had been through purchases of U.S. corporate securities, primarily bonds.  In the third quarter, however, private foreign purchases of corporate bonds (line 4c) fell sharply despite strong issuance and foreigners' on net sold U.S. equities (line 4d).  More than offsetting the decline in foreign purchases of corporate securities were robust inflows into agency bonds (line 4b) and strong purchases of Treasury securities (line 4a).  The inflows into Treasury securities ($55 billion) were the highest quarterly amount since 1996.

Banking flows (line 3) continue to be volatile.  For the third quarter, banking inflows amounted to $53 billion, more than offsetting the $25 billion in outflows in the first half of the year.

Foreign Exchange Markets

On balance, the broad nominal value of the dollar has appreciated slightly on a trade-weighted basis over the period since the last FOMC meeting, led largely by a gain of about â° percent against major foreign currencies. Against the currencies of our other important trading partners, the dollar is little changed.

<!-- missing-text -->

The dollar depreciated modestly against most major currencies in the week following the Committee's decision to cut rates but later retraced some of its losses as stronger-than-expected U.S. data fostered limited market optimism about economic conditions in the United States vis-Ã -vis those in foreign industrial economies.  On balance, the dollar gained 2â° percent against the yen and was little changed against the euro and Canadian dollar.  The dollar depreciated Â¾ percent on net against sterling.

Much of the dollar's gains against the yen came late in the period following official commentary which market participants interpreted as reflecting the government's preference for a much weaker yen.  Over the period, stock prices in Japan fluctuated near multi-decade lows as uncertainty about the extent and impact of expected government reforms to the banking sector and supplementary budget plans swayed market sentiment.  Equity prices in the banking sector fell dramatically following a media report that a major bank would be nationalized. Although the report was subsequently denied by the government, share prices at two of Japan's four largest banks fell over 30 percent on balance.  Broad

Japanese equity markets fell 1 percent on net.  The yield on the ten-year Japanese government bond ended the period a few basis points higher after the government confirmed its plans for a supplementary budget and the resulting need for new issuance.

<!-- missing-text -->

The Bank of Japan left its target range for reserves held at the central bank unchanged in meetings this period but said it would now aim at the upper end of the range.  Reserves at the BoJ, which had been averaging near the center of the current range of 15-20 trillion yen, increased to levels above 19 trillion yen after the announcement.

Short-term interest rates in the euro area declined over 20 basis points.  Data from the euro area, and Germany in particular, showed further economic weakness, helping to firm market expectations that the European Central Bank would lower interest rates at least 25 basis points by year end.  Consistent with a relatively weaker euro-area growth and inflation outlook, yields on long-term euro-area government debt fell modestly, whereas comparable Treasury yields increased modestly.

Short-term U.K. interest rates rose on balance as continued strength in housing prices and stronger-than-expected retail sales prompted markets to adjust upward

the expected future path of the Bank of England's policy rate.  Headline equity indexes fell in the United Kingdom and registered mixed performance in the euro area.  European markets made substantial gains in response to a number of stronger than-expected U.S. data releases but were generally weighed down by weaker corporate outlooks.

Reversing course after having increased rates twice earlier this year, Sweden's Riksbank lowered its policy rate 25 basis points to 4 percent.  The dollar nonetheless depreciated modestly against the krona on balance following stronger-than-expected Swedish confidence data.

<!-- missing-text -->

In Latin America, market sentiment toward Brazilian assets remained relatively stable despite ongoing uncertainty about the likely composition and policies of the incoming Lula administration.  The Brazilian EMBI+ spread over U.S. Treasuries narrowed to 1,600 basis points from a recent peak of 2,400 basis

points in late September and the Brazilian stock market rose 7 percent.  Promarket statements by senior members of Lula's transition team and of the Workers' Party (PT), as well as comments by IMF officials in support of Lula's economic plans, helped to support Brazilian asset prices.  After having appreciated substantially in the immediate aftermath of the second-round elections in late October, over the intermeeting period the Brazilian real depreciated a relatively modest 4 percent against the dollar on net.

Argentina's EMBI+ yield spread over Treasuries increased 250 basis points over the period, largely in reaction to the Argentine government's failure to repay the principal due on its World Bank debt.

In emerging Asia, sovereign bond spreads were little changed and equity market performance was mixed.  The Korean stock market outperformed amid news of strong export growth in that country, and the won appreciated 1 percent against the dollar.  Equity markets also rose, although more modestly, in Taiwan and Hong Kong, while markets fell about 5 percent in Singapore and Malaysia.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Real GDP growth in most foreign industrial countries slowed or remained weak in the third quarter.  Growth in Japan moderated from a strong second-quarter rate as net exports made a negative contribution to growth.  Canadian growth subsided as well, but stayed relatively robust on the back of strong investment growth.  The United Kingdom continued to grow at a moderate pace with support coming from the service sector.  In the euro area, growth remained sluggish despite a rebound in final domestic demand.

More recent indicators have also been soft.  In most major foreign industrial countries, September industrial production fell, and business confidence declined or remained low in recent months.  In Canada and the United Kingdom, a robust housing sector has offset weakness in other sectors.

Twelve-month consumer-price inflation rates rose in most major foreign industrial countries.  In Canada and the euro area, higher energy prices were partially responsible for the upturn.  In the United Kingdom, rapid increases in housing prices also added significantly to the rise in inflation.  Japanese prices continued to fall, though at a slightly slower pace.

In Japan , real GDP rose 3 percent (s.a.a.r.) during the third quarter.  The rise was led by a slowing pace of inventory decumulation, which contributed 1.9 percentage points to growth.  Private consumption remained strong, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of positive growth.  In contrast, business fixed, residential, and public investment all declined.  Net exports, an engine of growth during the first half of the year, subtracted 0.4 percentage point from growth. Real export growth slowed markedly from roughly 26 percent in the second quarter to 2 percent in the third quarter, in part reflecting a slowdown in exports of high-tech goods to emerging Asia.  GDP growth during the second quarter was revised upward to 4.2 percent from 2.6 percent, while first-quarter growth was revised to 0.8 percent from zero.

Recent indicators are generally consistent with a slowing in the pace of growth. Industrial production slipped in October, marking the second consecutive monthly decline.  Private consumption appears to be moderating, with household expenditures in October only slightly above the third-quarter average.  New car registrations declined in November.  The unemployment rate rose to 5.5 percent in October, matching the record high set last December.  The job-offers-toapplicants ratio, a key leading indicator of employment conditions, edged up to 0.56 in October, but remains at low levels.  Business spending remains weak, with core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, falling nearly 2 percent on average during the third quarter.  Residential building

starts rose sharply in October, but this followed several months of steep declines. Exports remain relatively sluggish, with real exports for October up about 1 percent from the third-quarter average.  October imports fell roughly 2 percent.

Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) were unchanged in November from the previous month and were down 0.7 percent from a year earlier.  Wholesale prices for domestic goods have been roughly flat on a month-to-month basis since February; as a result, twelve-month deflation at the wholesale level eased to 0.5 percent in October from 1.4 percent earlier this year

Details on the supplementary budget were announced on November 22.  We estimate that the net 'real water' content of the package is about Â¥2 trillion (0.4 percent of GDP), including Â¥1.5 trillion for additional spending on traditional public works as well as some funds for labor market programs.  Additional financing for small- and medium-sized enterprises will also be available.  The government will issue an additional Â¥3 trillion in bonds to cover an expected tax-revenue shortfall.  This added financing will bring the total new debt issuance to Â¥35 trillion for FY2002, violating Prime Minister Koizumi's pledge not to exceed Â¥30 trillion.  Legislation for the supplementary budget is expected

to be submitted to the Diet in January.  Even with the addition of this supplementary spending, fiscal policy will be somewhat contractionary next year.  On November 29, Financial Services Agency Minister Heizo Takenaka provided more information about his proposals to resolve problems in the Japanese banking sector, but important details remain unspecified as Takenaka continues to seek political support for significant reform.

GDP data confirm that euro-area economic growth remained sluggish in the third quarter.  Consumption growth picked up, and investment spending was flat after six quarterly declines, but net exports provided less of a boost than in the first half and inventory destocking was a drag on GDP growth.  The French growth rate slowed to just below those of Germany and Italy, after exceeding them in the first half, with declining business fixed investment and a negative

contribution from inventories largely accounting for the French slowdown.

Euro-area industrial production and German manufacturing orders finished the third quarter on a sour note with declines in September, and business sentiment indicators suggest that euro-area growth is slowing further in the fourth quarter. November's euro-area purchasing managers index (PMI) for manufacturing, though up slightly, remained just below the 50 level (the threshold for positive growth), and German IFO business sentiment continued to deteriorate in November.

Consumer confidence slipped further in November and is relatively pessimistic on balance.  Both consumers' expectations of their own financial situation and their expectations of the general economy over the next twelve months declined. The volume of retail sales dropped considerably in September but still posted a notable rise during the third quarter.

The twelve-month rate of euro-area consumer price inflation remained just above the European Central Bank's (ECB) target ceiling of 2 percent in November. Excluding food, energy, and alcohol and tobacco, the twelve-month inflation rate edged down to 2.3 percent in October, just below the six-year peak of 2.5 percent reached in May.  Producer prices are only slightly higher than year-earlier levels.

The European Commission announced on November 13 that it will launch an 'excessive deficit procedure' against Germany.  The country's fiscal deficit is expected to come in at 3.8 percent of GDP in 2002 and to remain over the 3 percent limit specified in the Stability and Growth Pact in 2003.  The German government has expressed its commitment to tighten fiscal policy in order to adhere to the 3 percent limit in 2003, announcing a package of spending cuts and tax increases equal to about 0.8 percentage point of GDP in 2003.  The package includes a new capital gains tax on share sales and investment property and the postponement of approved reductions in personal income taxes.  The Commission also announced that it will implement an early warning procedure

against France, given the Commission's forecast that France's fiscal deficit will be 2.9 percent of GDP in 2003.  The Commission has criticized France for the lack of clear improvement in its projected structural deficit next year and for its failure to put a plan in place that will allow the budget to be balanced by 2006.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP expanded 3.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, up from 2.5 percent in the previous quarter.  The third-quarter pickup in growth mainly reflected sharp turnarounds in government spending and inventory accumulation.  The services sector also was strong.  In contrast, growth of consumer spending moderated from a striking second-quarter rise and gross fixed capital formation tumbled.  Net exports subtracted 1.2 percentage points from growth, as exports shrank and imports grew.

The limited indicators that are available for the fourth quarter are mixed, but on balance point to moderate growth, with a relatively weak manufacturing sector and a robust services sector. Business confidence fell in November, whereas the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey of manufacturing order books recovered notably.  In recent months, the manufacturing PMI has been falling, with November's index indicating no growth in the sector.  November's services PMI receded, but continued to indicate a notable expansion.  Retail sales grew briskly in October, and the CBI survey of retail sales indicates further growth in

November.  Consumer confidence has remained relatively flat over the past several months after rising during the summer, with consumers relatively optimistic about their own financial situation over the next twelve months, but less sure about the economy in general.

Despite some anecdotal evidence that the housing market is cooling, housing prices increased about 5â° percent (not annualized) in the three months ending in November according to one of the two leading surveys.  The November Construction PMI rose to 56.2, with the housing sector index climbing to 62.3. Borrowing to finance the purchase of homes jumped in October, while unsecured borrowing subsided.

Labor market conditions have remained tight.  The official claims-based unemployment rate held steady at 3.1 percent in October, near a record low.  The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) rose to 2.3 percent in October, slightly below the Bank of England's 2â° percent target.  The increase in inflation partially reflects higher housing prices.  The twelve-month growth rate of average earnings ticked up to 3.7 percent in September.

On November 27, the government presented to Parliament its Pre-Budget Report, which included no new major spending.  Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, projected Public Sector Net Borrowing to be Â£20 billion for 2002-03 and Â£24 billion for 2003-04 -- both around 2 percent of GDP.  This forecast is an upward revision from the March budget's projection of Â£11 billion for 2002-03 and Â£13 billion for 2003-04.  The government lowered its real GDP growth forecasts to 1.6 percent for 2002, and 2â°-3 percent for 2003.  The foreast for 2004 is 3-3â° percent growth.

Brown announced on November 27 that Mervyn King will replace Edward George as Governor of the Bank of England.  Mr. King currently serves as the bank's Deputy Governor, and his appointment as Governor will begin when George's term expires at the end of June 2003.  His term of office will be for three years and is renewable.

In Canada , real GDP grew 3.1 percent (s.a.a.r) in the third quarter, led by strong growth in the export of motor vehicles and a residential housing boom. Investment in residential structures increased 15.9 percent, compared with an otherwise tepid 2.1 percent rise in investment in non-residential structures and equipment.  Consumption expenditures were flat following strong growth in the previous quarter.  Monthly GDP measured by industry reveals that third quarter

growth was concentrated in the beginning of the quarter and had tapered off by September.  However, indicators suggest that residential construction has remained strong in the fourth quarter.  In October, housing starts jumped 6.6 percent above the third-quarter average, rising to their highest level since 1990.

Surveys suggest mixed business sentiment going into the fourth quarter.  In October's business conditions survey, manufacturers expressed increased pessimism regarding production prospects for the fourth quarter, with those firms expecting to decrease production outweighing those expecting to increase production.  However, October's PMI rose to 60.9 from 58.5 in September.

The unemployment rate fell to 7.6 percent in October from 7.7 percent in September.  Employment has increased 3 percent in 2002, the largest ten-month increase since 1994.  However, recent data suggest that the labor market is cooling.  Employment increases in September and October resulted from gains in part-time employment, while full-time employment actually fell in both months. Hours worked fell 1.4 percent in October from the third-quarter average.  In October, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation leapt to 3.2 percent from 2.3 percent in September, reflecting base effects and higher energy and tobacco prices, as well as higher automobile insurance premiums.  Core inflation,

excluding food and energy prices, rose to 3.3 percent in October from 3.0 percent the month before.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

The economic and political environment in South America remains unsettled. Brazil is coping with the transition to the Lula administration, and Argentina has defaulted on a World Bank loan.  Despite some improvement in recent economic data, the Venezuelan political situation appears to have deteriorated.  In Mexico, the recovery has continued, but recent indicators point to some softening in the pace of activity.  Growth in emerging Asia moderated in the third quarter, but China is still the most notable exception, with indicators there showing no signs of a slowdown in economic activity.

In Brazil , indicators since the last Greenbook have been mixed.  Real GDP rose 3.8 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, boosted by strength in the industrial sector.  This growth was higher than expected, given that other indicators had pointed to a slowdown.  In particular, unemployment rose in the third quarter and continued to climb in October.  The trade surplus has widened significantly in recent months, bringing the cumulative trade surplus through November to over $11 billion, versus $2 billion for the same period in 2001.  The increase reflects both the weak economy and improved international competitiveness following the depreciation of the real .

Twelve-month consumer price inflation climbed to 8.5 percent in October, driven by pass-through from the sizeable net depreciation of the real in recent months. The rise in inflation has prompted the central bank to increase its overnight interest rate 300 basis points since mid-October.  Reflecting concerns that President-elect Lula, who takes office in January, will enact expansionary policies, inflation expectations have climbed considerably in recent weeks.  The delay in the announcement of a new economic team, which is now expected by December 8, has helped fuel these concerns.

Despite some recent improvement in exchange rates and risk premia, Brazilian borrowers' access to international and domestic capital markets remains highly restricted.  Attention continues to focus on the rollover of significant amounts of domestic federal government debt maturing in coming weeks.  The government rolled over most of the debt maturing in early December, but at yields that may prove unsustainable.

In Argentina , data releases since the last Greenbook were mixed.  Although confidence indicators rose, other indicators pointed to a weakening in activity.  In any case, the very depressed state of the economy, plus the suppression of utility rates, kept CPI inflation at only 0.2 percent (s.a.) in October.  This brought the twelve-month increase to nearly 40 percent, versus an increase in the producer price index of about 125 percent over the same period.  Consumer price inflation has been surprisingly low given the government's severe fiscal problems, fiscal and monetary pressures from the provincial governments, and the country's lack of access to international and domestic capital markets.

In mid-November, the Argentine government defaulted on a $800 million payment to the World Bank, after failing to reach agreement with the IMF on a new loan.  The default makes Argentina ineligible for new loans from the World Bank.  The Argentine government lifted withdrawal restrictions (the 'corralito') on December 2, one year after the restrictions were imposed.  The lifting of restrictions passed relatively calmly, with only modest deposit withdrawals reported.  Capital controls on most transactions remain in place.  Talks between President Duhalde and the nation's provincial governments aimed at building a political consensus for economic reforms culminated in a late-November agreement that the IMF considered a step forward, but insufficient for a program. The Fund also remains concerned about the lack of a clear monetary framework.

In Mexico , real GDP grew 4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, in response to growth in U.S. output.  Available fourth-quarter indicators are generally consistent with a deceleration in activity; exports were down modestly in October and, although the unemployment rate improved in the same month, other labor market indicators were weaker.  However, business confidence turned back up in November after several months of decline.  A fall in exports has led to a widening of the trade deficit.  Twelve-month inflation came in at around 5 percent in October, unchanged from its September value and above the government's year-end target of 4â° percent.  Price data from the first half of November suggest that inflation likely moved up some in November.

A draft 2003 budget presented to congress in early November is currently under debate.  Although the opposition has endorsed the tight overall deficit target of â° percent of GDP, it has proposed an alternative budget that would dramatically increase social spending, public investment spending, and transfers to states and municipalities.  The higher spending in these categories would be financed by cutting other spending and increasing budgeted revenues, including raising the oil price assumption $1.50 per barrel.

Positive economic news out of Venezuela since the last Greenbook was at odds with a further ratcheting up of political tensions.  Output rebounded sharply in the third quarter, retracing the second quarter's decline.  Most of the gain was due to strength in the oil sector, which led the current account surplus to more than double to $15.3 billion (a.r.).  Financial conditions also improved somewhat, as Venezuela exchanged about one-third of its domestic debt coming due in the next three years for longer-term instruments that are linked to the exchange rate. However, violent skirmishes between government and opposition groups continued, and OAS sponsored 'peace talks' have made little progress.  On December 2, opposition forces began a national strike in hopes of forcing a referendum on the rule of President Chavez.

Recent indicators for Korea continue to point to healthy, albeit moderating, growth in the second half of the year.  Output rose 5.1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, boosted by robust performance in the manufacturing and service sectors, which more than offset sizable declines in agriculture and construction. The latter sectors were hurt by poor weather conditions.  More recently, industrial production for October jumped 2.4 percent, with particularly strong gains in the auto and computer chip industries.  Exports also soared in October, leading to a sizable trade surplus and a significant jump in the current account balance. Twelve-month inflation rose to 3.5 percent in November, reflecting increases in fuel prices, while the unemployment rate for October held steady at 3 percent. There are signs that consumption and investment growth may be slower going forward, however.  The most recent consumer and business confidence indicators fell, in part, on fears of weakening external conditions.  Presidential elections are scheduled for December 19, and neither the ruling party nor the opposition candidate is expected to alter the current course of economic policy significantly.

Since the last Greenbook, economic conditions in the ASEAN region have weakened somewhat.  Real GDP growth in Indonesia moderated to just over 3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, while the Philippine economy registered a small contraction.  Real GDP in Singapore fell more than 10 percent, after a very strong second quarter, largely due to a precipitous decline in equipment investment.  Malaysia, with only a modest slowing in growth in the third quarter to 6.8 percent, was the bright spot among these countries.  Recent industrial production figures for the region have been mixed, but data on production of high-tech goods have been decidedly negative in recent months.  Trade surpluses have generally widened since August, although Singapore's trade surplus shrank for the second straight month in October.

Inflation in the region was benign through October.  Indonesia remained close to achieving single-digit inflation on a twelve-month basis.  In Singapore, twelve-month inflation remains slightly negative, although prices have been stable over the past several months.

The Chinese economy has shown no signs of slowing.  Exports have continued to soar and are currently more than 30 percent above their year-ago levels. Foreign direct investment is on a pace to exceed $50 billion this year, which would likely make China the single largest recipient of FDI in the world this year. The Chinese government began the change to the next generation of political leadership in November, when the Communist party elected new leaders.  As a result, early next year Hu Jintao will become China's new President and Wen Jiabao will become the new Prime Minister.  These new leaders are expected to continue China's reform policies.

Third quarter real GDP in Hong Kong surprised on the upside, with growth of more than 10 percent (s.a.a.r.).  The Hong Kong government reported considerable strength in exports to China and in tourism.  Despite the good news, most recent indicators point to weakness in the fourth quarter.  Data show little, if any, improvement in unemployment, consumer confidence, and manufacturers' expectations.  The government did announce new measures designed to boost the ailing property market, but most analysts doubt that those measures will have much effect.  Consumer prices continued to fall in October.

Taiwanese real GDP grew just 0.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter.  A large increase in government spending and small increases in personal consumption and investment spending were largely offset by a surge in imports.  The high-tech manufacturing industry has not done well recently, and this has had repercussions throughout the economy, including the labor market, where unemployment is near decade highs.  While overall industrial production rose in October, production of high-tech goods fell sharply.  Deflation persisted in October, with prices down 1.6 percent from a year ago, although part of this decline is due to a base-year effect.
