Key Background  Factors

In  the eek following  he  announcement  of he  FOMC's  tightening  as,  ields w t t bi y on  Treasury oupon  securities  ved higher  s  financial  rkets riced  n  an c mo a ma p i early ed  tightening--indeed, ral ightenings.   the  same time, isk  preads F seve t At r s on  investment-grade  rporate  onds  moved up,  and  mortgage  rates  ose  smartly co b r as  well.  Last eek,  the enign  May  CPI  report  nd  Chairman  Greenspan's w b a JEC testimony  gnited    little  nd rally, t t as  fizzled  n worries  bout  oncoming i a bo bu i h o a corporate  ssuance  nd  renewed  nervousness bout he  possible  ggressiveness i a a t a of  Fed  pre-emptive  ctions. a

Given  the OMC's  directive  d  the  inflationary dencies  e see  in  the F an ten w economy,  we have  pulled  orward he  moderate  hike n he ederal  unds ate f t i t f f r that as assumed in  our  last  orecast  o  occur n 000.  As noted,  argely  ecause w f t i 2 l b of  policymakers'  tatements,  tes  n  the ong  end  of he  market  also ave  moved s ra i l t h up ahead  of ur  previous  chedule,  nd  we are nticipating  at  hey ill o s a a th t w fluctuate  ound  the urrent  evel  hrough ext ear. e  have  assumed ar c l t n y W somewhat less  ightening  an  appears uilt  nto he  yield  urve  at  this  uncture, t th b i t c j but  the inancial straint    our orecast  s einforced   a  subpar quity  arket f re in f i r by e m performance.

As in  previous  orecasts,   have  made some adjustments  or 2K  effects. f we f Y 2 Specifically, have  assumed  a  little  ecautionary ocking  y  consumers  and we pr st b

During  the  intermeeting riod,  atin merican financial rkets  experienced pe L A ma several  outs f  increased  tress, ich  were  caused  by  expectations  igher b o s wh ofh U.S.  interest  tes  ollowing  he OMC's  announcement  of he  adoption  f ra f t F t o a tightening as t  the  May  meeting,  ncertainty out  the olitical  nsensus bi a u ab p co with  regard o  the  Argentine urrency-board  egime,  nd  concerns ver he  pace t c r a o t

of fiscal  reform in  Brazil. Brady bond  spreads rose  early in the  period following these  developments  but have  since retraced much  of their  increases.

Overseas  equity markets  strengthened during  the intermeeting  period,  with the exception  of those in Latin America. Share prices  were  5 to 7  percent higher in Japan  and Europe. Equity  markets in  major Asian  emerging markets  were up as much as 23 percent.  Major Latin American  markets were  down  slightly on balance.

The price of gold fell  another $15 to below  $260 per troy  ounce  on higher interest  rates  and  expectation  of future  sales by the official  sector.

The Desk did not intervene  during the intermeeting period.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent  economic  developments  in the  major foreign  industrial  countries  suggest that activity  has picked  up somewhat.

In Japan,  real  GDP rose a surprising  7.9 percent annual  rate (seasonally adjusted)  in  the first quarter,  but the  extent to which  this number represents  a shift  toward sustained  improvement  is unclear. Other indicators of activity  show smaller  increases,  and unemployment  has risen to record  levels.  Most  of the expansion  in GDP was  associated with fiscal  stimulus and unexpected,  and possibly  transitory,  increases  in private  expenditure.

Euro-area  activity has picked up moderately, with  Germany's better performance partly offset  by weaker performance  in France and Italy. Industrial production  moved up 0.6 percent in the  euro area in March  and 0.7 percent in Germany in April.  Forward-looking  indicators for the euro  area suggest continued recovery in industrial  output but are  less positive for household spending. Industrial  confidence  has risen from recent lows,  but consumer confidence  edged  down further in May  from earlier historic highs.

In the  United Kingdom, preliminary  indicators  suggest that the pace  of economic activity increased  in the second  quarter, after  a flat first quarter. Data on industrial  production, employment,  retail  sales, and business confidence  point to modest expansion  in the second quarter.  Canadian  GDP rose  at an  annual rate  of 4.2  percent  in the first  quarter, but recent  indicators  suggest  a modest  slowing of growth in the second quarter.

Inflationary  essures  emain  subdued  in  the oreign  ndustrial  untries. pr r f i co In Japan, onsumer  prices  n  May  were 0.6 ercent  elow  year-earlier els. c i p b lev Consumer price nflation    the  euro  area dged  up  to  1.1  percent  n  April. n i in e i I the  United ingdom, retail ice nflation    May  fell  o .1  percent  rom  a  year K pr i in t 2 f earlier,  low  the  Bank of ngland's  .5  percent  arget.  anadian  CPI  inflation be E 2 t C moved higher,  ut  consumer  prices  n  May  were only  1.6  percent  igher han b i h t a year arlier. e
