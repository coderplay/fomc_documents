Key Background Factors

In  light  f he ubdued  wage numbers  published  n  the  past ouple f eeks, o t s i c o w fewer  financial rket  participants  e ow guessing hat  he ightening as ma ar n t t t bi announced  after  he  last  OMC t F meeting  will e  translated  to    hike n  the b in a i federal  unds  rate ext eek. Nonetheless,  ost  anticipate  at  ome firming  n f n w m th s i policy ill ccur  over  the  next ear  or  so, nd  we have  once  again ssumed  a w o y a a moderate  rise  n  the unds ate  n  our aseline  orecast. i f r i b f

Elsewhere  in  the redit  arkets,  ond  yields  ave  been  running igher f ate c m b h h o l than  we anticipated    the  last  reenbook,  and  we have  raised  he ath n he in G t p i t forecast  omewhat--to   degree,    natural  djunct  o he  faster owth  of s a a a t t gr productivity, ch  tends o  raise  he quilibrium al ate f  interest.    do see whi t t e re r o We the  potential r   decline  n  corporate  ond  yields  nd  mortgage  rates  s  end-offo a i b a a millennium iquidity  essures  isappear, t e are  anticipating t  ates  ill l pr d bu w tha r w move back  up  before ong.

Equity rices,  ike  ond  yields, ve  been  volatile    recent  eeks. On net, p l b ha in w however,  with  corporate  arnings  osting    large ear-on-year in,  he tock e p a y ga t s market  bulls  ave  had  the pper  hand.

Turning  to  the xternal  ector, coming  readings  n  foreign  ctivity  ain ave e s in o a ag h shown more strength  han  expected. ecoveries  n  Canada and  many European t R i countries  ave  quickened urther,  d  Japan  continues  o  surprise   the pside. h f an t to u As a  result,  reign  conomic  growth  over  the econd  half  f his  ear s ikely  o fo e s o t y i l t about  match the  first-half  e.

In T to b addition, though  rowth  in  emerging  economies  has  rebounded  impressively al g this ear,  he ecoveries  tarted om  very  low  levels, d those ountries-y t r s fr an c especially ose n  Asia--appear likely  o  repeat  his  erformance n  the ext th i un t t p i n couple  of ears.  All  told,  e see  foreign  DP  growth  slowing  a  bit,   an  annual y w G to pace  of round  3-1/2 ercent  n  2000  and 2001. With  the  large nd  growing a p i a U.S.  current  ccount eficit ighing  on  the ollar,   are  anticipating  teady a d we d we a  s depreciation er  the rojection riod--about  percent  er  year  for he ov p pe 2 p t inflation-adjusted  ue  against    broad  range f urrencies. val a o c

Indeed,  ith  current  rices  eaving  mple  scope  for d w p l a production  o  increase  hroughout  he orld, e believe  hat  rices  ill rend t t t w w t p w t downward.

The strengthening  he  yen, hich  extended   runup  begun  at he  middle  of his oft w a t t year,  resumably  owed to vidence f ontinued  ecovery n  Japan, s  well  as  to p e o c r i a upward revisions   the  anticipated panese iscal  ackage.  These  developments to Ja f p underpinned   moderate  increase  n  long-term  ond  yields  nd  a  substantial  se a i b a ri in  equity  rices.  otwithstanding ncerns vinced y  Japanese uthorities  at p N co e b a th the  strength  f he urrency ight  undercut he  recovery,  he ank of apan  did o t c m t t B J not  intervene  n  foreign  xchange arkets o  weaken the en. i e m t y

The rise in the dollar  since the October FOMC meeting  against the euro  and sterling  occurred  despite  a tightening  of European monetary  policy in response  to indications of a strong revival  of economic  activity. On November 4, the European  Central  Bank increased its refinancing  rate  50 basis  points, to  3 percent, and the Bank of England raised its repurchase  rate  25 basis points, to 5-1/2 percent. Even though  expectations  of the rate  hikes  solidified in the  weeks leading  up to these  actions,  ten-year bond  yields  in the euro  area and the United Kingdom declined  significantly,  rolling back a portion of their rise over the prior half year.  These declines  in bond yields may have reflected improved  prospects for price  stability or reduced uncertainties  about  monetary  policy going forward. Along with the strength  of the  economic  recovery, these declines  likely contributed to a runup in major European  equity  indexes since  the October FOMC meeting.

In Latin America,  equity prices  rose substantially  in Mexico  and Brazil and somewhat less in Argentina.  In Brazil, the real came under pressure  early in the period, partially  in response  to a  supreme  court ruling overturning  a tax on government pension benefits.  It recovered  after the central  bank announced measures to support  the currency,  including  an  agreement  with  the IMF allowing it more room to  intervene in  the foreign  exchange market.  The victory  of the opposition candidate  in  Argentina's presidential elections had been widely anticipated  and  generated little market reaction. The victory in Mexico's rulingparty primary of the  candidate  most closely  associated  with the current administration also proved uneventful.  Despite continued  debt-servicing problems in Ecuador, Brady bond spreads narrowed for most Latin American issuers,  partly because of several  exchanges  that  took many  of these bonds  off the market.

Emerging  Asian financial markets generally  remained stable  in the absence of much significant news.  However, the Indonesian  rupiah surged  12 percent with the election of a new government, which reduced  political uncertainties. The Korean  won and  Thai baht both appreciated moderately. Share prices rose in most emerging  Asian markets, with  double-digit  increases for the period being registered in both Indonesia  and Korea.

. The Desk did not intervene  during  the period for the  accounts of the System  or the Treasury.

Economic  activity  abroad. In  the euro  zone, sizable increases  in industrial production in July and August, strong  third-quarter growth  in new orders for manufactures  in Germany,  and  widespread  improvements  in recent indexes of consumer and business sentiment suggest that a firming of growth has taken  hold
