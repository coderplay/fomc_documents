The Household  and Payroll  easures  of mployment M E

Each month,  the  Bureau  of  abor  Statistics S) publishes o independent  stimates L (BL tw e of  employment. The  payroll  mployment  measure  is  based n  a  survey f e o o establishments nducted  as  part f he urrent mployment Statistics  ogram, nd  the co o t C E pr a household easure  of mployment is ased  on a  survey f ouseholds alled  he m e b o h c t Current opulation  urvey.  The  payroll  urvey stimates  he umber of mployees  on P S s e t n e nonfarm  payrolls  ased n a  sample  of bout 00,000  establishments  at  ccount or b o a 4 th a f about ne-third  f otal  onfarm  payroll  mployment. Each year,  he ayroll o o t n e t p employment estimates  re  benchmarked  to  a  near-universe unt f ayroll a co o p employment that s aken  in arch of he  previous  ear  from  unemployment insurance i t M t y tax  records  nd  other dministrative  ta. n  contrast,  e ousehold urvey stimates a a da I th h s e the  number of ersons ith  a  job y  interviewing proximately  0,000  households. p w b ap 6 The  household  survey igures  re  inflated   monthly  estimates  f he opulation  o f a by o t p t generate stimates  f ational  mployment and  unemployment. Although  the aw e o n e r household  survey ata re  not  revised, e opulation  stimates ed  to nflate em  are d a th p e us i th occasionally dated o  incorporate w information  rom  decennial  ensuses nd  new up t ne f c a estimates  f mmigration. o i

The two  measures  differ  mportantly   concept. irst, e ayroll  urvey allies  bs, i in F th p s t jo whereas  the ousehold urvey ounts he  number of ndividuals  th  a  job. hus,  a h s c t i wi T person  who holds  multiple  obs t  different tablishments  uld appear ore than j a es wo m once  in  the ayroll  urvey ut nly  once  in  the ousehold urvey. n  addition  o p s b o h s I t covering  age and  salary  orkers  on  nonfarm  payrolls, e ousehold urvey's  easure w w th h s m of  employment includes  nincorporated lf-employed  ndividuals, kers  in  private u se i wor households,  npaid  family orkers, orkers  on  unpaid  absences,  nd  farm  employees, u w w a all f hom  are  excluded rom  the ayroll  ecords  f onfarm  establishments.   the o w f p r o n At same time, he ayroll  urvey ncludes  age and  salary  orkers nder  the ge  of 6; t p s i w w u a 1 these orkers  are  excluded rom  the ousehold urvey. w f h s

The  BLS  has  made major  changes  to oth  employment surveys  ver  the ast ecade. b o p d Over  the  past  everal  ears,  he ayroll  urvey ethodology  has  shifted  rom  an s y t p s m f archaic,  uota-sampling  rocedure o  a  probability  mple  of stablishments.    1994,  a q p t sa e In major  redesign  f he ousehold urvey  sharpened he  clarity  ts  uestions  nd o t h s t ofi q a improved  the  interviewing chniques  sed  in he urvey.  In  addition, e ousehold te u t s th h survey  adopted  the orth  American Industrial  assification tem  (NAICS) for ts N Cl Sys i industrial  d occupational assifications  anuary 003;  the  payroll  urvey stimates an cl in  J 2 s e were converted  o  NAICS  in  June  2003. How  such  changes  may have  altered  he t t comparability  he  two measures  of mployment or  their  yclical aracteristics  ot oft e c ch is  n known.

Reconciling  he evels t L of  the wo  Employment  Measures T

Each month,  the oard's  taff justs  ousehold mployment to  the  concept nderlying B s ad h e u the  payroll  urvey nsofar  s  the vailable ta  allow table).   also ncorporate s i a a da ( We i estimates  f he  updates  o  the opulation  ontrols er he istorical  riod o  which o t t p c ov t h pe t

they pply.Â¹  lthough  these djustments,   net,  educe he evel  f ousehold a A a on r t l o h employment and  narrow  the  discrepancy  n  the evels  f he eported  eries, e i l o t r s th difference  emains arge chart  ). r l ( 1

Over  time, he iscrepancy  etween  the  adjusted  ousehold easure  and  the ayroll t d b h m p measure  has  had  two  components: ne  secular  nd one  cyclical. e secular  omponent o a Th c has  tended o  expand  as  monthly  household stimates ogressively tend eyond  the t e pr ex b most  recent  pdate o  Census  population  ontrols.  ndeed,  efore he ncorporation  n u t c I b t i (i January 003)  of he ew controls  or he 000 decennial  ensus  and  the  annual  update 2 t n f t 2 C to  the opulation  stimates  or mmigration, e  average onthly iscrepancy  as p e f i th m d w around  4.1  million.  he  updates o he  population  stimates  liminated out T t t e e ab 60  percent  f hat  ap. o t g

Regarding  cyclical havior,  he ayroll  eries  as  historically  n  more pro-cyclical be t p s h bee than  the  adjusted  ousehold eries.   the ast,  he  inability   he ayroll  urvey o h s In p t oft p s t adequately  apture  irths d deaths f stablishments    they ccurred ontributed c b an o e as o c to its  yclical  attern  uring he eriods  etween  annual enchmarks.  But  even  after c p d t p b b benchmarking,  t emained  more pro-cyclical  an  the ousehold easure, nd i r th h m a researchers ve  not een  fully  ble o  explain  hy this  s o.  Among  the ossible ha b a t w i s p explanations   an  increase  uring eriods  f eak labor arkets n  work "off  he is d p o w m i t books"  of stablishments,  ich  might  cushion he eported  ecline  n  household e wh t r d i employment  relative   the  payroll  easure.  Another  contributing  ctor  ay be  related to m fa m to  the rocedures  or ealing  ith  persons ho do  not espond o  the  household urvey p f d w w r t s either  ecause hey  refuse  o  participate   ecause he  interviewers nnot each hem. b t t orb t ca r t Those  procedures  ssume that  he  labor orce  haracteristics  he  nonrespondents  re a t f c of  t a the  same as  those or ersons n  a similar  emographic  group  who are  interviewed.  f f p i d I those issed  tend  to  be  marginal orkers  who are  less  ikely  o  be  employed  during m w l t weak labor arkets  and  more likely  o  hold obs hen employment  is  expanding, he m t j w t procedures  ould dampen the  cyclicality   ousehold mployment. Finally,  e w ofh e th expanded  use  of ultiweek  pay  periods  ay result  n orkers  appearing n  the  payrolls m m i w o of ore than  one  establishment,  d  thus s  employed  more  than nce  in  the ayroll m an a o p survey- particularly n hiring  s obust  nd  workers  are  changing obs ore often. whe i r a j m Such  job  changers ould  be  counted s  employed  at nly  one  job n  the ousehold w a o i h survey,  hich  measures  labor orce ctivity  ring   single  eference  eek during he w f a du a r w t month.

Another  unresolved  ssue  n  reconciling e wo employment  measures  is n  apparent i i th t a break  in  the evel f he ap between  the wo  series.  hat  break eems  to  coincide  ith l o t g t T s w the  introduction   he ew household  survey  n  1994. Before  1994,  the iscrepancy oft n i d between  the djusted  ousehold eries  nd  the ayroll  eries  ended o  fluctuate dely a h s a p s t t wi but  averaged  close o  zero; ince hen, he ap, hile  still emingly yclical,  s  been t s t t g w se c ha persistently  gative-that  he  level f he  adjusted  ousehold eries  as  been  below ne is,t o t h s h that  f he  payroll  eries. o t s

Differences  n  Employment  Changes Indicated  y the wo  Measures i b T

More recently, tention  s  focused ot  on  the  levels  f he wo  measures  but n  their at ha n o t t o divergent  ignals  f he hange s o t c in employment.  For  example, etween  the  most  recent b recession  rough November 2001) and  September  2003,  the ayroll  urvey  showed a t ( p s decline  f oughly   million bs,  hile  the fficial  usehold urvey ndicated  rise  f o r 1 jo w o ho s i a o 1 million;  he ncrease  n  our  adjusted  ousehold eries  as  even  larger--1-1/4  lion. t i i h s w mil 2 That  said,  he abor arket  by  either asure  has een  very  weak during he  past t l m me b t twenty-two onths-with  mployment even  somewhat weaker  than  during he m e t recovery rom  the  1990-91  recession d  much weaker  than n  earlier onomic f an i ec expansions chart  ). ( 2

Two upcoming revisions   the  series  re  likely   change  those stimates, d  whether to a to e an they ill,  n  net,  arrow  the ifference tween  the  two  is  unclear.  irst, e LS w o n d be F th B recently  eported  hat ts  reliminary bulations   mployment from  first-quarter r t i p ta ofe unemployment insurance  ax  records  mply  a  downward  revision  f pproximately t i o a 145,000  in  the evel f  ayroll  mployment  for arch 2003;  those evisions e l o p e M r ar scheduled or elease  ith  the reliminary  stimates  or anuary 004.  Taken alone, f r w p e f J 2 that  hange  would  increase  he iscrepancy  etween  the hanges  indicated  y  the wo c t d b c b t employment measures.  However,  at he  same  time, he ousehold urvey igures  ill t t h s f w be  adjusted  o ew population  ontrols  hat  ncorporate formation  n immigration  n t n c t i in o i the  period ince 000. Because  we believe  hat  mmigration  as  slowed  recently, s 2 t i h we anticipate at  he pcoming adjustment  ay lower  the stimate f  he opulation  nd th t u m e o t p a of  its  uture  ate f hange  and, hus,  esult  n   lower eported  evel  f ousehold f r o c t r i a r l o h employment. The magnitude  of his  hange  is  uncertain,  t ssuming  that t  oes  in t c bu a i g the  direction at  e anticipate,    lso ould  tend  to  reduce he ecent  ncrease  n th w it a w t r i i household  employment over  the eriod ince he ecession  rough. p s t r t

The Two  Surveys as  Economic  Indicators

Each of  the wo  surveys as  strengths d  weaknesses  as  an  indicator  conomic t h an ofe activity. e  principal vantage f he  household urvey s hat  t  rovides    broader Th ad o t s i t i p a view  of mployment  than  does  the ayroll  urvey. owever,  measurement  of any of e p s H m the  components  of ousehold urvey mployment that  re  missing rom  the ayroll h s e a f p concept  may be  subject  o  greater nsampling eporting ror  han he  components  that t no r er t t the  two surveys ave  in  common.  In  addition,  like he ayroll  stimates, e onthly h un t p e th m estimates  rom  the  household urvey re  not evised,  nd  the ampling ariation  he f s a r a s v oft household  survey s  noticeable. e  approximate tandard  rror  or he onth-toi Th s e f t m month change  in  household mployment is  177,000.Â³  y comparison,  efore ts  ecent e B b i r major  redesign,  e  root ean squared rror  f he  month-to-month hange  in  payroll th m e o t c employment was about  65,000.  Finally,    noted arlier,  e ousehold urvey as e th h s

questionnaire  s  redesigned  n  1994. Although  researchers ve  developed   good wa i ha a understanding  f ow to  bridge he ld  and  new series,   do  not  know to  what  extent o h t o we the  cyclical  roperties  he  household easures  of abor  arket  activity y have p oft m l m ma changed.

On balance,  he oard's  taff s  found  the ayroll  urvey o  be  the ore reliable t B s ha p s t m indicator  urrent  conomic  activity,  though  t lso as  a  number of isadvantages ofc e al i a h d as  a  current  ndicator. r  example, he  monthly evisions   the reliminary timates i Fo t r to p es of  payroll  mployment  have  tended o  be  pro-cyclical.  d,  as  noted arlier,  fore  he e t An e be t recent  edesign  f he  sample, reliminary yroll  urvey stimates  ere  subject  o r o t p pa s e w t large  nd  systematic  enchmark  revisions. fore  the hangeover o  the ew sample, a b Be c t n benchmark  revisions   payroll  mployment were  generally  ositively  rrelated th to e p co wi both  the hange  in  payroll  mployment and  with  whether t as accelerating c e i w or decelerating.  ey also ended o  be  positively  rially  rrelated. us,  the  upcoming Th t t se co Th March 2003 adjustment  f  -145,000 s  not  necessarily  rprising  cause ayroll o i su be p employment was declining,    balance,  ver  the  period  rom  March 2002  to  March on o f 2003. 4 The recent  tatistical  rovements  in  the ayroll  urvey ere,  in art,  ntended s imp p s w p i to  improve  its  bility   estimate  mployment  between  benchmarks; hether  the a to e w redesign  ill,  ver  time,  lter  hese  arlier stematic  atterns  nclear. w o a t e sy p isu
