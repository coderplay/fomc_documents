Supply-side indicators of GDP for the fourth quarter provide evidence of  continued robust growth as employment and industrial output recorded hefty increases. Spending indicators also point to above-trend growth, but not nearly so strong as those on  the supply side. Household outlays decelerated and the saving rate ticked up late last year despite continued high confidence levels. At  the same time, growth in real business fixed investment came to a  halt after its remarkable surge in  the second and third quarters. A tightening of  the labor market has caused nominal wages to accelerate somewhat over the past year, but prices decelerated, restrained by  falling import and  energy prices.

Labor Market Developments

Labor demand expanded rapidly in  the fourth quarter. Growth of nonfarm payroll employment averaged 358,000 per month--and the average workweek of production or  nonsupervisory workers ticked up. The  unemployment rate fell further, to an average of 4.7 percent-the lowest in  more than twenty-five years.

The robust pace of  hiring late last year reflected gains across all major industries. Notably, manufacturing added 125,000 jobs during the fourth quarter, bringing total growth for the  year to 230,000; construction added 88,000 jobs, almost half of  its net gain for the year. Employment in retail trade surged, and despite anecdotes of  hiring difficulties, general merchandise and apparel outlets added almost 40,000 jobs between September and December, a much larger gain than in  earlier quarters. The strong demand for retail workers also was reported to  have contributed to a pickup in hiring in  the help supply industry, which had shown uncharacteristically weak performance earlier in  the year. The weakness in  help supply had been attributed in  part to  a  lack of qualified and available workers (perhaps for more technical jobs than seasonal retailing) rather than slackening demand. Other service industries also saw significant increases in  hiring during the fourth quarter: Jobs in engineering and management, computer, and health services all rose faster than their 1997 averages.

of  aggregate hours last quarter. 1 Smoothing through these wiggles and including BLS estimates for other wage and salary employees, hours for all employees rose 4.4 percent (annual rate) in the fourth quarter. However, because hours of self-employed and unpaid family workers fell at  a  3.2 percent rate, we estimate that hours of  all persons in  the nonfarm business sector--the series used to  estimate labor productivity--rose about 3-1/2 percent (annual rate). Given our expectation for growth of  nonfarm business output, productivity appears to  have risen at close to its trend rate of 1-1/4 percent last quarter, after two quarters of rapid increases.

The  household survey also portrayed a  robust labor market at year-end. Household employment growth averaged 339,000 per month last quarter, and the labor force participation rate rose to 67.2 percent in  December. Although the overall participation rate changed little on  net over 1997, the participation rate for adult women moved up 0.3 percentage point during the year. More than half of  this increase came from a  further rise in  participation among women maintaining families; about 60 percent of  these women have children under 18, making them an  obvious group to be  affected by welfare reform. However, the participation rate for these women has been rising fairly steadily throughout the current expansion, which makes it  difficult to separate the effect of  the recent welfare reforms from a  cyclical response. The fraction of the population not in  the labor force but wanting jobs continued to  drop last quarter, suggesting limited room for further increases in  overall participation rates.

Other indicators also point to  a  tight labor market. The fourweek  moving average of  state initial claims for unemployment insurance, at  329,000, has held at  a  level consistent with relatively strong growth of payroll employment. Surveys of businesses conducted by  the  National Federation of Independent Business and the Bureau of  National Affairs showed that the

- 1.  The BLS recently confirmed that the workweek data are sensitive to the number of days in  the monthly pay period because of inconsistent reporting by respondents. This problem artificially boosts the change in  the workweek when moving from months with more working days to months with fewer (such as  from October to  November) and causes a  subsequent drop in  the workweek when the situation is reversed (such as between November and December). The BLS has indicated that the  net effect of  this bias on  the average workweek in  the fourth quarter was probably negligible. The agency has embarked on  a  program to identify establishments that have been reporting incorrectly and expects to publish more consistent data at the time of its annual benchmark in June.

proportion of  companies reporting jobs difficult to fill remained at very high levels at year-end. In  addition, smoothing through the monthly gyrations, the  Michigan SRC and Conference Board surveys of households continue to  point to  very favorable perceptions of  labor market conditions early in 1998.

Industrial Production

Total industrial production rose 7-1/2 percent at an  annual rate in  the fourth quarter, with  manufacturing output soaring 8-1/4 percent, the fastest growth rate since the fourth quarter of 1994. Production of  durable goods continued to advance briskly, particularly in  industries producing motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, and information technology goods. However, growth in  the production of computing and office equipment slowed to about a  20 percent annual rate in  the fourth quarter from the thirdquarter's blistering 50 percent increase. Output in  nondurable goods production picked up  in  the fourth quarter after having been sluggish earlier in  the year; the advance was led by  gains in food, printing and publishing, and chemical products.

The operating rate in  manufacturing reached 82.5 percent in December, but was just a  bit  above its historical average and 1.8 percentage points below its most recent peak in January 1995. Anecdotal reports suggest few  bottlenecks and continued rapid capacity growth. 2

Production of  motor vehicles and parts advanced almost 19 percent (annual rate) in  the fourth quarter as  automakers made up output lost to strikes and start-up problems in  the  third quarter. Production in  December fell from November's high level, and industry schedules call for a  further decrease in  motor vehicle assemblies in the first quarter. At the end of  December, the days' supply of light trucks and autos were at  comfortable levels.

Note. Components may  not sum to  totals because of rounding. Days' supply estimates use sales figures adjusted for shifts in  reporting periods.

Several other factors also suggest that growth in  industrial production is likely to  moderate in  the first quarter. The staff's estimate of  real adjusted durable goods orders was little changed in the fourth quarter, after having increased 4.4 percent in  the third quarter. In December, the new orders index from the National Association of  Purchasing Managers (NAPM)  fell to  its lowest level in  more than a year. In  contrast, the monthly new  orders index by Dun and  Bradstreet remained more optimistic. 3

Signs of  slowing export demand have begun to appear. The NAPM index of  new  export orders fell in  December to  its lowest level since January 1996. Also, anecdotal reports, including the Beige Book, suggest that some manufacturers are seeing weaker demand from Asia, although the dimensions of that  weakening, to date, remain unclear. Export demand has been an important contributor to the strength in  output over the past two years; as shown in  the accompanying chart, we  estimate that the growth in exports from  the first quarter of 1996 through the third quarter of 1997 contributed 6.2 percentage points to  the 12.6 percent rise in  durable manufacturing production over that period. 4 Export growth was a less important source of growth in  nondurable manufacturing.

Consumption and Personal Income

Growth in consumer outlays moderated in  the fourth quarter after having surged more than 5-1/2 percent at an  annual rate in the third quarter. Nevertheless, circumstances seem favorable for sizable spending gains in  the near term: Real disposable income growth has been ample in recent months; consumer sentiment remains decidedly upbeat; and households have enjoyed a  stunning increase in net worth.

According to the Census Bureau's advance report, total nominal retail sales increased 0.7 percent in  December and 0.2 percent in the fourth quarter (not at  annual rate). Spending in  the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 0.2 percent in  December and 0.4 percent in  the quarter as  a  whole (not  at an  annual rate).

Nominal outlays at outlets for durable goods within the retail control category--furniture and appliance stores and stores selling "other durable goods"--posted strong gains in  December, and these stores recorded strong sales fairly consistently throughout the fourth quarter. However, at stores selling nondurable goods, sales edged down in  December and were unchanged in  the fourth quarter.

The retail sales report suggests that real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for goods excluding motor vehicles rose 0.4 percent in December and 1.1 percent at an  annual rate in  the fourth quarter. Building in  a  small anticipated decline in real motor vehicle purchases, we  estimate that real PCE for all goods likely increased about 3/4 percent at  an annual rate in the fourth quarter.

Real expenditures for services rose 0.6 percent in October and 0.2 percent in  November. In  November, real outlays for energy services (natural gas and electricity) were little changed, while brokerage and investment services were pushed sharply lower by  a drop in  trading volume. Looking to  December, temperatures were about average for the month, suggesting only a  small rise in energy services. However, trading volume on  major U.S. exchanges rose about 4  percent, which should boost real outlays for financial services.

The personal saving rate averaged 3.9 percent over October and November, after having dropped to 3.5 percent in  the third quarter.

In  November, real disposable income rose a  hefty 0.6 percent, led by a  rapid increase in  wages and salaries. Although December's labor market report suggests a much smaller increase in  labor income for that month, earlier strong gains should be  enough to generate a solid increase in real labor income in  the fourth quarter. Looking ahead, a  factor that may provide some additional impetus to consumption growth is  the current wave of  mortgage refinancing. However, because prevailing mortgage rates are not so far  below those on  the outstanding stock of  loans as  was the case in  the last wave, the effects on spending could be  relatively small.

Consumer sentiment has remained at  highly favorable levels. After having declined in December, the Michigan SRC index of consumer sentiment rose in  early January to  the middle of the reasonably high range that has prevailed since early last year. Households' appraisals of current conditions were little changed in January, but appraisals of  expected conditions rebounded because of more positive expectations for their personal finances and future business conditions.

The  SRC reported that one respondent in ten  mentioned concern about Asian economic problems in January and that these households were more likely to expect the unemployment rate to rise. Nevertheless, the index of expected unemployment change moved down bit in  January following a  sharp rise in  December.

The  Conference Board index of consumer confidence fell back in January after climbing to its highest level since early 1969 in December. Households in  this survey were less upbeat about expected business conditions, income, and employment: however their perception that job opportunities are currently abundent kept their assessment of the present situation extraordinarily positive.

Motor Vehicles

Reported sales of  new light vehicles in  December jumped 1 million units, to 16.1 million units at an  annual rate, in  large part because many automakers extended their reporting period into early January. Adjusted for shifts in  reporting periods, we estimate that sales increased about 1 percent, to 15.3 million units. Correcting for reporting-period effects, most of  the increase was  the result of  a  spurt in  sales at Toyota, which reflected the company's successful effort to ensure that Camry would achieve the title of  top-selling car in 1997. At  this point, we expect companies to  close their books at the end of this month, and,

with the shortened reporting period for January, reported sales for the  month should fall sharply.

In  the past, the extension of  the reporting period would boost BEA's estimate of PCE and PDE spending for motor vehicles and be mostly offset by  a  lower estimate of  inventories. The effect on GDP would reflect only the differences between the  wholesale and retail margins. BEA, however, has decided to exclude an estimated effect of  automakers' changes in  reporting periods. Thus, the NIPA estimates for motor vehicle purchases in  the fourth quarter should not be  distorted by  the extended reporting period.

Overall, sales of light vehicles in 1997 were 15.1 million units, little changed from the pace seen in  the previous several years. However, this pace was maintained, in  part, by  a considerable drop in the relative price of  motor vehicles. During the past year, the CPI for new  cars and new  trucks fell 1.0 and 0.1 percent, respectively, while the  core CPI rose 2.2 percent. The industry's standard rule-of-thumb of  a  (negative) unitary elasticity of  demand would imply that sales of  light motor vehicles were 400,000 units higher in 1997 than they would have been if  motor vehicle prices had moved in  tandem with core CPI. (The  unitary elasticity is in  the middle of the range of published econometric estimates of  minus 1/3 to  minus 1-1/2.)

In  the near term, the industry's strategy appears to be  to continue pricing to keep sales in the 15-million-plus bracket. Their plans for incentives in the first quarter remain in  the relatively high range that we  have seen over the past several years. In turn, attractive pricing has helped sustain upbeat consumer attitudes toward buying conditions for cars. The preliminary January results from the Michigan SRC survey indicate that buying attitudes remain in  the elevated range seen over the last several years.

Housing Markets

The  housing sector has  remained buoyant in recent months, fueled by  sharp declines in  fixed mortgage rates during the second half of last year and  by  further sizable gains in employment and personal income. To  be sure, single-family starts were at a surprisingly weak 1.09 million unit annual rate in  December, down 6  percent from the robust November pace and noticeably below the average reading for the year. However, adjusted permits for these units, which provide a  better short-run indication of  the underlying

trend, edged up 1/2 percent in  December to a  level a  touch above the 1997 average.

Other indicators of  housing demand strengthened at  year-end. Existing home sales were at  a  4.29 million unit annual rate in December; in  the fourth quarter as a whole, these sales averaged 4.35 million units, up 2  percent from the third-quarter pace. New home sales rose to  an  830,000 unit annual rate in  November, the highest monthly pace in  more than ten  years. Builders' ratings of new  home sales, which have been  trending up since last winter, rose a bit further in  January. In  addition, according to the preliminary reading from the  Michigan SRC survey, consumers' assessments of homebuying conditions, which rebounded in  January, have been quite positive, on  net, since early last fall. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes rose to a new  monthly high in  December, and the average reading through January 23 was up  13 percent from the December level. 7

Multifamily starts jumped to a 427,000 unit annual rate in December--the highest since early 1990. This followed relatively high levels of starts in  both October and November. For the fourth quarter as  a  whole, multifamily starts averaged 401,000 units, up 26 percent from  the pace seen earlier last year. Permits for these units also moved up in the fourth quarter, but not nearly so much  as starts, suggesting that starts will drop back in  the next few months.

Some tightening may be  occurring in  the multifamily market; Real rents have trended up during the past year, and the vacancy rate for rental units has edged lower, on  net, since late 1995. Nevertheless, industry contacts think that the ready availability of financing may  be  spurring developers to undertake excessive construction.

Business Fixed Investment

Real outlays for producers' durable equipment and for nonresidential structures appeared to stall in the fourth quarter,

By  contrast, existing home sales are recorded at closing, which usually is a month or two after the time that a  mortgage application is submitted. As a  result, mortgage applications for home purchase show a  strong contemporaneous correlation with new home sales, and they tend to lead existing home sales by  an  average of  about a  month and a  half.

after having expanded at  a heady pace earlier in the year. Nonetheless, the economic environment remains supportive for business investment: Business output has accelerated over the past two years, corporate cash flow is healthy, and the real user cost of capital remains low.

Led by  higher shipments of  office and computing equipment, shipments of  nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 3-1/4 percent in  December. This rapid growth was not enough to offset the sizable declines in  shipments registered in  October and November, and for the fourth quarter as a  whole shipments fell 8 0.3 percent.

Nominal shipments of  office and computing equipment subsided in the fourth quarter despite a  large increase in  December, which returned the level of  shipments close to its trend level. After factoring in  the declining prices in this sector, real office and computing expenditures likely decelerated sharply in  the fourth quarter, rising perhaps 10 percent. Shipments of communications equipment fell in  the fourth quarter, despite a  strong performance in December, and real outlays probably posted a  slight decline last quarter.

In  the transportation area, sales of  medium and heavy trucks remained an area of strength; sales were about 450,000 units (annual rate) last quarter, noticeably above the already high reading in  the third quarter. In  addition, net new  orders of  heavy trucks rose to the highest level in  more than  three years. However, real business expenditures on  aircraft appear to  have declined in  the fourth quarter. Although deliveries by  domestic manufacturers rose, net exports of aircraft are expected to  more than account for the increase.

Outside of the information technology and transportation sectors, nominal shipments of  capital goods rose 1.1 percent in December after having declined, on  balance, over the preceding two

months. New  orders in  this category dropped about 1.7 percent in December, largely erasing the backlog of  unfilled orders.

Although real estate prices are up and vacancy rates are down, the available indicators suggest that real spending on nonresidential structures declined in  the fourth quarter. Initial estimates indicate that construction put in  place for nonresidential buildings fell 3.8 percent in  November. However, this decline comes on  the heels of  an  upward-revised 1.1 percent gain in  October. 9 The pace of  construction contracts has also eased over the past six months; the weak readings in  this sector are surprising given the favorable financing environment and improved market conditions. Business Inventories

Over the first two  months of  the fourth quarter, businesses outside of  the  motor vehicle sector accumulated inventories at an average pace of  around $45 billion (annual rate) on  a  book-value basis, up from a $37 billion rate in  the third quarter.

Manufacturers' inventories accumulated at a  relatively rapid pace in both October and November. Stock-building in October was boosted by a $16 billion accumulation of  inventories of aircraft and parts, a development that was most likely a  result of  the production and delivery disruptions at  Boeing.10 Inventories at chemical manufacturers posted large increases in  both months that may  have been related to rail transportation problems. With shipments declining, the inventory-shipments ratio for manufacturing increased in  November but remained within the narrow range of  the past year.

In  wholesale trade, stocks continued to  build, and the inventory-sales ratio has  maintained the upward trend evident over the past year; by November, the ratio had reversed the 1996 decline. This V-shaped pattern was widespread but was especially evident in furniture, lumber, apparel, and farm products. Excluding motor vehicles, wholesale stocks rose at a $6 billion annual rate in October and at  a $29 billion rate in  November. The accumulation of

stocks of  farm products was particularly strong in  October when the harvest was speeding along at a  faster-than-usual pace. Wholesale inventories of groceries also surged. In  the retail sector, the sluggish growth in sales in  October and November did not lead to a backup in  inventories. Indeed, retail inventories fell at a $5 billion annual rate in  October and were little changed in November. The inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers remained close to its twelve-month low.

Federal Government

Favorable numbers in  the last two months of 1997 left the federal budget for the calendar year in  deficit by  just $2 billion. After adjusting for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, the deficit was $19 billion in  calendar 1997, $108 billion lower than a  year earlier.

Outlays grew moderately in  the fourth quarter and for the year were only 2.3 percent above the 1996 level. Defense expenditures edged down further, spending growth for health programs continued to moderate, and debt service payments flattened. Declines in  the number of  food stamp recipients, unemployment insurance beneficiaries, and welfare cases led to a  leveling-off of income security payments.11 Receipts continued to grow more rapidly than nominal income; fourth-quarter receipts were 12 percent above a  year earlier. December receipts included the last of  the four payments by  corporations on  their estimated 1997 income tax liabilities; these payments were 13 percent above a year earlier. The last of the four quarterly payments by  individuals on  their estimated 1997 income and social insurance tax liabilities were due on  January 15. Daily data indicate that these payments were well above the yearearlier level.

The Congressional Budget Office released its "Economic and Budget Outlook for Fiscal Years 1999-2008." The CBO now  projects an essentially balanced federal budget over the next ten years if current policies remain unchanged.

These budget projections are more favorable than those released in September, with deficits about $50 billion smaller than forecasted at that time. About half of the near-term improvement stems from more upbeat economic assumptions; changes in  the longerterm economic outlook had a  negligible effect on  the deficit

projections. Instead, most of the improvement over the longer run reflects downward revisions to the growth in  outlays because the unexpectedly slow growth in  Medicaid and other mandatory programs in recent years is expected to  be  more persistent. In  addition, the CBO  boosted its estimate of  income tax receipts, under an  assumption that the forces behind the recent surge will fade more slowly than previously projected. By  fiscal 2007, outlays in  the CBO forecast drop to  just 18.3 percent of  GDP, well below the norm for the past thirty years, largely as a  result of  a  continuing decline in discretionary spending as a  share of  GDP. Similarly, revenues are projected to  remain high relative to  GDP, although the share does fall between 1998 and 2003, in  part because of  the phase-in of last year's tax cuts.

State and Local Government

Available data suggest that spending on  consumption and investment by  state and local governments grew at  a  moderate pace in the fourth quarter. Employment edged up in the fourth quarter, suggesting a  moderate gain in real consumption. (Compensation accounts for 60 percent of  the state and local sector's contribution to GDP.) Among investment items, real construction outlays, which account for most of  the sector's investment spending, rebounded somewhat in  October after trending down from its record last February. Despite a backward slide in  November, the average for the two months stands well above that for the third quarter. In particular, highway construction jumped to  an  unusually high level in  November.

With growth in  total consumption plus investment spending less than GDP growth in recent years, and revenue growth relatively strong, the sector has remained in  good fiscal health. And the latest survey just published by  the National Conference of State Legislators indicates that fiscal 1998 is  likely to  be  another good year. All but one state, Alaska, reported that revenues are coming in  on  target or  better so far  this fiscal year. Likewise, spending also appears to  be  on  target. Survey respondents report that key budget issues for legislatures this winter and spring will center on K-12 education funding, tax cuts or tax reform, and the funding of corrections programs and transportation.

Prices

The consumer price index rose just 1.7 percent during 1997, well below its 3.3 percent pace over the  previous year. 1 2 The latest news on prices has remained quite favorable, with the CPI rising just 0.1 percent in  both November and December. Continued weakness in import prices and declining energy prices have restrained consumer prices recently. At  the same time, lower prices for many industrial commodities suggest no  inflationary pressures at earlier stages of  processing.

The  CPI for energy fell 1.6 percent in  December after a  small decline in  November. Gasoline prices moved lower for the third consecutive month; heating oil prices also retreated. In  addition, electricity and natural gas prices dropped back as unseasonably warm weather eased demand. Overall, energy prices declined 3-1/2 percent last year after having surged 8-1/2 percent in 1996. All types of energy contributed to  this deceleration, although the large swings in prices of gasoline and heating oil accounted for  more than half of the slowing.

Retail food prices were little changed in  November and December. The favorable news on  food prices has been widespread across categories, and grocery prices in coming months likely will be  held down by the recent declines in  spot and futures prices for both crop and livestock commodities. An  exception to the recent pattern in  the food area is the index for food away from home, which has picked up; it rose 0.3 percent in  November and 0.4 percent in December. In  the last Greenbook, we  noted that September's minimum wage increase appeared to  have had little effect on  the CPI for food away from home through October, but more recent data suggest that the effects of  higher wage costs may simply have come later than expected. Even with the recent uptick in  that component, the overall food CPI rose just 1-1/2 percent during 1997, nearly 3  percentage points less than its pace during the prior year.

Outside of  food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in December after having increased just 0.1 percent in  November. Over last year as a whole, the core CPI was up 2.2 percent, almost

1/2 percentage point less than the  pace registered during 1996.13 Deceleration was evident among prices of  both goods and services, although it  was not universal across all categories. Within goods, the deceleration was concentrated in the durables category, where falling import prices have been an  especially important restraining influence. In  particular, prices of  new and used motor vehicles decelerated considerably in 1997 and accounted for more than half of the slowing in  the core CPI last year. In  contrast to durable goods, price increases for nondurable goods picked up last year, with accelerating prices for tobacco and apparel. Among services other than energy, airfares--which dropped back last year after having popped up during 1996--more than accounted for the deceleration; shelter costs accelerated somewhat over 1997.

Other broad measures of inflation have also slowed recently; as of  1997:Q3, four-quarter changes in  chain price indexes for GDP and for  PCE excluding food and energy were down 0.4 percentage point from their pace at the end of 1996, similar to  the pattern for the 14 core CPI. However, some alternative measures of  the underlying trend in  the CPI have not slowed as much as the published core CPI. In  particular, the median CPI--calculated by the Cleveland Fed-showed no deceleration over the past year.15 The difference is due to the  fact that over the past year prices decelerated substantially for a  relatively small number of  items in  the CPI, such as  motor vehicles. Large decelerations for a  few  important items can have a  big effect on  changes in  the overall and core CPI but little or no effect on  the median CPI. Nonetheless, movements in  the median CPI should be  interpreted cautiously because yet another alternative--the trimmed mean CPI--tells a  story more like that of the core CPI.16

Inflation expectations as  measured by  the Michigan SRC index also came down over the past year. In  the fourth quarter of last year, one-year-ahead median expectations were about 1/4 percentage point lower than a  year earlier, while mean expectations dropped about 3/4 percentage point. The preliminary reading for January indicates that these expectations fell substantially further, although those figures probably should be  taken with a  grain of  salt until the final--full sample--readings are released at the  end of January.

Prices of  capital equipment in  the PPI edged down 0.2 percent further in  December, with declines for motor vehicles as  well as other types of  capital equipment. Just as for durable goods in  the CPI, prices of  capital goods in 1997 appear to  have been restrained by  weak import prices: The PPI for capital goods fell 1/2 percent last year, compared with an  increase of about 1/2 percent registered during 1996.17

At  earlier stages of  processing, prices continue to be subdued. The PPI for core intermediate materials edged down in  December and was up only 0.3 percent over 1997 as a  whole. The index for core crude materials dropped another 1.5 percent in December after having declined 0.7 percent in  November. As a  result of  ample supplies and softening demand on  world markets, prices of  many industrial commodities are, on  balance, considerably below their levels in  midDecember. Although the  most recent weekly observations suggest that these indexes may  have stopped declining, the Journal of  Commerce index of industrial prices is  down 4  percent, and the CRB index of spot industrials is  off 3-1/4 percent. 1 8

rate of 4.9 percent in the three months ended in  December. Over 1997 as  whole, this measure of  hourly compensation rose 3.4 percent, up 0.3 percentage point from its pace in  the prior year.

Over the final three months of last year, the pickup in  hourly compensation reflected an acceleration in  wages and salaries as  well as in  benefit costs. Developments in  the finance, insurance, and real estate (FIRE) industry contributed importantly to  the pickup in both wages and benefits, adding about a  percentage point to the increase in  overall ECI compensation. Wages and salaries in  FIRE were boosted considerably by  the sizable commissions generated from the recent wave of  mortgage refinancings, and nonproduction bonuses, included in  benefits, also increased substantially in  this industry.19

The year-end developments in  FIRE largely accounted for the acceleration in  hourly compensation between 1996 and 1997. Elsewhere, hourly compensation accelerated noticeably in  the business services industry, where anecdotal reports of labor shortages for some occupations, such as computer specialists and skilled temporary workers, have been common. Wages also picked up in  the health services industry after posting a  relatively small increase in 1996. In  contrast, hourly compensation in goodsproducing industries and in the retail and wholesale trade sector decelerated last year.

The occupational detail suggests that the minimum wage also provided a  boost to compensation gains in  the past year. Of  the three broad occupational categories, the services group has the highest concentration of low-wage occupations. Compensation in  this category was up 4.0 percent over the past year; this compares with a 3.0 percent rise in 1996 (when  the minimum wage was also increased) and a  1.9 percent rise in 1995. As for timing of  the minimum wage effect within the year, the quarterly pattern of compensation in service occupations suggests that much of  the impact of last September's minimum wage hike occurred in  the third quarter. At annual rates, compensation for service occupations increased 6.9 percent during the three months ending in September, but only 2.4 percent over the three-month period through December.

Over the past year, benefit costs increased 2.3 percent, compared with a  2.0 percent gain in 1996. In  addition to large

bonuses in  financial services, year-end bonuses were apparently sizable in a variety of  other industries as  well. Health insurance costs increased 0.9 percent last year, compared with an  increase of 20 0.4 percent in  the prior year.

Overall, tight labor markets appear to  have sustained nominal compensation gains last year even as  favorable developments in product markets led to a  slowing of  price inflation. Adjusted for inflation by  the nonfarm business chain price index, real ECI compensation is expected to show  an  increase of  nearly 2  percent in 1997, almost 1 percentage point more than in 1996.21

The decision by the FOMC to  keep policy on  hold at  the December meeting had been anticipated and thus market yields were unaffected. But, in subsequent weeks, more bad news from  Asia and more good news on U.S. inflation caused nominal interest rates to fall 10 to 40 basis points, the largest declines being posted at  intermediate maturities (chart). The slide in rates was attributed in  part to  a flight to the relative safety and liquidity of  dollar assets, particularly nominal Treasury securities. More recently, that rate decline was largely reversed, as some  Asian economies were perceived to  be stabilizing. Uncertainty associated with the President's legal problems also appeared to  be  a  factor.

Federal funds futures rates, which were flat at  the time of  the December FOMC meeting, now slope downward (chart). With the contract for June currently about 8 basis points below the intended rate of 5-1/2 percent, market participants apparently see a significant chance of  policy easing before midyear.

Since the last FOMC meeting, major equity indexes have registered mixed changes, amid considerable volatility that has been closely associated with frequent, large swings in  prices on  Asian markets and mixed signals on earnings growth prospects. On  balance, the Dow Jones Index was little changed, while the NASDAQ rose 2-3/4 percent, reversing some of  its relative underperformance during the fall.

The decline in interest rates created an inviting market for bond issuance, and this has tilted heavy business credit demands toward the bond market. Bank C&amp;I loans also have been rising rapidly of late, reportedly fueled by inventory growth and brisk merger activity. In contrast, the shakier stock market environment has trimmed new  equity offerings. Borrowing by households in recent months appears to  have stayed around its moderate third-quarter pace; with the decline in  rates, this portends a  slight easing of the burden of  debt payments. Net borrowing by the Treasury remains minimal. Lower rates on  tax-exempt bonds have boosted bond issuance--and overall borrowing--by the state and local sector. Growth in  the broader monetary aggregates has been robust in  recent months.

Treasury  Yield  Curve  and  Federal Funds  Futures Rates

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance by  nonfinancial corporations maintained a moderate $12 billion monthly pace in December, with some potential issuers apparently staying on  the sidelines anticipating still lower yields (table). In  early January, when corporate bond yields in  fact touched their lowest levels in  more than two decades, issuance surged. Based on proceeds raised through January 26, issuance in  January will easily top $20 billion, well ahead of the brisk $16-1/2 billion pace in  the fourth quarter. Issuance has  been particularly heavy in  the investment-grade sector, where a significant chunk of  the proceeds apparently has been used to pay down commercial paper. Speculative-grade bond offerings slowed to $5-1/2 billion in  December--a healthy pace, but one that pales by

comparison with last year's record monthly average of almost $8  billion.

Over the intermeeting period, interest rates on  high-yield debt fell only about 10 basis points, resulting in a  slight increase in quality spreads. The widening in spreads did not appear to reflect greater concern about default risk but, rather, the  marked preferences of  those fleeing emerging markets for the liquidity of Treasuries and top-quality corporates. Indeed, the spread of junk over Treasury rates was a  great deal wider in  early January, before Treasury yields retraced some of their recent declines.

The effects of the Asian crisis on  corporate fortunes have become a major focus for equity investors. Although U.S. stock price indexes show small mixed changes over the intermeeting period, this masks some sizable weekly swings (chart, top panel). Because money center banks and technology firms have relatively large exposures to Asia, their stock prices have been especially volatile, with the  money center banks registering large declines since midDecember. Equities in  the energy and basic materials sectors were roiled by  the declines in  oil and other commodity prices--both related at  least in  part to  Asian developments.

With about half of  the S&amp;P 500 firms thus far reporting fourthquarter earnings, it appears that, on  balance, corporate earnings once again have come in  above analysts' downward-revised projections. Positive surprises have outnumbered negative surprises by  a margin of  about five to  three, a  bit less favorable balance than in the last several quarters. Some of the  biggest positive surprises have come from the airline industry; firm prices and declining fuel costs have produced big profits in  this sector. In the computer-related technology sector, earnings have mostly run  a bit above the most recent consensus projections. Perhaps more important for share prices, though, several major companies in  this sector have indicated that declining demand in  Asia or  the strong U.S. dollar will have a  significant negative effect on  first-half performance.

If earnings reports continue the pattern seen to  date, the four-quarter growth in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share is estimated to have slowed to around 8  or 9 percent, from 12 percent in  the third quarter (middle left panel). This might be  consistent with a  small quarter-over-quarter gain in  economic profits on  a  seasonally adjusted basis.

Despite the  market's preoccupation with Asian problems, equity analysts have not yet marked down longer-term earnings prospects much. Since mid-October, average year-ahead earnings projections for S&amp;P 500 firms have been lowered only about 1/2 percent per month (middle right panel). Nearly all of  the recent downward adjustments are accounted for by  revisions to  technology sector projections. Currently, company-analyst ("bottom-up") projections for S&amp;P 500 earnings in 1998 still imply an  expectation that earnings will grow 13-1/2 percent (not  shown). While analysts' long-term growth projections have stopped rising, they remain at record high levels (lower left panel).

The increase in  stock market volatility in  late October had little immediate effect on  the pace of  equity issuance, as November saw  a  near-record number of IPOs by  nonfinancial companies, resulting in  $3.6 billion in  new issues. But IPO price performance deteriorated significantly in late November and December: average one-day returns on  IPOs dropped to around 7  percent, from  more than 20  percent in  October (lower right panel). Partly as  a  result, nonfinancial IPOs raised a  paltry $0.8 billion in  December and failed to  pick up  in  January after the normal seasonal lull early in the month.

Meanwhile, equity retirements have remained very strong. Companies continue to announce stock repurchase plans at  a  nearrecord pace, and merger activity involved about $30 billion in equity retirements during the fourth quarter. Only $8 billion of this came from megamergers, while the  number of  minimergers (combinations of companies under $1  billion in capitalization) was the largest for any  quarter during the current merger wave. The $22 billion of equity retired from these minimergers likely boosted bank loan growth late in the year, because many of the acquirers have limited access to securities markets for debt financing.

The fourth quarter saw  very few ratings changes for U.S. corporations. Over the course of  the year, upgrades were balanced by  downgrades in  the nonfinancial sector. Although a  large amount of  nonfinancial debt was recently put on  Moody's watchlist for downgrades, much of it  was related to  recent and prospective mergers. None of the additions appeared to  be  the result of  Asiarelated or general economic concerns.

Household Sector

After interest rates on new  fixed-rate home mortgages dropped below 7 percent, homeowners scrambled to refinance their mortgage loans. Indeed, the Mortgage Bankers Association's refinancing application index surged to a  record high in early January (chart). While this signals an  extraordinary level of refinancing activity, some of  that increase probably reflects heavy multiple application filing by  customers fearful that backed-up mortgage bankers will not be able to  process their forms promptly.

The volume of refinancing had already been rising for several months, as  borrowers--including many holding ARMs--sought to lock in lower long-term rates. In  total, prepayment activity for all of 1997 is  estimated to have reduced interest costs about $5-1/2 billion, only a  fraction of  the $33 billion in  estimated savings from the major refinancing wave in 1993, when rates last broke below 7  percent. The staff estimates that, if  mortgage rates were to  settle in  near 7 percent during the months ahead, then refinancing could reduce annualized mortgage payments about $16 to $24 billion in 1998, all else the same.

Overall, growth in  household debt appeared moderate during the fourth quarter. Various indicators point to a  pickup in  mortgage debt growth last quarter from  the sluggish third-quarter pace, but only a  smattering of  hard data is yet available to confirm this. Smoothing through month-to-month volatility, growth in nonmortgage consumer credit continued on  its path of gradual deceleration. An outsized gain in  October was followed in  November by  a  contraction of  4  percent (annualized): for the two months combined, consumer credit grew at a  3-1/2 percent annual rate, a  bit slower than in  the second and third quarters. December and January figures on  banks' consumer loans suggest consumer credit growth remains subdued. The Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey results suggest continued selective tightening of standards on credit card and other consumer loans.

Given growth in  household debt that only slightly outpaced that of  income last year and the downward drift in  average interest rates on  the stock of  debt, the ratio of debt-service payments to disposable income is estimated to  have stabilized at  17 percent in 1997, a bit  below the highs recorded in 1989 (lower panel). If  the interest savings from possible mortgage refinancings noted above

should materialize, then, all else the same, the debt-service bure ratio would be reduced about 1/3 percentage point.

Evidence on loan payment performance for the fourth quarter i scant, limited mainly to monthly reports from the major domestic auto finance companies. A  drop in  the delinquency rate on auto loans at these firms in  September pulled the third-quarter average below the previous quarter's reading. Company reports for Octobel and November indicate that delinquencies remain near their Septeml level, and down from their average level in  the third quarter. Government Finance

Treasury borrowing has remained subdued, held down by  favoral budget developments and a  drawdown of cash  balances that had  been boosted by  unusually strong tax  inflows. In  January, the Treasuri held its third auction of ten-year, price-index-linked securities The $8  billion sale of securities--at a  yield of  3-5/8 percent-brought the  total outstanding stock of  indexed securities to $41 billion, about 1  percent of total U.S. marketable debt. The auction drew about three times as  many bids as there were securit: available for sale, comparable to typical demand for nominal securities. Yields on  Treasury index-linked securities had actua. inched up in  December and early January, while nominal Treasury bi yields were declining, perhaps reflecting the oncoming supply and the preference for more liquid securities amid volatile financial markets; but, since the day preceding the auction, index-linked Treasury yields have edged down, even as nominal yields backed up

While flight to  quality has at times clearly boosted demands for  Treasury securities, also purportedly weighing on  the market have been concerns that the troubled economies of  Asia and the associated speculative attacks in  Latin America and Eastern Europ might lead foreign holders--both private and public--to sell some their Treasury securities in  large volume. As  yet, no massive sa have materialized. However, foreign official holdings of  U.S. Treasury securities in custody at  the New  York Federal Reserve Ba have fallen about $40 billion from their September peak (chart). The most notable official sales in  the fourth quarter were by Russia, Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan.

Spreads between agency-issued securities and Treasuries have held steady over the intermeeting period, even as government sponsored enterprises resumed issuance in global markets after a lull late last year. Recent issuers include Fannie Mae ($4 billi

and Freddie Mac ($1 billion). The bulk of the issuance was denominated in U.S. dollars. On  the domestic scene, the Tennessee Valley Authority refinanced a  portion of its debt by issuing $1  billion in  the forty-year sector.

Gross offerings of long-term municipal securities increased in December to $21-1/4 billion for the  month, about equal to the fourth-quarter pace (table). Both new capital issues and refundings were strong in  December, as yields on  long-term tax-exempts declined to  their lowest levels since 1993. Although preliminary data show issuance in  January slowing a  bit, it  is still quite strong. Money and Bank Credit

Bank credit expanded at about a  10 percent annual rate in December, maintaining the robust pace observed earlier in  the fourth quarter. Also following the pattern in recent months, the increase in  bank credit was heavily weighted toward securities holdings, a somewhat puzzling development given that loan demand has continued solid; adjusted for mark-to-market accounting rules, securities in December expanded at about a 25 percent pace.

Total loans increased at a  5-1/2 percent rate in  December, driven by  strong business lending, which rose at a  14  percent pace that month. In addition, there were substantial sales of loans to pools in  the form of issuance of collateralized loan obligations (CLOs); including these loans in net business loan originations would boost bank business lending in  December substantially further. The strength in  business lending likely reflected borrowing related to  mergers and acquisitions and inventory accumulation, as  well as perhaps some substitution of bank loans for commercial paper issuance at  year-end. Results from the latest Senior Loan Officer survey suggest a  continued accommodative stance toward business lending, although less easing of standards than in  other recent surveys. Aside from some Japanese respondents, whose lending apparently has been crimped by  their capital positions, the survey found no evidence of a  tightening in  credit standards.

To fund strong bank credit expansion, the broader aggregates have continued to grow  briskly in  December and January. M2 expanded at an  annual rate near 6-1/2 percent last month, pulling up its growth for 1997 (Q4  to  Q4) as a  whole to 5-1/4 percent, slightly

above its annual range.1 Rapid M2 growth has persisted into January, when it likely has been boosted by  robust increases in income and perhaps by  a  greater preference for safe assets as financial markets remained more turbulent. M3  expanded 10 percent in  December, bringing its growth last year to 8-1/4 percent, far above its 2  to 6 percent annual range; this aggregate too has continued to expand briskly in  January. Banks continued to raise large amounts of funds through issuance of  managed liabilities. In addition, Eurodollar deposits and institution-only money market mutual funds grew at a  stunning pace in  December. Mutual Funds

Preliminary monthly estimates from  the ICI indicate that net sales of  mutual funds continued strong in  December. Net sales of equity funds are estimated at  $18 billion for the month, roughly matching the  pace of  the two prior months and the first half of 1997 but below the $22 billion monthly pace of  the third quarter. Estimates for individual fund types are not yet available owing to complications in  measuring the levels of  reinvestment of  year-end fund distributions; however, preliminary results suggest flows to international funds continued to be  weak in  December. Net sales of  bond funds for December are estimated at $8.5 billion, the second highest monthly total for 1997, off from $10.4 billion in  November.

Available information about January flows presents somewhat contradictory patterns. Representatives of  some major fund families suggest very strong flows in early January, particularly in 401(k) plans and IRAs. By  contrast, data from commercial surveys depict sluggish flows in  the first half of January, with some indications of a  pickup more recently. Sources generally agree that early January figures continued to show that demands for international funds remained off  their earlier peaks, while flows to  bond funds were strong.

Liquidity ratios of  equity funds ticked up from 5.5 percent in October to 5.7 percent in  November--the latest data available--but remain well below the average level of  recent years. Liquidity ratios for bond funds held at around the average level of  the 1990s. Mutual funds report that they continue to rely on  lines of credit to supplement holdings of liquid assets in their management of liquidity.

APPENDIX

THE JANUARY SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON  BANK LENDING PRACTICES

The January 1998 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices (covering, for the  most part, changes over the past three months) posed the usual questions bearing on  the supply of  and demand for bank loans to businesses and  households. Additional questions targeted changes in  the sensitivity of respondents' loan quality to an  economic slowdown, changes in standards and terms on  home equity loans, and lending to affiliate or subsidiaries of  East Asian firms.

The domestic respondents indicated little change in standards on loans to businesses, although a  fairly large percentage narrowe yield spreads. By  contrast, foreign respondents (especially the branches and agencies of Japanese banks) appear to  be  pulling back from business lending, with many reporting tighter standards and terms. Both domestic and foreign respondents took steps to restri lending to  U.S. affiliates of  non-Japanese East Asian firms. At  t same time, demand from U.S. affiliates of Japanese firms increased

Many banks are still tightening standards on  consumer loans, but few said that their willingness to make these loans had change Standards for residential mortgage loans were about unchanged, but demand for such loans increased at a  large percentage of respondents. Several banks eased terms and standards on  home equi loans.

Special questions elicited broadly different opinions among t respondents as to the change in  their customers' ability to  meet their debt obligations during a  period of economic weakness. A fe more banks said that, overall, their loan portfolio had become moi vulnerable to a  downturn than said it  had become less vulnerable.

Lending to Businesses

The survey results suggest somewhat less easing of  business loan standards and terms than did last year's surveys. For domest respondents, one bank, on  net, tightened standards both on  C&amp;I loE to  small and to larger businesses. Recent surveys had found small fractions of  banks easing business lending standards. Also for  bc size categories, about 25 percent of  the domestic respondents reported some narrowing of  yield spreads; for loans to large borrowers, this was a  somewhat smaller percentage than in recent surveys. Less than 10 percent eased other terms such as the size and cost of credit lines, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements; in  general, these percentages have also fallen a bil

Many branches and agencies--primarily those of  Japanese bank! reported curtailing their lending, likely reflecting in part the economic turmoil in  Asia. More than one-third of  the branches an&lt; agencies reported tighter standards on  C&amp;I loans, and nearly twothirds widened spreads. Significant fractions also decreased the size and increased the cost of  credit lines. The respondents attributed the tightening to  a  weakening of  their parents' currenor expected capital position.

On  net, about 25 percent of  the domestic banks experienced increased demand for business loans from larger firms, and 15 percent reported stronger demand from small firms. Most frequently, the increased demand was attributed to  merger and acquisition funding needs, but the need for plant and equipment and inventory financing was also cited. The importance accorded to  inventory financing needs was about the same as that reported in  the November survey and a  little less than that in  the August survey. Few branches and agencies reported a  change in  business loan demand.

Less than 10 percent of  the domestic respondents, on  net, eased standards on commercial real estate loans, about the same as in  November. By  contrast, a  net 15 percent of the foreign respondents tightened standards on  these loans. Large net fractions of  the participants--two-fifths of  the domestic and one-third of  the foreign respondents--experienced increased demand for these loans, larger fractions than reported a  pickup in demand in  November.

Lending to  Households

The responses concerning consumer loans resembled those on recent surveys. On  net, one  bank expressed greater willingness to make consumer installment loans, 20 percent tightened standards on credit card loans, and 15 percent tightened standards on other consumer loans. While the current survey is the ninth in a  row  to find significant net percentages of banks tightening standards on consumer loans, the percentages have tailed off over the past year. The survey revealed little evidence of  any change in consumer loan terms.

Standards applied to  mortgage applications were about unchanged. Many banks--three-fifths--reported increased demand for these loans. Even though this question specifically refers to mortgages to purchase homes, the large number of  respondents indicating increased demand may reflect, in  part, the spike in refinancing in January.

Special questions found modest evidence of eased standards and terms for  home equity loans. Between 15 percent and 20 percent of the respondents, on  net, eased standards on these loans over the past year. Similar percentages reduced fees and raised maximum loan-to-value ratios; somewhat smaller percentages narrowed spreads and  lengthened maturities. The responses suggest a  degree of easing similar to that found by  the January 1997 survey.

Lending to  Affiliates and Subsidiaries of  East Asian Firms

The recent financial difficulties of  many East Asian firms have raised the possibility that lenders may be  approaching the U.S. affiliates of  such firms with greater caution. In  fact, the survey found a  widespread tightening of standards and terms on  loans to nonbank U.S. affiliates of  Asian firms, excluding Japanese firms. Two-thirds of  the domestic respondents and all of  the branches and agencies had tightened their standards on loans to nonbank affiliates or subsidiaries of  Korean firms. Only slightly fewer tightened standards on  loans to  non-Korean (and non-Japanese) firms. All or  nearly all of the survey participants had tightened terms on these loans, including the size and cost of  credit lines, yield spreads, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements.

In  the last few  months, Japanese banks have been under pressure to increase loan-loss reserves while maintaining capital ratios. These requirements may  have reduced the supply of  credit in  Japan, possibly leading to a  reduction in funding by  Japanese parents to their nonbank U.S. affiliates or subsidiaries. The survey did find that about one-quarter of  the domestic respondents, on  net, and  onehalf of the  branches and agencies had experienced increased loan demand from these firms. However, most of  those institutions experiencing increased demand attributed it  to reduced attractiveness of other sources of  funds. Reduced funding from parent firms was cited much less often, although still widely, as  a reason for the increased demand. Nevertheless, when increased loan demand is the result of substitution away from alternative sources of  funds, it  may be  difficult for respondents to know  the alternative source.

Sensitivity of Loan  Performance to a  Recession

For the past couple of  years, this survey and other sources have reported an  easing by  banks of  standards and terms for business credit and a  tightening for consumer credit. Special questions in the current survey asked respondents to  evaluate the effect that these changes have had  on  the ability of  their various customer groups to  meet debt obligations during a  period of  economic weakness. Banks' responses differed fairly widely. About onequarter of  the respondents, on  net, felt that their commercial real estate borrowers' ability to  weather a  downturn had improved over the past two years. By  contrast, on  net about 20 percent felt that their credit card customers, and about 10 percent their other consumer loan borrowers, were in  worse shape. It  may  be that the tightening of  standards on  consumer loans has not offset the deteriorating condition of some existing customers at these institutions. Regarding commercial and industrial and residential real estate borrowers, responses were quite dispersed, with fairly large percentages of  banks assessing their borrowers to be in better condition and roughly equal percentages seeing deterioration. Looking at  their loan portfolios overall, about 25 percent of  the loan officers judged their banks' aggregate charge-off and delinquency rates to  be  more sensitive to a  downturn than they were two  years ago, and about 15 percent felt this sensitivity had declined.

Exports declined slightly in  November after jumping up in October. Exports in  October-November on  average were 1.8 percent higher than the third-quarter average. The sharpest increases were in automotive and agricultural products, with strong increases also recorded for exported consumer goods and machinery (other than computers and semiconductors, which both declined). [Note: There is little evidence in  U.S data through November of  a  significant drop in exports to  developing countries in  Asia, other than perhaps the decline in  the value of  computers and semiconductors, and a  moderate decrease in exports to Korea.]

Imports dropped 2.3 percent in  November with  most of  the decline in oil (primarily quantity) and capital goods. The value of imports in October-November on  average were about the same as the third-quarter average. Most of  the change reflected increases in imported consumer goods and machinery (other than computers and semiconductors) that were about offset by  declines in  imported automotive products, computers, and, to  a  lesser extent a  wide range of other products. For imported oil in  October-November on  average, a  decline in  quantity was about offset by  an  increase in  price.

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  imported oil declined sharply in  November following several months of  moderate increases. As  a  result, for October-November on  average the quantity of  imports was a  bit less than in the third quarter. This decline followed two consecutive quarters of strong increases in oil imports, driven by  extremely robust consumption in  the second and third quarters. Preliminary department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil imports declined again in  December due  to a  substantial drawdown in  stocks.

The  price of  imported oil declined in  November and December following increases in  the previous three months. Nonetheless, prices for  the fourth quarter were 5  percent higher than the  average for the third quarter. The run-up in  prices from late summer through early fall reflected production disruptions in  Colombia and the lagged effect of  Iraq not exporting for two months. Spot WTI prices declined sharply in  December as the  market anticipated increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the  UAE. Spot prices declined further in  January because of  weak demand in  Asia, relatively warm weather in  the northeastern United States, and the resumption of  oil production for export by  Iraq.

Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in  December for the third consecutive month. This decline was attributable to decreases in all major trade categories with the exception of  foods and consumer goods. For the fourth quarter, non-oil import prices decreased 2-1/4 percent at an  annual rate, continuing a  downward trend that began in  late 1995. There were price declines in all major trade categories with the exception of  automotive products.

Prices of  exports declined slightly in  December after remaining unchanged in  November. The decline was attributable to lower prices for agricultural products and, to  a  lesser degree. other industrial supplies, computers, semiconductors, and other capital goods. For  the fourth quarter, export prices decreased moderately for the  third consecutive quarter. Prices of agricultural products declined significantly. Prices of nonagricultural exports decreased 2-1/4 percent at an  annual rate with declines spread among all major trade categories with the exception of  automotive products and consumer goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The flight to  quality apparent in  the very large October net purchases of  U.S. securities by  private foreigners was moderated considerably in  November (line 4  of  the Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table). Private net purchases of  U.S. Treasury securities were still strong in  November, but far below the record pace of  October (line 4a). The net was more than accounted for  by the  Netherlands Antilles and the  United Kingdom. Large purchases of  Treasury securities in  October by  residents of  Japan were reversed in  November, probably because of  the large increase in the  Japan premium during the month of  November. Moreover, purchases of  Treasuries by  Mexican residents fell by  over $2.5 billion to nearly zero in  November. On  the other hand, moderately large purchases continued in  Hong Kong.

Net purchases of corporate and other bonds by  private foreigners were unusually low  in  November (line 4b). New issues of Eurobonds by  U.S. corporations had been very strong in  September and October, but fell sharply in  November and continued very weak in December. The pace of corporate stock purchases by  private foreigners was moderate compared with that of  the second and third quarters (line 4c).

U.S. residents had quite modest net purchases of  foreign securities in  November (line 5). The total included $3.2 billion of net sales of  foreign stocks; almost two-thirds of  this total was accounted for  by  net sales of  Japanese stocks. U.S. residents also had  net stock sales in  the $500 million range to residents of  Brazil and  Mexico. In  Asia, there were net stock purchases in  Hong Kong and  Korea and net sales in  the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia.

Foreign official assets held in  the United States fell about $7  billion in  November (line 1); over half the fall was attributable to  Russia, with smaller decreases for Korea and Thailand. Preliminary data from the FRBNY indicate a  further overall decrease in  the $15 billion range for December, with a  large part of  this decline due to  Japan.

Banks in  the United States reported small net inflows in November (line 3). Monthly average data reported on  the International Banking Data table indicate a  continuation of  inflows from own foreign offices and IBFs in  December (line 1).

Foreign Exchange Markets

Since the December FOMC meeting, the dollar has continued to appreciate against most of  the currencies of  the Asian developing economies. Against a weighted average of ten developing economy currencies (eight of  which are Asian currencies), the dollar has appreciated almost 5  percent over the intermeeting period. Against the currencies of  the G-10 countries, the dollar peaked in early January before declining late in  the  month. On  balance, the  dollar has  firmed slightly against these currencies, up 1  percent on  a trade-weighted basis.

Financial markets in  Korea and Indonesia were particularly volatile over the intermeeting period. In  mid-December, after Korean authorities abandoned the daily, ten-percent limit on fluctuations in  the  won and Kim Dae-jung won  the  presidential election, the  value of the  won  and Korean share prices fell sharply as the total of  short-term, foreign currency obligations of  Korean borrowers became apparent. Markets stabilized in late December when foreign banks agreed to  a  rollover of  short-term obligations of Korean financial institutions and disbursements from  the IMF and other international financial institutions were accelerated. On balance, since the  December FOMC meeting, the  won has fallen more than 6-1/2 percent against the dollar; nevertheless, share prices in Korea were up  more than 34 percent.

While relatively tranquil in  December, Indonesian markets have fluctuated wildly in  the new  year. The rupiah fell sharply in  early January on  the release of  a  budget for 1998 that was  viewed as unrealistic and inconsistent with Indonesia's program with the IMF. The rupiah continued to plunge until mid-January when a  series of meetings involving Indonesian, IMF. and U.S. officials took place. The  meetings culminated with the announcement of  a  new program that accelerates reforms intended to restructure the Indonesian economy. Nevertheless, over the following week the rupiah continued to fall, with President Suharto's decision to seek reelection providing little calm to Indonesian markets. In  the past two days, the rupiah has firmed on  the announcement of a  debt renegotiation framework and further banking sector reforms. Over the intermeeting period as a whole, the rupiah has lost 48 percent of  its value against the

dollar. Over the same period, Indonesian equity prices have risen almost 43 percent.

Other Asian financial markets have been less volatile. The currencies of  most of  these economies have depreciated against the dollar, with the largest declines registered by  the ringgit (11 percent) and  baht (11 percent). Equity markets surged 18 percent in Thailand, although they  were up  only 2 percent in  Malaysia and  down 21 percent in Singapore. Share prices have fallen 11 percent in Hong  Kong, with the largest declines coming on  the news that Peregrine Investments had filed for liquidation.

The dollar has depreciated more than 4  percent against the yen. Over the first three weeks of  the intermeeting period, the dollar strengthened against the  yen. Against a background of  weak economic news, the mid-December Japanese government proposal to promote financial stability and economic recovery had little impact on  financial markets. Sizeable sales of dollars by  Japanese authorities around the  time of  the unveiling of  the proposal also had little lasting impact on the yen. The  dollar peaked near ¬•134 in  early January and  has fallen since then on  three factors: 1) talk of additional fiscal stimulus (beyond that contained in  the December proposal), 2)  a  period of  relative stability and recovery in  some Asian developing economies, and 3)  concerns over the fallout of the  allegations involving President Clinton. Over the intermeeting period as a  whole, the interest differential between ten-year bellwether bonds in  Japan and the United States has increased 30  basis points in  favor of  Japanese assets.

The dollar has appreciated a bit less than 2  percent against the  mark over the  intermeeting period. The dollar appreciated through early January as concerns began to emerge over the ramifications of  the crisis in  Asia and amid comments by Bundesbank officials that the dollar's rise was not troubling. Over the  past week, the  mark has recouped some of  these losses against the dollar in  response to a positive Ifo survey of  the business climate and the allegations against President Clinton. The German ten-year interest rate has fallen 20  basis points since the December FOMC, 8 basis points more than  the decline in  the comparable U.S. rate. Italian long rates have fallen a  bit further, in  part reflecting the lateDecember, 75 basis-point cut in official Italian rates.

The dollar has gained more than 2-1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar,

The Canadian dollar reached historical  lows  against the U.S. dollar late this month following a favorable CPI  release and indications that the Bank of Canada  is content with the current level of monetary conditions. The ten-year interest rate  in Canada has declined 18  basis points more than the comparable rate in the United States. At the three-month horizon, the Canadian interest rate is  little changed, while the U.S.  threemonth interest rate has  fallen 25 basis points.

The Desk did not  intervene in the  foreign exchange market during the period. Developments  in Foreign Industrial Countries

Economic activity in major foreign industrialized countries appears to have continued to  expand on average at  a healthy clip in the last quarter of  1997,  with recent data indicating moderate to robust growth in all  countries except Japan. Although apparently slowing somewhat from the third  quarter, the pace of economic expansion continued to be fairly strong in Canada, France, Germany and the United Kingdom.  Growth in Italy likely was weaker, but still  only slightly off the moderate pace  recorded in the first nine months of  1997. By contrast, indicators  in Japan suggest persistent weakness in economic activity. Despite some preliminary signs that the southeast Asian crisis has begun to  show up in forward-looking indicators, the eventual impact of the crisis on the foreign industrial economies  remains uncertain.

Inflationary pressures have been subdued to nearly nonexistent in all foreign G-7 countries  except the United Kingdom. CPI inflation is near or under  1-1/2 percent in France, Germany and Italy, and  under one percent  in Canada. It is  close to zero  in Japan, after netting out the effects of tax increases. In the United Kingdom, however, consumer price inflation  remains slightly above the government's 2-1/2  percent target.

Individual  country notes. In Japan, economic indicators for the  fourth quarter  suggest continued weakness. Industrial

production declined sharply in  November, and industrial inventories surged. Housing starts during October and  November remained near ten-year lows, and labor market conditions deteriorated. Household expenditures during October and November were down from their thirdquarter level, but December auto registrations rebounded somewhat. Inflation, net of  the  effects of  fiscal measures, remains virtually nonexistent.

The trade balance increased sharply during the fourth quarter, with export volumes expanding and import volumes contracting. Fourth-quarter trade data, however, provide the first glimpse of  the effects of  the Asia crisis on  Japanese trade, as exports to  Thailand and Korea registered sizable year-over-year declines. In  addition, foreign orders for machinery fell sharply in  October and  November.

In late December, the Japanese Cabinet approved a supplementary budget for FY1997 and  the regular budget for FY1998, which begins in  April. The supplementary budget includes a ¬•2 trillion temporary income tax  cut, as  well as ¬•1 trillion of  new spending for disaster relief and public works. The FY1998 budget calls for ¬•5 trillion of  expenditure reductions, offset by  about ¬•1

trillion of  tax changes, including cuts in  the corporate income tax, the securities transactions tax, and real estate taxes. Taken together, these measures, which are expected to  gain rapid Diet approval, suggest that fiscal policy would exert about a  1/4  ercent p drag on  GDP growth during calendar year 1998.

The Cabinet also approved the provision of  ¬•30 trillion (about $230 billion) of  public funds to  the Deposit Insurance Corporation (DIC) to address the banking system's difficulties. These funds include ¬•10 trillion of capital contribution bonds, which the DIC may  "cash" as resources are needed, and ¬•20 trillion of government guarantees for DIC  borrowing from the Bank of  Japan. Government officials have indicated that ¬•7 trillion of  the capital contribution bonds plus ¬•10 trillion of  BOJ lending are available, if necessary, to  protect depositors at failed banks. The remaining funds may  be  used to  recapitalize weak institutions or  provide capital to "rescue banks."

Also in  late December, the government announced measures intended to promote provision of  credit. First, new  lending programs for smalland medium-sized firms will be  established at government-owned financial institutions. Second, banks that are active only in  the domestic market will not be subject to  more stringent capital-asset standards scheduled to take effect on April 1. Third, Japanese banks will have the option of  valuing their equity holdings at  historical cost, rather than at the  minimum of  historical cost and  market cost.

Japanese Finance Minister Mitsuzuka resigned on  January 28, after two senior Ministry of  Finance bank examiners were arrested on charges that they had  accepted bribes from major banks in  exchange for information on  inspection schedules. Mitsuzuka stated, "The Ministry of  Finance needs to  be reborn. Major reforms are  needed." The  banks involved in the scandal (Asahi Bank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, Sanwa Bank, and failed Hokkaido Takushoku Bank) issued statements of regret.

Incoming data point to  a  continuation of the economic expansion in  Germany during the fourth quarter, but there are tentative signs that the crisis in  Asia has begun to affect the outlook for exports. Industrial production rose 0.7 percent in October-November from its level in the third quarter. Manufacturing

orders remain at a  high level despite declines in  October-November. However, the decline in  October-November owed to  a  sharp drop in orders from foreign firms, as domestic orders rose, and points to diminished export prospects over the near term. Business confidence also dropped back slightly in  October and November but remained near its highest level in  almost three years. Conditions in  the labor market remain stagnant, however, with the all-German unemployment rate edging up  to 11.9 percent in  December. To some extent, the rise in  unemployment in  1997 resulted from the termination of government subsidized work programs in  the eastern states (the unemployment rate in  eastern Germany rose from 16 percent in  the fourth quarter of  1996 to 19.8 percent in  December). Price pressures remain modest, with preliminary CPI inflation for January at 1.2 percent on  a  12-month basis.

In France, economic activity in the fourth quarter is estimated to  have expanded at a  solid pace slowing somewhat from its rapid third-quarter rate. Domestic demand underpinned third-quarter GDP, and fourth-quarter data support a  continued broadening of

growth beyond the export sector. In  October-November, industrial production was 2.0 percent above its third-quarter average. The composition of  increased manufacturing output was consistent with strong foreign and domestic demand. Business surveys suggested that manufacturing output accelerated in each month during the fourth quarter. These surveys did not indicate that the slowing in  Asian economic activity or trucker's strike in  November had impacted production. The IP data, however, suggested that firms had increased production in  October in  advance of  the strike. Consumption of  manufactured products increased sharply in  October (owing to some special factors) and remained virtually flat in November and December. Stores reported buoyant holiday spending in December, and consumer sentiment remained at a  high level. Although the  unemployment rate edged down in  November to 12.4 percent (the first decline in the rate of  unemployment since September 1996), it still was only slightly below its post-war high. Meanwhile, inflationary pressures remain contained as consumer prices in December were 1.1 percent above their year-earlier level.

The pace of  economic activity in  the United Kingdom slowed somewhat in  the fourth quarter of  last year. The preliminary GDP release showed growth of  2.1 percent (SAAR). Output of  production industries was estimated to  have declined in  the quarter, reflecting weak manufacturing production and lower output of  utilities

industries owing to  unseasonably warm weather. However, consumer expenditure appears to  have remained strong on  average in the quarter, despite a  slight decline in  the average volume of  retail sales in  November and December. Total service sector output increased about 4  percent (SAAR). Since November, business sentiment has remained well below the average level earlier this year, reflecting increased concern over both domestic and export demand.

Conditions in the labor market appear to  have tightened further in  the fourth quarter. The claimant unemployment rate fell to 5 percent in  December. Based on  the quarterly Labour Force Survey, the LFS unemployment rate declined 0.5 percentage points to 6.6 percent over the September-November period, and LFS unemployment fell to  its lowest level since the series was introduced in  1984. Average earnings growth picked up in both October and November. primarily reflecting increased overtime and annual bonuses. Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.7 percent over the year to  December, remaining above the government's inflation target of  2  1/2  ercent p for underlying inflation.

In Italy, GDP rose 1.8 percent (SAAR) in  the third quarter. Final domestic demand was relatively strong with  both household consumption and business investment contributing positively. Net exports also contributed to third-quarter growth. Inventory accumulation, which contributed over 7  percent to second-quarter growth, slowed. Passthrough effects of the government's highly successful auto-tax incentives continued to provide stimulus to household consumption.

<!-- missing-text -->

Available fourth-quarter indicators point to  modest but continuing growth. Industrial production rose in  October and November. Consumer confidence declined slightly below its thirdquarter average, but remained higher than its level in  the second quarter.

Italian inflation, which reached record low levels last year, remains modest. In 1997, inflation was 1.8 percent on  a  year-overyear basis, sharply below the 3.9 percent consumer price inflation in 1996, and well below the official target of  2.5 percent. In January, data from eleven Italian cities, which carry a cumulative 76  percent weight in  the  national index, point to a  1.5 percent year-over-year increase in consumer prices.

On  December 24, the  Bank of  Italy cut its official discount and Lombard rates by  75 basis points each. Currently, the discount rate stands at 5-1/2 percent and the Lombard rate at 7  percent. Since July 1996, both the discount and the  Lombard rates have been lowered five times for a  cumulative 350 basis points. The latest cuts--widely expected by  market participants--were announced a  day after preliminary data indicated lower-than-expected consumer price inflation in  December and on  the day  the government's 1998 budget proposal passed through parliament.

On  January 2,  the Treasury Ministry announced that the 1997 public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) was slightly below $30 billion equivalent, compared with a  PSBR of  $70 billion equivalent a year ago. As  a  result, the 1997 budget deficit as  a  share of  GDP is now expected to  be  below the 3  percent Maastricht reference value-less than half the 6.7 percent deficit in  1996.

Real GDP in Canada rose 4.1 percent (SAAR) in the third quarter, following revised growth of  5.4 percent in  the second quarter. Consumption expenditures rose 5.3 percent, near the average of  the previous three quarters. Fixed investment surged, led by  investment in  machinery and equipment. Government expenditures rose slightly. Exports grew a  solid 10.1 percent, but imports increased a  rapid 19.9 percent, due to  strong domestic

demand growth for goods with  high import content, such as machinery and equipment, industrial goods, and automotive products.

Canada recently has enjoyed declining unemployment and low inflation. Unemployment--though still high--dropped from 9.0 percent in  November to  8.6 percent in  December, the  first time below 9  percent since September 1990. Employment showed strong gains, led by  an  expansion of full-time employment. Canadian consumer price inflation (on  a  twelve-month basis) decelerated to  0.7 percent in December, below the Bank of Canada's 1  to  3  percent target range. Contributing factors were  moderation in  auto price increases and  a decline in  gasoline prices.

The Bank of  Canada increased its key  Bank Rate 50  basis points, to 4.5 percent, on  December 12, the fourth increase in  the Bank Rate since June but the first move of 50 basis points in  more than two years. The  move  was explicitly aimed at defending the Canadian dollar, which had continued to  weaken to  near all-time lows despite a  previous rate hike on  November 25. The Canadian currency remained under pressure due to  Canada's worsening external balances and the belief that low inflation and relatively high unemployment would keep the  Bank of  Canada from raising rates aggressively in  the near future. The Canadian dollar fell to an  all-time low (below 69

US cents) on  January 22  following indications by  Bank of  Canada officials that the  Bank was  not uncomfortable with the current level of  monetary conditions.

Canada's trade surplus fell to $0.3 billion in  October (the lowest level since December 1993) but rebounded a  bit to $0.7 billion in  November. Fallout from the  Asian crisis showed through in  the weakness of  Canadian exports, whose decline partly reflected lower commodity prices (especially for primary metals and energy). In  addition, a  decline in  lumber exports was due largely to  reduced demand from Japan. The surge in  Canadian imports was led by investment goods (machinery and equipment, computer equipment, aircraft), as  Canadian firms continued their investment boom.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Financial turmoil has shown few signs of  abating in  the  ASEAN region and is reaching dangerous levels in  Indonesia. In  Korea, major commercial bank creditors agreed in  late December to  a voluntary arrangement to roll over claims on  Korean banks, which appears to  have succeeded, at least temporarily, in  halting a  run on Korea's banks. Negotiations on a  debt-restructuring agreement began on  January 21.

Financial turmoil has led to a  significant slowdown in growth in  Asia, with the exception of  Taiwan. The slowdown is particularly pronounced in  the major ASEAN countries, but it appears that growth began slowing in  Korea in  the fourth quarter, and also moderated in China in  the second half of the  year. Growth performance was good in  major Latin American countries in the second half of  1997. with the exception of  Brazil.

External imbalances in  the ASEAN region and  Korea have narrowed as a  result of  the fall in domestic demand and currency depreciations. In  China, surging exports contributed to  the largest trade surplus in its history in  1997.

Individual country and  ASEAN notes. In  Korea, there are already signs of substantial macroeconomic adjustment. Real activity appears to  have decelerated markedly in  November and December, due to  a  severe credit squeeze and high degree of  economic uncertainty. The  Bank of  Korea (BOK) estimated on a  preliminary basis that the growth rate of  industrial production slowed to  under four percent in  December on a year-over-year basis.

Korea's current account appears to  have achieved a  rapid turnaround into surplus, following substantial deficits during the past two years. The recent improvement in  the  current account reflects in  part a  large depreciation of  the  Korean won, reduced credit availability, and slowing growth. The depreciation of  the won  has translated into a  sharp rise in  import prices (which rose by 36 percent in  December from  their year-earlier level), and substantial upward pressure on  consumer prices.

The IMF  program announced in  early December failed initially to restore market confidence. The international run on  Korea's banks continued to drain the BOK's reserves through the first three weeks of  December, and the won declined substantially. Following

efforts by  the IMF and U.S. authorities to "tighten" the original program in  late December, the  major commercial bank creditors of Korea agreed to  a  voluntary arrangement to roll over claims on Korean banks. The  rollover arrangement effectively imposed a temporary standstill on  payments to creditor banks while a  long-term solution to  managing Korea's external obligations was formulated.

<!-- missing-text -->

The arrangement has been broadly supported by  the  major creditor banks of  Korea, including banks in  the United States, Japan, Germany, and France. It appears to  have succeeded in  halting the run on  Korea's banks (at least temporarily). The BOK's reserves stood at $11 billion on  January 22, up  from $4  billion at  their low on  December 18.

On  Wednesday January 21, a Korean delegation met in  New  York with the major creditor commercial banks to  begin negotiations on  a debt-restructuring agreement. The Koreans proposed to  restructure a substantial fraction of  the short-term liabilities of  Korean banks into longer-term obligations that would be  accompanied by  a sovereign guarantee.

Korea's President-Elect Kim  Dae Jung  has indicated strong support for the IMF program since his election on  December 18. Despite his reputation as  a  populist, Kim  supports legislation to increase labor market flexibility, including provisions that would make it easier for employers to lay off  workers.

Korean authorities have moved swiftly to  implement several key reforms mandated in  their IMF program. In  particular, Korea's National Assembly passed a  financial sector reform bill on  December 29 that grants independence to  the BOK  effective April 1;

consolidates authority for regulating the financial sector into a single regulatory agency; and requires corporations to  file consolidated accounting statements. The National Assembly also passed legislation that will facilitate the effort to clean up  the banking sector by  allowing the government to  write down shareholder equity when injecting capital into banks. The  Korean authorities also took important steps in  December towards opening the capital account by  allowing foreign investors much greater access to  Korean stock and  bond markets and by  giving domestic corporations greater ability to  borrow funds abroad.

In  the ASEAN region, the substantial increases in  interest rates since the onset of  the crisis, along with the effects of  the currency depreciations and associated declines in investor confidence, have slowed domestic demand growth considerably. In Thailand, industrial production in  October 1997 was 12  percent below its year-earlier level. In Indonesia and the Philippines, anecdotal reports suggest a  substantial slowdown in  economic activity in  the second half of 1997 from the pace in the first half of  the  year.

<!-- missing-text -->

Inflation has been rising in  some economies in the region, driven in  large part by  the sharp depreciation of  their currencies. In  Indonesia, inflation rose to over 11 percent by  end-1997; a  long drought has exacerbated the inflationary pressure. Inflation also picked up  a  bit in  the Philippines and  Thailand, but remains at low levels in  Malaysia and Singapore.

<!-- missing-text -->

Trade balances continued to improve in  most economies in  the region as a  result of  the real depreciation of  their currencies, the slowdown in  their growth, and strong industrial country growth. Thailand reported a  trade surplus in  October, in  contrast to a decade of  trade deficits.

On  January 15, Indonesian authorities announced that they  have reached agreement with the IMF on  a  "much strengthened and reinforced" economic program. The  major improvement over the previous program--which had been announced on  November 5--is that President Suharto has promised "to take personal responsibility for the quick and full implementation of  the program." The  four major elements of  the program are: (1)  a  tight monetary policy; (2) fiscal measures; (3)  structural reforms; and (4)  bank and corporate sector restructuring.

The Indonesian authorities renewed their commitment to  a  tight monetary policy until confidence in  the currency is  restored. Under the  new  program, Bank Indonesia will be  given greater autonomy to conduct monetary policy and determine interest rates. On  January 27, Bank Indonesia raised the rates on  its central bank certificates for all maturities. The Indonesian authorities will improve fiscal

performance by (i)  phasing out  most subsidies on  energy; (ii) improving fiscal transparency by  bringing several off-budget funds on  to  the  budget; and (iii) limiting spending on  infrastructure projects and eliminating tax and credit breaks granted to  the national airplane projects and the national car project. Additionally, distribution cartels will be  broken up, trade in agricultural products will be  deregulated, and barriers to foreign investment in  palm oil plantations will be  removed.

Despite these steps, the renewal of  the market's confidence is likely to  depend heavily on  the  crucial fourth element of the program, the plans to  restore the health of  the  banking and corporate sectors. On  January 26, Indonesian authorities announced reforms of  the banking sector and a  framework to  handle the renegotiation of  corporate debt. The  banking sector reforms consist of two components: (1) a  government guarantee to  depositors and creditors of  locally incorporated banks, and (2)  the creation of  a restructuring agency to  handle problem institutions. The guarantee is valid for both rupiah and foreign currency denominated loans (the latter are payable in rupiah at current exchange rates), is to  last for about two years, and is  to  be  followed by  the introduction of  a deposit insurance scheme. Shareholders and subordinated debt are excluded from the guarantee. The financial restructuring agency will supervise and manage the restructuring process of  problem banks, and will also serve as the management agency for assets that it  acquires in  the course of restructuring. The  Indonesian government will issue bonds to  cover the costs of the restructuring.

The corporate debt framework includes a  temporary freeze on financial, non-trade debt servicing, during which time depositors and creditors will be  encouraged to  arrange workouts. A  steering committee consisting of  senior international bankers from  the main creditor countries is  being set up, as is  a  contact committee of borrowers. The  framework will be  set up  and managed by  the private sector based on  voluntary agreements between borrowers and lenders. The scheme does not involve any government guarantee or  financing.

In Thailand, authorities have continued to take steps to improve the health of  the financial sector. On  January 24, the central bank took control of a failing mid-sized commercial bank, thereby increasing the pressure on  other struggling banks to  raise

capital quickly. In  the Philippines, the authorities announced their intention to seek further assistance from multilateral sources in  their efforts to  defuse the crisis.

In  Hong Kong, concerns about the currency peg remain. As  of late January, the yield spread between Hong Kong government debt and U.S. Treasuries remained 350 to 550 basis points at  maturities up to 10  years (the  longest maturity available), comparable to  the spread between Hong  Kong interbank rates and LIBOR U.S. dollar rates. Hong Kong's stock market, which fell 20 percent during 1997, has  fallen another 14 percent this year. Much of  that decline occurred following the failure of  Peregrine. Hong Kong's largest independent investment bank; press reports suggest concern about other, generally small, securities companies as  well.

Hong Kong authorities, as  well as  Chinese officials, continue to stress Hong  Kong's commitment to  the fixed peg  against the dollar. Foreign exchange reserves were $93 billion at the end of December, down about $4  billion from November. Hong Kong authorities estimate that GDP grew about 5.0 in  the third quarter of 1997 from the  year-earlier period, compared with growth of  6.5 percent in  the first half of 1997.

In  China, output growth was about 8  percent in  the second half of 1997 from the year-earlier period, and the 8.8 percent growth rate (year over year) for all of 1997 was the lowest rate of  growth since 1991. Inflation remained close to  zero. Exports surged 20 percent in  1997 from a  year earlier, contributing to  the  widest trade surplus in China's history; imports rose about 3 percent.

So  far, China has remained relatively unaffected by  the current financial crisis in  Asia. China's exchange rate has remained stable against the U.S. dollar, and the price of  domestic shares (which comprise 95 percent of  China's stock market, and  which foreigners cannot purchase) remain 30 percent higher than they were last July. Foreign-exchange reserves have risen steadily, reaching $140 billion at  the end of 1997, up $33 billion for the year.

China's currency is  not convertible on  the capital account, making a  speculative attack difficult. Chinese authorities had previously expressed a  goal of  moving towards capital account convertibility, but in  mid-January announced that, in  response to events in  Asia, they were postponing any such plans.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  addition, China announced plans to  accelerate reforms of the financial system, including a  reorganization of the People's Bank of  China, the central bank. to  make its structure more similar to  that of  the Federal Reserve system. In  particular, in order to reduce interference by  local authorities, the reforms would eliminate many of  the local and provincial branches, creating 10 regional headquarters that cut across provincial lines. Other reforms include increased efforts to  improve the quality of  bank assets by  closing unprofitable branches of  the state-owned commercial banks, and substantially increasing state allocations to write off non-performing loans. According to  Chinese officials, more than 20 percent of  bank loans are  non-performing, although only 5  to 6  percent of loans are  unrecoverable. However, western bankers often estimate that the proportion of  non-performing and unrecoverable loans may  be  much higher.

In Taiwan, industrial production surged in  the fourth quarter, while consumer prices have remained relatively flat. Very preliminary government statistics suggest that in  the fourth quarter, GDP growth was about 6.7 percent. If these statistics are accurate, the staff estimates that at a  seasonally-adjusted annual rate, growth was around 8  percent in  the third and fourth quarters. Taiwan's trade surplus narrowed substantially in 1997, as  exports rose 5  percent from 1996 and imports rose 12 percent.

The Taiwan dollar depreciated about 5  percent against the  U.S. dollar in  early January, following declines in  other Asian currencies. The stock market ended 1997 up 18 percent for the year, although it was 20 percent below its mid-summer peak. As  of January 28, the  market was down 1  percent for the year. At the end of November, international reserves were $83 billion, essentially

unchanged from a month earlier, and down $7  billion from their recent peak in June.

In Brazil, economic activity has weakened considerably. Industrial production plunged in  November in  the  wake of  the doubling of  interest rates at the end of  October from 20 to 40 percent. Inflation ended the  year at 4.3 percent (December-overDecember), Brazil's lowest inflation rate since the 1950s.

The sharp decline in  demand contributed to  a  narrowing in  the trade deficit in  December to  $0.8 billion, down considerably from the deficit of  $1.8 billion in the year-earlier period. The current account deficit for 1997 stood at $33.8 billion, about 4 percent of GDP. International reserves totalled about $52 billion (liquidity concept), down $8  billion from a  year ago. In  the capital account, direct foreign investment rose from $10 billion in 1996 to $17 billion in 1997, owing in part to  privatizations at the federal and

state levels. Other net capital inflows declined from $22 billion in  1996 to $8  billion in 1997, largely reflecting an  outflow of short-term capital.

So  far. Brazilian authorities have  maintained that they will not succumb to pressures to devalue the "real" and will keep interest rates high. The "real"/dollar exchange rate has continued to  depreciate slowly within a narrow crawling band (the so-called "mini-band") that is realigned about 0.6 percent each month. This narrow band moves within a  wider band (the  so-called "maxi-band) that has been realigned about once a  year. On  January 21, about a month before markets expected, the central bank realigned the "maxi" band, but the  implied maximum-allowable depreciation over the  next year is in  keeping with the current policy of  a  7  percent annual depreciation of  the "real"/dollar exchange rate. Therefore, financial markets interpreted the move as  a  continuation of  the existing policy.

The Cardoso administration has also continued its efforts at tackling Brazil's serious fiscal problems. In January, Congress convened an  emergency session to  consider constitutional reforms that are thought to  be crucial for fiscal stability.

In  Argentina, economic activity continues to  be  quite strong. Compared with the year-earlier period, industrial production rose almost 9 percent in  November while real GDP grew  more than 8 1/2 percent in  the third quarter of 1997. Moreover, the unemployment rate fell to 13.7 percent in  the October 1997 survey, down almost 5 percentage points from its peak in  mid-1995. Despite the decline in unemployment, inflation remains virtually non-existent. Strong growth led to a  trade deficit of  $2.5 billion through November of 1997, compared with a  surplus of  over $2  billion over the same period in 1996.

To  date, the turmoil in  Asia has not created any  undue pressures on  either convertibility or  the banking sector, although the  blue-chip Merval stock index has declined roughly 25 percent since the Asian crisis intensified in  late October. The real interest rate (measured using observed monthly inflation) on  30-day peso-denominated deposits rose over 500  basis points to  almost 12 percent in  November, but has been declining since then.

International reserves (excluding gold) stood at over $21 billion at  the end of December, up  roughly 7  percent from November. Deposits, which currently stand at nearly $70 billion and have more than doubled since the end of  the banking crisis in 1995, have not shown any substantial declines following the Asian crisis. The fiscal deficit (excluding privatization revenues) declined from $4.9 billion in 1996 (1.6 percent of  GDP) to $2.9 billion in  1997 (1 percent of  GDP), meeting the 1997 IMF target of $3  billion.

In  Mexico, economic activity remains strong, and unemployment has continued to  decline. Industrial production remains robust, and unemployment declined to  2.8 percent at  the end of 1997. Consumer price inflation has remained subdued. In  the twelve months to December 1997, consumer prices rose 16  percent, well below the inflation rate of  28 percent registered in 1996. In  December, the trade deficit was $0.7 billion; for  all of  1997, Mexico had a  small trade surplus of  $0.6 billion, down from a  surplus of  $6.5 billion in  1996. The recovery of  the economy and the real appreciation of the peso have contributed to faster growth of  imports than exports.

On  December 15, Finance Minister Guillermo Ortiz was nominated by  President Zedillo, and approved by  the senate, to  head the  Bank of  Mexico. Ortiz replaces Miguel Mancera, whose 15-year tenure ended last month with  his retirement. On  January 5,  Foreign Minister Jose Angel Gurria was named as the new Finance Minister; prior to  being Foreign Minister, Gurria held various high-ranking

economics posts. Economic policies under this new  team are  expected to remain essentially unchanged.

In  mid-December, the  Mexican congress passed the budget, ending a  stalemate that had  threatened to shut down the government. This budget does not include the  main tax cuts the opposition wanted, including a  reduction of  Mexico's value-added tax  to 12 percent from 15 percent, and is unlikely to raise the fiscal deficit by  much above the  administration's initial target of  1.25 percent of GDP. In January, the Mexican authorities announced additional spending cuts to offset an  expected decline in revenues of  0.4 percentage points of  GDP: the cuts are  expected to  come in  both current spending and investment. The  authorities expect that the estimated budget deficit of 1.25 percent of GDP for 1998 fiscal year will remain unchanged.

Mexican financial markets continue to  be  affected by the  Asian crisis. The  peso value of  the dollar, which opened the  year at  8.1, fell to the 8.2-8.3 range in  the second week of January, and  has remained volatile. At  the  most recent Treasury auction 28-day interest rates were 17.4 percent, below their mid-December rates but above their mid-October level.

In Venezuela, the  recent pick-up in  economic activity continues. The unemployment rate fell to 11.1 percent in  the fourth

quarter of  1997, compared with 12.4 percent in  the same period of 1996. The recovery has led to  a  widening of  external balances; the non-oil trade deficit moved to  roughly $6  billion in  the period from January to  October last year compared with around $4 billion in  the same months of  1996. Inflation picked up  last year:

December/December consumer price inflation for 1997 was 38  percent, compared with the original target of  25 percent agreed upon with the IMF.

The recent decline in  oil prices is likely to create fiscal problems for the government this year, and has led to  a  fall in international reserves which, excluding gold, stood at just under $14 billion at the end of  December, down 10  percent from November. The stock market has suffered due to  the decline in  oil prices coupled with the effects of  the  Asian crisis.

Responding to concerns that the  Venezuelan currency is overvalued, Venezuela's Central Bank in  January reset the central rate of  its currency band system and accelerated the rate at  which the bands depreciate from 1.16 to 1.28 percent per  month. In an attempt to tighten monetary policy to  curb inflation, the central bank also increased the discount rate to 60 percent from 45 percent, effective immediately.

In  Russia, recent data confirm the favorable macroeconomic trends of  1997. Real GDP showed a  12-month increase of 1.2 percent in  December, and for 1997 as a  whole edged up  0.4 percent, its first yearly rise since 1990. Industrial production was up  4.2 percent in the 12 months to  December. The  12-month consumer price inflation

rate continued to  edge down in  December, and at 11.1 percent was substantially below the 21.8 percent rate of  the previous December. Consistent with an  environment of  less inflation, the government introduced a  redenominated ruble at  the start of  the year, equal to 1,000 old rubles; the introduction of  the new ruble appears to  have gone smoothly. The government's draft budget calls for real GDP growth of  2 percent and inflation of  below 6  percent in 1998.

<!-- missing-text -->

The severe downward pressure on  the ruble which had developed in  November eased in  December after the central bank signaled its willingness to raise interest rates substantially to defend the currency. Foreign exchange reserves showed no  net decline during December, remaining at $18 billion, following a $5 billion decline in  November. Russian financial markets have continued, however, to remain vulnerable to occasional bouts of  pressure resulting from spillovers from the Asian financial crisis or adverse reports about President Yeltsin's health.

On  January 8,  the IMF approved the release of $800 million to Russia that had been held up  since September because of concerns over the government's ability to  collect taxes and meet its promised budget targets.
