Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales of New and Existing Homes

The recent data on both new and existing home sales are consistent with the tentative signs of stabilization in the housing market.  Sales of new homes held about flat in March at a February level that was revised up noticeably.  The stock of unsold new homes continued to fall in March and reached its lowest level since 2001, though, with sales still at a depressed level, months' supply remained extremely elevated.  Sales of existing single-family home sales edged down 3 percent in March, retracing much of February's increase.  These sales have now fluctuated for several months at a level a touch above 4 million units.

Orders and Shipments of Nondefense Capital Goods

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell 1.7 percent in March, resuming a downward trajectory after being flat in February.  New orders increased 1.5 percent last month after a rise of 4.3 percent in February.   These gains offset only part of 1 the sharp drop in new bookings that occurred in January.  With these data, the level of orders remains well below shipments, which points to further declines in shipments in coming months.

Within the high-tech category, orders and shipments of computers and peripherals dropped in March.  Shipments of communications equipment fell for the fourth consecutive month, but orders recovered further in March after the plunge around the turn of the year.  Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments fell steeply last month, and orders increased less in March than they were revised down in February.

The three-month moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders was down 1.5 percent in March, continuing to reflect the plunge of orders early this year.  This series-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-is one of the staff's indicators of near-term industrial production.

Correction to Part 1

In the table that appears on page 13 of Part 1 of the Greenbook, two lines were inadvertently mislabeled.  Specifically, the results reported as based on commercial loan credit standards from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey are in fact based on the change in bank credit standards from the survey; the results reported for the change in bank credit standards are in fact based on commercial loan credit standards.
