Contributing   the ollar's  preciation  ainst  he  mark  were  statements to d de ag t by several  undesbank  officials,  the eeks following  hairman  Greenspan's  eptember  4 B in w C S speech, ndicating  at  hey  did ot  believe    German rate  ut o e  warranted.  ost i th t n a c t b M

market analysts also came to believe that the effective exposure  of German banks to the Russian  crisis was not as large as had been feared  initially. Other euro-zone currencies followed  the mark's  movement, with the strain on currencies  reflected in a few sporadic intervention  operations and in small  movements  in spreads of government  bond yields relative  to German bunds. The exchange value of the British pound, which rose less against the dollar than most European currencies, was affected by the release  of data showing slower growth and a diminished inflation threat in the United Kingdom; this increased the perceived likelihood of a future monetary  easing by the Bank of England. Some other European currencies  outside of the euro-zone, particularly  in Scandinavia, also came under pressure.  The Norwegian krone,  which was affected by low oil prices, depreciated  about 4 percent against the mark

The exchange value of the dollar in terms of the Canadian dollar was little changed on balance.

Moody's September  3 downgrade of  the foreign-currency  debt ratings  of  Brazil and Venezuela and its placement of the debt of  Mexico  and Argentina on review reinforced the already pessimistic outlook about the region's financial  stability.  The Mexican peso, affected by  low oil  prices and concerns about neighboring Latin American economies,  found little support in soaring cete rates and repeated auctions of dollars by the central bank, with the  dollar up 8  1/2 percent against the peso during the period.

. Vast  capital outflows  were

reported in Brazil despite large increases in policy interest rates; Brazil's daily capital outflows  at times topped $2 billion but slowed  significantly by the third week of September, as numerous unconfirmed rumors circulated of a large international  lending package prepared by G-7 nations, led by the United States, and international  financial organizations. Columbia and Ecuador devalued their currencies  on September  2 and 13, respectively. There was widespread market commentary that the Venezuelan  bolivar, under additional pressure from low oil prices  and a difficult political situation,  would soon have to be devalued.

In Russia, the exchange rate of the ruble was difficult to assess with certainty since quotes originated in a very illiquid market, but a depreciation of at least 50 percent versus the dollar since August  17 was evident.

Equity prices in many of  the world's markets have fallen significantly  since the last FOMC  meeting,  in sessions often  marked by extreme volatility.  Immediately  after the Russian debt problems intensified, share prices of financial  sector firms in most industrial  economies declined, as investors  attempted to gauge the exposure of  various institutions.  Later, concerns about future earnings  of  corporations  faced with declining world demand appeared to be driving equity prices  lower.  In Asia, Japanese  share prices declined more than 6 1/2 percent from already extremely depressed levels.  Hong Kong share prices rose 4 percent,  supported by unusual equity purchase operations by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.  Share prices in many other Asian markets fell, particularly  in Indonesia and the Philippines.  European  equity indexes  fell  10 /2 percent (United 1 Kingdom) to 19 percent  (Spain -- where prices were most affected by losses in Latin America).  Canadian  share prices fell  8 1/2  ercent. p Latin American equity price were the most volatile; the Brazilian Bovespa  and the Argentine  Merval  lost over 21  percent, but the Mexican Bolsa gained 2 1/2  ercent. p

Nowhere was the flight-to-quality  theme more evident than in bond markets, with soaring yields on most emerging-market sovereign issues standing in contrast to recordlow yields on Japanese,  Canadian, European and U.S. government bonds.  The yield spreads over Treasury securities of most Latin American Brady bonds had widened over 500  basis points by mid-September, but bond prices retraced  some of  their losses  late in the period.  Yield  spreads of Asian dollar-denominated  debt also widened  to levels exceeding those of last fall.  The collapse of Russian financial  markets was evidenced by an increase  in the yield spread of the Russian dollar-denominated  Prin bond of  more  than 3000 basis points.  In the major foreign industrial economies, yields on bellwether government bond issues generally fell 25 to 55 basis points.  German and Japanese bond yields  fell 45 and 41  basis points, respectively,  reaching new historical lows  during the period. In addition, the yield spreads between core and periphery euro-zone  countries widened during the intermeeting period; the spread between Italian and German  10-year bellwether issues increased  11  basis points to 47 basis points.
