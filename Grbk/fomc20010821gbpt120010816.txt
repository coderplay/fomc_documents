International Developments

Overview

We have again substantially marked  down our forecast  for foreign  economic growth but continue  to expect a return to moderate expansion  next year.  In assessing  the magnitude  of the  downward revision  over the forecast period, we have taken into account  three factors. First, incoming  data on  activity abroad have been substantially weaker  than expected  for both industrial  and developing countries.  Second, the outlook for growth  in the United  States has worsened, with more protracted  weakness in the U.S. high-tech sector expected to have  a particularly adverse  impact on the exports  of Asian  emerging-market economies.  Third, in light of recent events, it now appears that Argentina will not be able  to avoid a severe  economic crisis  and related  substantial  drop in activity, with some negative  spillover to neighboring Latin American  countries. The projected  revival  in foreign growth is based on  an expected  strengthening  of U.S.  growth  as well as somewhat stimulative  macroeconomic  policy abroad. Lower  energy prices  are also expected to provide  some support to activity, although oil prices are being  held up to some extent by OPEC's apparent willingness  to cut back production in response to reduced world demand for oil.

The dollar has depreciated  about 2 percent on balance in terms of the broad index of our trading-partner currencies  since the June  Greenbook, as market concerns  about the relative  strength of the U.S.  economy  have mounted.  We project that the dollar will decline somewhat further between now and the end of next year.  The possibility of a sharp  fall rather than moderate  decline in the dollar remains  an important risk to the  outlook.  (See the alternative  scenario discussion  at the end of this section.)

NOTE.  Changes for years are measured  as Q4/Q4; for half-years, Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2.

As a consequence  of the weakening global  economy and the still-elevated  level of the dollar, exports  are expected  to make an unusual negative contribution to U.S. real output growth this year.  Very low U.S. growth should result in a

positive contribution from imports,  despite  the strong dollar.  Accordingly,  real net exports of goods and services are projected to make  an arithmetic contribution of about  zero to U.S.  GDP growth  this year as imports  and exports have offsetting  effects. However, we project that net exports  will resume making a negative  arithmetic  contribution to growth next year, given  the substantial  size of the trade deficit and the stronger rebound  in imports.

Recent Developments

International  financial markets.  On balance, the trade-weighted  index of the dollar's value against  major currencies declined nearly 3 percent, with most of this decline coming late in the intermeeting period. Indications  that sluggish U.S. economic activity  will continue longer than anticipated  have weighed  on the dollar, although economic  activity is also slowing more than previously expected in the euro area, Canada, and Japan.

On August 14, the Bank of Japan moved to ease monetary policy, raising its target for the outstanding balance of bank accounts held at the Bank and increasing  the pace of its outright purchases  of government  bonds.  The other notable changes in monetary policy stances by major foreign industrial countries during the intermeeting period were reductions of 25 basis points in target interest rates by the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England.  In all three of these cases, weakening activity was cited as the main reason for the change. Foreign long-term interest  rates generally  declined, and broad equity  indexes in most major industrial  countries moved lower over the period.

The main focus  of market  attention on emerging  financial markets  was Argentina, where widespread pessimism  about the country's ability to  stave off default and avoid a change in its currency regime  led to a sharp rise in the yield spreads on Argentine  sovereign  debt, large-scale  withdrawals  of currency from the Argentine banking system, and a drop in share prices.  Late in the period, speculation that the IMF and other multilateral  organizations  would extend Argentina an enhanced  support package  led to a slight improvement in financial market conditions. Although there has been some negative  financial  market spillover from Argentina to Brazil,  other emerging financial markets  appear unscathed so far.
