The Domestic Economy

Labor Market Developments

The labor market continued to improve in November.  Employment on private nonfarm payrolls rose 50,000-a bit below the increases of the previous two months-and aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.2 percent.   The unemployment rate ticked down to 5.9 percent. 1

The rise in payroll employment in November was widespread, with noticeable gains in temporary help services (21,000), non-business services (including 34,000 in education and health services and 21,000 in leisure and hospitality), and the construction industry (10,000).  Although cutbacks continued in manufacturing (-17,000), those losses have tapered off in recent months.  After adjusting for the effect of recent strikes at food stores, employment in retail trade was little changed in November.  Government employment rose 7,000, as increases at state and local governments more than offset a decline in federal government jobs.

The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers edged up 0.1 hour to 33.9 hours in November, the highest level since September 2002. Aggregate hours stood at their highest level since January.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point to 5.9 percent, the lowest level since March.  The number of persons unemployed less than five weeks declined noticeably in November, and the number of job losers dropped back for a second month.  However, the count of those jobless more than 26 weeks was little changed.  The household measure of employment rose sharply for a second month in November, and the labor force participation rate moved up 0.2 percentage point to 66.3 percent.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls inched up 0.1 percent in November, bringing the increase over the last twelve months to 2.1 percent, the lowest year-over-year increase since 1987.

Manufacturers' Inventories, Shipments, and Orders

The book value of manufacturers' inventories increased at an annual rate of $2.3 billion in October.  Paced by stockbuilding at manufacturers of transportation equipment and of computers and electronic products, inventories held by producers of durable goods rose at an annual rate of $7.2 billion. Producers of nondurable goods continued to liquidate stocks in October, with

the largest run-off at chemical manufacturers.  Overall, with shipments having risen 0.7 percent, the manufacturing inventory-shipments ratio edged down to 1.29 months, a new low.

Revised estimates of shipments and orders of durable goods were little changed from the advance release reported in Part 2 of the Greenbook.  As we noted, the Census Bureau reviewed its estimates of a second sharp monthly rise in new orders for communication equipment, but did not alter them significantly.

Consumer Credit

In October, consumer credit rose at an annual rate of 1/2 percent, down from a 10-1/2 percent pace in September; revolving credit posted a modest gain while nonrevolving credit fell slightly.

The International Economy

U.S. International Financial Transactions

October data on U.S. international financial transactions were transmitted to us after the Greenbook was finalized; they will be released to the public on or about December 15 th .

The October data revealed that foreign private demand for U.S. securities continued to be weak.  Following net sales of $10 billion in September, foreign private investors on net purchased only $3 billion in U.S. securities in October (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).  Demand for corporate bonds (line 4c) remained strong in the month, but sales of Treasuries (line 4a) were sizeable and private foreigners sold small amounts of agency bonds (line 4b) and equities (line 4d).  The weakness in inflows into U.S. securities was surprising, especially given anecdotal evidence of strong foreign demand for new agency and Treasury issues (which, in retrospect, likely owed to strong foreign official demand) and the strong performance of the U.S. equity markets.

In contrast to the weak private demand for U.S. securities, banking inflows (line 3) were exceptionally large in October and net foreign official inflows (line 1) continued at a robust pace.  The largest foreign official inflows were from Japan, Russia, and Australia.  Through the first ten months of 2003, foreign official inflows totaled $155 billion, far exceeding the previous annual record of $129 billion in 1996.  Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that foreign official reserves in custody there increased by an additional $30 billion during November.

U.S. investors continued their recent enthusiasm for foreign securities in October, purchasing on net $15 billion in foreign equities and bonds (line 5), following net purchases of $29 billion in the third quarter.
