The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Although revised figures now indicate that employment was still contracting in March, rather than having turned up as indicated previously, the report for April shows some signs of improvement.  Employment on private nonfarm payrolls posted a net gain of 41,000 in April; more industries added jobs last month than cut them, with the one-month diffusion index edging above 50 for the first time since March 2001. However, the average workweek declined a bit in April, leaving the index of aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers just below the first-quarter average.

Employment in the help-supply industry rose 66,000 in April, the second month in a row in which this industry has posted such a large gain.  The strength of the help-supply industry is closely linked to demand for workers in the manufacturing sector to which it provides many workers.  The job loss in manufacturing slowed further in April; the decline of only 19,000 was the smallest since the fall of 2000.  Within manufacturing, fabricated metals and industrial machinery-two of the industries hardest hit in this downturn-reported their first solid gains in more than a year; employment in the electrical equipment industry was unchanged, after having declined in each month since December 2000.  Transportation equipment, however, lost another 10,000 jobs, in part because of continued cutbacks in the aircraft industry.

Elsewhere in the economy, services industries excluding help-supply added jobs for the second month in a row.  The rise reflected a noticeable gain in engineering and management services and a further rise in employment in health services; these increases were offset in part by another drop in jobs in amusement and recreation services as firms appeared to cut back their usual spring hiring.  Other industries increasing their payrolls included retail trade (23,000), led by increases in eating and drinking establishments, and finance, insurance, and real estate (18,000).  On the downside, the construction industry posted its second large monthly decline (-79,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis) as hiring once again fell short of the seasonal norm.  Losses were widespread, but were particularly large in special trade contractors, which shed 61,000 jobs.

The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm payrolls ticked down 0.1 hour in April to 34.1 hours.  However, the manufacturing workweek held steady at 41.0 hours, and factory overtime edged up further.  Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers fell 0.2 percent in April, leaving the level of aggregate hours a shade below percent below the average last quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate rose 0.3 percentage point to 6.0 percent in April.  The labor force participation rate moved up 0.2 percentage point to 66.8 percent in April.  We believe that much of the increase in unemployment is the result of the federal Temporary Extended Unemployment Compensation program (TEUC).  Our view is that the program likely spurred some workers to return to the labor force to renew their claims for benefits and reduced the incentives for others to leave the jobless rolls.  Job losers unemployed less than five weeks as a percent of household employment-an indicator of the layoff rate-declined in again April.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls edged up 0.1 percent in April.  Over the twelve months ended in April, average hourly earnings increased 3.4 percent, nearly a percentage point less than the 4.3 percent rise in the previous twelve months.

Sales of Light Motor Vehicles

Sales of light motor vehicles rose in April to an annual rate of 17.1 million units-a stepup of almost 400,000 units from the March sales pace.  Most of the over-the-month increase (300,000 units) was the result of higher fleet sales at General Motors; the company's retail sales were flat last month.   Sales at 1 Ford edged up while sales at DaimlerChrysler ticked down.  Among the major Japanese firms, sales firmed a little at Toyota and Honda, but sales at Nissan fell back to about its recent average rate after having run up the month before.

Data from J.D. Power and confidential data from GM indicate that the overall level of incentives is currently at least as high as in October, and industry contacts report that there 'has been no let up' in competitive pricing pressures. Despite the improvement in its sales last month, GM's share of industry sales was still a bit below the company's target of 30 percent, and Ford's share was 2 percentage points below its average in the first half of 2001.  Because these shares are probably below levels acceptable to company executives, incentives may remain high in the near term.  Indeed, GM and Ford introduced new incentive packages to replace those that expired at the beginning of May.

Manufacturers' Inventories

The book value of manufacturers' inventories decreased at an annual rate of $33 billion in March, following a $27.6 billion liquidation in February. Shipments increased 0.7 percent in March, and the manufacturing inventoryshipments ratio declined to 1.36 months from 1.38 months.  For the first

quarter as a whole, manufacturers' inventories fell at a $33.7 billion rate, after having declined at a $51.8 billion rate in the fourth quarter. 2

Stocks held by manufacturers of durable goods declined in most categories in March.  Aircraft manufacturers recorded an extraordinary drawdown ($22.5 billion), and sizable liquidations continued at manufacturers of computer and electronic products, primary metals, machinery, and electrical equipment.  For the durable goods category as a whole, shipments were unchanged and the stock-to-shipments ratio declined to 1.56 months, toward the low end of readings in the last year.  Nevertheless, the stock-to-shipments ratio remains above trend at manufacturers of electrical equipment.

At producers of nondurables, inventory declines were widespread and generally small.  Shipments of nondurable goods increased 1.6 percent, and the stock-to-shipments ratio declined to 1.12 months. Nonetheless, inventoryshipments ratios remained somewhat elevated for manufacturers of chemicals, beverage and tobacco, and leather and allied products.

Revised data on orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods in March, which were released with report on manufacturers' inventories, are summarized in updated versions of the table and chart that appeared on pages II-24 and II-25 of Greenbook, Part 2 .
