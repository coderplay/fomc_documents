Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales and Prices of Existing Homes

Sales of existing single-family homes declined 2 percent in December to an annual rate of 4.31 million units; data on pending home sales through November and other indicators of housing demand had instead implied a small increase.  Still, existing home sales continue to paint a noticeably less downbeat picture of housing demand than do the data on sales of new single-family homes.  Sales of condos and co-ops also moved down in December, and the declines in total existing home sales were spread across all four Census regions. The average price of existing single-family homes sold fell 5 percent in the twelve months ending in December, similar to the readings for this series seen in recent months.
