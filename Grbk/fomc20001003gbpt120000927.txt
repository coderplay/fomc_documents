The Backdrop for  the orecast F

Private  ong-term  nterest  tes  ave  not hanged  materially om  their vels  t l i ra h c fr le a the  time  of he ugust  Greenbook.

Recent  Developments

The intervention,  itiated    the CB, took lace n in by E p o September  22,  the  day  before  he eeting f he t m o t G-7 finance inisters d m an central  ank  governors,  nd  was accompanied y  a  statement  xpressing b a b e

concern  about the potential implications  of  the recent movements  m the euro  for the world economy.  U.S. monetary authorities purchased $1.3  billion of euros, the first U.S.  intervention  in foreign  exchange markets since June  1998.  The Desk's purchases  were split evenly between the accounts  of the System  and the Treasury.

On balance, the  dollar is up about  1 percent  since the August FOMC meeting  in terms  of  both our major  foreign currencies  index and the index of currencies of our other important trading partners.  Both short-term  and long-term  interest rates  abroad were generally  little changed over the same period. The only significant policy move was a 25-basis-point  increase  in official rates by the ECB on August 31  that essentially had already been priced into market interest rates. Equity prices  shed 2 to  5 percent  in the industrial countries  and were down more significantly  in many of the emerging  market economies.

Economic  activity abroad. In the foreign industrial countries, recent data indicate  some moderation in the current quarter from the robust pace of growth in the first half of  the year. This pattern mostly  owes to variations in Japanese growth, which had rebounded sharply in the first half from  a very weak level in 1999:Q4 and received a further impetus from a surge  in public  investment spending  in 2000:Q2.  With the all-industry index of activity  flat in July relative to the second quarter and  shipments of both machinery  and consumer goods down, the  current quarter  likely has  seen a sharp  deceleration  in activity.  In Canada as well, sluggish employment  growth in July and August points to some slowing  following  first-half growth averaging  nearly 5 percent, although demand indicators  suggest that the pace of expansion remains  above potential. Protests over higher oil prices  in some European countries may have had a measurable,  albeit temporary, effect on third-quarter  output.

Headline  inflation in the foreign  industrial countries is clearly  showing the impact of  the recent oil price increases. However,  spillover effects have been limited so  far, as core prices have shown only  a mild acceleration. Twelvemonth headline inflation  in the  euro area, which has also been boosted by the weakness of the  euro, was about 2  1/4 percent in August, up from less than  1 percent a year  and a half ago  and above  the ECB's  2  percent ceiling.  In Japan, where only  a small portion of the increase in oil prices has shown up in the consumer price index, the  rate of consumer price  deflation  has intensified  in recent months.

Growth  in the developing countries is somewhat  uneven, but on balance activity in both the  Asian and the Latin American  regions remains firm.  The strength in Asia is fairly widespread  across  countries, with third-quarter  indicators pointing to  growth averaging  somewhat above 5 percent. Growth in Mexico appears  to
