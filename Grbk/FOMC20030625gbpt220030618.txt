Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

The economy appears to have expanded at a subpar pace in the current quarter, and the incoming data have provided mixed signals about the trajectory of economic activity as we move toward the second half of the year.  Businesses still have been reluctant to hire, and we have seen no sign yet of any substantial pickup in their capital spending.  However, consumer confidence rebounded substantially after the war with Iraq, and, adjusted for inflation, retail sales in May more than reversed their drop in April.  Homebuilding has flattened out, albeit at a high level.  In the public sector, federal defense outlays are up sharply, outweighing by a significant margin the spending restraint of state and local governments.  Meanwhile the year-over-year change in core consumer prices edged up in May after having moved lower during the early spring.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market showed some signs of stabilizing in April and May.  After having fallen 35,000 per month in the first quarter of the year, employment on private nonfarm payrolls edged up 8,000 in May, after an upward-revised increase of 2,000 in April.  Employment in manufacturing continued to fall last month, although employment in temporary help services-which supplies many of its workers to manufacturing-picked up noticeably.  Employment in construction rose substantially for the third consecutive month, and financial activities continued to add jobs.  However, employment in services industries-excluding temporary help supply-was essentially unchanged. Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in May after having fallen 0.3 percent in April.

In the survey of households, the unemployment rate, which is considered to be a lagging indicator, edged up further to 6.1 percent in May. The recent rise in joblessness has reflected an increase in both incidence and duration:  The numbers of short-term job losers and longer-term unemployed have both increased.  The labor force participation rate, which continues to be depressed by the paucity of jobs, was essentially unchanged, at 66.4 percent.

In keeping with its usual practice, the May labor market report included the BLS's benchmark of payroll employment estimates to unemployment insurance tax records for March 2002 as well as other annual updates to the payroll employment estimates. 1 In addition, the establishment survey program was converted from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system to the North

American Industrial Classification System (NAICS). 2 As a result of these changes, payroll employment is now estimated to have fallen more in 2002 than previously reported but to have contracted less thus far this year.  On net, in the twelve months following the benchmark date of March 2002, the cumulative decline in private payroll employment is now only 40,000 steeper than estimated earlier.  However, the revised figures now show a 0.1 hour decline in the workweek over the period rather than a 0.1 hour increase. 3

The revised data now show that the decline in aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers was more than 3/4 percentage point per year steeper in 2001 and 2002 than reported earlier.  The change in aggregate hours (at an annual rate) was also revised down 1-1/4 percentage points in the first quarter of this year.  The BLS will use these revised figures in estimating its broader measure of hours of all persons for its productivity and costs measures. However, because of the extent of the recent changes to both the household and payroll estimates, considerable uncertainty exists as to how the hours data will be revised.  Currently, the BLS expects to update the hours series, and associated productivity series, for release with its preliminary estimates of second-quarter productivity and costs in August.  Even if the BLS adheres to that schedule, the productivity estimates will likely change further after the benchmark revision to the output estimates in the national income and product accounts in December.

Despite the better readings on payroll employment in April and May, initial claims for unemployment insurance have shown little improvement over the past couple of months.  The four-week moving average of initial claims stood at 434,000 for the week ended June 7, nearly the same as the average level in early April.  Insured unemployment rose to 3.8 million for the week ended May 31 and now stands more than 400,000 above its recent lows in January.

Other labor market indicators have yielded mixed signals.  After having deteriorated in February and March, households' perceptions of current labor market conditions were little changed in April and May, according to the Conference Board survey.  Expectations of future labor market conditions improved noticeably in May in both the Conference Board and Michigan surveys but then deteriorated a bit in early June, according to the preliminary release of the Michigan survey.  Among firm-level indicators, the hiring plans of small businesses, as reported by the National Federation of Independent

Businesses, were unchanged in May from their low level.   In contrast, layoff 4 announcements tumbled in May, according to the outplacement firm Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., although the Board staff's tally so far for June suggests that they have moved back up.

Productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first quarter, bringing the change over the four quarters ending in 2003:Q1 to 2.4 percent-down from its heady 4.4 percent pace over the preceding four quarters.   n the nonfinancial corporate sector, productivity rose 2.9 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter and 4.3 percent over the four quarters ending in 2003:Q1-down from 5.2 percent over the preceding four quarters. I

Industrial Production

Activity in the industrial sector stabilized in May after sizable drops in the preceding two months.  Total industrial production edged up 0.1 percent in May, and manufacturing output was up 0.2 percent.  Nonetheless, the factory operating rate was at 72.6 percent in May, the lowest level since 1983.  As of May, manufacturing production had eked out a cumulative gain of just 0.6 percent since the December 2001 trough in IP, by far the weakest recovery since World War II.

<!-- missing-text -->

The improvement in manufacturing activity in May was broadly based.  In the transportation sector, motor vehicle assemblies dropped again but by less than in the previous three months.  An increase in the production of aircraft and parts in May partially recouped a strike-induced decline in the output of military aircraft in April.  Industry contacts suggest that the remaining lost production will be made up in June.

Manufacturing activity within the high-tech sector continued to expand, on balance, although developments have been mixed.  Steady gains in computer output since the beginning of the year have boosted the production of highvalue-added semiconductor chips, such as microprocessor units, in recent months, while the production of other semiconductors, particularly those used in cell phones, softened significantly in April and May. 5 Output of communications equipment-cell phones, equipment used by telecommunications service providers, and the routers, switches, and hubs used in computer networks-dropped in May after having moved sideways, on balance, since the beginning of the year. 6

Apart from transportation and high-tech, factory production was up 0.3 percent in May after having declined 0.8 percent in April.  Among upstream market groups, the output of construction supplies turned up in May after having contracted in each month since September, and the output of materials also moved up.  However, the production of business supplies continued to be lackluster.  Among market groups that align with final demand categories, production results were generally positive.  The output of defense and space equipment jumped another 2 percent in May, bringing the average gain so far this year to 0.9 percent per month.  In addition, the production of consumer goods (excluding motor vehicles) rose in May.  In contrast, restrained capital spending continued to depress the production of business equipment, which was unchanged in May and remained well below its level in May 2002.

Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity are generally consistent with a further small rise in industrial production in June.  The May readings on new orders from the diffusion indexes from the Institute for Supply Management and various regional surveys all improved in May and suggest modest gains in

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

manufacturing activity apart from motor vehicles and parts.   The first glimpse 7 at June from the Empire State survey also showed a pickup.  The three-month moving average of real adjusted durable goods orders dipped in April and is consistent with little change in IP.   Based on the limited data in hand, motor vehicle assemblies are on track to move up toward an annual rate of 12 million units in June-which would add 0.1 percentage point to the rate of change in IP. Apart from motor vehicle assemblies and electricity generation, scant available data suggest that the weekly physical product aggregate will contribute a little to IP in June.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light motor vehicles declined slightly in May, to an annual rate of 16 million units.  Taken together, April and May's sales averaged 16.2 million units, a bit above the sales pace of 15.8 million units in the first quarter.   n an attempt to bolster sales, automakers raised incentives during April and May, offering a record high average of $2,200 per vehicle in May.  However, the surge in sales that has accompanied previous sweetenings of incentives has not I

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

yet materialized.  Perhaps because the window on these current deals is open longer (through July), the sales response will be spread over several months. Indeed, some industry contacts have reported a noticeable step-up in sales so far in June.

The general softness in business demand for new capital has been reflected in tepid gains in the sales of motor vehicles to businesses.  Fleet sales of light vehicles were little changed in April and May from their first quarter pace of about 3 million units.  However, sales of medium and heavy trucks turned up a bit in April and May, and new orders for medium and heavy trucks rose in May.

Although production of light motor vehicles fell from an annual rate of 12.7 million units in January to an 11.3 million unit rate in May, inventories remain high.  With stocks of 3 million units at the end of May, dealers held more than seventy days' supply of light vehicles, well above the target range of sixty to sixty-five days.  Despite elevated inventories, manufacturers' thirdquarter schedules call for a jump in assemblies to 12.6 million units, nearly 1 million units more than in the second quarter.  As noted earlier, the partial data for June suggest that assemblies are ramping up.  However, an underbuild relative to current plans would not be surprising, given that inventories are high and that, over the last ten years, third-quarter assemblies have averaged 3 percent below the scheduled rate.  That said, the higher schedules may instead represent a hedge against possible production disruptions related to the upcoming contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers (UAW) union. 8

Consumer Spending

Real personal consumption expenditures are likely to post another modest gain in the second quarter after a 2.0 percent (annual rate) increase in the first quarter.  Spending on motor vehicles has risen a bit, on net, relative to the first quarter, while real consumer outlays excluding cars and trucks, which were flat in April, rebounded in May. At the same time, the fundamentals underlying household spending have become more favorable:  Real disposable income has posted solid gains (driven largely by the retreat in energy prices), and both the stock market and consumer confidence have recovered smartly from earlier in the year.

In May, nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which excludes automotive dealers and building materials and supply stores, edged up 0.1 percent following a decrease in April of 1.0 percent.  Falling prices pushed down nominal sales at gasoline stations last month, but spending rose substantially at most other categories of retail outlets.  Factoring in the effect of declining prices, we estimate that real retail control increased a robust 0.7 percent in May, more than reversing April's decrease of 0.3 percent.

Real outlays on services rose moderately in April, the most recent month for which data are available.  Much of this increase was due to higher expenditures on energy services.  Spending on non-energy services has been tepid so far this year-held down, in part, by weak outlays for airline travel and recreation.

After having posted a substantial rebound in April and May, consumer sentiment retreated somewhat in early June, according to the Michigan SRC index.  The recent fallback occurred as households' expectations for business conditions-both twelve months and five years hence-reversed part of the improvement registered in the preceding two months.  Assessments of current conditions were little changed in early June.  Despite the latest decline in the Michigan index, both the Michigan and Conference Board indexes remain well above their low levels reached earlier in the year.

Housing Markets

Activity in the housing market has been reasonably well maintained in recent months, as further declines in mortgage rates have offset much of the downward pressure from the soft labor market.  Homebuilding was likely held down a bit last month by the unusually wet weather.  Yet starts of single-family homes rose to an annual rate of 1.38 million units, leaving the April-May average only a little below the first-quarter pace.  New permit issuance-adjusted for activity in areas where permits are not required-was at an annual rate of 1.37 million units in May, close to the first-quarter average; in addition, the backlog of unused permits remained near its record high.  Along with sharply lower mortgage rates, these indicators suggest that single-family starts are likely to remain strong in coming months.  In the multifamily sector, starts rebounded sharply from their April low and rose to an annual rate of 354,000 units in May, a bit above the average over the preceding six months. With vacancy rates high and rents declining, multifamily starts are unlikely to strengthen significantly anytime soon.

New home sales, which have been exceptionally vigorous during the past year, reached an annual rate of 1.03 million units in April, the third-highest level on record.  Existing home sales-adjusted by the staff to eliminate trading-day

<!-- missing-text -->

variation-were about unchanged in April at an annual rate of 5.76 million units, also one of the highest levels on record. 9

Other indicators of housing demand are also quite robust.  The four-week moving average of the Mortgage Bankers Association index of purchase applications has moved up sharply since mid-May to a new record high.  The Michigan Survey's early-June measure of household attitudes noted a slight drop in homebuying attitudes that was mainly due to apprehension about employment prospects.  Nonetheless, the level of the index remains high, with fully three-quarters of respondents mentioning low mortgage rates as a factor contributing to favorable homebuying conditions.

House prices decelerated modestly in the first quarter but continued to post solid gains.  The quality-adjusted price of new homes sold last quarter was 2.6 percent higher than a year earlier after having posted a 5.9 percent gain during the preceding year.  The repeat-sales price of existing homes, which provides a better reading of the value of the overall stock of housing, was 6.4 percent higher in the first quarter of 2003 than in the first quarter of 2002. Although this increase was a bit smaller than the 7 percent increase seen during the previous year and well below the outsized gains seen in 2000 and 2001, prices of existing homes have continued to increase at a faster pace than they did in the mid- and late-1990s.

Business Fixed Investment

Equipment and Software. Business demand for new capital has remained soft. Real outlays on equipment and software (E&amp;S) fell at an annual rate of 6.7 percent in the first quarter of 2003, more than reversing the increase posted in the fourth quarter of last year.  Excluding outlays for transportation equipment, E&amp;S spending rose on average 1-1/2 percent in both quarters, and the data on new orders and shipments in April (the latest available) point to only a moderate pickup in the current quarter.  The fundamental drivers of business investment are generally lackluster, with the four-quarter changes in business output and real corporate cash flow early this year both smaller than in the second half of last year.  Nonetheless, the user cost of capital continues to fall.

In the high-tech sector, nominal shipments of computers soared 20.2 percent (not at an annual rate) in April after two months of declines.  Since the middle of 2001, computer shipments have tended to spike in the first month of each quarter and to fall back in the second and third months.  Nevertheless,

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

smoothing through the recent swings, computer shipments continue to trend upward; and paired with double-digit decreases in prices, we expect a solid gain in real computer outlays this quarter.  Shipments of communications equipment decreased 3.3 percent in April and have been essentially flat since the beginning of the year.  Orders for communications equipment also edged down in April, although they remained above the level of shipments for the fourth consecutive month.  Orders and shipments of non-high-tech equipment both fell back in April after strong showings in March.  These two series have moved essentially sideways over the past few months.

Business outlays for transportation equipment appear poised to make a modest contribution to the overall increase in equipment spending this quarter.   n particular, business spending on autos and trucks seems to have edged up in April and May, and the rise in new orders for medium and heavy trucks in May suggests some impetus to transportation investment for the coming months.   n contrast, despite a slight increase in Boeing's production schedules in May, the most recent data on shipments and net exports of aircraft indicate that outlays for aircraft by domestic carriers continue to languish at half the level of a year ago. I I

Nonresidential construction. Real investment in nonresidential structures continued to fall in the first quarter, although we estimate that the decline slowed to an annual rate of 2-1/4 percent. 10 Outlays for office buildings were down roughly 13 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter, and the data for April

<!-- missing-text -->

suggest that a further drop is likely in the current quarter.  With falling rents and rising vacancy rates, the oversupply of office space has shown few signs of abating.  Spending on industrial buildings contracted at an annual rate of about 8 percent in the first quarter, and again the data for April point to another decline in the current quarter.  Outlays for institutional buildings fell at an annual rate of nearly 7 percent in the first quarter, offsetting part of the fourthquarter rise, and investment in structures by public utilities contracted at an annual rate of roughly 6 percent.

Real investment in two categories of nonresidential structures moved up in the first quarter, but these gains seem unlikely to be repeated in the second quarter. Spending in the other commercial sector rose at an annual rate of nearly 10 percent in the first quarter, but fell on a monthly basis in both March and April.  Moreover, rents for both retail space and warehouses fell again in the first quarter, suggesting demand for such space remains very weak.  Similarly, spending for lodging and miscellaneous structures rose 3-1/2 percent in the first quarter but edged down in April.

In the drilling and mining sector, outlays increased in the first quarter at an annual rate of 18 percent.  The sharp increase in the number of natural gas drilling rigs in operation from April through mid-June indicates that drilling activity has responded to higher natural gas prices, and suggests that spending on drilling and mining structures will likely increase again in the second quarter.

Business Inventories

The book value of manufacturing and trade inventories excluding motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of $25.6 billion in the first quarter.  However, in real terms, these stocks were little changed.  Book-value stocks excluding motor vehicles declined at an annual rate of $5.4 billion in April, and our guess is that they again were little changed in real terms.

By industry, book-value manufacturing inventories were nearly unchanged in April, as stock-building by manufacturers of nondurable goods was about offset by a runoff at producers of durable goods.  Non-auto wholesalers liquidated inventories at an annual rate of $5.4 billion in April, in large part the result of a runoff at wholesalers of professional and commercial equipment.  Non-auto retailers' stocks edged down in April after large run-ups in the preceding five months.  Book-value inventories in all three categories stand at historically very low levels relative to shipments and sales.

In May, days' supply in the staff's flow-of-goods system pulled back a bit but remained at an elevated level, primarily because of the high level of motor

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

vehicle stocks. 11 Excluding motor vehicles and parts, the inventoryconsumption ratio has, on balance, moved sideways at a low level since late 2002.  Outside of motor vehicles, imbalances are few and include textile mill products, paper, communications equipment, and electrical equipment.

Government Sector

Federal. According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, defense spending in April jumped 30 percent above the year-earlier level.  Although the more recent daily data indicate much smaller year-over-year increases in these outlays, the cumulative data indicate a large increase in defense spending this quarter. Monthly data for April show that outlays excluding defense were essentially flat, a reflection of persistent slowing in spending across many categories and of one-time declines recorded for several loan programs due to revaluations of the subsidy value of the loans.

At the same time, the monthly Treasury data for April and daily data through June 17 continue to point to weakness in federal receipts.  April collections were 2-1/2 percent below last year's level, as a sharp drop in nonwithheld individual income and self-employment taxes was only partially offset by a rebound in corporate income tax receipts.  While daily data through June 16 indicate that corporate receipts continued to post strong gains relative to year-earlier figures, the increased bonus depreciation provision of the Jobs And Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act should begin to significantly damp increases in corporate collections in coming quarters as a greater share of investment spending falls under the new provision..

Principally because of the enactment of the new tax law, the Congressional Budget Office now expects the fiscal year 2003 budget deficit to exceed $400 billion.  In addition, pending legislation, if enacted, would raise spending on Medicare and several other nondefense programs.

The new tax legislation accelerates the phase-in of many of the key provisions of the 2001 Tax Act, although on a temporary basis for some of the provisions. The main changes affecting individuals include a boost to the child tax credit effective for 2003, which will be delivered primarily through a round of advance

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

refund checks that will be sent out between July 25 and August 8.  In addition, the new act speeds up the scheduled reductions in marginal rates, cuts the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains realizations from 20 percent to 15 percent through 2008, and sets the tax rate on most dividend income equal to the capital gains rate through 2008.  Employers are slated to adjust withholding by the beginning of July of this year.  On the business side, the act bumps the temporary 30 percent depreciation bonus enacted last year up to 50 percent and extends its expiration date from September 11, 2004, until the end of 2004.

In addition to the tax bill, the Congress recently extended through December the temporary unemployment benefits program that was slated to expire at the end of May.  The Senate and House have passed versions of a small expansion of the child tax credit, while the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means Committees have  approved versions of a Medicare bill that adds a prescription drug benefit beginning January 2006.

State and local governments. Indicators of state and local spending continued to deteriorate in the second quarter.  Employment fell 21,000 in May after a small rise in April.  The revised figures for employment now show a net decline so far this year, with a sizable drop in employment at the state level dwarfing a slight increase at local governments.  Real construction spending edged down in April after larger declines in the two preceding months, and it is now at its lowest level since October 2001.  Declines were concentrated in spending for buildings and for highways.

Despite the recently enacted addition of $20 billion in federal aid, many state governments are still scrambling to pass a balanced general fund budget for fiscal year 2004, which begins in less than two weeks.  Along with spending cuts, many states are enacting tax increases.  As they did in fiscal year 2003, many jurisdictions will also likely plug budget gaps by borrowing both from rainy day and other funds and by issuing bonds. And more states than in recent years have employed other, one-time measures, such as moving payments into the next fiscal year and selling assets.

A  recent survey from the National League of Cities indicates that declining income and sales tax receipts and reductions in state aid have led to sharply deteriorating fiscal conditions in many cities.  In the aggregate, about 20 percent of city revenue comes from state aid, with another 17 percent from sales taxes and income taxes.  So far, property taxes, which account for around 20 percent of city revenue, have held up fairly well, bolstered by continued strength in housing markets.  The weakness in revenues comes at a time of intensifying pressure to spend for homeland security and public safety needs.

Prices and Labor Costs

Overall consumer prices have been moved around in recent months by large swings in energy prices.  After having risen rapidly earlier this year, consumer energy prices fell sharply in April and May in the wake of the drop in crude oil prices in late March.  The plunge in energy prices pushed the twelve-month change in the overall consumer price index down to 2.1 percent in May from its recent peak of 3.0 percent in March.  Nonetheless, overall inflation remains considerably higher than the 1.2 percent rate recorded a year earlier.

The CPI excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent in May after no change in March and April; the May increase reflected a 0.5 percent jump in the prices of non-energy services.  By contrast, the index for core commodities fell 0.4 percent last month, with price declines posted for most categories of goods. The core CPI has increased only 1.6 percent over the last twelve months, well below the 2.5 percent run-up during the comparable period a year earlier.  The most recent twelve-month change is about 3/4 percentage point above our point estimate of 0.9 percentage point for the measurement bias in this series.

Core PCE prices edged up 0.1 percent in April (the latest available data) and likely increased 0.1 percent again in May.  We estimate that core PCE prices rose 1.3 percent over the twelve months ending in May, compared with a 1.7 percent increase over the preceding year.  The 1/2 percentage point deceleration in the PCE measure of core inflation is noticeably less than the 1 percentage point deceleration in the core CPI over the same period, a difference that largely reflects the wider scope of PCE prices.  Over the past year, the deceleration in the CPI-based portion of PCE has been in part offset by a pickup in the prices of PCE items that are not included in the CPI and for which no market-based prices are available.  Most noticeable have been an upswing in imputed service charges at financial institutions and a sizable increase in prices for travel abroad.  By contrast, the market-based component of the core PCE price index is estimated to have risen only 3/4 percent over the twelve months ending in May, down 3/4 percentage point from a year ago. 12 The most recent twelve-month change is a touch above our point estimate of 0.5 percentage point for the measurement bias in this index.  The core portion of the chained CPI, which like the PCE price index uses a superlative aggregation formula intended to take into account substitution by consumers in response to changes in relative prices, rose 1.0 percent over the twelve months ending in May, a deceleration of about 1 percentage point from the previous year.

Consumer energy prices fell 3.1 percent in May, as retail prices of gasoline and fuel oil dropped sharply for the second consecutive month.  Survey data for the first half of June point to a small increase this month in the CPI for gasoline on a seasonally adjusted basis.  The May decline in consumer natural gas prices reflected a dropoff in demand due to mild temperatures.  Because the level of natural gas inventories remains very low, natural gas prices are likely to remain quite volatile in the months ahead.  In contrast to the declines posted for other energy prices, the CPI for electricity increased 1.5 percent in May, likely reflecting the lagged effects of higher fuel input costs.

Consumer food prices increased 0.3 percent in May and have risen 1.7 percent over the past twelve months.  Fruit and vegetable prices turned up last month, more than reversing their April decline, and food away from home (about 40 percent of the overall food category) posted a modest increase that is broadly consistent with its long-run trend, tracking movement in the core CPI.

According to the PPI, capital equipment prices edged up in May after a large decline in April.  These prices have been quite volatile of late, owing primarily to erratic movements in the PPI for light motor vehicles.  Over the past twelve months, the PPI for capital equipment edged up, on balance, compared with a slight decline over the previous twelve months.

Prices at earlier stages of processing have decelerated recently, reflecting the direct and indirect effects of the decline in energy prices.  The PPI for intermediate materials fell in both April and May, while prices for core intermediate materials were about unchanged.  The most noticeable of the energy-related swings in core intermediate materials prices in recent months occurred in the prices of plastics, fertilizers, and industrial chemicals.

Spot commodity prices have moved up somewhat since the previous Greenbook. Both the Journal of Commerce and Commodity Research Bureau industrial price indexes have risen about 1-1/2 to 2 percent over that period.  In the agricultural sector, corn and soybean crops are off to a good start; however, spot prices for these commodities have fluctuated around levels that remain about 1/4 percent higher than a year earlier.  In contrast, a bumper crop of wheat has depressed spot prices of that crop.  The Commodity Research Bureau's index of futures prices, which includes both food and other commodities, is up about 2-1/4  percent since the April Greenbook.

Median expected one-year inflation as measured by the Michigan Survey dropped further, to 2.0 percent in May and early June, lower than any full month since January 2002.  Median expectations of inflation over the next five to ten years edged down 0.2 percentage point in early June, to 2.6 percent.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

The May FOMC announcement pointing to the risks of 'an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation,' along with subsequent comments by the Chairman and other Federal Reserve officials later in the intermeeting period, seemed to convince investors that the FOMC would move policy aggressively and hold rates lower for longer than previously expected to ward off any incipient deflationary pressures.  This sizable downward revision in the market's expected path for policy pulled down Treasury and private yields and boosted equity prices.

The drop in longer-term interest rates spurred another wave of debt restructuring in both the business and household sectors.  Firms issued a large volume of bonds, with the proceeds slated primarily to pay down commercial paper and bank loans, and record numbers of households flocked to refinance home mortgages.  State and local government borrowing also picked up.  Federal borrowing was robust over recent weeks, reflecting somewhat weaker-thanexpected tax receipts and an increase in defense spending stemming from the war in Iraq.

Policy Expectations and Interest Rates

Market participants largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at the May 6 meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged.  But the accompanying statement apparently surprised investors by signaling that the FOMC was prepared to ease policy to guard against further substantial disinflation. Subsequent comments from Federal Reserve officials were viewed as reinforcing this message.

Investors marked down their expected path for policy substantially, and options data suggest that uncertainty about the future path of policy has fallen considerably as well.  Options on federal funds futures now imply that investors are virtually certain that the FOMC will ease at the June meeting; they are placing about equal odds on a quarter-point versus a half-point easing.  Further ahead, eurodollar futures options suggest that investors revised up the probability that they attach to target rates of less than 75 basis points by late this year.

Despite incoming economic news that was close to market expectations, on balance, and the deteriorating outlook for the federal budget, nominal Treasury yields declined 32 to 65 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Both marketand survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations edged a little lower, but these indicators are well within the range observed over the last few years.  In fact, judging from the inflation-indexed yields, much of the drop in

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

longer-term nominal Treasury yields appears to reflect a decline in expected real interest rates that, in turn, may be attributable to the change in policy outlook.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Major equity price indexes have risen between 9 and 11 percent since the last FOMC meeting, with small cap, biotech, and Internet stocks outperforming the broader indexes.  Implied-volatility has remained low since the end of military action in Iraq.  In addition to the substantial fall in real interest rates, stock prices have been bolstered by the most stable earnings outlook since early 2000; over the past three months, almost no downward revisions have been made to year-ahead forecasts of S&amp;P 500 earnings per share.  Also, the passage of the fiscal stimulus package may have provided some additional lift for equity prices, but there is scant evidence that investors have shifted their preferences toward stocks with higher dividends.  Despite the increase in share values, the equity risk premium apparently has not narrowed, as the forward earnings-price ratio-a proxy for the required return on equities-has fallen by about as much as real long-term Treasury yields.

Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds fell along with those on comparable Treasury securities over the intermeeting period, leaving their spreads roughly unchanged.  Yields on speculative-grade bonds fell by slightly less than those on comparable Treasuries, and spreads widened modestly.  Issuance of high-yield bonds has been robust, and the onslaught of new bonds coming to market may have put some upward pressure on speculative-grade spreads.

Business Finance

Low long-term yields proved quite alluring to many businesses, and gross corporate bond issuance jumped last month to its highest monthly level in two years, with gross junk bond issuance reaching a historical peak.  Issuance so far this month has not matched the pace in May but nonetheless has remained strong.  Many firms report that they have continued to use the bulk of the proceeds from bond issuance to pay down existing debt, consistent with declines in commercial paper outstanding and bank credit.  The amount of net borrowing this quarter is about roughly equal to its first quarter pace.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms picked up some in May from the extremely slow pace in March and April.  Energy and utility firms continued to account for most of the seasoned equity offerings, in many cases to pay down debt.  Also, although the nonfinancial IPO market finally ended its four-month drought in May, the longest since 1975, the streak was broken by just a single $10 million offering.  However, an $80 million tech offering was well received last week, and a number of IPOs are on the calendar for the near future, developments that perhaps reflect the recent rise in stock prices.  With the

exception of Oracle's recent hostile, and quickly snubbed, bid for PeopleSoft, talk of mergers remained sporadic even as financial market conditions have improved.  Announcements of share repurchases are likely to repeat last quarter's modest flow.  Still, with gross new offerings remaining low, net equity issuance should remain in solidly negative territory this quarter.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With the first-quarter earnings season essentially complete, S&amp;P 500 operating earnings per share are estimated to have risen 11 percent from last year's levels. However, the spike in oil prices resulted in the three largest oil companies accounting for about two-thirds of that gain.  Moreover, the rise in fuel costs was not yet fully accounted for in the income statements of oil-consuming industries last quarter.  In the second quarter, the reversal in oil prices has removed this boost to earnings, which accounts for a good part of the slowdown in aggregate earnings growth expected by analysts for this quarter.

Measures of credit quality for nonfinancial firms either held steady or improved somewhat of late.  The six-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds has changed little in recent months after dropping back around the turn of the year, while the net pace of ratings downgrades continued to moderate in the second quarter.  In addition, delinquency rates on C&amp;I bank loans fell somewhat in the first quarter from elevated levels.  The forecast of aggregate year-ahead default rates based on the KMV model plunged in April and dropped again in May, a reflection of higher stock prices and lower asset price volatility.

Commercial Real Estate

Despite continuing declines in construction activity, commercial mortgage debt increased about 7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, a pace that is likely to be exceeded in the second quarter.  Gross CMBS issuance in April and May was strong on average, and issues set to price in June suggest that issuance this quarter will be comparable to the rapid pace of the fourth quarter of last year.  The CMBS delinquency rate has ticked up in recent months from low historical levels.  Nonetheless, investors continue to show little concern about credit quality; spreads on CMBS over swaps contracted further over the intermeeting period and are now at the low end of their ranges in recent years.

Household Finance

Household debt, which rose to a 10 percent pace in the first quarter, appears on track to post another substantial gain in the current quarter; the increase stems from a record amount of refinancing activity.  Many households have refinanced for the second or third time in as many years, and the average amount of home equity extracted per dollar of mortgage refinanced has ebbed somewhat. Nonetheless, the estimated volume of home equity extracted has risen to a very

high level because of the large number of mortgages being refinanced. Meanwhile, consumer credit is likely to accelerate a bit from the modest growth of recent quarters; in particular, nonrevolving credit expanded briskly in April, an apparent response to the step-up in auto financing incentives during that month.

The credit quality of the household sector has been holding steady on balance, with limited pockets of distress.  The delinquency rate on credit card loans at commercial banks moved down in the first quarter, and rates on other types of loans, such as credit card loans in securitized pools and nonrevolving consumer loans at commercial banks, have continued to hover in fairly narrow ranges. However, the bankruptcy rate remains quite elevated despite a small improvement in the past few weeks.

Recent gains in share values have pushed the ratio of household assets to income somewhat above its level at the end of last year.  Consistently positive net inflows to equity mutual funds since mid-March suggest that households have renewed their confidence in the stock market, and inflows into high-yield bond mutual funds have also remained sizable.

State and Local Government Finance

The underlying pace of gross municipal bond issuance remained quite strong, reflecting efforts by state and local governments to cope with ongoing tax shortfalls.  A $10 billion taxable bond used to fund Illinois's pension liability augmented long-term issuance in June, and California's rollover of $11 billion in securities that had been issued to deal with the state's fiscal crisis boosted short-term issuance.  At the same time, the substantial decline in yields following the last FOMC meeting has bolstered issuance for advance refundings, which remain near recent levels.

The recent dividend and capital gains tax cuts appeared to have had little visible effect on municipal bond yields.  After a sizable net downgrade in 2002, municipal bond ratings upgrades and downgrades have been roughly balanced so far this year, but the spread of BBB- over AAA-rated municipal bond yields has widened since the last FOMC meeting and remains quite high by historical levels.

Treasury and Agency Finance

The Congress raised the federal debt limit last month to a level that likely will not bind Treasury borrowing until at least early next year.  Faced with the prospect of large deficits for some years, the Treasury is increasingly shifting issuance patterns toward longer-term securities, a move that will appreciably

<!-- missing-text -->

III-13

lengthen the average maturity of Treasury debt, which now stands at its lowest level since 1985.

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have scaled back their reference and benchmark note programs, in part because of renewed Treasury issuance and sluggish growth of their on-balance-sheet mortgage portfolios.  Demand for Freddie Mac securities has been curtailed somewhat lately following revelations of alleged accounting irregularities that led to the departure of its top three officers and news of impending investigations by the SEC and Justice Department.  The price of  Freddie Mac's stock dropped, and credit default swap spreads on its debt moved sharply higher in response.  Although Fannie Mae's stock price also declined, and its credit default swap spreads rose a few basis points, there appears to be little, if any, lasting spillover into broader financial markets.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 growth surged in May partly because of special factors.  This year, total tax payments were somewhat weaker than expected, so the April build-up and May run-offs in balances were damped relative to the pattern embedded in seasonal factors.  Also, the recent spike in mortgage refinancing and the accompanying bulge in escrow accounts that serve as temporary repositories of funds in connection with prepayments on MBS likely contributed to the pickup in M2 growth last month.

Withdrawals from retail money funds over recent months have been associated with a fall in money fund yields relative to rates paid on bank deposits.  Low yields on short-term securities have pressured some money market mutual funds to reduce fees to keep investors' yields in positive territory, although the assets under management in such funds represent less than 1 percent of total money market fund assets.

Bank credit maintained its recent strong growth in May.  Falling mortgage rates spurred continued robust demand for home purchases and mortgage refinancings, and banks continued to acquire MBS.  But the ongoing contraction in commercial and industrial lending partially offset these factors.

The May Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicates a downward shift of the entire distribution of rate spreads, as the average spread on C&amp;I loans over comparable-maturity market rates at domestic banks declined from the previous quarter.  For loans not made under commitment, which are more representative of recent pricing conditions, spreads declined for both higher-risk and lower-risk loans, a trend that is largely consistent with the corporate bond market over the same period.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit in April was $42 billion, slightly smaller than recorded in March (revised) as exports declined less than imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

Exports of goods and services decreased 2.2 percent in April.  There were declines in most trade categories, with the largest in services (reduced foreign travel in the United States) and capital equipment, both of which fell for the second consecutive month.  The value of exported industrial supplies eased slightly from the high levels recorded during the first three months of the year, largely accounted for by fuels and chemicals.

Imports of goods and services fell 2.1 percent in April, with declines concentrated in petroleum and natural gas.  The value of petroleum and natural gas, which jumped up in March reflecting a run up in prices, fell in April as prices declined.  Imports of automotive products turned down in April, continuing a pattern of declines begun in January.  In contrast, imports of capital goods rose in April, reversing part of the declines recorded during the previous three months.  Services payments fell for the third consecutive month, largely because of reduced U.S. travel abroad.

All previously published trade data were revised beginning in 1992.  The deficit in net exports of goods and services in 2003:Q1 is now $486 billion at an annual rate, $14 billion smaller than published previously.  For the fourth quarter of last year the deficit is $17 billion smaller.  Small upward revisions were made to exports (by $2-3 billion at an annual rate in both Q4 and Q1).  The level of imported goods and services was revised down significantly (by $15 billion at an

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

annual rate in Q4 and $11 billion in Q1), primarily because of services transactions.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In May, the price of imported non-oil goods declined slightly (0.2 percent).  Prices of imported computers and semiconductors fell moderately, and prices of core goods showed a marginal decline (mostly foods and unfinished metals).  In April, non-oil import prices (and core goods prices) had fallen sharply, reflecting a reversal of the sharp run up in prices of imported natural gas in March.  The price index for core goods in April-May, on average, declined nearly 1 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter and followed a jump of 5 percent in the first quarter.   When natural gas and other fuels are excluded from the index, prices of the remaining imported core goods rose fractionally in April-May, on average, from the level in the first quarter, and the increase in the first quarter was 1‰ percent at an annual rate.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil fell 1 percent in April following a revised 18 percent drop in March.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil fell more steeply in April than the BLS price, averaging about $28.25 per barrel, down more than $5 per barrel from its March average.  The commencement of military action in Iraq and the relatively rapid conclusion of the war led the spot price of WTI to fall to less than $26 per barrel by late-April. Increased OPEC oil production, particularly by Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Venezuela (where oil production recovered substantially from low first-quarter levels), also contributed to the price decline.  In May and June, delays in the return of Iraqi exports, along with recent terrorist bombings in the Middle East, have helped push the price of WTI to more than $30 per barrel.  Spot WTI closed on June 17 at $31.07 per barrel.

Exports. In May, the price of exported goods rose slightly.  Most of the 0.2 percent increase in the price of exported core goods was from rising prices of agricultural products (particularly soybeans, wheat, corn, and meat).  Prices of exported industrial supplies declined for the second consecutive month led by decreasing prices of petroleum and precious metals.  The price index for core goods in April-May on average rose just over 1 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter and followed an increase of nearly 4 percent in the first quarter.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Treasury data recorded a $3 billion decrease in foreign official assets in the United States in April, following a $9 billion increase in March (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).  The first quarter as a whole saw very strong official inflows of $37 billion, similar to the amount in the fourth quarter of last year.  Notwithstanding the $3 billion outflow in April,

second quarter inflows should also be very strong: May data from custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York show a $37 billion increase for the month, led by large increases for Japan (associated with its official exchange intervention), Korea, China, and Russia.

Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) surged in March and showed continued strength in April.  The $65 billion in inflows in March brought the total for the first quarter to $95 billion, in line with the quarterly average from last year.  In the quarter, strong inflows were recorded for all types of U.S. debt securities, but especially corporate bonds.  Robust purchases of debt securities continued in April and comprised nearly all of the $47 billion in inflows in the month, with inflows into corporate bonds again leading the way. Purchases of other debt securities-Treasuries and agencies-were sizeable in March and April, following only modest inflows in the first two months of the year.  Inflows into U.S. equities, while small, have been positive in the past two months.

As is typical, about one-half of the securities inflows in the first quarter originated in the United Kingdom, but purchases from Asia, especially China, were also substantial.  It should be noted, however, that given China's severe restrictions on outward portfolio investment, recorded inflows from China's private sector are likely made by public entities outside the official sector.

The first quarter marked a resumption of substantial U.S. acquisitions of foreign equities, with $20 billion in straight purchases (line 5b) and another $14 billion in a merger-related stock swap (line 5c).  Although the equity acquisitions ceased in April and U.S. investors have on net sold foreign bonds this year, the year-to-date acquisitions of all foreign securities (line 5) totaled $26 billion in the first four months of this year, consistent with levels of 2001 and previous years.

Net capital flows in the banking sector (line 3) amounted to an outflow of $27 billion in the first quarter that was more than reversed by a $43 billion inflow in April.

Full balance of payments data for the first quarter, including direct investment, will be released on June 19 and discussed in the Greenbook Supplement.

Foreign Exchange Markets

The most salient developments in global financial markets over the intermeeting period were the continued drop in the exchange value of the dollar and the sharp fall in long-term interest rates in all major industrial economies.  The drop in yields began as a reaction to the concerns over disinflation expressed in the May 6 statement of the FOMC.  Further declines in long-term yields came in the wake of statements by Federal Reserve officials about policy measures available to head off deflation in a low short-term interest rate environment, such as increasing purchases of long-term bonds or capping their yields.  Despite the lackluster pace of global economic activity, equity prices in major financial markets rose substantially during the intermeeting period.  Equity prices appeared to be boosted by moderately upbeat earnings news in several sectors and by the growing market perception that policy interest rates were likely to remain at extremely low levels in the foreseeable future.

<!-- missing-text -->

The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index, dropped 3‰  percent over the intermeeting period, continuing a trend that began about a year ago.  The dollar's decline was particularly sharp in the first half of the period.  Continued concerns about the financing burden of the large and growing U.S. current account deficit weighed on the dollar, as did statements by Treasury Secretary Snow that seemed to signal a shift away from the U.S. authorities' long-standing but indeterminate 'strong dollar' policy.  The

potential benefits to the United States of a weaker dollar - increased exports and decreased deflationary pressures - were widely cited as reasons for the perceived shift in policy.  Later in the period, however, perhaps in part in reaction to concerns expressed by several of our major trading partners, President Bush reaffirmed on several occasions the administration's commitment to a strong dollar.  During the intermeeting period, the dollar was little changed on net against the currencies of our other important trading partners.

On balance, the dollar depreciated against all individual major foreign currencies over the intermeeting period, falling 3¾ pe rcent against the euro.  The dollar's exchange value versus the euro retreated for the first time since early 1999 beyond its level at the time of the euro's debut, reaching an all-time low above 1.19 $/ /G76 in late May before retracing slightly.  The dollar depreciated 4‰ percent against sterling.  On June  9, the British government announced that it would not hold a referendum this year on EMU entry, but that it may do so next year; this 'not yet' decision was not a surprise.  During the period, the dollar also depreciated 5‰ percent against the  Canadian dollar and 2 percent vis-a-vis the Swiss franc.

In contrast, the dollar depreciated … percent on balance versus the yen.  Japan's Ministry of Finance continued to intervene heavily in an attempt to prevent its currency's appreciation.  The MoF purchased nearly $38 billion dollars over the intermeeting period, pushing Japan's foreign currency reserves to more than $500 billion.

In monetary policy actions, the European Central Bank lowered its minimum refinancing rate 50 basis points to 2.0 percent, and the National Bank of Denmark and Sweden's Riksbank lowered rates by the same amount.  Also during the intermeeting period, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand lowered its main policy rate 25 basis points and the Bank of Japan adjusted its target range for current account balances up from ¥22-27 trillion to ¥27-30 trillion. Reflecting the ECB's action, three-month euro rates fell about 35 basis points over the period.  Canadian and Australian three-month rates declined more modestly, while sterling rates rose slightly.

Long-term rates, as mentioned above, fell dramatically in all industrial countries over the period, but have retraced somewhat in recent days.  On balance, ten-year sovereign yields fell about 45 basis points in the euro area and the United Kingdom, somewhat less than the 60 to 70 basis point drop in the United States and Canada.  Japanese ten-year benchmark yields fell a further 6 basis points, reaching multi-decade lows.

<!-- missing-text -->

Equity indexes registered gains over the intermeeting period in all major industrial countries, ranging from 6… per cent in Canada to about 11 percent in Japan.  Japanese banking sector shares rose more than 15 percent; the Japanese government announced in mid-May that it would bail out Japan's fifth-largest financial institution, Resona Holdings, injecting the yen equivalent of about $17 billion.

Equity prices also rose in a number of emerging market economies, particularly in Asia, where receding concerns over SARS and signs of recovery in the global high-tech sector interacted to generate large gains.  Share prices rose 19 percent in Taiwan and Thailand, 13 percent in Korea, and 12 percent Hong Kong over the period.  Equity prices also rose in Latin America, although generally more moderately than in Asia.  The exception was Argentina, where equity prices rose more than 21 percent.  The Argentine peso was little changed, on net, over the period.  The Brazilian real appreciated about 3‰ percent against the dollar, as President Lula appeared to move closer to an agreement with Brazil's Congress on a reform of civil service pensions.  The Mexican peso, in contrast, depreciated about 3‰ percent, in pa rt on concerns about a slowdown in

economic activity.  Latin American sovereign bond spreads declined moderately over the intermeeting period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

On average, real GDP growth remained weak in the first quarter in major foreign industrial countries, as external demand sagged amid heightened geopolitical uncertainties and, in some countries, local currency appreciation that had taken place over the previous year.  Net exports contributed negatively to growth in all major foreign industrial countries, but domestic demand remained strong in Canada.  Limited data for the second quarter do not inspire much optimism for the near term, with no apparent bounceback in activity following the ebbing of conflict in Iraq.

Twelve-month rates of consumer price inflation fell in recent months, reflecting both declines in oil prices and local currency appreciations.  Canadian headline inflation dipped to 3 percent in April, while euro-area inflation fell below 2 percent in May for the first time since June 2002.  Inflation fell below 1 percent in Germany where recession is expected to continue.  In Japan, deflation continued.

Earlier this month the European Central Bank (ECB), the Reserve Bank of New Zealand, the Swedish Riksbank, and Denmark's central bank lowered official interest rates.  The Bank of Japan (BOJ) eased monetary policy in late May, increasing its target range for the outstanding balance of reserve accounts held by private financial institutions at the BOJ.

In Japan , real GDP growth slowed to a revised 0.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter.  Business fixed investment advanced for the fourth straight quarter, increasing 2.8 percent, while private consumption expanded 0.8 percent.  A slowing in the pace of inventory decumulation added about ‰ percentage point to growth.  However, public investment continued to contract sharply, subtracting 0.8 percentage point from growth, and residential investment declined nearly 5 percent.  Net exports also contributed negatively to growth, as exports fell and imports rose only slightly.

Most available indicators for the second quarter suggest that economic activity remains sluggish.  Industrial production fell 1.5 percent in April from the previous month.  Real exports continued to contract, declining 1.3 percent in April from the previous month, while imports fell 0.8 percent.  Household expenditures rose 1.2 percent in April from March, but were up only slightly from the first-quarter average.  New car registrations rebounded in May, but the average for April and May was about 6 percent below the first-quarter average. Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, fell

The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.4 percent in April, only a bit below the record-high 5.5 percent rate in January.  The job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of employment, remained steady at 0.6 in April.  Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) fell marginally in May and were down 0.4 percent from a year earlier. Wholesale prices for domestic goods declined 1 percent in May from a year earlier.  Recently released data show that urban land prices were down 7.1 percent in March from a year earlier.

On May 20 the Bank of Japan raised its target range for the outstanding balance of reserve accounts held by private financial institutions at the BOJ from ¥22-27 trillion to ¥27-30 trillion.  In its announcement, the BOJ noted its 'determination to ensure financial market stability' in the wake of the government's decision on May 17 to inj ect close to ¥2 trillion ($17 billion) into Resona Holdings, Japan's fifth largest  banking institution, to shore up its capital position.  Resona failed to meet Japanese minimum capital standards after

auditors forced the bank to exclude from capital a substantial portion of deferred tax assets.  The government will hold ¥280 billion of common stock and nearly ¥2 billion of preferred shares (with voting rights) once the capital injection is complete, giving it 70 percent of the voting rights at Resona.

On June 11, the BOJ announced details of its plan to purchase asset-backed securities (ABS) issued to help finance small- and medium-sized enterprises.  To be eligible for BOJ consideration, longer-term ABS must be rated BB or higher, while asset-backed commercial paper must meet a stricter A-1 rating hurdle.  The BOJ will purchase ABS from late July 2003 through March 2006, and will initially limit its total purchases to ¥1 trillion ($8.5 billion) over this period.

Euro-area real GDP was flat in the first quarter, as modest gains in private consumption were offset by a steep fall in investment, the largest decline since 1996.  In addition, exports fell while imports grew, resulting in a substantial negative contribution from net exports.  A slowing in the pace of inventory decumulation helped to keep overall GDP growth from declining.  German, Italian and the Dutch growth rates were negative in the first quarter.   Italian GDP was pulled down by a decline in private consumption, while Germany and the Netherlands suffered large declines in investment.

<!-- missing-text -->

Incoming data suggest continued stagnation in the second quarter.  Although euro-area industrial production rose in April, it has remained essentially falt since the beginning of the year.  The May euro-area purchasing managers' index (PMI) for manufacturing, a timely indicator of production, fell further below the 50 threshold for positive growth.  The European Commission's measure of industrial confidence also declined in May.  German industrial production ticked down in April, while the volume of German industry orders rose 1.4 percent in

April, recovering only part of the sharp decline in March, to a level of about 1 percent below the first-quarter average.

Surveys of consumer confidence in the euro area also have continued to fall, primarily owing to increases in expectations of unemployment, particularly in Germany.  Consistent with the survey results, the April euro-area unemployment rate was above the first-quarter average rate.  In Germany, unemployment was 10.7 percent in May.

The European Central Bank (ECB) reduced its main policy rate, the minimum bid rate for the refinancing tender, 50 basis points to 2 percent at its June meeting.  The move largely had been signaled by comments from ECB officials. ECB President Duisenberg stressed that the ECB aims to keep inflation rates 'below but close to 2 percent over the medium term' and argued that 'there are currently no forecasts indicating any deflationary risks' for the euro area. Implicitly addressing the concern that Germany could experience deflation, he

stated that 'within a monetary union, deflation is not a meaningful concept when applied to individual regions.'  Bank of France Governor Jean-Claude Trichet was acquitted of charges in the Credit Lyonnais scandal.  The verdict clears the way for Mr. Trichet to take over as head of the ECB when Duisenberg steps down, most likely during the summer.

Euro-area twelve-month consumer price inflation declined to 1.9 percent in May, falling below the ECB's target ceiling for the first time since June 2002, according to the preliminary estimate.  Excluding energy and unprocessed food, inflation was 2.2 percent in April, up from the 2 percent rate it had maintained throughout the first quarter of 2003.  German twelve-month consumer price inflation declined to 0.7 percent in May from 1.0 percent in April, as consumer prices fell for the second month in a row.

In the United Kingdom , first-quarter real GDP growth was weak after lackluster fourth-quarter growth.  Substantial growth in government spending was offset by a deceleration in consumer spending and a decline in gross fixed capital formation.  Net exports declined as imports rose considerably while exports were flat.

Data for the second quarter suggest that the pace of activity is recovering, but remains sluggish.  Whereas industrial production slid 0.4 percent in the first quarter, it rose 0.2 percent in April, and business confidence recovered somewhat in May.  May's Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for manufacturing ticked down after rebounding somewhat in April, and still suggests further contraction in the sector.

Retail sales grew mildly in April after being unchanged in the first quarter.  The leading survey of retail sales points to further improvement in May.  Consumer confidence recovered for the second month in a row in May, though sentiment remains below its level in late 2002.

The rate of increase in housing prices is slowing.  The April/May average of housing prices was 2 percent higher than the first-quarter average, down from an increase of 4.4 percent in the first quarter.  The deceleration in prices has spread

beyond London to most other regions of the country.  Net mortgage lending remained elevated through April, while the growth of other consumer credit slowed.

The labor market continues to be tight as both the official claims-based and the labor force survey measures of the unemployment remain near record lows. The twelve-month rate of retail price inflation (excluding mortgage interest payments) ticked down in May but remained above the Bank of England's 2‰ percent target.  The harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) rose 1.2 percent in the twelve months ending in May.  The twelve-month growth rate of average earnings slid to 2.6 percent in April.

On June 9, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced that the five economic conditions for Britain joining the euro area have not been met.  The government will reassess the five tests with the release of next year's budget, expected in March.  The tests are now to be reviewed annually in the budget.  In the meantime, legislation will be introduced this autumn to enable a referendum on euro entry, should the tests be met.  Further measures to promote convergence will be enacted, including housing market reform and changing the Bank of England's target inflation rate to the HICP at the time of the Pre-Budget Report, expected in November.  Public opinion remains strongly against entry.

In Canada , real GDP increased 2.4 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter as final domestic demand grew 3.9 percent led by robust growth in consumption and residential construction.  A record increase in the level of inventories also provided a substantial boost to activity, with roughly half of the stockpiling occurring among motor vehicle retailers and wholesalers.  Net exports subtracted from GDP growth, reflecting a decline in exports and strong import growth.  The data on monthly real GDP indicate that much of the first quarter's growth occurred in the beginning of the quarter.

Recent indicators suggest weak growth for the second quarter.  Following robust job growth throughout 2002 and early 2003 the labor market cooled in April and May, partially reflecting the impact of SARS on accommodation and food service employment in Toronto.  Declining employment, in conjunction with continued strong labor force growth, increased the unemployment rate to 7.8 percent in May.  Housing starts declined in both April and May, though they remain at a level above the historical average.  Manufacturing shipments dropped significantly in April while inventories continued to increase, raising the inventory-to-shipment ratio to its highest level in 14 months.

In April, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation declined to 3 percent from 4.3 percent in March, returning to the top of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3

percent target band.  The decline in the headline rate largely reflects lower energy prices.  Twelve-month core inflation, excluding food, energy prices, and indirect taxes, decreased to 2.7 percent in April.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Economic conditions in the developing world remain weak.  Recent indicators suggest that growth has continued to slow in much of developing Asia, with the negative economic effects of SARS beginning to show up in data throughout the region, particularly for Hong Kong.  In Latin America, Mexican economic growth turned negative in the first quarter, and Brazilian indicators suggest that economic activity remains soft.  The Venezuelan economy has contracted sharply as a result of that country's ongoing political crisis, while Argentina's recovery has continued.

Although the SARS outbreak in China appears to have been largely contained, the economic effects are just now beginning to show through available data. Twelve-month growth rates of retail sales and tourist arrivals both slowed considerably in April.  Industrial production growth also decreased to a twelve-month growth rate of just under 14 percent in May from 17 percent in the first quarter.  Some deceleration was expected, however, as many producers who drastically increased output in the first quarter to fill orders before the start of the Iraq war have since cut back.  Consumer prices continued to rise slowly on a twelve-month basis, but month-to-month changes have turned negative again due to lower oil prices and, possibly, weaker demand resulting from SARS. Lower oil prices helped return the Chinese trade balance to surplus in April, but rapid growth in non-oil imports narrowed the surplus in May.

Real GDP in Hong Kong fell just over 1 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter. The outbreak of SARS has apparently been contained.  The categories that were expected to be hurt most by SARS, personal consumption and tourism, were both down in the quarter.  In contrast, both exports and imports grew strongly. This, coupled with robust trade figures for April, lends support to anecdotal reports that SARS has not significantly affected merchandise trade.  Other economic effects of SARS, however, were evident in April.  Retail sales for that month fell, and tourist arrivals plummeted.  The unemployment rate rose in April and May, as SARS-related layoffs began to show up in the data, and consumer prices fell at a twelve-month rate of about 2 percent, partly reflecting the anemic property market and weaker sales of goods due to SARS.

Real GDP in Taiwan contracted slightly in the first quarter reflecting declines in investment spending and sluggish growth in private consumption.  Exports, however, were up sharply for that period on average.  Since the first quarter ended, the outbreak of SARS in Taiwan has worsened considerably, and its economic effects are now being felt.  Industrial production decreased in April, and unemployment remained at a high level.  Both exports and imports have fallen sharply since February.  Of most concern is the reduction in imports of intermediate goods used in the production of high-tech goods, indicating a potential further decline in future exports.  Twelve-month inflation turned

positive in May due to a base month effect, while the month-to-month change was slightly negative.

Incoming data for Korea since the last Greenbook have been generally weak. GDP fell 1.4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, weighed down by a sizeable decline in consumption and low export growth.  Industrial production in April dropped almost 2 percent, with the contraction concentrated in the high-tech sectors.  Consumer and business confidence indicators held steady or lost ground in May, and recent measures of retail sales and service-sector demand have also been anemic.  Consumer prices were up 3.2 percent over the twelve months ended in May, and the unemployment rate rose to 3.4 percent. The trade balance jumped in April as exports climbed and imports dropped off, in part due to lower oil prices.  Early figures suggest that this improvement in the trade balance is unlikely to be sustained in May.  Concerns over weakening demand led the Korean central bank to lower its target interest rate in May by 25 basis points to 4 percent.  The government has also announced a fiscal stimulus package of roughly ¾ percentage point of GDP for the rest of this year.

In the ASEAN region, data releases since the last Greenbook have generally pointed to weak economic activity.  In the first quarter, private consumption contributed negatively to real GDP growth in Malaysia and Singapore but drove the expansions in Indonesia and Thailand.  Real GDP in the Philippines contracted, owing to reduced agricultural output.  With the exception of Malaysia, recent industrial production data for these countries suggest a further slowing in activity so far in the second quarter.  Trade surpluses, however, widened across the region, primarily reflecting rising exports, while inflation remained benign.

In Mexico, data releases since the last Greenbook generally point to weakness in the economy.  Real GDP fell 2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, exports declined in April, and business confidence was down in May.  Industrial production appears to have fared somewhat better, however, rising 0.8 percent in April.  The weakness in exports in April led to a sizeable widening of the trade deficit in that month.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation declined in April and May, probably helped in part by the net appreciation of the Mexican peso since early March.  Survey measures of inflation expectations for end-2003 edged down a bit to 4.1 percent in May, near the top of the central bank's 2-4 percent target range.

In Brazil , real GDP in the first quarter was roughly flat after having risen about 3‰ percent over the second half of 2002 in  the midst of considerable financial turmoil.  Data releases since the last Greenbook suggest that activity continued to weaken into the second quarter.  Monthly trade surpluses have remained sizable, reflecting some trade adjustment from the large depreciation of the currency in recent years.

The weak economy and the nominal appreciation of the real since March contributed to a decline in monthly headline consumer price inflation in April and May.  The twelve-month inflation rate rose nevertheless.  Inflation therefore remains well above the 8.5 percent 'adjusted inflation target' for 2003 that was set by the central bank last January.  In consequence, the central bank maintained its overnight interest rate at 26.5 percent at its May policy meeting.  Brazilian asset prices have moved up significantly in recent weeks.  The improvement

most likely reflects investors' approval of the fiscal performance of the Lula government, including further progress towards pension reform.

In Argentina , industrial production in May was up 16 percent from a year ago, but it has edged down in the last two months.  Inflation has continued to decelerate considerably, and the consumer price index fell 0.3 percent in May from April-the first decline since the peso's devaluation in January 2002.  The peso continued to strengthen, and has appreciated nearly 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year, amid accumulation of foreign reserves by the central bank.  Federal tax collection in May increased 48 percent year-on-year, exceeding expectations.  While Argentina has so far met the fiscal and monetary targets agreed with the IMF, the government is lagging in the implementation of structural reforms.  President NØstor Kirchner, who took office in late May, has not yet fully articulated a program that addresses the country's fundamental economic problems, including the restructuring of the banking system and the renegotiation of the country's defaulted debt.

In Venezuela , real GDP fell 29 percent on a four-quarter basis in the first quarter, reflecting a 47 percent decrease in oil output and a 21 percent decline in non-oil output.  The decline implies a drop of 52 percent (s.a.a.r.) from the previous quarter, according to staff estimates.  The first quarter result follows a similarly large drop in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2002.  Plummeting economic activity in recent months has been associated with political turmoil that led to a general strike from December to February.  Activity has also been weakened by the imposition of capital controls last January, which have virtually halted non-oil related imports and disrupted production in sectors that rely on imported intermediate goods.  Monthly consumer price inflation rose in April and May, despite the pegging of the currency to the dollar last February; the rise has been attributed to shortage-induced increases in domestic prices of imported goods.  Oil production and exports remain below pre-strike levels.
