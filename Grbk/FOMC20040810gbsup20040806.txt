The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

The slowdown in hiring by private nonfarm businesses continued into July; employment rose only 32,000 last month, and the level of employment in June was revised down 51,000.   Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory 1 workers rose 0.3 percent in July, only partially reversing their June decline.

By industry, manufacturing employment increased 10,000 last month despite a reported drop of 21,000 in the transportation equipment industry, which the BLS attributes to an atypical pattern of summer plant shutdowns.   In the related 2 wholesale trade industry, employment moved up 8,000 last month, in line with gains since the start of the year, but temporary help employment was reported to have edged up only 5,000 after having fallen 11,000 in June.  Our contacts in the staffing industry report that demand for workers in light industrial jobs has remained strong, and, in contrast to the weak payroll figures, they have been fairly upbeat about their business prospects going forward.  Elsewhere in the goods producing industries, construction employment was little changed for a second month after strong increases earlier this year.

In the services producing sector, employment fell in retail trade (-19,000) and financial activities (-23,000); combined, these industries averaged monthly gains of 39,000 during the first half of this year.  The weakness in retail trade was widespread, while a drop off in mortgage refinancing activity was likely responsible for much of the loss in financial activities employment. Employment in leisure and hospitality services was essentially flat last month after average increases of 25,000 in the first half of the year.  Elsewhere, employment continued to rise in education and health services (20,000) and professional and business services excluding temporary help (37,000).

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.1 hour to 33.7 hours last month, reversing half of the previous month's decline.  With last month's increase, aggregate hours now stand 0.2 percent above their second-quarter average.

Respondents in the household survey reported a more positive picture of labor market developments than the one portrayed by the business report.  The

unemployment rate ticked down 0.1 percentage point to 5.5 percent, while the labor force participation rate rose 0.2 percentage point to 66.2 percent. Combining these two measures, the employment to population ratio rose 0.2 percentage point to 66.5 percent, about 1/2 percentage point above the low point reached last September.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls moved up 0.3 percent last month.  Over the twelve months ending in July, average hourly earnings increased 1.9 percent compared with an increase of 2.9 percent over the previous twelve months.

The International Economy

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) were very strong in June, bringing second quarter inflows to $128 billion, similar to the elevated pace of the first quarter. In June, private inflows into Treasury securities (line 4a) and corporate bonds (line 4c)  were particularly strong while inflows into equities (line 4d) remained tepid.  This year's pattern has been rather consistent, with near zero purchases of equities but very strong inflows into corporate bonds and Treasury securities or, alternately, agency bonds (line 4b) .

Net foreign official inflows (line 1) picked up to $35 billion in June, following inflows of roughly $20 billion in both April and May.

.  Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) suggest a slowing of foreign official inflows in July.

Following modest net sales in May, U.S. investors acquired $15 billion in foreign securities (line 5) in June.  As in previous months, purchases of foreign equities were relatively robust, totaling $9 billion.  In a shift, U.S. investors purchased a significant amount of foreign bonds ($6 billion) for the first time in years.

The banking sector (line 3) recorded modest outflows in June, following similarly sized inflows in May.
