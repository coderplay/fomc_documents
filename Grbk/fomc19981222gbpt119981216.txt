Overview

The information  hat  e have  received  n  the  brief  nterval nce he  last  reenbook t w i i si t G suggests  hat he conomic expansion as  remained  robust hrough he  autumn months. t t e h t t We  have  raised  ur  forecast  f  real DP o o G growth  in  the  fourth  uarter   full  ercentage q a p point,  o  more than  3 percent,  nd  the  indications  ngoing  support or obust  inal t a ofo f r f demand have  led  us  to  add  several  enths  o  our  prediction   the  output ain  in  1999. t t of g However, despite  he igher evels  f  resource tilization t ccompany this  tronger t h l o u tha a s outlook,  ur  projection r nflation   nly  marginally  igher;  n  part,  his  eflects ill o fo i iso h i t r st another avorable  urprise om the  commodity markets, here the  prices  f  oil nd f s fr w o a other aterials  ave  plunged  further  ecause  of  excess orld  capacity nd  the m h b w a weakness  in  the sian  and  Latin merican economies. A A

We  still ink t ikely  hat  he  expansion ill low  over  the  coming months, th i l t t w s most  probably  to  pace  that  s elow  the rend ate f  growth  in  potential  tput. a i b t r o ou Underlying  that  rojection  he otion hat accelerator"  fects  ave  been  important p ist n t " ef h in  pushing  investment  n  consumer  durables, mes,  and business  quipment  to  very i ho e high  levels;  oing  forward,  he batement  of  these ffects  hould e an  important g t a e s b moderating  force n the  economy. o

But,  clearly,  r  tune  has  changed  materially om that  f  a few months ago ou fr o when,  in  the idst  of he  financial rket  turmoil,  e thought hat  rowth  might  come m t ma w t g almost  to  a  halt n he irst  alf  f  1999. The  biggest  ifference:  onetary  policy as i t f h o d M h eased  more rapidly  han  we assumed in  the  earlier recasts,  d  the  effects ve  been t fo an ha magnified y the  wildly nthusiastic  sponse f  the  equity arkets.  The upside isks b e re o m r that e noted  in  recent  reenbooks--and auged  in  some of  our  model simulations-w G g have, n  effect, en  realized.  ven maintaining  he  view  that oor  corporate  arnings i be E t p e will  dent hare rices  n  coming months,  we have a  considerably re accommodative s p i mo financial vironment  than  was built  nto ur  baseline  rojections   the  last  ouple  of en i o p in c Greenbooks.

We  are  now predicting at,  ith  no further anges  in  the  federal  unds  rate, th w ch f real DP  will ise   percent r  so  in  1999 and about  2-1/4 ercent  n  2000.

Key  Background  Factors n  the  Staffs  conomic  Forecast i E

Interest tes  n intermediate-  d  long-term reasuries  ave  fallen  oughly  1/4 ra o an T h r percentage oint,  n net, ince he  November FOMC p o s t meeting.  Although  the  bulk  of the  incoming  news on  economic activity s  suggested hat  rowth  is  holding p  better ha t g u than  expected,  he  markets  seem to  have  been  more heavily nfluenced  y the  softness t i b in  the  prices  f il nd other ommodities  and  by  further  ndications   weakness  in o o a c i of manufacturing;  hese evelopments ave  raised  xpectations  f  additional sing  y t d h e o ea b the  FOMC sometime in  the  first lf f  1999. Renewed  concern bout  foreign ha o a economies, specially azil,  lso ppears o  have  affected  reasury ates  n he  past e Br a a t T r i t couple  of eeks,  with  skittish  vestors  urning  nce  again o  the reater  afety  f w in t o t g s o government  securities.

As noted  above, e are  assuming  no  further sing teps  n  this  orecast.  he w ea s i f T failure  f  the ed to e  as  generous s  the  market  is oping  and  an  ebbing  of he isk o F b a h t r aversion nd  liquidity eference  till parent oday  will end  to  push  Treasury ields a pr s ap t t y somewhat higher n  coming months. However,  in  private  ecurities  rkets,    return i s ma a to  more realistic lity  preads hould ermit ates  o  hold  steady r  even  decline-qua s s p r t o especially  s  year-end ensions  ass.  Most borrowers ppear o  have  found  a way to a t p a t obtain redit  n  the  aftermath f  the ecent  urmoil, d  we are  assuming  that  he  vast c i o r t an t majority  f usinesses  nd  households ill ontinue o  have  good access o  credit o b a w c t t moving forward.

In  equity  arkets, he  rally  hat egan  in  October  carried  ost  of he ndexes m t t b m t i to  new highs  in  late  ovember  and  early ecember. Astonishing  un-ups n  InternetN D r i related  tocks including  ome IPOs),  merely  spectacular ins n  some high-tech s ( s ga i standbys,  nd the  effervescence  &amp;A a ofM activity eated   market  atmosphere  that cr a made questions  bout  valuations em almost rrelevant.   the  past ouple  of  weeks, a e i In c renewed worries bout  earnings  ave  caused  share rices  o  slip odestly,  nd  we a h p t m a think hat his  rend ill ersist   the  first lf  f  1999. But  partly  ecause e have t t t w p in ha o b w elevated  ur  output nd  profit  aths rom  those  in he  last  reenbook,  share rices o a p f t G p have  been  notched  up again  in his  orecast. t f

We  have  revised  p  slightly r  predictions  oreign  conomic growth, ut u ou off e b the  outlook s till ite luggish.  n  total, reign  DP  is xpected o  increase    bit i s qu s I fo G e t a less han  1/2  percent n  1998,  about  1-1/2 ercent n  1999,  and  2-1/4 ercent  n  2000. t i p i p i Recovery  in  Asia  is xpected o egin  in  early 999 but  to  proceed ery  slowly or e t b 1 v f

several  uarters.  eanwhile,  activity   Europe  seems to  be  decelerating,  d  Latin q M in an America is  in  the  midst  of  contraction at e think  ill xtend hrough ost  of a th w w e t m 1999. Although  these rowth  prospects  o not  provide uch encouragement  for .S. g d m U producers,  e think hat   little  ft  or ur  exports  ay be coming from  exchange  rate w t a li f o m movements:  The value  of  the ollar, ving  changed  little    recent eeks,  remains d ha in w well  below its  hird-quarter k, nd  we continue o  assume that t  ill ecord urther t pea a t i w r f small  declines  ver  the  next ouple  of ears. o c y

In  response o  the ecent lunge  of  oil  rices, r  assumptions bout he rice t r p p ou a t p of  crude  going  forward ave  been  revised  ownward  this  onth,  especially  he  near h d m int term.  The average pot rice f  West Texas  intermediate TI) this  uarter  s  now s p o (W q i expected o  be  more than  a dollar  ower han  we previously  ere projecting--and t l t w although e still pect  prices  o  be  moving back  up  after  his  uarter, e ebound w ex t t q th r leaves rices ower  than  before.  The WTI  price verages lightly ss han  $14-3/4  per p l a s le t barrel  n  1999,  down more than  a dollar  rom  the  previous orecast.  he price i f f T averages  $16 per  barrel  n 000,  down fifty  ents rom the  last  reenbook. i 2 c f G

Our projection  f  the  surplus  n  the ederal  udget as  been  raised  urther is o i f b h f th month. We  now expect  the  unified  urplus  o  amount to  $81 billion  iscal  999,  up s t inf 1 from  $55 billion   the ast  reenbook. The surplus  n  fiscal  000  is rojected  o  be in l G i 2 p t $101 billion,    from  $73 billion. e bulk  of  the evision  eflects  e  stronger up Th r r th economic forecast.  ur assumptions egarding  iscal  olicy ave  not  changed; he O r f p h t thrust  f  policy s rojected  o  be  roughly eutral  ver  the ext  two years. o i p t n o n

The Current  Quarter

With  the  data ow in  hand,  growth  of  real DP n G in  the hird  uarter  ppears o ave t q a t h been  only  slightly eater  han  we previously  ere predicting.  ut  our  forecast r he gr t w B fo t current  uarter  as  been  revised  p appreciably--to   percent,  ersus .1  percent  ast q h u 3.1 v 2 l month.

The labor arket  report  or ovember  and  the  recent eekly  figures  n  initial m f N w o claims  suggest hat he  pace  of  hiring  as  not  slowed  as  much as  we  had  thought. t t h Although  payrolls  n  manufacturing  ave  continued o hrink,  verall  anufacturing i h t s o m output hould  rise  t  an  annual  rate f ore than  3 percent  his uarter  ecause  of  a s a o m t q b sizable  ncrease  n  auto  production,  reflection  inly  of he  rebound  from the M i i a ma t G strike.

The Outlook for the  Economy in  1999 and 2000

The upward revision  o  our  estimate  f  activity   the  second  half f  1998 has  boosted t o in o the  forecast  f eal DP  growth  for he  year  as a  whole to  a  little  ove 3-1/2 ercent, o r G t ab p only  a  touch  shy  of he  strong ains  of  1996 and 1997. This  added  strength, t g underpinned y a  higher evel f  stock arket  wealth, enerates  ome momentum b l o m g s for faster  rowth  going  forward.  Thus,  our  forecast  f eal DP g o r G growth  in  1999 has  been raised  /2  percentage  oint,  o  2.1  percent. e  expect   further  mall ickup  in 1 p t W a s p growth  in  2000, o  about  2-1/4 ercent. t p By the  end  of  2000,  the evel  f  real DP l o G is 3/4  percent igher han  it  as in  our  previous  orecast,    increment hat e attribute h t w f an t w largely  o  the ecent inancial rket  developments nd the  related  pward revision  o t r f ma a u t our  forecast  f  stock rices. o p

Consumer spending.  Although  we have  raised  ur  forecast  f eal CE o o r P growth  somewhat for oth  1999 and 2000,  we continue o  anticipate  ch  smaller b t mu gains han  in  1998. A 2.7  percent ise s redicted  or  1999,  and we are  projecting e t r i p f th growth  in  2000  to  be  2.5  percent--these  tes  re  about  half  he  rate f ncrease  his ra a t o i t year.

This  prediction  f  a  slowdown rests  n  good part n  the  conviction  hat he o i o t t wherewithal o  support pending ill ot  be increasing  o  fast s  it as  been. Indeed, t s w n s a h our  forecast  or he  stock arket  implies   considerable  ecline  n  the  ratio  f f t m a d i o household  net  worth  to  income--which,  eteris ribus,  hould ause  the  "wealth c pa s c effect"  with he  usual ags) o  swing  gradually  rom strongly  ositive is  ear  to ( t l t f p th y mildly egative  n  2000.

consumer demand will e damped further  y diminishing  ob  and  income  gains. b b j Household  debt  burdens  are  high, ut  we do not oresee ebt-service rains coming b f d st be widespread;  nd although enders  ay  become a  bit ore cautious  ith  respect  o a l m m w t consumer  credit, rrowing  should  remain  pretty  asy  for  all ut  the  most  marginal f bo e b o households.

Spending  on consumer  durables  ight  be  expected  to  be  restrained   another m by factor  s  well:  Large gains n  spending ver  the  past ew years ave added a i o f h substantially  the  stocks f  both  vehicles  nd household quipment, nd  the  urgency to o a e a to  add  further  o  these tocks robably s  not  great. his  past ear's mp in t s p i T y ju consumer  purchases f  light  ehicles  as prompted, n  part,  y the  attractive  icing o v w i b pr offered  y manufacturers  ighting  ggressively r arket  share; ustaining les t  so b f a fo m s sa a

Housing.

Meanwhile,  the a r s n availability    loans hould  continue o  be  excellent  xcept n  the iskiest  rtions  f of s t e i r po o the  market.

Nonetheless,  e do expect hat ousing  activity ll eaken over  the  projection w t h wi w period.  The story  ere  is uch  the  same as  with  consumer  spending:   sizable  tock h m a s of  housing  units  eflecting  e arge dditions de recently,  upled  with  less r th l a ma co favorable  ovements in  employment,  income,  and wealth.  But, iven  the m g extraordinarily d "affordability"  nditions  xpected  to  continue o  prevail  n  the goo co e t i single-family ctor,  do not  expect  a  major  retrenchment. otal  housing  starts, se we T which appear o  be running t  about  1.62  million  nits his  ear,  re  projected   drop t a u t y a to off o  around 1.55  million  y the  second  half f  next ear  and  then  to  edge  down  a  bit t b o y more in  2000.

Business ixed f investment. After ising  bout  11-1/2 ercent n  1998,  total r a p i BFI is  projected   decelerate arply o  growth  of  about  4  percent n  1999 and 5 to sh t i percent n  2000. In  view of  widespread xpectations   slower ales rowth  and i e of s g increased  ressures  n  profits,   do  not  think hat  usinesses  ill ant  to  keep p o we t b w w adding  to  capacity  s  rapidly  s  they  have  been  in  recent ears. lthough  the arkets a a y A m for  business  redit  hould ontinue o  mend, some lingering mage to  commercial c s c t da mortgage  channels--and  he  persistence   a  bit ore caution n  lending enerally-t of m i g probably  will queeze  out  a  few of  the  riskier ojects  hat ight  have  found  ready s pr t m support efore he  recent  inancial rmoil. b t f tu

Real  outlays  or quipment, hich we now estimate  o  have  risen ore than  17 f e w t m percent n  1998,  are  expected o  rise  t  less han alf hat  ace  in  each  of he ext  two i t a t h t p t n

Computers  and related  quipment  are  a  bit f  a  wild  card.

Budget receipts, outlays, and  surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus is  excluded from the on-budget deficit and shown separately as  off-budget, as  classified under current law. The Postal Service deficit is included in  off-budget outlays beginning in  FY90.
