The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization

Total industrial production (IP) rose 1 percent in February.  IP was revised down in November but revised up in December and in January, leaving the overall change during those three months higher by 0.2 percentage point.  A surge in energy output and a partial rebound in motor vehicle assemblies accounted for the bulk of the increase last month. The swing in temperatures from a mild January to a cold February resulted in a jump of 6.7 percent in the index for utilities, which contributed ⅔ percentage point to the increase in IP; much of the gain will likely be reversed this month.  Mining output was little changed in February, as declines in oil and gas extraction and coal production were offset by increases in metal mining, nonmetallic mineral mining, and oil and gas well-drilling. Manufacturing output rose 0.4 percent in February, and the rates of change for the previous two months were revised up in response to stronger output data for steel, drugs, and cigarettes.  The capacity utilization rate in manufacturing rose 0.2 percentage point in February to 80.1 percent, a level that is 0.2 percentage point above its year-earlier level and 0.3 percentage point above its 1972-2006 average.

Light vehicle assemblies were 10.4 million units (annual rate) in February; the increase of 500,000 units (annual rate) relative to January only reversed about half of the plunge in January.  Assemblies of medium and heavy trucks fell in February for the fourth consecutive month; the level of assemblies was 30 percent below its peak last year. Overall, motor vehicles and parts production in February boosted the rate of change in total IP by about 0.2 percentage point.

Production in the high-tech industries rose more than 3 percent in February, with solid output gains for each major high-tech category.  Computer production jumped 5 percent; it was boosted by a surge in the production of PCs for consumer use that was likely related to the release of the new Microsoft Vista operating system.  The output of communications equipment was up more than 2 percent for a second consecutive month after having slowed in the second half of last year.   Semiconductor production increases were broad-based; output increased significantly for chip categories related to computing, such as microprocessors.

Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products, output gains in the major market groups were mixed in February.  The production of consumer goods was

little changed relative to January, as gains in the output of nondurable consumer goodssuch as food and paper products-offset continuing declines in the production of durable consumer goods.  The output of business equipment was also little changed in February; excluding commercial aircraft, business equipment output has decreased at an annual rate of nearly 2½ percent in the past three months.  In February, production declines included metalworking machinery, commercial and service industry machinery, and transit equipment other than motor vehicles.  The output of defense and space equipment edged up, as a decrease in the production of military aircraft was more than offset by output increases elsewhere.  The production of construction supplies declined 0.6 percent in February; among its components, output for a variety of wood products, cement, concrete, and gypsum all fell.  In contrast, the output of materials rose, with increases in both durable and nondurable materials.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment edged down in early March, with declines in both the 'expected conditions' and the 'current conditions' components of the overall index.  Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved a little.  In addition, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for both cars and homes strengthened.  The median of expected inflation over the next twelve months held at 3 percent in March, and the median of expected inflation over the next five- to-ten years held at 2.9 percent.

Prices

The producer price index for finished goods rose 1.3 percent in February, reflecting large increases in food and energy prices.  Increases in the PPI for finished energy were widespread across components, with gasoline and fuel oil posting the sizable increases. The PPI for finished food rose 1.9 percent in February, as cold weather in western states boosted prices for fruits and vegetables.  Excluding food and energy, the PPI for finished goods rose 0.4 percent, following increases of 0.2 percent in each of the previous two months. One contributor to the step-up in core PPI inflation was a second steep monthly rise in tobacco prices.   Among the PPIs for services, which are not included in the 1 headline index, the price index for doctors' services jumped 3 percent last month, while the index for hospital services edged down 0.2 percent (both not seasonally adjusted). These indexes, along with other indicators, are used by the BEA to construct the PCE price index for medical services.

At earlier stages of processing, prices for core intermediate materials rose 0.2 percent last month. The increase brought the twelve-month change in this index to 3.7, 1 percentage point less than the year-earlier increase. Part of this slowdown has reflected a deceleration in the prices for a number of energy-intensive goods, including chemicals and plastics.

The consumer price index rose 0.4 percent in February, led by increases of 0.8 percent in food prices and 0.9 percent in consumer energy prices.  Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent last month after having risen 0.3 percent in January.  Based on our translation of the February CPI and PPI data, we estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.3 percent last month.

Recent increases in the core CPI have pushed up the three-month change in the index from the relatively low rates seen at the end of 2006; a swing in core goods price inflation-which had been coming in unusually low late last year-accounts for the recent pickup.  Over the twelve months ending in February, the core CPI rose 2.7 percent, 0.6 percentage point higher than a year earlier; a sharp acceleration in shelter rents over this period more than accounted for the acceleration in the core index.

Last month's increase in the CPI for energy was boosted by a jump of 5 percent in prices for natural gas; by contrast, prices for motor fuel rose only 0.3 percent, and electricity prices were unchanged.   Nevertheless, energy prices have actually declined slightly over 2 the twelve months ending in February, down from an increase of 20 percent over the year-earlier period.

The effects of cold weather on prices of fruits and vegetables showed through to the March rise in the CPI as well as the PPI.  However, the twelve-month change ending in February in retail food prices was up only slightly from a year earlier.

The pickup in core goods prices in recent months has been broad-based, with especially large accelerations in prices for tobacco, apparel, and motor vehicles.  Smoothing through these higher-frequency movements, core goods prices have been flat over the past year after remaining unchanged over the preceding year as well.  As of February, rent of shelter had accelerated 1¾ percentage points over the preceding twelve months; by contrast, prices for core services excluding shelter had decelerated ¼ percentage point.

U.S. Current Account

As reported in the Balance of Payments data, released March 14, the U.S. current account deficit was $783 billion (a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 2006, $134 narrower than in the third quarter of 2006 (revised).  The trade deficit narrowed by $91 billion, as goods imports decreased and goods exports increased.  The decrease in goods imports was more than accounted for by a drop in imports of petroleum and petroleum products.  The increase in goods exports was largely accounted for by increased exports of capital goods, particularly civilian aircraft.  The surplus on services increased slightly, as the increases in services receipts, primarily from 'other' private services, travel, and royalties and license fees, were greater than the increases on services payments, primarily for 'other' private services. Net unilateral transfers to foreigners declined slightly, driven by decreases in private remittances and other transfers, and in U.S. Government grants.

The investment income balance was positive $19 billion (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, returning to a net inflow after several negative quarters.  Interest, dividend and direct investment income receipts each increased in the fourth quarter, while total income payments were unchanged, as increases in interest and dividend payments were almost exactly offset by a sharp decline in direct investment payments.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The financial flows associated with the current account are presented in the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.  Foreign official flows into the United States continued robustly in the fourth quarter, but net private financial inflows moderated. Strong foreign net purchases of U.S. securities were partially offset by a surge in U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities and a decline in net direct investment inflows.  The decline in net direct investment inflows is associated with a noticeable drop in direct investment inflows.  Although the total value of foreign acquisitions of U.S. firms hit a five-year high in the fourth quarter, reinvested earnings fell substantially.  The fall in reinvested earnings owes in part to lower earnings by direct investors in the United States (reflected in smaller direct investment payments in the current account) and a significant drop in the retention rate.  With respect to other flows, foreign acquisitions of U.S. currency moved up in line with typical seasonal demand.  Other inflows, which largely reflect quarterly reported banking and nonbanking positions, moved to a moderate inflow in the quarter.

To balance the international transactions accounts, the statistical discrepancy measured $32 billion for the quarter, remaining positive for the fourth consecutive quarter.  This positive statistical discrepancy indicates some combination of under-recorded net financial inflows or over-recorded net imports of goods and services and other transactions measured in the current account balance.
