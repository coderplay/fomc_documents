The  run f ood  news  on  the .S.  economy has  continued  n ecent  eeks,  with urther o g U i r w f indications  apid rowth, arge  mployment gains,  nd  low  price  nflation.    believe, ofr g l e a i We however,  that  conomic  performance ill  ecome more mixed  in  the eriod mmediately e w b p i ahead,  owing  mainly o  a  sharp eterioration he ation's ade  alance. he financial t d in  t n tr b T strains  ast  Asia  are orcing  n  abrupt  urrent-account  justment  here, ich  will  e inE f a c ad t wh b reflected    a  weakening  demand for .S.  exports nd  an  intensification  ompetition in U a of  c from  imports.

Domestic  demand likely ll  e  buoyed  in  the hort  un y  the  still  nerally wi b s r b ge favorable  inancial  vironment ere.  To be  sure,  eal  hort-term terest  tes  ave  been f en h r s in ra h drifting ward,  but ates  n  intermediate-  d  long-term  ebt vidently  re uite up r o an d e a q attractive  borrowers,  enders  emain  active  n eeking ut  customers,  nd  the  stock to l r i s o a market  has  held p  in he  face f ome downgrading  of arnings  xpectations d  new u t o s e e an political  certainties.    due  course,  owever, he rag  from  the xternal ctor  ill low un In h t d e se w s the  growth  of roduction, ployment,  and  income, n urn etarding e xpansion  f p em i t r th e o domestic pending.

- 1.  OMB's September 1997 deficit estimates (assuming the  enactment of  the President's proposals) are $58 billion in  FY98 and $57 billion in  FY99. CBE's January 1998 baseline deficit estimates are  $5  billion in  FY98 and  $2  billion in  FY99. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The OASDI surplus is excluded from the on-budget deficit and shown separately as  off-budget, as  classified under current law. The Postal Service deficit is included in  off-budget outlays beginning in FY90.
- 2.  OMB's September 1997 deficit estimates (assuming the  enactment of the President's proposals), excluding deposit insurance spending, are  $63 billion in  FY98 and $59 billion in  FY99. CBO's January 1998 baseline deficit estimates, excluding deposit insurance, are $11 billion in FY98 and $6 billion in  FY99.
- 3. Other means of financing are  checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and  changes in  other financial assets and liabilities.
- 4.  HEB is the NIPA current and capital account surplus in  current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the level of potential output associated with an  unemployment rate of 6 percent. Real potential GDP growth is assumed to  rise from 2.2 percent in 1996 to 2.5 percent in 1999, reflecting CPI modifications. Quarterly figures for change in  HEB  and FI  are not  at annual rates. Change in  HEB, as  a  percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed in sign, FI is the weighted difference of  discretionary changes in  federal spending and taxes in chained (1992) dollars, scaled by  real federal consumption plus investment. For change in HEB  and  FI, negative values indicate restraint.
- 5. Fiscal year data for the  unified budget come from OMB; quarterly data come from the  Monthly Treasury Statement and  may  not sum to  OMB fiscal year totals.

International Developments

Recent  Developments

Global  financial  markets  remained  in  turmoil  during  the  intermeeting  period. Although  the situation  in Korea  worsened  after the  December  FOMC  meeting, emergency  actions by  the IMF  and  Korea's creditors  in  late  December  mitigated  the external  financing  crisis  and helped  to  stabilize  won  exchange  rates. Severe  turbulence erupted  in  Indonesian  financial  markets  at  the  turn  of the  year.  Over the  intermeeting period,  the  dollar  moved down  against  the  yen  and  appreciated  somewhat relative  to the  mark;  it  appreciated  against  the  currencies  of developing  economies  on balance.

Since  the  December FOMC  meeting,  the dollar has  depreciated  more  than 4 percent  against  the yen. Despite  government  measures  proposed in  mid-December  and sizable  sales  of dollars  by  Japanese  authorities  to  support the  yen, the  dollar moved  up through  early  January,  as  a result of concerns  about  the  weak  Japanese  economy  and the  bankruptcy  of a  large  commercial  concern. With rumors  of additional  fiscal stimulus  in Japan,  the  dollar  has reversed  course  since  early  January. It  rose  against the mark  through much  of the  intermeeting  period  but retreated  sharply  late  in  the period  and  returned  to about  its  level  at  the time  of the  December  FOMC. Its  initial rise  appeared  to reflect  the  growing  awareness  of market  participants  that  the  crisis  in Asia would have  a greater impact on  European  economies  than  had been thought. Its subsequent  decline  reflected  both  evidence  of further  strength  in  the German  economy.

. News  of the  scandal  that has  rocked  the  Clinton Administration  weighed  on the  dollar.

The  dollar has  appreciated  against  Asian  currencies  since  the  December FOMC meeting. Early  in  the  period,  the  Korean  won  fell  precipitously,  first  following  the removal  of daily  limits  on currency  fluctuations  and later  amid rating  agency downgrades  and revelations  about  the magnitude  of Korea's short-term  foreigncurrency  obligations. The won  stabilized in  late  December following  a  strengthening of the IMF  program,  announcements  of accelerated  disbursements  from  international organizations  and the possibility  of official  bilateral  support,  and  a decision by creditors  to  roll  over short-term  obligations. On  balance,  the  won  has  lost more  than 6-1/2  percent  against  the  dollar  since  the  December  FOMC meeting,  bringing  the decline  since  the  beginning  of October  to 45  percent. The Indonesian  rupiah  plunged in early  January  following  the  release  of the  government's  1998  budget,  which  was viewed  as inconsistent  with  targets  laid  out in  Indonesia's program  with  the  IMF  and reinforced  concerns  about  political  will  to  implement  meaningful  reforms. Despite meetings  in mid-January  of Indonesian,  IMF,  and U.S.  officials  that resulted in the

announcement  of accelerated  reforms  and  substantial  restructuring,  the  rupiah plummeted  further. Announcements  this week  of frameworks  for restructuring  the banking  system and corporations' foreign  debts  have  had  an  initial  favorable  effect  on financial  markets. On  balance,  the  rupiah  ended  the  period  down  48  percent against the dollar  since  the  December  FOMC  meeting  and  69  percent  since  the beginning  of October. Both the Malaysian  ringgit and  the Thai  baht  fell  11  percent  over the intermeeting period.

Stock markets  generally moved  higher  in industrial  countries  over the intermeeting  period. After  dropping  7-3/4  percent  early  in  the period,  Japanese  stock prices  turned up  as  the  rumors  of additional  fiscal  stimulus  began  to surface;  equity prices  ended the period  up  6-3/4 percent. European  stock price  increases  ranged  from 2  percent  in  the  United  Kingdom  to more  than  18  percent  in  Italy. Despite  declining exchange  rates,  stock  prices  in  several  Asian  economies  rose;  prices  fell in  Hong  Kong following  the  liquidation  of Peregrine  Investments.

Three-month  interest  rates  fell  in most  major  foreign  industrial  countries  since the  December  FOMC  meeting,  with  declines  ranging  from  about  10  basis  points  in Japan  and  France to  about  30  basis  points  in  some  other  continental  European countries. The  Bank of Italy  trimmed  its  official  rate by  75  basis  points  in  late December,  a move  that was  widely  anticipated  by  market  participants. With the exception  of Japan,  yields on  ten-year  securities  generally  have dropped  a bit more than  short-term  rates  have. In  Japan,  the  long-term  yield  rose  18  basis  points  over the period.

.The

Desk did not  intervene.

The economic  expansion  appears  to  have  continued  at a healthy  clip  in the final  quarter of  1997  in  all  of the  foreign  G-7  countries  except  Japan. In  Germany, industrial  production  showed  strong  gains  in  October  and November,  although  a  sharp drop in  export  orders  may  signal  that  the crises  in  Asia  have  begun  to  affect  European producers. The rate  of economic  expansion  slowed  a bit further  in the  United Kingdom  during  the  fourth  quarter, to  2.1  percent  (annual  rate). However,  the data likely  exaggerate  the extent  to  which  U.K. growth  slowed  in  the  fourth  quarter  because unseasonably  warm  weather  led to  a substantial  drop  in utilities  production. In Canada,  real  GDP  expanded at  an annual  rate  of more  than  4  percent  in  the  third

quarter  ith  strong  ndustrial  oduction  n  October  supporting  ourth-quarter wth. w i pr i f g o The weakness  of  activity   Japan  persisted to he  fourth uarter,   both  production in in t q as and spending  indicators re down  from  their  hird-quarter els, d housing  starts we t lev an remained  near  ten-year  ows.
