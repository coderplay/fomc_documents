The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Gross Domestic Product, 2002:Q3 Advance Estimate

According to the BEA s advance release, real GDP increased at an annual rate of = 3.1 percent in the third quarter of 2002 after having risen 1.3 percent in the second quarter.  The BEA s estimate of the overall change in real GDP came in = as we had expected and matched the average pace recorded over the first half of the year.  A slightly slower rate of inventory accumulation last quarter than in the preceding one subtracted 0.1 percentage point from the increase in real GDP; the change in inventory investment contributed significantly to the increase in output in the first and second quarters.  Final sales, which were roughly flat in the second quarter, rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent last quarter; a surge in consumer motor vehicle sales accounts for half of this swing.

Among the components of final demand, real PCE outside of motor vehicles rose at a modest pace in the third quarter.  Residential investment declined at an annual rate of 0.8 percent last quarter after a sizable increase over the first half of the year.  Business fixed investment ticked up 0.6 percent, as another large decline in investment in structures was roughly offset by a 6.5 percent increase in real spending on equipment and software Χ the best performance since the second quarter of 2000.  Although spending increased for most types of capital equipment last quarter, the pickup in real expenditures on computers and peripheral equipment Χ at an annual rate of 49 percent Χ was particularly striking. Federal government consumption and investment increased at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, the slowest pace in a year, while state and local government outlays rose at a 1.2 percent rate, about the same as in the first half.  Exports and imports both increased modestly after their surges in the second quarter, but the deceleration was more marked for imports.  As a result, net exports made only a small arithmetic deduction from the change in real GDP, after having subtracted 1.4 percentage points in the second quarter. Elsewhere in the accounts, the personal saving rate was 3.7 percent in the third quarter, the same as the firsthalf average.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending

Total nominal personal income rose at an annual rate of $37.1 billion in September, compared with the $26.2 billion increase in August.  The gain in personal income in September largely reflects higher private wages and salaries stemming from an advance in both hours worked and average hourly earnings. 1 Other labor income, farm income, and dividend income continued to rise at the same moderate pace as earlier in the year, while other proprietors  income and =

income from transfer payments surged in September.  Rental income declined for the third straight month owing to fees associated with the surge in mortgage refinancing activity; interest income also continued to be a drag.  With personal tax and nontax payments essentially flat, disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of $36.8 billion in September.  In real terms, disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of $18.3 billion, or 0.3 percent at a monthly rate.

Real personal consumption expenditures declined 0.6 percent in September owing to a significant contraction in spending on motor vehicles.  Among other durable goods, purchases of hand tools and computers picked up noticeably, but spending on home furnishings declined.  Real spending on nondurable goods also fell last month, with broad-based weakness that included further declines in outlays for food and clothing.  Spending on services advanced a bit, as increased spending on electricity outweighed reduced spending on airline travel and hotels and motels.

The increase in real disposable income combined with the decline in personal consumption expenditures led to a 0.8 percentage point jump in the personal saving rate, to 4.2 percent.

Labor Market Developments

Today s Employment Situation Report indicated that the labor market remained = weak in October.  After having posted very modest gains from May through August, private employment on nonfarm payrolls fell 29,000 in October after a decline of 17,000 in September.   Average weekly hours of production or 2 nonsupervisory workers ticked back down to 34.1 hours in October, and the unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent, retracing September s decline. =

Employment in manufacturing and related industries dropped again last month. Manufacturers shed 49,000 jobs in October, and the average loss in this sector during the past three months has been more than double that experienced during the preceding several months.  Within manufacturing, job loss was widespread, as the one-month diffusion index of manufacturing payrolls came in at 40.4. 3 Meanwhile, help supply and wholesale trade registered their largest payroll declines since November 2001, losing 56,000 and 16,000 workers respectively.

Employment also fell in construction (down 27,000 jobs in October) and in the transportation and utilities industry (down 4,000 jobs).   In contrast, the strength 4

of the housing market and the surge in mortgage refinancing led the finance, insurance, and real estate industry to add 34,000 jobs in October, its largest onemonth increase since March of 1998.  Employment in services excluding help supply rose 74,000 in October, about the same pace as in the third quarter. Governments added 24,000 jobs in October, with most of the gain at the federal level resulting from hiring by the Transportation Security Administration.  The retail trade industry added 14,000 jobs after two months of declines.

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers moved down 0.1 percentage point to 34.1 hours in October, and the September workweek was revised down to 34.2 hours.  As a result, aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined 0.4 percent in October and now stand below the August level.

The increase in the unemployment rate in October is echoed by other data from the household survey.  The proportion of individuals in the civilian labor force classifying themselves as job losers rose to its highest level since the recession began, while the proportion of individuals working part-time for economic reasons is now at its highest level since last December.  After having risen more than 1.1 million in August and September, household employment fell 271,000 in October.  The labor force participation rate edged down 0.1 percentage point, to 66.7 percent.

Initial claims for unemployment insurance under state programs rose 16,000, to 410,000, for the week ended October 26, reversing most of the previous week s = decline.  Smoothing through the up and down movements of the last several weeks, the four-week moving average of claims decreased 3,000, to 402,000. The level of claims in October appears to be somewhat depressed as a result of the BLS s decision to include data from October 2001 (when claims were = elevated following the September 11 attacks) in the construction of its seasonal factors.  Using seasonal factors computed without data from 2001, the level of claims rose 8,000, to 439,000, for the week ended October 26, while the fourweek moving average inched up to 431,000.

The level of insured unemployment for the week ended October 19 rose 76,000, to 3.62 million, while the insured unemployment rate remained at 2.8 percent. In the week ended October 12, 812,000 persons received TEUC benefits.

Labor Costs

The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at an annual rate of 2.5 percent over the three months ending in September, after having posted a 4.4 percent increase over the previous three-month period. The wage and salary component of the index rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent, while benefit costs rose at a 4 percent rate.  Over the twelve months

ending in September, private-industry hourly compensation rose 3.7 percent; this rate was 0.3 percentage point lower than a year earlier Χ a deceleration that now appears more consistent with the weakness in labor markets.  Excluding sales workers, whose compensation includes a substantial commissions component, the ECI decelerated 0.5 percentage point over the past year.

On a twelve-month-change basis, wage and salary inflation was 3.2 percent Χ down 0.4 percentage point from a year earlier Χ while benefit cost inflation moved down only 0.1 percentage point, to 4.8 percent. Within benefits, employers  costs for health insurance and workers  compensation accelerated = = noticeably over the past year, but these changes were roughly offset by a sharp deceleration in nonproduction bonuses and a less pronounced deceleration in retirement and savings costs. 5

The deceleration in compensation over the past year varied considerably by industry.  Hourly compensation in construction and in services decelerated sharply, while the rate of change in compensation in other industries has remained steady or increased.  By occupation, hourly compensation of both white-collar and blue-collar workers decelerated 0.3 percentage point over the past year, while growth of service workers  hourly compensation edged up = 0.1 percentage point.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls increased 0.2 percent in October.  Over the twelve months ended in October, the change in average hourly earnings was 3.0 percent, down from 3.8 percent over the preceding twelve months.

Prices

The chain-weighted price index for GDP is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the third quarter, while core PCE price inflation was 1.9 percent.  The four-quarter change in core PCE prices was 2 percent, compared with 1.6 percent over the year-earlier period.  However, this pattern is distorted by the BEA s treatment of insurance payouts associated with last year s terrorist = = attacks, which temporarily lowered the PCE price index in 2001:Q3.  Excluding these adjustments, the four-quarter change in core PCE prices would have been 1.7 percent last quarter, compared with 2 percent a year earlier.

On a monthly basis, both the overall PCE price index and the core index were up 0.2 percent in September.  As with the quarterly indexes, the published yearover-year increases are distorted by last year s treatment of insurance payouts. = Excluding these insurance effects, the twelve-month change in core PCE prices would have been 1.7 percent this September, down from 1.9 percent over the

ISM Report on Manufacturing

The latest reading from the Institute of Supply Management s (ISM) = Report on Business indicated that activity in the manufacturing sector receded in October. The overall index declined to 48.5, the second consecutive month that the index stood below 50.  However, the new orders index, the component of the overall PMI most useful in forecasting near-term movements in manufacturing IP, edged up to 50.9 in October and has hovered near 50 for the last four months.  A slightly lower proportion of respondents felt that their customers  inventories = were too low in October (24 percent), while the proportion that felt their customers  inventories were too high increased (9 percent); overall, the diffusion = index of customers  inventories returned to the level that prevailed in July and = August.  The diffusion index of own inventories fell last month to its lowest level since February. The diffusion index for prices fell to 58.3 in October, as the share of respondents seeing increases in the prices paid for purchased commodities declined (to 27 percent from 32 percent in September) and a greater share faced price declines.

Construction Put In Place

The total nominal value of new construction put in place increased 0.6 percent in September, but it was down 1.3 percent (quarterly rate) for the third quarter as a whole, despite moderate upward revisions to the July and August figures.  In real terms, construction expenditures rose 0.5 percent in September but declined 1.4 percent over the third quarter.  Overall, these data were somewhat above the assumptions that the BEA used when putting together the advance estimate of real GDP.

In the private sector, nominal spending for residential construction rose 0.7 percent in September, as a 1.8 percent increase in expenditures for singlefamily structures and a slight rise in multifamily construction were partly offset by reduced outlays for residential improvements.  For the third quarter as a whole, residential expenditures edged up 0.2 percent at a quarterly rate, which is the slowest increase over the past two years.

Nominal nonresidential construction spending was off 1.7 percent in September. The weakness was widespread across types of construction, with decreases for office buildings, lodging and miscellaneous structures, non-office commercial structures, and industrial facilities.  In contrast, institutional building increased 3 percent (nominal) in September.  For the third quarter as a whole, expenditures on nonresidential construction decreased at a quarterly rate of

Light Vehicle Sales

Light vehicle sales in October were 15.3 million units at an annual rate, a decrease of 900,000 units from September's pace.  Sales of domestically produced vehicles fell 400,000 units (3 percent) and sales of foreign-produced vehicles dropped nearly 500,000 units (13 percent).  By type of vehicle, sales of autos dropped 600,000 units and sales of light trucks declined about 300,000 units.

Sales at GM improved in October, while sales at nearly all of the remaining firms were down from their levels in the previous month.  According to our industry contacts, sales at GM in September were reportedly held down by limited supplies of heavily-discounted 2002 model-year vehicles relative to its competitors.  In October, GM's sales and market share rebounded as incentives were broadened to cover 2003 models, which were available in greater supply. Nonetheless, the level of GM's sales in October were about a half million units below their average pace in the third quarter.
