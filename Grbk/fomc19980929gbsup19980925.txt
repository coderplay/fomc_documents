The survey esults dicate  hat  here  as  been  a  fairly despread ightening   standards r in t t h wi t of and  terms  on  commercial  and  industrial ns o arge  nd  middle-market  irms. owever,  the loa t l a f H respondents  eported  ittle  ange  in  standards  nd  terms  for ommercial  and  industrial  ans o r l ch a c lo t small  businesses,  d  they  were  slightly  re willing  o rovide onsumer  installment  ans han an mo t p c lo t they ad  been  a  month earlier. mand  for oth usiness  nd  consumer  loans eportedly s h De b b a r ha softened  ecently. r

By o b b t o l s 1 contrast,  ere as little  t hange  reported  n  standards  or ommercial  and  industrial  ans o th w ne c i f c lo t small usinesses.  ost terms  on  these oans ere  also ittle  anged, n  net,  lthough aximum b M l w l ch o a m sizes f redit  ines  ere  trimmed  by  a  substantial  action  anks.  However,  even  the  relative o c l w fr ofb stability   he  terms  on  small oans arks a  departure  rom  recent  urveys,  hich  have  generally oft l m f s w shown some easing.

Thirty  ercent  f he  large  anks  on  the anel  (those  ith  assets  reater  han 15  billion)  ported p o t b p w g t $ re having  tightened  ending  tandards  n loans o arge  nd  middle-market  irms,  hile  only  about l s o t l a f w ten ercent  f  the maller  anks, n  net,  ad  done  so.  Similarly, arger  hare f he arge anks p o s b o h a  l s o t l b generally  eported  aving ightened  erms  on  such  loans; he nly  exception  as maximum  credit r h t t t o w line  ize,  hich  was  tightened   a  somewhat larger  raction  f he maller  espondents. s w by f o t s r

The banks  that  ad  tightened  ending  tandards  nd  terms ost  commonly  attributed  eir h l s a m th decision  o  a  less avorable  conomic  outlook,  nd  a  worsening f ndustry-specific  blems,  s t f e a o i pro a well  as  a  reduced olerance  or isk.  he banks  indicated at  he educed olerance  or isk  id t f r T th t r t f r d not  stem  from  concerns bout oreign  osses  r xposures,  ut ather  rom  other auses. a f l o e b r f c

In  their mments, a  few  banks  noted hat  oan  demand had  been  boosted a co t l by  a  shift om  the ecurities  rkets,  specially  e unk ond  market, oward  bank  finance. fr s ma e th j b t However,  it  ppears hat  his  ubstitution  generally  ore  than  offset  y  other actors at a t t s was m b f th weakened demand. A couple  of anks  noted  that    shift  rom  the apital rkets ight  be  in  the b a f c ma m works,  but  that  t  ad  not et ccurred. i h y o

Because  larger  anks  and  foreign  ranches nd  agencies  re ore likely  o e  involved  n b b a a m t b i the  market or arge yndicated  redits,  e  pattern  f ightening  ported  n  the urvey s f l s c th o t re o s i
