SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Domestic Developments

The BEA will  publish  ts dvance  estimate  f  fourth-quarter i a o GDP growth tomorrow. Our guess  is  that t ill eport   real ncrease  f  around i w r a i o 5 percent. Every major  segment of  private  omestic  spending  appears o  have  surpassed d t our  expectations d so, oo, ave  net  exports. eanwhile,  wages and prices an t h M have performed  about  as  we  predicted, th  inflation  owing  no signs f wi sh o picking p despite  xtremely aut abor arkets  and a downturn in  the  dollar u e t l m since  last  ummer. s

Can the  good times ontinue o  roll?  Perhaps  they  can,  for t  least   while. c t a a However, ultimately  he  constraints    the  supply ide  of  the  economy would t on s stand n  the  way  of  a  lengthy xtension  f  the  3-3/4 o  4 percent eal i e o t r GDP growth  trend hat e have observed  in  the  past hree ears.  The recent t w t y performance  of  labor roductivity  s  supported ur  assessment hat he p ha o t t underlying  ace  of  improvement picked  up at  the  middle  of  the  decade, ut  it p b would require  ome greater  ptimism  to  anticipate  further  ignificant s o a s acceleration    the eriod head. Thus,  a continuation   output ains  even in p a of g approaching hose  we have  been  enjoying robably ould require  hat he t p w t t jobless  ate all  onsiderably  urther.  e  have  strong oubts  that  uch  a r f c f W d s development  could  be achieved  without  quite arked intensification a m of inflationary  essures. pr

In  our  current  orecast,  ere s  no direct  est  f  that ssertion cause  we still f th i t o a be anticipate  substantial  deration n  the  pace  of  economic expansion his a mo i t year.  In  the  near  term, his  eflects,   art,  he  unwinding  of  some special t r inp t factors  hat levated ctivity   late 998--namely, nusually avorable t e a in 1 u f weather  and an auto  strike  ebound. r Of greater  undamental  importance s f i our  view  that he ull arket  in t b m U.S. equities  robably as  run  its  ourse.  In p h c the  forecast,  e  consequent ecline n  the  household ealth-income atio th d i w r gradually  akes he  steam  out  of ggregate emand.  Along the  way,  the t t a d accelerator fects  hat  ave  boosted  investment  ver  the  past ew years lso ef t h o f a wane.

We  are  predicting  hat  eal t r GDP growth  will rop  off o  about  2-1/2  percent, d t on average,  his ear  and  next.  Owing  to he  initial nditions  f  greater t y t co o demand momentum  and a  higher tock arket  level,  his  s  a significantly s m t i stronger  utput ath  than  in  the  last  reenbook--probably  trong nough to o p G s e prevent he  unemployment rate rom rising  ppreciably,   contrast  o  our t f a in t prior  orecasts.  ith this  dditional utness  n  the  labor arket, nd  with f W a ta i m a higher  factory  tilization es  s  well, here s  bit ore acceleration u rat a t i a m in wages and prices  n  this  orecast, though rom  marginally  ore favorable i f al f m initial  vels. il  prices  re  still e  biggest  actor  n  a projected  tep-up  n le O a th f i s i inflation  er  the  next  two  years:  The ov CPI moves up from a 1.5 percent ise r in 1998 to  a 2.6 percent dvance  in  2000,  on  a consistently  asured  basis. a me

Key  Background  Factors

Financial  onditions  ecame increasingly pportive  f  growth  over  the c b su o intermeeting  eriod.  Stock  prices  it  ecord ighs n  the  middle  of  January, p h r h i and subsequent profit  aking" roded  only  a portion  f  those  gains.  Perhaps " t e o because  it ad  been  so  much  feared,  he nticipated ar-end cramble  for h t a ye s funds  proved  to  be a  non-event,  nd  thus  far he  news of  presidential a t impeachment,  military  ction gainst  raq, nd currency risis   Brazil  ave a a I a c in h caused  only  a ripple  n  financial rkets.

The economic outlook or urope and  Japan  is  a little  fter  n  this f E so i Greenbook;  in  non-Japan  Asia, ncoming  indicators tually  ave  been  a bit i ac h more positive  n net  than  we had expected.  But, s  a result  f  the  weaker o a o forecast  or  Latin merica,  foreign eal DP  growth--weighted  cross f A r G a countries  ccording o  the  importance n  U.S.  exports--now  s  projected  o  rise a t i i t only 1  percent n  1999,  3/4  percentage oint ess han  anticipated    the  last i p l t in forecast. rowth is  projected  o  pick  up  to  a 2-1/4 ercent ace  in  2000,  as G t p p recovery ommences  in  Latin  America and growth  firms  in  emerging  Asian c countries.

On foreign xchange  markets, he  dollar  s  little  anged, n balance,  gainst e t i ch o a the  yen  over  the  intermeeting riod,  ut  it as  strengthened  lightly ainst pe b h s ag the  euro.

Recent Developments and the  Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

As noted, GDP growth  in  the  fourth uarter  ppears o  have  been  remarkably q a t rapid,  utstripping  en  the  brisk  rend f  previous  uarters.  part f  the o ev t o q A o story as the  surge  in  motor  vehicle ssemblies, ich contributed out w a wh ab 1-1/2  percentage  oints o  the  GDP  gain; M's post-strike  forts   recapture p t G ef to market  share ed  to  an  intensification rice ompetition  hat,  gainst l of  p c t a a backdrop  of  basically rong emand, helped  push  sales  o  levels  hat  ook st d t t t even the  automakers  by surprise.

Although  source  data  are  still r rom complete, hose e do have  suggest fa f t w that nventory  nvestment lowed in  the  fourth  uarter. ur guess  is hat i i s q O t nonfarm  stock ccumulation ubsided  enough to  subtract  /4  percentage oint a s 3 p from GDP  growth.  The pace of  accumulation--about 1/2 ercent--would  e 2p b well  under  that f  final  ales,  nd  our  sense s hat nventories e  viewed  as o s a i t i ar excessive  n  only  a  few segments  of  the  nonfarm  economy. i

For t t h example,  we  anticipate  at ales f  new light  otor  vehicles,  hich  reached th s o m w a twelve-year  igh  of  15-1/2 illion  nits n 1998,  will lip  o  about h m u i s t 15 million  nits n  2000.

The Outlook for  Wages  and Prices

The fourth-quarter  I report  howed less f  an increase  n  hourly EC s o i compensation  than  we expected.

Now, rather  han fo t decelerating om  the  1998 pace,  we foresee tability    about  3-1/2 ercent fr s at p this  ear  and an uptick  o  3-3/4 ercent n  2000. y t p i

This  forecast  emains  a somewhat awkward  compromise between  two basic r models of  wage determination.  n  one  view,  overly ight  abor arkets  tend I t l m to  generate ver  larger  ncreases  n  nominal  wage inflation, h  no direct e i i wit influence  rom  what is  happening  to  prices  nd thus  to  real ages.

We  also xpect anks  to  maintain ighter i ha o e b t terms  and standards  n  business  oans  than  they  had in lace  six onths ago, o l p m but  not  to  tighten  uch  further.  onsequently,  e do not  envision  ny m C w a constriction    credit  hat ould greatly  estrain siness  pending. of t w r bu s

- 1. OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the  enactment of the President's proposals) are  $39 billion in  FY98, $54 billion in  FY99 and $61 billion in FY00. CBO's August 1998 baseline surplus estimates are $63 billion in  FY98, $80 billion in  FY99 and $79 billion in  FY00. Budget receipts, outlays, and  surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The  OASDI surplus is excluded from the on-budget deficit and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law. The  Postal Service deficit is included in off-budget outlays beginning in  FY90.
- 2.  OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the enactment of the President's proposals), excluding deposit insurance spending, are $35 billion in FY98, $51 billion in  FY99 and  $58 billion in  FY00, and  CBO's August baseline estimates are $59 billion in  FY98, $76 billion in  FY99 and $76 billion in  FY00.
- 3.  Other means of financing are checks issued less checks paid, accrued items, and  changes in  other financial assets and liabilities.
- 4.  HEB is the NIPA current and capital account surplus in  current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and  outlays adjusted to the level of potential output associated with an  unemployment rate of 6 percent. Real potential GDP  growth is assumed to  be 2.8  percent beginning 1995:Q3. Quarterly figures for  change in  HEB  and FI  are not  at annual rates. Change in  HEB, as a percent of  nominal potential GDP, is reversed in sign. FI is the weighted difference of  discretionary changes in  federal spending and  taxes in  chained (1992) dollars, scaled by  real federal consumption plus investment. For change in  HEB and FI, negative values indicate restraint.
- 5.  Fiscal year data for the  unified budget come from OMB; quarterly data come from the  Monthly Treasury Statement and  may  not sum  to OMB fiscal year totals.
