Domestic Developments

Overview

The recent erformance  of  the  U.S.  economy has  not  differed  reatly  rom what  we p g f anticipated    the  August  Greenbook. Real GDP  has  evidently  isen  oderately n  the in r m i third  uarter.  omestic  final emand appears till   be relatively  bust,  ut q D d s to ro b manufacturing ctivity ntinues  o  be  restrained   a  deteriorating de alance nd a co t by tra b a by efforts   curb  non-motor  vehicle  nventory ccumulation. abor  markets  have to i a L remained  extremely ight  verall, ile  indicators   inflation  ends  ontinue o  be t o wh of tr c t mixed.

But  this  as  been  a far rom  placid  ime.  Indeed, he  intermeeting riod as h f t t pe h been marked  by financial mult f uch  a  magnitude  as  to  significantly er  he tu o s alt t outlook or  the  economy.  Given the  lags n  the  response f  domestic emand to  these f i o d shocks, he  effects  re  not  really  pparent n he  very  near erm  path or eal DP,  but t a a i t t f r G they  leave   considerable rk on  the  projected  trength  f  activity   1999. A deeper a ma s o in retrenchment  n  U.S.  stock arkets, ore cautious  redit  rovision, d  more serious i m m c p an disruptions   economic growth  abroad  are  now expected o  combine to  produce  a to t sharper eceleration   output han  we predicted  n  August: After ising  t  an  annual d in t i r a rate f  about  2-1/2 ercent n  average  in  the  current  alf-year,  al DP o p o h re G is  projected to  increase  ust  -1/4 ercent ver  the  four uarters  f  1999. This  pushes he j 1 p o q o t unemployment rate p  about  3/4  percentage oint y  the nd  of  next  year. u p b e

The outlook or  aggregate  emand would be  still aker  had  we not  changed f d we our  monetary  policy ssumption.  We  have  set side ur  previous  ssumption f  a a a o a o stable  ederal  unds ate nd  have  instead  nticipated  at  he  System will ase  money f f r a a th t e market  conditions  ppreciably  etween  now and  next  spring. he lower  path  for he a b T t federal  unds  rate  xerts    significant  fluence  n the rajectory   the  economy in  the f e a in o t of latter lf f  1999 and  in  2000. With this reenbook,  we have  extended  our  forecast ha o G through  2000  for he irst me.  The Fed  easing,  long  with  a diminishing  rag  from t f ti a d the  external  ector, lps o  restore  eal DP  growth  by  the  second  half  f  2000 to s he t r G o around  the  assumed 2-3/4 ercent  rend f  potential tput,  tabilizing  e obless  ate p t o ou s th j r a  touch  below  5-1/2 ercent. p

The incoming  information  n labor ost rends  as  been  ambiguous. However, o c t h we continue o  think hat ompensation  increases  robably re  flattening  is  ear  and t t c p a th y will all  ff ome in  1999--reflecting   only  the  effects  f eaker  profits d of f o s not o w an slower  business xpansion n commissions  and  bonuses  but, ore generally, e e o m th favorable  rend f  price xpectations.  onsumer prices  ave  been  held  down  this  ear t o e C h y

by the  declining  osts f  oil nd  other aterials,  t  in  coming months,  energy  prices c o a m bu should  turn p  a  bit,  nd  the  softening  f he  dollar  n foreign  xchange  markets u a o t o e should  lead o  the irming f  import rices.  hus,  we continue o roject    pickup n t f o p T t p a i overall  PI inflation  om  just  ver  1-1/2  percent  n  the welve  months  that nded  in C fr o i t e August  to  around  2 percent  uring  1999 and  2000. d

Key Background  Factors

As noted  above,  we have  changed  our  monetary  policy ssumption his  ound, n a t r i anticipation   n appreciable  ecline  n  the  federal  unds ate etween  now and  next ofa d i f r b spring. e  chose  the  timing nd  dimension  of  the  easing teps ith  an  eye  to W a s w bolstering mand enough  that eal DP  would again  be  rising  t  a moderate  rate de r G a toward  the  end  of he rojection  eriod nd  to  preventing  he nemployment rate rom t p p a t u f moving above  our  notional  AIRU. N The assumed decline  n  the  funds  rate ppears o i a t be in  the  vicinity  hat  the  market  currently  nticipating. ofw isa

In  the  August  Greenbook,  we indicated at  he  prevailing 1/2 ercent unds th t 5p f rate ould have  been  thought o  be  fairly  estrictive e it ot  for he  financial w t r w r n t stimulus ssociated th  a  high  stock arket  and aggressive  ending. hose conditions a wi m l T have  clearly  hanged  in  the  intervening riod. ven with  monetary  policy asing,  e c pe E e w do not  see  financial rkets eturning  o  their  revious ccommodative  state. arket ma r t p a M participants  ll ikely  e  licking  heir  ounds for   while, nd  they  will ave  to wi l b t w a a h contend  with  an  ongoing  flow  of our  economic  news over  the  coming months. s

That  news will o doubt  include  egative  eports  n  corporate  rofitability  t n n r o p tha should  weigh  on  the tock arket, here  current  xpectations   earnings  nd notions s m w e of a of  "normal"  investment  eturns  till  em out  of ouch ith eality.  nder the r s se t w r U circumstances,  expect hat  ajor  share rice verages ill lip  ack  to  the  recent we t m p a w s b lows  before taging    minimal  recovery hat  egins ext  spring. his  may still   a s a t b n T be conservative  rediction:   our  projection,  rporate  rofits cline  -1/2 ercent  ver p In co p de 5 p o 1999 before ebounding  percent n  2000. Consequently,  rice-earnings  ltiples r 4 i p mu will emain  high  by  historical ndards, aving he  market  vulnerable  o  a r sta le t t considerably  reater  orrection.  in  the  last  reenbook,  we have  chosen  to  address g c As G that ownside  risk  hrough n  alternative  enario  sing  a  model simulation  escribed d t a sc u d at  the  end  of  this  ection. s

The shakiness f  business  onditions  ver  the  next  several  uarters  s ikely  o o c o q i l t affect  redit  arkets long  with  the  equity  ector. isk  spreads n corporate  onds c m a s R o b have widened dramatically   recent  eeks--indeed,  y more than  would seem in w b explicable  y a  reasoned eassessment  f  default  isks  er  se. Rather, it  y losses b r o r p h b

initially "submerging"  market  investments  nd on other everaged  rading  trategies, on a l t s many  of  the layers  ave  sought  to  reduce heir  isk  xposures;  n  the  process,  he p h t r e i t corporate  ector  as  been  the  victim f ollateral  mage,  so  to  speak  We  foresee s h o c da some narrowing  of  corporate  ond spreads s  market  participants ain heir  ooting, b a reg t f but  we do  not  expect hem  to  approach  the egligible sk  remiums that  revailed t n ri p p before.  On balance,  iven he  greater  conomic adversities    this orecast d the g t e in f an renewed awareness  of  risk,  are  anticipating reater  egree  of  restraint    private we a  g d in credit  upplies  han  was built  nto ur  previous  orecast--not y  in  the  corporate s t i o f onl bond  markets  but  also n  bank  lending o  businesses  nd, o  a  much  lesser  egree, o i t a t d t consumers.

We  are  assuming  that fter  ext  spring,  he  federal  unds  rate  ill e steady a n t f w b through  2000. Given that he xpectation  f ed easing s  now so  strongly  eld, e t e o F i h w do not  foresee uch, if  ny,  further  ecline  n  Treasury ields  eyond the  very  short m a d i y b end. The yield urve  should  steepen s  prospects  or   pickup  in  economic activity c a f a are  seen  to  improve  and  expectations garding  ubsequent  ed action  ecome neutral. re s F b On balance,  e do not  expect,  ver  the  next  couple f  years,  o  see  any  major w o o t departures  n  longer-term  reasury nterest  tes  rom  the  range  established    the i T i ra f in intermeeting  eriod--but elds  n  higher-risk  ivate  onds  should  come down a little p yi o pr b as  risk preads arrow. s n

The dollar  as  depreciated  ubstantially inst  he en and key  Continental h s aga t y currencies  ince he  last  OMC s t F meeting, ut  it as  declined ess  n  real erms  as b h l i t measured  by our  broad  index  of  29  foreign  urrencies.  n this  roader asis,  e are c O b b w projecting 1  percent ecline n  the  dollar  n  the  fourth  uarter  s  the ederal a d o i q a F Reserve  eases onetary  policy. hereafter, e  broad  real ollar  ndex  trends m T th d i gradually  ower--roughly    percent  er  year--over  he  remainder f he  projection l 1 p t o t period.

Weighing heavily  n financial rkets  in  recent  eeks has  been  renewed o ma w concern  about  the  outlook or conomic  stability  d growth  in  several  arts f he f e an p o t world.  Relative  o  our  previous orecast,  e argest  hanges  in  the  outlook or t f th l c f foreign  conomic  growth  are  in  Latin merica. However,  we have  also arked down e A m our  projections r rowth  in  other reas.  Overall,  e now expect   slight  ontraction fo g a w a c in  foreign  conomic output ver  the  second  half f  this ear.  We  anticipate  at,  n e o o y th i 1999,  continued eakness  in  output n  Asia  and in  South  America will old  growth  of w i h foreign  eal DP  to  less han  1-1/2 ercent--around 4  percentage  oint elow our r G t p 3/ p b assumption n  the  August  projection.  e  are  expecting  hat,  y 2000,  foreign i W t b economic  growth  will ick  up  to  2-1/2 ercent. p p

Over the  past ew months,  OPEC f and its llies  ppear o  have  been  largely a a t successful  n  achieving he roduction  uts hat hey  pledged o  implement  in  late i t p c t t t June. As a  result,  ogress  as  been  made  in  reducing xcess  inventories    crude  oil, pr h e of and  world  oil rices  ave  firmed.  The spot  price f  WTI  crude  should  average bout p h o a $14.50  per  barrel  or eptember, nd  we expect  it o  climb  somewhat above  $16 per f S a t barrel  y the  first arter  f  next  year--a  ittle  gher  han  at he eginning f his b qu o l hi t t b o t year.  Given  prospects  or orld  economic  growth  at  the ime  of  the  August f w t Greenbook,  we projected  hat  il rices  ould continue o  move up a  bit urther  ver t o p w t f o the  course f  1999. The current  rojection,  wever, mbodies  weaker  world  demand o p ho e next  year, nd in  that  ontext,  e now  think t ore likely  hat rices  f rude  oil ill a c w i m t p o c w average  $16  per  barrel  n  1999. We  have  assumed that  il rices  ill ick  p  to i o p w t u $16.50  per  barrel  n  2000  because  f he  continued eakening  of he  dollar. i o t w t

Although  the  President's  edicament as  introduced  ome new political pr h s dynamics  into he  situation,   fiscal  olicy ssumptions nderlying  ur  forecast ve t the p a u o ha not  changed.  We  have  assumed that  here ill e  no government  shutdown  and  that t w b efforts  o  push  through ome tax  cuts r  to  raise  pending bove  the  caps  will e t s o s a b rebuffed.' he changed  economic  projection d  stock arket  path  have led  us  to T an m mark down our  prediction r  the  federal  udget urplus   bit. fter eaching  oughly fo b s a A r r $68 billion   the  fiscal  ear ow  ending,  he  surplus  s xpected o  shrink o  around in y n t i e t t $56 billion   fiscal  999,  about  $6  billion ss han  our  August  projection.  or  fiscal in 1 le t F 2000,  we expect he  surplus  o  fall  lightly,    $52 billion.  his rajectory   ess t t s to T t isl favorable  han  that  escribed  y  the  CBO t d b of  late, d it ay alter  he  rhetoric xt an m t ne year  regarding he  use  of uture overnment  surpluses. t f g

Recent  Developments  and the  Near-Term  Outlook

We  now expect hat  eal DP  will ncrease  t  an  annual ate f  around  2-1/2 ercent t r G i a r o p in  both  the hird  nd  the  fourth uarters--a  ojection rginally bove  that n he  last t a q pr ma a i t Greenbook.

The negative  ffects  f  the rop  in  wealth u i e o d and  of lower mployment and  income gains  will end  to  outweigh  the  stimulus  rom s e t f lower  mortgage  interest tes.  owever,  because  the  level f ome  construction  uld ra H o h wo remain  quite  igh, dditions   supply  would still   ample. Given  the ack f  pent-up h a to be l o demand, we are  projecting ngle-family  arts   be  unchanged  in  2000,  despite si st to improving  job  growth.

However,  steeply  alling ices c i b f pr along  with  a  desire  o ake  advantage f ewly available  eatures  nd  to  resolve  ear t t o n f a Y 2000 problems  should  prop  up spending omewhat--especially  rly n  the  year, efore s ea i b some firms uspend  major  system  upgrades  so  that  hey  can  focus  on final  oftware s t s fixes nd testing.  n  nominal  terms, e are  projecting at utlays  or  computers  will a I w th o f rise nly  a  few  percent ext ear, hich when deflated  ranslates  to ore than  a o n y w t in m 30 percent ain  in  real,  uality-adjusted ms.

Over time, ising  oblessness ould  restrain e  size f  pay  increases.  he r j sh th o T deceleration   labor ompensation s  expected o  occur  in  the  wage and  salary in c i t component of  the  index.

CBO's August 1998 baseline surplus estimates are $63 billion in  FY98 and $80 billion in  FY99. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The  OASDI surplus is excluded from the on-budget deficit and shown separately as off-budget, as classified under current law. The  Postal Service deficit is included in  off-budget outlays beginning in FY90.
- 2. OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the  enactment of the President's proposals), excluding deposit insurance spending, are $35 billion in  FY98 and $51 billion in  FY99 and CBO's August baseline estimates are $59 billion in  FY98 and $76 billion in  FY99.

HEB is the  NIPA current and capital account surplus in  current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the level of potential output associated with an  unemployment rate of 6 percent. Real potential GDP growth is assumed to  be 2.8 percent beginning 1995:Q3. Quarterly figures for  change in  HEB and  FI are  not at  annual rates. Change in  HEB, as  a percent of  nominal potential GDP, is reversed in  sign.

Canadian stock and bond markets have  moved much  the same as those in Europe and the United States over the period.

Financial  markets in Asia, already having undergone  a major downturn,  were less affected  by the developments  in Russia and Latin America.  Two actions worthy of note were massive intervention in the Hong Kong stock market by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  and the imposition  of exchange controls  in Malaysia.  The HKMA  spent  an estimated $12 1/2 billion in the stock market,  which ended the period up 4 percent.  With the imposition of exchange controls  in Malaysia in early September, the currency was set at  a  10 percent higher level  than  had prevailed  in recent  months.  Malaysian  interest rates have declined,  and the stock market has risen on balance  since the controls were  imposed and  banking supervision  and regulation  were relaxed.

On a trade-weighted  average basis in terms of the major currencies, the dollar has declined  about 4 percent since the August FOMC meeting.  Against a broad weighted average  the dollar is down  only 2 percent, however, reflecting  in large part the dollar's rise against the Mexican peso.

The Desk did not intervene.

Economic  activity abroad.  The growth of  total foreign real GDP (weighted  by shares of  U.S.  nonagricultural  exports)  appears to have remained near zero in the second quarter, and  early indications  for the third  quarter point to continued sluggishness. Japan's GDP showed another substantial  decline, though  the rate of descent slowed somewhat in the  second quarter because of a steep drop in imports.  Domestic demand fell  at an  annual  rate of 6.2 percent  in the second quarter, somewhat more  than in the first quarter.  A drop in industrial production  and big declines in housing starts  and machinery orders in July point to negative GDP growth for Japan again in the third quarter.

Real  growth  in Europe  slowed in the second quarter as German  GDP growth fell to only  0.4 percent  (SAAR) because  of the impact of a VAT increase and unusual weather.  Recent indicators  point to some rebound in the third quarter.  Elsewhere  in Europe,  early indications  are  generally for some  slowing of growth  in the third quarter. Canadian growth should recover somewhat  from a strike-depressed second  quarter. Industrial  countries  showed  a substantial  slowing in growth of real exports  during the first half of 1998  compared with  1997, and Japanese  and  U.K. exports recorded significantly negative  growth rates. Twelve-month  CPI inflation dipped to zero in Japan in July and August,  was running  in the neighborhood  of to  1  2 percent  in continental Europe and 1/ Canada and slowed to the official target of 2  1/2  rcent  in the United Kingdom in August. pe
