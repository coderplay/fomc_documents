NOTE. Change is  from  February   to  March  14/15. 1

Several  developments  in emerging  markets led to a substantial  decline  in stripped spreads  over U.S.  Treasuries  of sovereign  bond yields  of developing countries. On February 3, Moody's Investor Service placed Mexico's sovereign foreign  currency credit rating on review for possible upgrade,  which materialized  on March  7; the rating went from Bal to investment grade,  Baa3. Shortly  thereafter, Standard  &amp; Poor's also raised its rating  for Mexico,  to one notch  below  investment grade.  In the intermeeting  period, the sovereign spread on  Mexico's dollar-denominated foreign bonds fell  about 200 basis points and Mexican  share prices gained  more than  16 percent.  Standard &amp; Poor's revision of the outlook for Brazil's foreign currency credit rating from  stable to positive had  a similar effect on Brazil's sovereign  spread, which  shed 60 basis points over the same period.  The  agreement of Russia and its London  Club creditors to exchange  new senior Eurobonds  for the defaulted debt of the former  Soviet Union  helped to bring the spread on Russian debt down  18 percentage  points.

Prior to the FOMC's decision  on February  2, the Reserve  Bank of Australia raised its cash rate  50 basis points,  and immediately  following  the U.S. move, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate 25 basis  points.  The next day, the European  Central Bank and the Hong Kong Monetary  Authority  each raised their  respective policy  rates 25 basis points, the Danish central  bank raised its two-week lending rate 30 basis points, and the  Swiss  National Bank moved its target band for Swiss-franc  LIBOR 50 basis points  higher.  On February 4, the Swedish  Riksbank hiked its repurchase rate 50 basis points.  The Bank of England increased  its repurchase  rate 25 basis points on February  10,  the same day  the Bank of Korea raised its overnight call rate  a similar amount.  The Reserve Bank of New Zealand raised its cash rate 50 basis points on March  15.

The price of gold experienced wide gyrations  over the  intermeeting period. Various announcements  about hedging  activity  by gold producing companies and  speculation  about the outcome  of bankruptcy proceedings  against a large Ghanian  gold producer caused the metal's price to shoot over $320  per troy ounce in early February. As speculation  subsided  and other gold producers announced that they would not change  their hedging  activity,  the price  of gold retreated,  falling to $289  per ounce or $7  above its early February  level.
