Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Personal Income and Consumer Spending

Total nominal retail sales rose 0.6 percent in August after having surged 1.3 percent in July.  Sales rose 0.5 percent at motor vehicles and parts dealers but fell a touch at building material and supply stores.  Nominal sales in the retail control group of stores, which excludes those outlets, advanced 0.8 percent in August.  In addition, the increases in the retail control category in June and July were revised up slightly to 1 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.  These data are broadly consistent with the current-quarter estimate for real purchases of goods excluding cars and trucks that we wrote down in the September Greenbook.

The increase in nominal sales within the retail control category in August was fairly broad-based.  Sales at general merchandise stores, electronics and appliance outlets, gasoline stations, and food services posted strong gains.  The only downturns were recorded at clothing and accessories stores and at nonstore retailers (which include electronic shopping and mail order houses).

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment ticked down about 1 point in early September relative to August's final report.  The SRC index has been relatively flat since June and stands well above its March low.

Both the current and expected conditions components of the overall index slipped in early September.  For current conditions, consumers' assessments of buying conditions for large household appliances and of their current personal finances both dipped.  For expected conditions, a drop in expected business conditions over the next twelve months was only partly offset by an improvement in consumers' appraisals of their expected personal finances.

Among those items not included in the overall index, expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months deteriorated slightly, partly reversing their improvement in August.  Assessments of buying conditions for houses dropped to their lowest level since March while appraisals of buying conditions for cars were unchanged.

In early September, the mean of expected inflation over the next twelve months jumped to 3.6 percent, and the median rose to 2.9 percent after having increased noticeably in August.  Both measures are at their highest levels since March.   In contrast, the mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years slid to 2.8 percent while the median edged down to 2.6 percent, its lowest level since last September.

Producer Prices

The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.4 percent in August, led by an increase of 0.7 percent in food prices and a rise of 1.2 percent in energy prices.  Excluding food and energy, the finished-goods PPI edged up 0.1 percent last month following July's rise of 0.2 percent.  August's increase in the core was about in line with our expectations and left core PPI inflation at 0.4 percent on a twelve-month change basis, up 0.8 percentage point from a year earlier. Last month's increase in the PPI for energy reflected a jump of 6.3 percent in gasoline prices as well as smaller gains in fuel oil and electricity prices; by contrast, natural gas prices fell 1.5 percent.   Over the year ending in August, the 1 PPI for energy rose more than 14 percent compared with a year-earlier decline of 5-1/2 percent.

The August rise in food prices came on the heels of a small decline in July; large increases in prices for fresh fruit and vegetables and for beef and veal contributed importantly to last month's jump.  Over the twelve months ending in August, the PPI for food rose 5 percent after having fallen 2.3 percent over the year-earlier period.

Prices for consumer goods excluding food and energy ticked up 0.1 percent last month and were essentially unchanged relative to a year earlier.  The PPI for capital equipment edged up 0.1 percent as well, with increases in car and light truck prices largely offsetting a decline in prices of communications equipment. After having fallen 1 percent between August 2001 and August 2002, prices for capital goods rose 0.8 percent over the twelve months ending in August 2003, reflecting an acceleration in prices in most categories.

At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials edged up 0.1 percent in August and was up 1.8 percent from a year earlier.  Prices of core crude material prices jumped 3.7 percent, boosted by large increases in scrap metal prices; core crude prices were up 8.3 percent relative to a year earlier.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit in July was $40.3 billion, which was about the same as in June but smaller than recorded during the previous three months (revised).

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports of goods and services rose 2.0 percent in July, a third consecutive month of solid increases in both goods and services.  Within goods, the largest increases were in agricultural products, aircraft, and automotive products.  Exports of computers and semiconductors also rose, but other capital goods declined.  In July, services receipts were boosted by increases in travel and passenger fares, continuing the rebound from the lows associated with SARS and the Iraq war.  With the release of July data, the monthly value of services receipts was revised down in the first six months of the year by an average of about $200 million per month.  As a result, nominal services receipts fell 6½ percent (a.r.) in the first quarter of 2003, almost twice as much as previously published.  In the second quarter, services receipts, which previously remained flat, edged down ½ percent (a.r.).

Nominal imports of goods and services rose 1.6 percent in July, reflecting a moderate rise in goods imports and a continuing rebound in services payments (largely from travel and passenger fares).  The increase in imported goods in July was the largest rise since March, with consumer goods, oil, and industrial supplies accounting for most of the increase.  The monthly value of services payments was revised beginning in January 2003.  The first quarter was revised down and the second quarter was revised up.  As a result, nominal services payments rose 3 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, less than half the growth rate published before the revision.  In the second quarter, services payments declined

1¾ percent (a.r.), compared with the previously published decline of nearly 6 percent (a.r.).

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In August, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods both fell 0.2 percent, following revised July growth rates of 0.0 and 0.1 percent, respectively. Within core goods, the largest price changes were in industrial supplies and foods, feeds and beverages.  After a 0.9 percent increase in July, prices of foods, feeds and beverages fell 0.4 percent in August, led by lower prices for vegetables.  The 0.6 percent decline in the price of industrial supplies was the result of a lower price for natural gas, which offset increases in metals, building materials, and paper.  In other major trade categories within core goods, prices generally edged down, with the exception of automotive products which rose slightly.  The prices of U.S. imports of computers continued to decline in August, and semiconductor prices also fell.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 3.9 percent in August, following a revised 4.5 percent increase in July.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil was also higher in August, averaging $31.60 per barrel, up about 80 cents from July.  Thus far in September, the spot price has fallen, closing at $28.83 per barrel on September 11.  The recent decline may reflect the lack of supply disruptions from tropical storms and heightened market concern about expected increases in non-OPEC oil supply.  However, prices remain elevated, relative to historical norms, owing to the slow return of Iraqi exports and low global oil inventories.

Exports. In August, for the second consecutive month, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods both fell 0.1 percent.  Falling prices of agricultural products, particularly soybeans and corn, were responsible for much of the August decline.  However, from the first week of August when the BLS collected their price data to the end of the month, the spot prices of soybeans and corn each rose about 9 percent.  Export prices also moved down slightly for consumer goods but edged upward for industrial supplies.  The prices of U.S. exports of computers fell 0.5 percent; prices of semiconductors were unchanged.
