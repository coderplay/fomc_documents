Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

Although economic activity in the late spring appears to have been weaker than we had expected as of the last Greenbook, the few indications available for the second half are consistent with a resumption of stronger activity.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have remained in a range consistent with substantial gains in jobs, sales of autos and light trucks rebounded in July, home sales and permits have remained robust, and orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods rose smartly in June.  Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation has moderated substantially in recent months, although higher energy prices continue to boost inflation.

Labor Market Developments

Employment gains slowed substantially in June following large increases in the March-May period.  The stepdown in private nonfarm payroll gains was widespread, and most major industries posted increases less than half the size of those in the preceding three months.  In addition, the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers dipped 0.2 hour in June, to 33.6 hours, pushing aggregate hours down 0.6 percent.   Even so, for the second quarter as a 1 whole, aggregate hours rose at an annual rate of 2.0 percent, as the average monthly increase in employment was nearly 230,000.

According to the household survey, the labor market situation was little changed in June.  The unemployment rate was unchanged at 5.6 percent, about the same level it has held since the start of the year.  The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point, to 66.0 percent, with rates for all age groups except teenagers showing small increases.  The employment-population ratio, which reflects changes in both the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate, edged up, although it remained within the low range seen since early last year.

Other indicators point to a more positive tone in the labor market.  Since the June reference week, the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has fluctuated in a range just below 350,000, a pace consistent with solid employment gains.  The number of job losers unemployed less than five weeks as a percent of household employment, another measure that serves as a proxy for layoffs, edged down in June.  And layoff announcements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, Inc., declined in both June and July. The four-week moving average of insured unemployment is down a bit from its level during the June survey week.

Labor Output per Hour

(Percent change from preceding period at compound annual rate; based on seasonally adjusted data)

<!-- missing-text -->

Note. Staff estimates.  Annual changes are from fourth quarter of preceding year to fourth quarter of year shown.

Small-business hiring plans edged up in June and stand at a level well above last year's trough, according to the July report from the National Federation of Independent Businesses.  In addition, according to both the Conference Board and Michigan surveys, consumers in July continued by a wide margin to expect the labor market to improve over coming months.

Using the incoming NIPA data, we now estimate that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter and 3.0 percent in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2004, productivity rose an estimated 4.5 percent, about the same as in the previous four quarters.   Looking back further, the revised 2 productivity data now show a slightly more muted dip in productivity in 2001, followed by a slightly weaker recovery in 2002, but the level of output per hour at the end of last year was nearly unchanged from the previous estimate.

Industrial Production

Production fell 0.3 percent in June after having risen rapidly in April and May. The recent dip in industrial activity does not appear to have extended beyond June; indeed, the available near-term indicators point to an increase in production in July.  Motor vehicle assemblies are on track to increase from the slow pace in June, and the decline in output among other industries for which we have weekly production data is mostly attributable to unseasonably cool weather in July that reduced electricity generation.  Elsewhere, manufacturing orders appear to be well maintained and are consistent with solid near-term increases in production.  The available new orders diffusion indexes from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the various regional surveys all moved up in July, and although the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders has dropped back in recent months, it remains at a high level.

In June, the output of utilities and motor vehicles and parts posted significant declines, which together reduced the change in total IP about 0.4 percentage point.  The output at utilities dropped as temperatures returned to more-normal levels after an unseasonably warm May.  Motor vehicle and parts production slipped about 2-1/2 percent for a second month in June as automakers scaled back assemblies in response to an elevated level of truck inventories.

Elsewhere in the industrial sector, manufacturing production excluding motor vehicles and parts, which makes up three-fourths of total IP, edged up 0.1 percent in June after having risen by about 0.7 percent per month since the beginning of the year.  For the second quarter as a whole, this component of IP rose at an annual rate of nearly 9 percent, the largest gain in seven years.

Production of high-technology goods continued to advance at a solid clip in the second quarter.  The gains were concentrated in the output of computers and semiconductors and related equipment, which increased between 35 percent and 40 percent (annual rate); utilization rates in these two industries now stand around 20 percentage points above the lows reached in the last business-cycle downturn.  In contrast, utilization rates for manufacturers of communications equipment, who eked out only a small increase in production last quarter, remain stubbornly low.

Looking ahead, unit shipments of personal computers edged down during the second quarter, but research analysts at Gartner are projecting a stronger-thannormal back-to-school season in the third quarter and a sizable pickup in the pace of replacements of aging PCs.  The midpoint of Intel's third-quarter revenue guidance is consistent with another solid increase in worldwide shipments of microprocessor units (MPUs), the high-value semiconductor chips used in personal computers and servers.  But that increase in MPU shipments may not translate into markedly higher production in the near term because

Capacity Utilization

(Percent of capacity)

<!-- missing-text -->

Intel's inventories of MPUs have risen significantly during the past three quarters. 3

For the semiconductor industry more broadly, the contributions of MPUs to the change in overall semiconductor production have been noticeably less than in the late 1990s, while contributions of non-MPU chips, particularly those used in consumer electronics, such as cell phones, have accounted for a greater share of production gains.  Moreover, high utilization rates among chip manufacturers and expectations of future capacity needs have kept orders and shipments of semiconductor manufacturing equipment at their highest levels in three years. 4

Production excluding energy, high-tech, and motor vehicles and parts, about 70 percent of total IP, increased in all major market groups during the second quarter; in June, only the output of consumer goods declined.  Business equipment production moved up in June and rose at double-digit rates in both the first and second quarters.  The output of defense and space equipment, which fell in the first quarter, rose nearly 12 percent in the second quarter.  The production of business and construction supplies was unchanged in June, but this pause came on the heels of several months of solidly increasing output. Nondurable materials production was also unchanged in June, while the output of durable materials posted another increase.

In June, capacity utilization for total industry was 77.2 percent, 3.2 percentage points above its cyclical low in June 2003 but still 3.9 percentage points below its 1972-2003 average.   The operating rates for downstream industries were 5 farther below their long-run averages than those for upstream industries. Indeed, rates for a few significant upstream industries-including iron ore mining, organic chemicals, pulp and paperboard, petroleum refining, and semiconductors-exceed 90 percent and are well above historical averages.

Michigan Survey Index of Car-Buying Attitudes

<!-- missing-text -->

According to anecdotal reports, bottlenecks have emerged in the transportation sector.  Truck production has been below replacement needs since mid-2000 except for a brief period in 2002.  As a consequence, the fleet has aged considerably, and capacity is quite tight; moreover, federal rules that restrict the number of hours a driver can be on the road have only exacerbated the situation. The combination of tight capacity along with higher diesel fuel prices and driver shortages has encouraged many large trucking companies to increase their use of railroads to ship truck trailers.  So far this year, the substitution of rail for trucking, together with rising imports and exports, has significantly raised the volume of intermodal traffic-the containers and truck trailers shipped by rail-and has caused some considerable delays, especially at Union Pacific.

Motor Vehicles

Light vehicle sales rebounded to an annual rate of 17.2 million units in July after having dropped off sharply in June.  General Motors accounted for more than 60 percent of the overall increase, and confidential data indicate that almost all of the gain in that company's sales was in retail.  According to the latest report from J.D. Powers and Associates, the average incentive per vehicle rose from $2,330 to $2,400 over the first four weeks of July.  Ford and GM, in particular, recently introduced enhanced deals on their large light-truck models. Manufacturers will probably continue to offer substantial discounts on their 2004 model-year lineup to clear out stocks in advance of the arrival of 2005 model-year vehicles late in the third quarter.  However, despite the rise in incentives, the Michigan survey reports that car-buying attitudes have dimmed because respondents are concerned about financing rates.

Business demand for motor vehicles has remained firm.  So far this year, both fleet sales of light vehicles and sales of medium and heavy trucks have come in above the average for 2003.  In light of the current tight freight situation and the recent move by haulers to replace their aging fleets, demand should retain some momentum.  Industry contacts report that producers of medium and heavy trucks expect solid sales in the second half of 2004.  Indeed, in July, the three-month moving average of medium and heavy truck orders remained high, signaling continued strength in demand.

Total motor vehicle production in the second quarter was 11.8 million units, more than 500,000 million units below the first-quarter pace and the lowest level in a year.  Nonetheless, inventories remained elevated at 78 days' supply for the second quarter.  Stocks of light trucks, at 2.2 million units, account for all of the excess inventory.  With strong sales in July, inventories were pared back to 73 days' supply.  The latest schedules from automakers show that the rate for third-quarter assemblies will be about the same as the second-quarter rate, an indication that producers need solid sales to further reduce their inventory overhang.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending slowed sharply in the second quarter, increasing at an annual rate of just 1.0 percent after having advanced 4.1 percent in the first quarter.  Although outlays for services continued to expand at a solid rate in the second quarter, expenditures for goods declined sharply.  The sluggish rise in spending was accompanied by a slight deceleration in real disposable personal income-held back by rising food and energy prices-and a decline in equity values.

Total real personal consumption expenditures slumped 0.9 percent in June.  As noted above, sales of cars and trucks dropped sharply to their lowest levels since February 2003.  At the same time, spending on other goods declined 1/4 percent as expenditures on food fell for a third consecutive month, outlays for apparel dropped, and spending in most other goods categories was also weak.  Some retailers have attributed the moderation in spending to unseasonably cool and wet weather in June.  Expenditures on services also slowed in June as spending on household electricity and gas moderated.

Recent indicators provide some evidence that spending may have perked up in July.  As noted above, purchases of light motor vehicles bounced up.  In addition, sales at the largest chain stores are reported to have been brisk.  And the July readings of consumer sentiment from both the Michigan Survey Research Center and the Conference Board increased and are consistent with gains in spending.

Real disposable income was unchanged in June, damped by higher energy prices and lower wage and salary disbursements.  Real disposable income rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent for the second quarter as a whole.  Nonetheless, the gain in household income outpaced the increase in consumer spending last quarter and boosted the personal saving rate 0.5 percentage point, to 1.7 percent.   Although a lackluster stock market has kept increases in household 6 wealth below the pace of income growth this year, the ratio of household wealth to income remains well above its historical average.

Housing Markets

Although housing construction dipped in June, permits and sales remained robust, and recent indicators point to solid demand in July.  New single-family homes were started at an annual rate of 1.49 million units in June, a considerably slower pace than in April and May.  However, a substantial

increase in the permit backlog in June points to a rebound in starts in July.  The multifamily sector exhibited a similar pattern:  Starts declined in June, but the permit backlog rose, a sign that a bounceback in July is likely.

Home sales remained strong in June.  Sales of existing homes increased 2 percent, to an annual rate of 6.95 million units, the highest pace on record.  In addition, new homes sold at an annual rate of 1.33 million units in June, just a touch lower than the record high posted in May.

Recent indicators suggest that housing demand will hold up reasonably well in the near term.  Although the four-week moving average of mortgage applications to purchase homes has trended down since mid-May, the recent levels are still high by historical standards.  And the thirty-year fixed mortgage rate, which has averaged 6.0 percent since the beginning of July, remains relatively low.  Moreover, consumers' homebuying attitudes in July remained within the favorable range that has persisted for the past couple of years.

Home prices have continued to rise rapidly.  In June, the average price of existing homes sold was up almost 10 percent from the year-earlier level.  The average price of a new home advanced 9-1/2 percent during the twelve months ended in June, and the constant-quality price index for new homes, which controls for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, and other readily measurable attributes, was 8-1/4 percent higher than it was a year earlier, the fastest rate of increase in more than twenty years.

Equipment and Software

Real business spending on equipment and software is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 10.2 percent in the second quarter, a little above the 8.0 percent pace posted in the first quarter.   The second-quarter pickup was 7 largely the result of a bounceback in spending on transportation equipment. After having risen at a robust rate for several quarters, real outlays for equipment excluding transportation items rose at a more moderate rate last quarter.  The deceleration in spending was most pronounced for non-high-tech equipment.  Still, fundamentals continue to send strong signals about investment prospects in general:  Business output is expanding, financing costs remain low, and the corporate sector has accumulated a large cushion of liquid assets.

In the high-tech sector, real outlays increased at an annual rate of 20.4 percent in the second quarter after having risen around 14-1/2 percent in the first

quarter.  Gains in real spending on computers and peripherals accelerated from their sluggish first-quarter pace amid reports of strong replacement demand for PCs.  Outlays for communications equipment skyrocketed in the second quarter, posting a 37-1/2 percent advance.  The BEA's outsized figure reportedly is based on source data from the International Trade Commission that point to a surge in imports of telecommunications equipment in April and May.  However, in May and June, declines in orders for communications gear, which reversed a sizable portion of their earlier gains, suggested some renewed softness in shipments of this equipment in the near term.  Software investment slowed considerably in the second quarter.  Large firms like Microsoft and Oracle reported impressive gains in sales, but a host of smaller firms announced disappointing earnings figures.  The smaller companies were surprised by lastminute deferrals of corporate outlays by customers that appeared to be waiting for a shakeout among the major players in the industry before making their purchases.

In the transportation category, business spending on motor vehicles was flat in the second quarter, while real aircraft investment is estimated to have increased moderately.  Aircraft expenditures continue to linger at levels far below the peaks recorded a few years ago.

Real spending on equipment excluding high-tech and transportation rose at an annual rate of 0.6 percent in the second quarter, down sharply from the 11.6 percent pace posted in the previous quarter.  Nominal orders and shipments in this broad category fell in both April and May before turning up noticeably in June.  Even with the recent weakness, the increase in the backlog of orders each month since February bodes well for this category in the current quarter.  In early July, steel-plate producers reported increased demand from manufacturers of farm equipment, ships, and railroad cars.  Moreover, the surveys of manufacturers by the Philadelphia and New York Federal Reserve Banks and the most recent reading from the ISM pointed to a pickup in activity in July and suggested that the second-quarter weakness in demand for capital equipment is unlikely to persist.

Recent indicators of market conditions in the nonresidential structures sector paint a mixed picture.  Although conditions in the office sector remain soft, they may be bottoming out.  The office vacancy rate edged down in the second quarter but remained elevated.  Office rents continued to decline in the first quarter but did so less rapidly than during the previous year; property values posted a small increase in the first quarter after showing little change last  year. The vacancy rate for industrial space also ticked down in the second quarter.  In the retail sector, the vacancy rate also moved down in the second quarter; on balance, vacancy rates for retail properties have been relatively low since the late 1990s.  Retail property values recorded a small increase early this year after posting more robust advances last year.  The upward trend in the number of natural gas drilling rigs in July suggested that spending on drilling and mining structures is continuing to increase at a robust pace.

Business Inventories

With the June data on manufacturers' inventory investment now in hand, we estimate that real nonfarm inventories excluding finished motor vehicles rose at an annual rate of about $34 billion in the second quarter after a small rise in the first quarter. 10 The change in nonfarm inventory investment is estimated to have boosted the change in real GDP by 0.4 percentage point in the second quarter after having contributed 1.1 percentage points in the first quarter.  Inventory investment has been somewhat subdued relative to recent small decreases in sales, and both book-value and NIPA inventory-sales ratios edged up but remained at fairly low levels.

According to the staff's flow-of-goods system, days' supply of inventories edged up in June, largely as a result of the upswing in stocks of motor vehicles. Apart from motor vehicles and parts, only the inventories of paper and communications equipment appear elevated; in marked contrast to other goods, the days' supply of communications equipment has fallen more than 17 percent since early 2002 and now stands at its lowest level since April 2001.

Federal Government

The federal unified budget deficit appears to have stabilized in recent months as the inflow of receipts has picked up.  In June, buoyant corporate income tax payments caused receipts to jump 11 percent above the level posted a year earlier.  Outlays, adjusted for financial transactions and payment timing shifts, were boosted by higher interest payments on the debt and rose 5-3/4 percent relative to the year-earlier level.  Among non-interest outlays, Medicaid outlays surged in June; some states may have accelerated payments in order to take advantage of the temporarily higher reimbursement rates from the federal government that expired at the end of that month.  Year-over-year increases in defense spending have recently begun to wane:  In June, defense outlays were only 7 percent above their level a year earlier; over the previous twelve months, they typically had shown annual increases of about 14 percent.  Daily data for July and early August suggest some acceleration again in the current quarter.

The Congress has made little progress on budget-related legislation.  The Senate has managed to pass only one of the thirteen regular appropriations bills, compared with an average over the past decade of six bills passed before the summer recess.  The defense appropriations bill cleared both houses and includes a 7 percent increase in budget authority for programs outside the war on terrorism, along with a $25 billion downpayment for continued operations in Iraq.  Neither corporate tax reform nor the extension of expiring individual income tax provisions has seen much progress, in part because of persistent wrangling over PAYGO.

The Administration now projects a fiscal 2004 unified budget deficit of $445 billion, compared with a $375 billion deficit in fiscal 2003.  The Administration projects that the deficit will decline to $331 billion next year, largely reflecting the end of the partial-expensing tax provision, the cyclical improvement in the economy, an assumed falloff in spending on operations in Iraq, and an increase in the effective tax rate.  These factors lead to some further improvement in the deficit in 2006 and little change thereafter.

State and Local Governments

The staff estimates that real spending by state and local governments has risen at an annual rate of 2.5 percent in the second quarter, the largest increase since the first quarter of 2002.  Essentially all of the strength was the result of a surge in construction spending, which began in March.  Meanwhile, employment fell a little in the second quarter after having risen during the previous six months.

Most signs point to overall improvement in state and local financial conditions. Standard and Poor's upgraded three times as many state and local credits in the second quarter as it downgraded.  Many states report that revenues have come in higher than expected in recent months, and general fund spending has been held

in check.  An infusion of federal aid from the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 also bolstered general fund accounts during fiscal 2004, which ended June 30 in forty-six states.  According to a preliminary report from the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), ending general fund balances for fiscal 2004 rose to 5.4 percent of expenditures from 3.7 percent at the end of fiscal 2003; this was the first increase since 2000. 11 Even so, many legislators remain wary about developments in fiscal 2005.  In particular, according to NCSL, outlays for Medicaid are expected to increase more than 13 percent this fiscal year despite the many cost-containment measures that were put into effect during the past three years.

Prices and Labor Costs

Core CPI inflation has moderated substantially in recent months.  However, sizable increases in food and energy prices have continued to push up overall consumer price inflation.

Consumer energy prices rose 2.6 percent in June after advancing 4.6 percent in the previous month.  Although the gains were broad-based, in part because of the pass-through of high crude oil costs, the increases in gasoline prices were especially large.  The strength of demand for gasoline over the past year, combined with stagnant gasoline imports through June, left inventories quite lean in the second quarter.  In addition, higher production costs associated with higher U.S. refinery utilization rates pushed up pump prices relative to crude oil prices through mid-July.  Since then, gasoline imports have begun to rise, bringing wholesale mark-ups down, and retail prices have continued to decline. Among other energy products, natural gas markets softened a bit in July.  By July 23, inventories of natural gas had risen to a level 3.1 percent above their long-run average for this time of the year.  As a result, the spot price of natural gas at Henry Hub finished the month a touch below its level at the end of June.

Consumer prices for food rose 0.2 percent in June, well below the 0.9 percent spike posted in May.  Prices for dairy products advanced rapidly during the three months ending in June because herd reductions over the past couple of years hampered dairy farmers' ability to meet the recent surge in demand.  An extraordinary jump of 6.8 percent in May was followed by a 1.7 percent advance in June, even though dairies increased milk supplies by boosting the feed rates of their cows.  Crop reports so far this season point to bumper harvests for corn and soybeans, and grain prices have fallen in response.  This development has encouraged producers of meats and poultry, which use corn and soybeans as feed, to raise their output a bit.  As a result, increases in

consumer prices for meats and poultry also moderated in June.  Similarly, increases in prices for food away from home, which also had ticked up in May, eased back in June to 0.2 percent.   Over the twelve months ending in June, food prices rose 3.7 percent, a pickup of 1-1/2 percentage points from the preceding year.

Excluding food and energy, the CPI increased just 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent rise in May and larger increases in March and April.  The recent moderation reduced the three-month change to an annual rate of 2.3 percent, a substantial deceleration from the nearly 3 percent rate posted over the first three months of the year.  The slowing in core prices reflected a return to outright price declines for durable goods as well as smaller price increases for a variety of services.  Over the past twelve months, prices of core goods and services rose 1.9 percent, compared with a 1.5 percent increase in the preceding year.

Core PCE price inflation, which did not pick up as much as its CPI counterpart in February and March of this year, has also decelerated less than the CPI in recent months.  The core PCE price index rose 0.1 percent in June, and the twelve-month change was 1.5 percent.  This increase represents only a 0.1 percentage point step-up from the twelve-month change a year earlier, a little smaller than the 0.3 percentage point rise in core CPI inflation.  The market-based component of the core PCE price index increased 0.2 percent in June, a bit more than the core CPI; however, over the past twelve months, the market-based core PCE price index accelerated 0.4 percentage point.

The BEA's recent annual revision made a large change to non-market-based core PCE prices.  The level of nonmarket price inflation was boosted in 2002, and thus the index decelerated 0.4 percentage point in June, on a twelve-month basis.  This is a dramatic revision from the 0.8 percentage point increase in the twelve-month change previously reported for May of this year relative to May 2003.

The prices of goods purchased by businesses decelerated in June.  In particular, capital equipment prices, which rose just 0.2 percent, were damped by sizable declines in prices of high-tech equipment.  Core intermediate materials prices also slowed in June, posting the smallest monthly increase yet this year. Likewise, commodity prices were little changed in June after having increased for several months.

More recently, however, commodity prices have resumed their rapid increases. The JOC industrials index rose 6.5 percent over the four weeks of July and was up 3.8 percent from the July average during the first week of August.  The biggest increase has been in petroleum and metals prices, especially steel scrap. Demand for steel plate has been strong in recent weeks; in addition, the normal

seasonal drop-off in auto production has reduced the 'cutouts' portion of steelscrap supplies.  Because strong demand from China and Korea had already eroded steel-scrap inventories over the past year, the price response was especially sharp.  The Commodity Research Bureau price index, which excludes energy and forest products, also rose in July.

Inflation expectations receded in July, according to the Michigan Survey. Median year-ahead expected inflation dropped to 3.0 percent, 0.3 percentage point below the median in May and June.  Median expected inflation over the next five to ten years also ticked down last month; at 2.8 percent, it is still within the narrow range observed over the past two years.

The information on labor costs released since the June Greenbook suggests little movement in the overall rate of change in hourly compensation so far this year. The Employment Cost Index (ECI) for hourly compensation in private industry rose at an annual rate of 4.0 percent over the three months ending in Junesimilar to the average pace over the preceding year and a half.  In recent quarters, the rise in the wage and salary component of the index has moderated, but that slowing has been offset by sizable run-ups in benefits costs.

Over the three months ending in June, ECI wages and salaries rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent and held the twelve-month change in this component to 2.6 percent.  In contrast, benefit costs, which jumped at an annual rate of 10.9 percent over the first three months of the year, climbed 7.1 percent in the March-to-June period.  The year-over-year change in ECI benefits stood at 7.3 percent in June-the fastest pace in twenty years.  The recent acceleration in benefit costs stems largely from the ongoing rapid increases in costs for retirement and savings that employers are incurring as they replenish their defined-benefit pension reserves that had been depleted by the earlier slump in the stock market.  At the same time, employer costs for health care have continued to rise rapidly, although the increase of 8.1 percent over the twelve months ending in June was down slightly from the double-digit increase posted over the preceding twelve-month period.

Based on the NIPA data on employee compensation for the second quarter of 2004, the staff estimates that the BLS Productivity and Cost release for the second quarter will show an increase of 4.4 percent (annual rate) in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector after a rise of 4.2 percent in the first quarter.  With productivity estimated to have slowed in the second quarter, we believe that unit labor costs increased faster last quarter than in the first quarter.

Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts

The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 30, affected data back to 2001.  The revision allows the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to incorporate more-comprehensive source data, including data from tax records and from economic surveys.  From 2000:Q4 to 2004:Q1, the average annual rate of increase of real GDP is unchanged at 2.5 percent, and revisions to year-to-year growth rates were small.  Nevertheless, the portrait of the business cycle changed in important ways.  The 2001 downturn and the subsequent recovery are both milder than previously estimated.  In the previously published estimates, real GDP peaked in the fourth quarter of 2000 and then decreased in each of the next three quarters; in the revised estimates, real GDP decreased in the first quarter of 2001 but increased in the second before decreasing again in the third quarter.  The cumulative decline in real GDP during these three quarters is now estimated to have been 0.4 percent, well below the average 2.3 percent drop in real GDP during post-1955 recessions.  From the third quarter of 2001 to the first quarter of 2004, the revised estimates show that real GDP increased at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent, compared with the previously estimated rate of 3.4 percent.

For 2001, the largest contributor to the upward revision to real GDP was state and local consumption and investment, but most other components also contributed.  For 2002, the largest contributors to the downward revisions were spending on equipment and software and personal consumption expenditures (PCE).  For 2003, the slight upward revision was attributable to small and mostly offsetting revisions to many components. The revised estimate of real GDP in the first quarter of 2004 reflected the BEA's introduction of an improved methodology for accounting for the production of light trucks.  The new procedure uses unit production data as well as FRB seasonal factors and is similar to the BEA's methodology for automobiles.  The new figures now show that real gross motor vehicle output increased at an annual rate of 8.8 percent in the first quarter rather than declining 8.2 percent as reported earlier; the revised estimate is broadly consistent with our estimate that industrial production of new motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the first quarter.

The revisions to real GDP imply little change to the trend increase in output per hour in the nonfarm business sector in recent years.  However, we expect that the Bureau of Labor Statistics will show a new pattern of productivity changes when it releases its revised data on August 10.  Measured from fourth quarter to fourth quarter, the NIPA data imply an upward revision to the growth rate of labor productivity of 0.2 percentage point in 2001, a downward revision of 0.6 percentage point in 2002, and an upward revision of 0.2 percentage point in 2003.

The annual NIPA revision also included new estimates of income-related measures. Gross domestic income (GDI) was revised down in 2001 and revised up in 2002 and 2003.  These revisions, combined with those for GDP, changed the pattern of the statistical discrepancy (GDP-GDI)-most noticeably, it is now estimated to have begun narrowing in 2001 and has remained in positive territory since 2002:Q3.  Among the components of personal income, the BEA's estimates of private wages and salaries, a major source of revisions in previous annual revisions, were little changed.  However,

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

II-A-3

other components of personal income were revised substantially.  In particular, the BEA revised up its estimate of employer contributions to defined-benefit pension plans, which boosted supplements to wages and salaries in 2002 and 2003; and it revised down personal income receipts on assets in 2002 and 2003 (principally, interest and dividends).  Because personal tax payments were little revised, the revisions in disposable personal income (DPI) mimic the changes in personal income; by the end of 2003, the level of current-dollar DPI is $56.6 billion less than previously estimated. Taken together, the revisions to DPI and PCE added 0.1 percentage point to the personal saving rate in 2001 but cut it substantially in 2002 and 2003.  Corporate economic profits were revised down in all three years as upward revisions in before-tax profits were more than offset by downward revisions in capital consumption allowances.  As a result, the profit share as a percent of GNP (excluding Federal Reserve Banks) was revised down in all three years.

Overall, our view of core inflation over the past several years is little affected by the new data.  Core PCE prices now decelerate slightly less from 2001 to 2003.  More recently, the level of core inflation is a little higher than before, and its turning point occurs one quarter earlier.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Over the intermeeting period, the market's expected path for the federal funds rate shifted down and longer-term interest rates declined somewhat in response to weaker-than-expected economic data releases.  Still, market participants are virtually certain that the FOMC will raise the federal funds rate 25 basis points at the August meeting and have priced in 75 basis points of tightening between now and year-end.  Stock prices declined over the intermeeting period, while risk spreads on corporate bonds were little changed.

Corporate debt growth has picked up recently on the strength of short-term financing.  Household debt growth has slowed from its double-digit pace in the first quarter but has remained relatively brisk.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

The FOMC's decision to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at the June meeting was widely anticipated.  However, the accompanying statement-which characterized recent inflation as partly the result of transitory factors and retained language indicating that the pace of policy tightening could be measured-led investors to expect a more gradual pace of tightening.  That shift in the expected policy path was subsequently reinforced by economic data releases that were softer, on net, than the market had expected, although the generally favorable economic outlook conveyed in the Chairman's monetary policy testimony provided some offset.  Over the intermeeting period, federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates declined on net by 20 to 40 basis points beyond the very near term.  Options prices suggest that the declines reflected reduced odds on particularly rapid increases in the funds rate.  Market participants now expect the funds rate to reach about 2 percent by the end of this year and 3-1/4 percent by the end of 2005.  A recent survey suggests that market participants also anticipate that at the August meeting the FOMC will continue to view risks to the outlook for both economic growth and inflation as balanced and will retain the 'measured pace' language-or some variant.

Yields on intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasuries moved down with the change in policy expectations over the intermeeting period, declining 15 to 25 basis points on net.  Similar decreases in yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities decreased a bit less, leaving inflation compensation down slightly. Implied volatilities of Treasury bond prices increased a bit over the intermeeting period.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Despite generally strong earnings reports for the second quarter, major stock price indexes fell 3 to 9 percent on net over the intermeeting period, with the Nasdaq index leading the decline.  Market participants had apparently expected

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

even stronger second-quarter results and were disappointed by the cautious revenue outlooks from some major companies.  Steadily rising oil prices also contributed to the declines in stock prices.

Even as stock prices broke through their 2004 lows, expected and realized volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 and the S&amp;P 500 remained muted.  At the same time, the twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio for firms in the S&amp;P 500 ticked up, and its spread over a long-run Treasury yield, a rough measure of the equity premium, widened a bit further.

Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined roughly in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasuries over the intermeeting period.  As a result, risk spreads have changed little, as expectations of moremoderate earnings growth evidently have not shaken the view that corporate credit quality will remain strong.  Risk spreads on commercial paper have remained low.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Based on results for the 400 firms in the S&amp;P 500 that have already reported second-quarter earnings, operating earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 are estimated to have risen about 25 percent from four quarters earlier.  Although more than two-thirds of the reports exceeded consensus estimates, this fraction was below that posted in recent quarters.  In addition, analysts' forecasts of yearahead corporate earnings have hardly budged of late after several months of strong upward revisions.

Credit quality of nonfinancial firms has remained strong.  Among the recent news on credit quality, upgrades outpaced downgrades in the second quarter--the first net upgrade since 1998--and the bond default rate has remained very low. A forecast of aggregate year-ahead default rates based on the KMV model also has changed little in recent months, holding at its lowest level since the late 1990s.  Expected default rates have dropped substantially for the vast majority of firms but have remained elevated for a troubled minority.

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance has slowed in recent months.  Given the steady pace of bond retirements, net bond issuance was close to zero in the second quarter and was negative in July, as nonfinancial firms continued to rely on robust earnings, shorter-term debt, and ample cash assets to fund their investments.

In contrast, short-term debt has continued its turnaround.  Net issuance of commercial paper has been robust in recent months, reportedly boosted by increased merger activity.  C&amp;I loans on banks' books were about unchanged in

the second quarter after thirteen consecutive quarterly declines and appear to have expanded in July.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, banks continued to ease lending terms and standards, and nearly half of the responding banks, on net, reported stronger demand for C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  Banks pointed to rising accounts receivable, inventories, and capital expenditures among their loan customers as factors contributing to increased loan demand.  With the rebound in short-term credit, total net debt financing for nonfinancial firms picked up in July from its weak second-quarter pace.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms has been sluggish in recent months.  The pace of IPOs has risen, but most deals have been small, and nearly half were sold at prices below their filing ranges.  At the same time, equity retirements appeared to have picked up in the second quarter, leaving net equity issuance more firmly negative.  Completions of cash-financed mergers totaled $7 billion at a monthly rate, a 50 percent increase over the first-quarter volume, and a spate of new deals announced in July indicates that merger completions will remain elevated.  Stock repurchases are estimated to have been robust again in the second quarter; they have been buoyed by ample corporate profits and cash holdings and will be boosted a bit over the next couple of years by Microsoft's recently expanded share repurchase program.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have grown at a robust 9 percent pace in the second quarter, a view based largely on the strength of CMBS issuance, which totaled a near-record $25 billion.  CMBS deals completed in July, along with those now in the pipeline, indicate continued strength in the current quarter. CMBS credit quality has remained solid, as delinquency rates on CMBS issues edged down again in June, and CMBS spreads have remained low.  REIT equity prices rose slightly over the intermeeting period, remaining well above their second-quarter lows.  The ratio of net operating income to price on commercial properties fell in the second quarter, and its spread over the real long-run Treasury rate narrowed further, a move consistent with declining risk premiums on commercial real estate assets.

Household Finance

Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages declined about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period, and the spread between rates on fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages narrowed a bit.  However, at around 190 basis points, this spread remains relatively wide and has likely continued to fuel ARM originations, which have been climbing sharply since the beginning of the year. Although the growth rates of mortgage and consumer credit are estimated to

have slowed somewhat in the second quarter, household debt growth has remained strong.

Household credit quality continues to be solid.  The financial obligations ratio is estimated to have ticked down further in the second quarter, as a decline in the average interest rate on household debt more than offset an increase in the ratio of debt to disposable income.  In addition, delinquency rates on securitized credit card pools, as well as those on auto loans at captive finance companies, stayed at relatively low levels in the second quarter.  A more up-to-date measure, household bankruptcy filings, has consistently been a shade lower than its yearago levels but has remained somewhat elevated.

Growth in household wealth appears to have stalled.  The combination of lower stock prices and the likely continued slowing of house price appreciation suggest that the ratio of household net worth to disposable income was about unchanged in the second quarter.  Despite the lackluster performance of stock prices, flows into equity mutual funds were strong in July, albeit at a slower pace than earlier in the year.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed in July, as new capital issuance dropped back from a very rapid pace in June.  The issuance of shortterm debt jumped in June, as it typically does, to cover budget shortfalls at the end of the fiscal year; but it rose only to about half its year-ago pace, as fiscal positions of states and municipalities have improved.

Yields on highly rated municipal bonds declined roughly in line with Treasuries over the intermeeting period, and measures of municipal bond credit quality improved.  The spread between yields on BBB-rated and AAA-rated municipal bonds declined to its lowest level since 2001, and upgrades of municipal bonds continued to outpace downgrades.

Treasury and GSE Finance

The federal budget situation showed continued signs of improvement over the intermeeting period.  The $19 billion surplus for June exceeded consensus expectations.  Market participants expect favorable year-over-year comparisons of budget data in July and August because of improving receipts and the adverse effect of the 2003 fiscal stimulus package on last year's monthly budget numbers.  In its midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasury retained the reopenings of ten-year nominal securities but indicated it might trim auction sizes for coupon securities if the budget situation continues to improve.

III-13

Over the intermeeting period, the GSEs weathered a slew of negative news about their earnings, accounting practices, and regulatory compliance.  In addition, investors shrugged off Fannie Mae's decision in mid-July to break with its previously announced calendar of benchmark debt issuance.  Indeed, yield spreads on GSE-issued bonds relative to comparable-maturity Treasuries narrowed substantially, on net, over the intermeeting period, and their stock prices outperformed broad equity market indexes.

Money and Bank Credit

The growth of M2 slowed sharply in June to about a 1-1/2 percent pace, and the aggregate is estimated to have contracted slightly in July.  The deceleration was due mainly to weaker liquid deposit growth, which likely reflected a moderation in mortgage refinancing activity.  In addition, retail money market fund assets resumed their more-than-two-year downward trend in June and July.  The slowdown in M2 would have been even more pronounced if not for a spike in currency demand from Russia and Iraq.

While real estate lending at banks has slowed of late, the growth rates of business and consumer loans (adjusted for securitization) have picked up. Excluding the effects of sizable litigation-related provisions at two large banking firms, second-quarter net income at large bank holding companies remained very strong.  Loan-loss provisions continued to decline, reflecting further improvements in asset quality.

July 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey

The July 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  In addition, the survey queried banks about the extent to which the recent developments in the bond markets have affected their C&amp;I lending patterns.  Responses were received from fifty domestic and nineteen foreign banking institutions.

Both domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks further eased lending standards and terms for C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  A small net fraction of domestic institutions also reported an easing of lending standards for commercial real estate loans, while standards for this type of loan at foreign institutions were essentially unchanged.  In July, the net proportion of domestic banks that reported stronger demand for C&amp;I loans was a bit higher than in April.  But a considerably larger net fraction of domestic banks reported stronger demand for commercial real estate loans compared with the April survey.  Foreign respondents indicated a sharp turnaround in C&amp;I loan demand over the past three months; in contrast, demand for commercial real estate loans at these institutions was reportedly unchanged over the survey period.  In the household sector, a notable net fraction of domestic banks reported an easing of credit standards on residential mortgage loans.  The demand for this type of loan was about unchanged, on net, whereas demand for consumer loans of all types reportedly deteriorated over the past three months.

Lending to Businesses

In the July survey, both domestic and foreign institutions reported a further net easing of credit standards on C&amp;I loans.  On net, about one-fourth of domestic banks indicated that they had eased standards for large and middle-market business borrowers over the past three months, roughly the same net percentage as in the April survey.  In contrast, only 4 percent of domestic institutions, on net, eased their lending standards for small firms, a notable decline from the 20 percent net easing reported in April.  The net percentage of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having eased their lending standards for C&amp;I loans rose from 30 percent in April to 42 percent in the current survey.

Domestic and foreign respondents also indicated that they had eased a number of lending terms on business loans over the past three months.  On net, 45 percent of domestic commercial banks reported that they had lowered spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for large and middle-market firms, and more than one-fourth, on net, reported having done so for small firms.  Among foreign institutions, more than onehalf of respondents, on net, reported having narrowed spreads on their C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  In addition, sizable net fractions of both domestic and foreign institutions reported that they had eased covenants on C&amp;I loans, especially for loans to large and middle-market firms. As in the April survey, domestic and foreign respondents indicated that they had eased terms on credit lines, both by increasing the size of credit lines and by reducing their cost.

About 90 percent of domestic and almost 70 percent of foreign respondents cited more aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for easing lending standards and terms over the previous three months.  In addition, about three-fourths of domestic and foreign institutions pointed to a more favorable economic outlook as a reason for easing their business lending policies. Domestic institutions also frequently pointed to improvement in industry-specific problems and increased tolerance for risk as reasons for their move toward a less stringent lending posture.  A small number of domestic banks that tightened their business lending standards or terms over the past three months generally cited a reduced tolerance for risk or a worsening of industry-specific problems.

C&amp;I loan demand. On net, one-third of domestic banks reported an increase in demand for C&amp;I loans from large and middle-market borrowers over the past three months, a slightly higher net percentage than in the April survey; about 45 percent also reported stronger loan demand from small firms.  In addition, almost one-half of domestic respondents reported an increase in inquiries from potential business borrowers over the same period, about the same fraction as in the April survey. Domestic respondents that experienced stronger loan demand pointed to their borrowers' increased financing needs for accounts receivable and inventories as well as for investment in plant and equipment.  In the current survey, demand for business loans was also stronger at branches and agencies of foreign banks, which in April reported a weakening in demand.  More than one-fourth of these institutions reported stronger demand in July, most frequently attributing it to an increase in customer needs for M&amp;A financing.  These survey results are consistent with bank credit data, which show a notable pickup in the growth of C&amp;I loans in recent months.

In light of the sharp decline in net bond issuance in the second quarter, a special question on business financing asked banks about the extent to which developments in the bond market had affected their C&amp;I lending.  Although only 12 percent of domestic banks reported a moderate reduction in loan paydowns, more than one-fifth of foreign respondents noted that the decline in bond issuance caused a moderate or a substantial reduction in the paydowns of C&amp;I loans.

Commercial real estate lending. On net, 8 percent of domestic banks reported that they had eased lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months, about the same net proportion as in the April survey.  The net percentage of domestic banks that experienced an increase in demand for this type of loan moved up from 20 percent in April to 32 percent in July.  In contrast, demand for commercial real estate loans at foreign institutions was reportedly unchanged, on net, over the past three months.

Lending to Households

The net proportion of banks indicating increased willingness to make consumer installment loans declined to 8 percent in July from 17 percent in the April survey. Standards for approving applications for credit cards and other consumer loans, as well as most terms on these loans, were unchanged, on net, in the July survey.  Demand for consumer loans of all types reportedly slackened over the past three months: On net,

III-A-3

15 percent of banks experienced weaker consumer loan demand in the current survey, compared with 22 percent of institutions, on net, that reported stronger demand in April.

In the current survey, 9 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had eased credit standards on residential mortgage loans, about the same net percentage as in April.  Reported demand for residential real estate loans was about unchanged, on net.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit shrank to $46.0 billion in May from $48.1 billion in April (revised).

<!-- missing-text -->

In May, the value of exports of goods and services increased 2.9 percent to a record high, with exports of goods more than accounting for the entire rise, as exports of services edged down slightly.  The increase in the value of exported goods was driven by increases in capital goods and industrial supplies.  Exports of agricultural and automotive products also edged up, whereas exports of consumer goods dropped a bit.  At an annual rate, the average value of exported goods and services in April and May was about 16 percent above the first-quarter level.  The increase was widespread with all major trade categories registering increases, particularly industrial supplies, capital goods, and services.

The value of imports of goods and services rose 0.4 percent in May, as an increase in imports of goods more than offset a slight decrease in services. Within goods, imports of industrial supplies and automotive products showed the largest increases.  Imports of capital goods and foods also edged up.  Imports of consumer goods, however, fell.  Oil imports were little changed as an increase in price offset a decrease in volume.  At an annual rate, the average value of imported goods and services in April and May was about 15 percent above the first quarter level.  The rise was widespread across most major categories of trade with the main exception of oil, which fell.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In June, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods remained unchanged from their May levels, following seven consecutive monthly increases.  After dropping 0.4 percent in May, prices of imported foods fell another 0.5 percent in June.  After two months of large increases, prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies ticked down 0.1 percent. Prices of imported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) also edged down 0.1 percent, whereas prices of imported consumer goods were unchanged.  Import prices of automotive products rose 0.2 percent.  Prices of imported computers and semiconductors decreased 0.1 percent.

In the second quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of imported core goods increased 3.5 percent at an annual rate.  Much of this increase was concentrated in the commodity-intensive categories of industrial supplies and foods, feeds and beverages.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil edged down 1 percent in June after surging nearly 10 percent in May.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $38 per barrel in June, but rose steadily in July to average more than $40 per barrel for the month.  On August 4, the spot price of WTI closed at $42.83 per barrel.  Recent oil price increases have been driven in part by concerns about oil production in Russia, where authorities have seized the main production assets of Yukos, Russia's largest oil company.  Reports suggest that, to pay Yukos' tax bill, these assets may be sold, which may bankrupt the company and could lead to supply disruptions.  In addition, strong world oil demand, violence in the Middle East, and doubts about the reliability of oil supplies from Nigeria and Venezuela continue to keep upward pressure on oil prices.

Exports. In June, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods fell 0.6 percent, following nine consecutive monthly increases.  Falling 4.6 percent in June, prices for exported agricultural products (particularly soybeans) accounted for most of the decline.  Prices of exported industrial supplies also contributed to the decline, falling 0.6 percent.  Prices of exported capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) rose 0.2 percent in June.  Prices of exported semiconductors fell 0.6 percent.  Prices for all other major categories of exports were unchanged.

In the second quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of exported core goods increased 6.0 percent at an annual rate.  Agricultural products and industrial supplies were the main contributors to this quarterly increase.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) weakened in May.  After averaging over $40 billion per month in the first four months of the year, private foreign inflows into U.S. securities in May totaled only $22 billion.  Most of the decline in May owed to a shift in equities (line 4d) from net purchases to net sales.  Demand for agency securities (line 4b) and corporate debt securities (line 4c) remained robust but not spectacular.  Private foreign purchases of Treasury securities (line 4a) remained weak; these purchases, after totaling $66 billion in the first quarter, amounted to a combined $6 billion in April and May.

Net foreign official inflows (line 1) remained brisk at $18 billion in May, though far below the white-hot pace of the first quarter, as Japan has not intervened in foreign exchange markets since March.  Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) suggest a further slowing, as monthly inflows averaged $12 billion in June and July.

.

U.S. investors acquired on net virtually no foreign securities (line 5) in May, following unusually large acquisitions of $17 billion in April.  In what has become the norm, U.S. investors purchased foreign equities and sold foreign bonds.

The banking sector (line 3) recorded sizeable inflows in May, bringing year-todate flows to near balance.

[TIC data for June, which should be available on August 5, will be discussed in the Greenbook supplement.]

Foreign Financial Markets

On net, the dollar's trade-weighted exchange value against major foreign currencies was little changed over the intermeeting period.  The dollar was also little changed on balance against the currencies of our other important trading partners, as modest gains against a number of emerging Asian currencies were offset by losses against several Latin American currencies.

<!-- missing-text -->

The dollar fluctuated during the period, depreciating in response to the lowerthan-expected June U.S. employment and core CPI data reports early in the period, and appreciating in reaction to Chairman Greenspan's semi-annual testimony to Congress on July 20-21, which market participants interpreted as generally reflective of a positive outlook for the U.S. economy, as well as stronger U.S. consumer confidence and manufacturing surveys.  U.S. economic data late in the period were more mixed, leading to a slight retracement in the dollar, but this loss was limited by several weaker-than-expected data releases in a number of foreign industrial economies.

On balance, the dollar was mixed against major foreign currencies, appreciating 3 percent against the yen, depreciating 2 percent against the Canadian dollar, and changing little on balance against sterling and the euro.  The yen experienced a bout of broad-based weakness early in the period.  Analysts

ascribed this weakness, in part, to commentary by Japanese officials that reinforced the view that there would be no urgency to tighten monetary policy. In addition, investors expressed concerns about the duration of a slowdown in China and its effects on the Japanese economy.  Economic data from Canada during the intermeeting period generally met or exceeded expectations, helping to support the Canadian dollar against the U.S. dollar.

<!-- missing-text -->

The European Central Bank left its policy rate unchanged at two meetings this intermeeting period, as had been expected.  After the Bank of England decided to leave its policy rate unchanged at its meeting in early July (as had also been expected), short-term sterling interest rates increased in response to strongerthan-expected U.K. retail sales data and the release of the minutes from the previous meeting, which revealed that policymakers believed the British labor market was tightening and that the economy had little spare capacity.  The Bank of England increased its policy rate 25 basis points, to 4.75 percent, at the August 5 th meeting.  Short-sterling rates declined modestly and sterling depreciated slightly after the announcement, as market participants reportedly interpreted the BoE statement as indicating a less rapid pace of future rate increases.

Market measures of the expected near-term path for monetary policy in other foreign industrial economies were generally little changed on net, while (except for Japan) such measures at farther horizons generally shifted down. Movements in long-term European and Canadian yields during the period often followed movements in U.S. yields, with Canadian yields showing net declines in line with U.S. yields and European yields declining less.  In addition to weak U.S. data, market analysis attributed the net declines in global yields to investor concerns about the effect of record oil prices on global economic activity.

Equity indexes in most foreign industrial countries registered losses this period, weighed down early in the period by the weak U.S. data and later by oil price increases and concerns about a softening outlook for the technology sector. Equity prices in Canada, an oil exporter, declined only modestly.  Technology shares significantly underperformed broader indexes following disappointing earnings news from several major global technology and telecom corporations.

Brazilian asset prices saw solid gains this period, with the Brazilian real up 2 percent, Brazil's EMBI+ spread down about 60 basis points, and Brazil's equity index up about 7 percent.  Analysts attributed these gains in part to several stronger-than-expected domestic data releases.  In addition, the Brazilian real was supported following the release of the minutes of the July 20 th policy meeting of Brazil's central bank; market participants interpreted the minutes as indicating that policymakers have ruled out further interest rate cuts and that they would even consider undertaking rate hikes if inflation keeps accelerating. Mexican spreads also declined this period (although more modestly than the Brazilian spread) and the Mexican peso appreciated modestly against the dollar. The Mexican central bank decided to tighten monetary policy on July 23, citing inflation risks.  The Mexican stock market decreased slightly on balance.

Emerging Asian equity prices were mixed; share prices in Korea and Taiwan were weighed down by global declines in technology shares.  Russian equity prices declined sharply on balance over the period, led by a 40 percent decline in the share price of Yukos, the large Russian oil producer engaged in a dispute with the government over payment of back taxes.  A minor banking crisis expanded slightly in Russia early in the intermeeting period when two major banks experienced significant deposit outflows.  The crisis appears to have subsided, however, following government efforts to support liquidity and extend deposit insurance to a broader category of banks.  On net, Russia's EMBI+ spread rose about 20 basis points over the period.

.  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Available data indicate that the major foreign industrial economies continued to grow at a solid pace in recent months.  In Japan, gains in exports and household expenditures strengthened the expansion, while surveys of business and consumer confidence were also favorable.  Indicators of economic activity in the euro area suggest moderating growth in the second quarter.  Domestic demand remained weak in Germany and strong in France.  In the United Kingdom, real GDP accelerated in the second quarter according to the preliminary release.  Economic activity grew at a solid pace in Canada, led by a surge in investment.

High energy prices have contributed to maintaining consumer price inflation elevated.  In Canada, headline inflation was unchanged at 2.5 percent.  Inflation in the euro area remained well above the ECB's 2 percent ceiling.  In the United Kingdom, inflation edged up to 1.6 percent, but remained below the Bank of England's 2 percent inflation target.  Slight deflation persisted in Japan.

On August 5, in the United Kingdom, the Monetary Policy Committee increased its policy rate 25 basis points to 4.75 percent, while, in the euro area, the European Central Bank announced no change.

In Japan , recent indicators suggest that economic activity continued to expand strongly.  Real exports surged 5 percent during the second quarter, while real imports were up about 3 percent.  Workers' household expenditures fell in June but rose more than 3 percent during the second quarter and measures of consumer confidence continued to move up.  New car registrations bounced back in July following a drop in the second quarter.  Industrial production fell 1.3 percent in June, but was up sharply for the second quarter as a whole.  The all-industries index of output rose 1.7 percent in April and May on average compared with the first-quarter average.  Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, fell 2.1 percent in May.  Despite the monthly decline, average orders for April and May were more than 9 percent above the first-quarter average.

Labor market conditions continued to improve and consumer price deflation remained mild.  While the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.6 percent in June, employment increased during the second quarter and the job-offers-to-applicants ratio moved up to 0.82 in June, an eleven-year high. Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) were flat in July from the previous month and were down 0.1 percent from a year earlier.  Higher commodity prices helped to push wholesale

prices up to 1.4 percent in June on an annual basis, the largest twelve-month rate of increase since 1997.

The Bank of Japan's Tankan index of business conditions rose in June, with the level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment among firms of all sizes and across all industries increasing to 0 from -5 in March.  The closely watched index for large manufacturers improved from 12 to 22 over the same period.  The June strengthening of the aggregate index was broadly based, with increases for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers across all firm sizes.

Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) won 49 seats in the Upper House election on July 11, losing only one of its 50 contested seat.  The results left the ruling coalition with control of 139 seats, more than the 122 seats needed to secure a majority.  Following the results, Prime Minister Koizumi announced

that he will stay in office and disclosed plans to reshuffle his cabinet in September.

Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group and UFJ Financial Group announced in July their intention to merge operations by September 2005.  If completed, the merger would create the world's largest financial firm by assets.  However, merger negotiations have been put on hold as UFJ appeals a Tokyo District Court injunction against the merger.  The court ruled that the new merger would breach an earlier agreement for UFJ to sell its trust assets to Sumitomo Trust &amp; Banking.

Indicators suggests that growth in the euro area has edged down from its firstquarter pace of 2.3 percent.  Industrial production increased in April and May, led by German production of capital goods.  In Germany, over the same period, merchandise exports continued to grow at a rapid pace but imports also moved up, suggesting some moderation in the contribution of net exports to GDP growth from the very high first-quarter rate.  Euro-area retail sales dropped in May but bounced back in June.  In Germany, June's retail sales remained below the first-quarter average, pointing to continued weakness in domestic demand.  In contrast, French consumption of manufactured goods surged in June, indicating that household demand in France has remained solid.

The European Commission's surveys of industrial and consumer confidence were unchanged in July.  In Germany, the IFO business climate index fell in June to a nine-month low, recovered somewhat in July but was still below both the first and the second-quarter averages.  According to market research group GfK, German consumer confidence was weaker than expected in July and is set to drop in August.  In France, conversely, the INSEE business confidence index rose in July to a three-year high, confirming the strength of the French recovery.

The labor market remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 9 percent in June   Meanwhile, recent wage agreements in . Germany and France have seen labor unions accepting wage moderation and increased working-time flexibility in exchange for no job cuts.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area was unchanged at 2.4 percent in July, well above the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.  The rise in inflation since the first quarter was mainly the result of a surge in energy and administered prices.  The ECB is closely monitoring price developments for second-round effects of these increases.  In June, core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco edged up to 2.0 percent.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 3.8 percent in the second quarter according to the preliminary estimate.  Estimated output in the service sector increased at around the same pace as overall activity.  Despite declining in June,

industrial production rose at a pace roughly consistent with the initial estimate in the second quarter.

Limited indicators for July point to somewhat slower growth on balance in the third quarter.  The manufacturing PMI rose to its highest level since October 1994 and consumer confidence inched up.  In contrast, business confidence dipped somewhat below the average level during the first half of the year. Services PMI ticked down for the third consecutive month, but continues to indicate strong expansion.  One of the leading surveys of retail sales suggests the pace of sales dropped.

According to the two leading private surveys, housing prices rose 21 percent in the twelve months ending in July.  Household net mortgage and consumer borrowing remained elevated in June.

The labor market continued to be tight, as both the official-claims-based and the labor-force-survey measures of the unemployment rate remained near their lowest points since 1975.  The twelve-month consumer price inflation rate rose to 1.6 percent in June, still well below the Bank of England's 2 percent target.

On July 22, the Bank of England announced upcoming changes to its operations in money markets aimed at reducing volatility in overnight sterling interest rates.  The Bank plans to introduce standing lending and borrowing facilities with rates 25 basis points above and below the official repo rate.  Commercial banks will be able to choose a positive average target level for the reserve balances that they will hold during the month-long maintenance period, and the Bank will start paying interest (equal to the repo rate) on those balances.  The Bank will reduce the number of open market operations from up to four a day to once a week, and change the maturity of the operations to one week.  The Bank intends to release further details in a consultative paper this fall, before enacting the change.

In Canada , monthly GDP growth moved up to 0.3 percent in May from 0.1 percent in April, suggesting that the expansion continued in the second quarter. Growth was especially strong in the mining and oil and gas extraction sectors due to rising energy prices.  The end of public-sector labor disputes in May also led to a rebound in activity in education service.  Real exports increased 4.5 percent on average in April and May from the first-quarter average, while strong domestic demand fueled an almost 6 percent jump in real imports over the same period.  Imports of machinery and equipment were particularly strong, indicating a steep rise in business fixed investment.  Housing starts reached a 14-year high in the second quarter, showing the continued strength of residential investment.  In contrast, retail and wholesale trade continued to shrink in May.  Employment increased steadily throughout the quarter, with construction exhibiting large gains.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

In emerging Asia, buoyant external demand has continued to support robust economic performance, although Chinese growth has slowed significantly following policy measures taken to temper the pace of investment.  Economic activity in Latin America has remained fairly strong, boosted by manufacturing exports to the United States, particularly in Mexico, and by a pickup in domestic demand in Brazil and Argentina.  Increases in energy and food prices have contributed to a further rise in inflation across the developing world, but inflation rates are still moderate.

Real GDP growth in China slowed to just under 3 percent in the second quarter, considerably lower than the double-digit pace maintained since the end of the SARS epidemic last year.  Chinese authorities' efforts to slow investment appear to have been effective; after soaring in the first quarter, investment was roughly flat in the second quarter.  Money and loan growth have also been checked.  Indicators of personal consumption, however, show a pickup; growth of retail sales is now hovering around 15 percent on a twelve-month basis. Exports and imports so far have been surprisingly unaffected by the investment slowdown, with twelve-month growth rates approaching 50 percent in recent months.

Inflation has moved up recently, with consumer prices rising 5 percent over the twelve months ending in June.  However, excluding food prices, consumer prices have been nearly flat.  There are also signs that recent increases in raw material and producer prices have flattened out.

The Hong Kong economy continued to benefit from its links to China.  Chinese tourists have provided an enormous boost to retail sales and consumer confidence, and trade volumes remain near record highs.  The unemployment rate fell further in June to its lowest level in more than two years.  Consumer prices inched up in June, bringing the twelve-month rate of change to just less than zero, suggesting that deflationary pressures are finally abating.

Taiwan's economy was supported by further growth in global high-tech demand in the second quarter.  Indicators of production of high-tech goods continued to move upward, and orders for these goods reached record levels in recent months.  Imports of electronic components and higher oil prices pushed the trade balance into deficit in June, but for the second quarter as a whole the trade surplus increased slightly, propelled by high-tech exports.  Driven primarily by the recent rise in energy prices, consumer price inflation has stepped up but remains relatively low.

Incoming data for Korea were mixed.  Indicators for domestic demand suggested an improvement in sales, but consumer and business confidence remained weak.  Industrial production fell in June as manufacturers of computer chips scaled back output after a surge earlier in the quarter.  The unemployment rate has edged up to 3½ percent in recent months.  Inflation has also picked up, reflecting higher prices of oil and other commodities.  The trade and current account surpluses moved lower in June but remained at high levels.  The Korean parliament approved a stimulus package of more than $1½ billion in July, in part directed toward increasing funding for small and medium-sized firms.

Incoming data from the ASEAN countries suggest continuing strength of economic activity, fueled largely by external demand.  According to the advance GDP release, Singapore's economy is estimated to have grown 9 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, following three quarters of double-digit growth.  For industrial production, the monthly pattern has been volatile, but average output levels available so far during the second quarter are significantly above their first-quarter averages, with the exception of Thailand. Indications are that ASEAN exports continued to rise in the second quarter but, in some cases, such as Thailand which is one of the more oil-dependent economies in the region, imports also have been increasing rapidly.  Inflation has continued to increase in the region but generally remains moderate.  A substantial part of the acceleration in consumer prices is accounted for by rising food prices, but other categories such as transport and communications, utilities, and services have also contributed.

Indonesia's first-ever elections to directly elect a president were held in early July and did not result in a clear-cut majority for any candidate.  As a result, there will be a runoff in September.  With the first round of the elections concluded without violence, Indonesian financial markets have rebounded considerably from their earlier weakness.

In Mexico, recent economic indicators have been generally consistent with a continuation of robust economic growth led by manufacturing exports to the United States.  Industrial production declined in May following two very strong months, but the April-May average stood more than 1½ percent above the firstquarter average.  Exports rose at a quarterly rate of about 5½ percent in the second quarter, the fastest pace in more than four years, reflecting increases in both oil and non-oil exports.  Second-quarter imports were up nearly 6 percent; imports of both consumer goods and capital goods accelerated, suggesting a pickup in Mexican domestic demand.  Consistent with that, retail sales rose more than ½ percent in May, with the April-May average up 1¼ percent from the first quarter.

The Bank of Mexico (BOM) tightened monetary policy on July 23, raising the "corto" (the daily amount that it shorts the interbank market) to 41 million pesos from 37 million pesos; one-month interest rates rose 45 basis points following the move.  The central bank cited rising inflation expectations and a recent increase in core inflation (to above 3½ percent) as reasons for the policy tightening.  In addition, in recent months, headline inflation has been running a bit above the upper end of the BOM's 2-4 percent target range.  The BOM has noted that the rise in inflation comes against the background of a rebound in Mexican consumer and investment spending.

In Brazil , data releases pointed to continued expansion in economic activity over the second quarter.  Average industrial production in April and May was nearly 2½ percent above its first-quarter average.  The unemployment rate declined to about 11½ percent in June.  Although growth continued to be fueled largely by net exports, there has been increasing evidence of a recovery in domestic demand.  The twelve-month increase in consumer prices was more than 6 percent in June, above the 5½ percent mid-point of the inflation target for this year.  In part, the most recent rise in inflation reflects hikes in domestic prices of energy and other government-regulated prices.  This has resulted in an increase in one-year ahead expectations of inflation, but longer-term expectations have moved up only a little.  Despite very high real interest rates, concerns about inflation prompted the central bank to maintain its policy rate at 16 percent in its late July meeting; the rate has been at this level since April.

In Argentina , recent data releases suggest that the economic recovery has continued, albeit at a more moderate pace.  Industrial production fell sharply in April from a very high level in March, but picked up again in May.  Recent performance suggests that the economy has not yet been severely affected by structural problems in the country's energy sector.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation increased in recent months, to about 5 percent.  Argentina has continued to run sizable trade surpluses.

Although Argentina has met all the quantitative targets outlined in its IMF program by comfortable margins, performance has lagged in other areas, such as debt restructuring, reform of federal-provincial fiscal relations, and bank compensation. Given Argentina's lack of progress in these key areas, the IMF mission that visited Buenos Aires in June has not yet recommended approval of the third review under the current program.  It is likely that Argentina will ask for waivers for these incomplete reforms, and the negotiation process with the IMF could prove to be protracted.

In Venezuela , the upcoming August 15 referendum on whether President Chavez should be recalled remains on center stage.  Polls indicate that Chavez's popularity has risen in recent months; analysts attribute this result to a fiscal expansion financed by the oil boom. Monthly inflation declined to about 1 percent in July, bringing the twelve-month change to nearly 22 percent.  Oil production is still believed to be about 15 percent below the level prevailing before a disruptive national strike in late 2002.

In Russia , real GDP increased at a robust pace of more than 6½ percent in the first quarter.  More recent indicators of production have also been strong. Consumer price inflation decreased slightly to about 10 percent in the second quarter.  The recent liquidity problems of Russian banks appear to have subsided with the  passage of a supplementary deposit insurance arrangement. However, the tax-evasion dispute between the Kremlin and Yukos, a major oil company, has intensified, roiling world oil markets.  The authorities have seized key production facilities of Yukos, and the trials of two major shareholders have begun.
