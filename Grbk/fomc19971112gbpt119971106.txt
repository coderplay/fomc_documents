Domestic Developments

Overview

The performance  of  the  U.S.  economy has  continued o e outstanding.  purred  by t b S exceptional  trength  n  domestic inal  emand,  real DP  growth  in  the hird  uarter s i f d G t q kept  pace  with  the apid rend f  the  previous ear nd  a half. ubstantial  creases  n r t o y a S in i productivity re than  offset  hat little  st ressure  as coming from  the  wage side, mo w co p w and  profitability  s mproved  while  price ncreases  emained  subdued. thu i i r

The question  f  the  moment, of  course,  s  whether he igor f  the xpansion o i t v o e will e  materially minished  y an  Asian  flu ug that  hreatens   infect  he b di b b t to t economies  of  many of  our  important  rading  artners.  t bviously s  too arly o t p I o i e t render   firm  judgment.  At this  oint,  lthough  e have  marked down  our  projection a p a w of  growth  for he est f  the orld, e think hat he  hit o .S.  production  nd  the t r o w w t t t U a disinflationary  luence  f he  current  urmoil  ost  likely  ill e less ramatic han inf o t t m w b d t many commentators  have  suggested. elative  o  our  previous orecast,  e  recent R t f th depreciation   the  dollar  gainst  ther -10 currencies  ffsets  ome of  the  influence of a o G o s of  weaker  foreign  ctivity d a  deterioration    competitiveness lative   some a an in re to Asian  currencies.  or  all he ecent yrations, ock rices  ave  declined  nly  slightly F t r g st p h o on net  over  the  intermeeting riod nd  are  close o  the evel nticipated   the  last pe a t l a in Greenbook.

The bottom  line  s  that e are  presenting    projection   GDP i w a of growth  through 1999 that ooks  much  like hat  repared or he  September  FOMC l t p f t meeting.  We foresee   marked deceleration    activity   the  assumption hat  he  System  will ct  to a in on t t a raise  eal hort-term  ates  ext ear,    consequence  of hich is  notable tock arket r s r n y a w a s m correction.  evertheless,  source  tilization es emain  high, nd  inflation  eeps N re u rat r a cr up  from  here--though  ecent  avorable  rice ews,  along  with  our  interpretation he r f p n of  t implications   continued trong nvestment  or  the  growth  of  capacity  nd of s i f a productivity,  ve led  us  to  chip  another  enth r  two off he rojected  rice ndex ha t o t p p i increases  or  1998 and 1999. f

Key  Background  Factors

The current  inancial viironment oes  not  appear  to e exerting  estraint    domestic f en d b r on demand.  Credit upplies  emain  ample,  and we doubt  that he  recent inancial s r t f turbulence  ill recipitate arked shift  n  liquidity  nditions.  he net  declines  n w p a  m i co T i U.S.  stock arkets  over  the  intermeeting riod ave  trimmed  only  a  smidgen  from m pe h the  huge run-up  earlier    the  year; he ousehold ealth-income atio  s till in t h w r i s up smartly,  nd the  cost f  equity apital mains  low. a o c re

We  continue o  think hat  he  stock arkets  will ave  to  struggle  ith  an t t t m h w increasing  umber of  earnings  isappointments  n  coming quarters, t  that    marked n d i bu a downturn  is  not  likely  o  come soon  in  the  absence  f urther ocks.  In  this  orecast, t o f sh f as  in he  last, ch  a  shock  comes in  the  form  of  a  sequence  of ikes n  the  federal t su h i funds  rate eginning arly ext  year,  hich will aise  eal hort-term  ates  omewhat b e n w r r s r s relative   their  urrent  evels. o such  tightening pears o e anticipated   resent, to c l N ap t b atp and  it  s ssumed  to  occur  before   pickup  in nflation   enerally  pparent. e i a a i isg a W anticipate at ong-term  ates  ill urn p as  well,  ut  that  he  term  structure ll th l r w t u b t wi flatten.  he upturn n  yields  n  Treasury otes nd  bonds could  be  muted to  the T i o n a degree  that iminished nvestor  onfidence  eads o  an  enlargement f  the  equity d i c l t o premium--building  n what seems  to  have  occurred n  the ast ouple  of  weeks. Risk o i p c spreads n  corporate  onds  relative   Treasuries  re  likely  o iden--perhaps o b to a t w appreciably  n  the unk ector--as  e  outlook or  business  rofitability  omes i j s th f p bec shakier;  anks  and other enders  lso ay become a  bit ore cautious  n  extending b l a m m i credit  o usinesses. t b

While  we think hat ome tightening  f  monetary  policy ill e  needed  in  the t s o w b near  term  to  check  an upswing  of  inflation, s uite onceivable  hat he rojected it  q i c t t p level f  real ates  s igher han  may be  necessary o  stabilize  e conomy  over  the o r i h t t th e longer un. In  that egard,  e have assumed  just   slight tracing  f he  1998 r r w a re o t increase  n  the unds  rate n  the  latter rt f  1999 and  a modest  easing f ond i f i pa o o b yields. hare  prices urn p in  1999,  but  not  very  much--and  not  enough  to  reverse S t u any significant  rtion  f  the teep ecline n  the ousehold ealth-income atio  hat po o s d i h w r t is  projected  or 998. f 1

Since  the  September  Greenbook,  the  dollar  as  appreciated nsiderably ainst h co ag many Asian  and  some Latin merican currencies  ut  has  depreciated,    average, A b on against  he  currencies  f he  other ajor  industrial  untries--at st  n  part ecause t o t m co lea i b of  revised  xpectations out .S.  monetary  policy. urther  ariations   exchange e ab U F v in rates ay well  be  ahead  in  light  f onetary  policy ctions  ere  and abroad  and  of  the m o m a h ongoing  deterioration    our  current-account sition.  ut  the ase  for   sizable  nd in po B c a a persistent  vement  in  one direction   the  other s ot  compelling,  nd given  our mo or i n a inability    predict  he  short-term ists  nd turns,  t eems  better  imply o  assume to t tw a i s s t that he  dollar  ill emain  around  the  current  evel n a G-10 trade-weighted sis. t w r l o ba Doing so  places  he  G-10 exchange  rate,  n  average,  bout  2-1/2 ercent ower  in t o a p l 1998 and 1-1/2 ercent ower  in  1999 than  in  the ast  reenbook. Largely  as  a p l l G consequence  of  the  damage to  Asian  economies, e have  marked down our  forecast w for  growth  abroad  about  1/4  percentage  oint n  1997, 1.1  point n  1998,  and  0.1  point p i i

in  1999. On an  export-weighted  asis,  oreign  rowth  is rojected  o  fall  o b f g p t t about 3-3/4 ercent his ear  and  2-3/4 ercent n  1998 before oving back p t y p i m up to 3-1/2 percent in 1999.

Housing  starts  ounced  back  sharply  n  September  from  their  urprisingly  w b i s lo August  reading;  he  estimates  or tarts  July  and August  were revised  p somewhat t f s in u as  well.

The Longer-Run Outlook

Our forecast  or ctivity er  the  long  run  is ssentially  changed  from  the f a ov e un September  Greenbook: After ncreasing  -3/4 ercent n  1997,  real DP  is  expected i 3 p i G to  rise  -1/4 ercent  n  1998 and 1-1/2 ercent n  1999. The sources f he  slower 2 p i p i o t growth  also re  the  same as  in  earlier recasts:  omestic  demand is  expected o a fo D t decelerate th  rising  nterest tes,  harply educed  equity alues,  nd slower rowth wi i ra s r v a g in  investment  rom levels  hat  re  already igh  enough to enerate izable  ncreases  n f t a h g s i i productive  apacity. e  continue  o  assume that et  exports  ill ecline urther  s  a c W t n w d f a result  f  lagged ffects  f arlier preciation   the  dollar;   addition, mands from o e o e ap in in de abroad  now  are  expected o e  weakened by lower  growth  in  overall  oreign  ctivity. t b f a

Although  we have  raised  he  projected  evel f he nemployment rate,  t t l o t u i remains  low enough  to  place pward pressure  n real ages. Furthermore,  e doubt u o w w that e shall  ee  a  repeat  f  some of  the w s o beneficial influences--notably ller  ealth sma h insurance  osts nd  dollar  ppreciation--that  e  reduced  inflation er he  past wo c a a hav ov t t years.  Accordingly,  e are  projecting at nflation  ll ncrease  ver  the orecast w th i wi i o f period,  lthough mple  expansion f  factory  apacity  hould revent roduction a a o c s p p

bottlenecks  rom  developing n  the  goods  sector  nd  help  keep  the ise n  prices f i a r i gradual.  Overall,  fter  dding  back  in  the  estimated  ffects  f he echnical  hanges  in a a e o t t c the  CPI,  the  acceleration    GDP in prices  umulates o  a  bit ess  han  1/2  percentage c t l t point etween 1997 and 1999;  the  pickup  in  core  CPI inflation   omewhat larger. b iss

Consumer spending.  Real  PCE  growth  is xpected o  come in  at  3-3/4 e t percent his  ear.  We  believe  hat onsumer  spending as  received  n  important  oost t y t c h a b from  the  massive ains n  stock arket  wealth,  eflected   the  forecast  f  a 1/2 g i m r in o percentage  oint ecline n  the  saving ate etween 1996 and 1997. The gains  in p d i r b wealth  probably  also ave  contributed   the  extraordinary vel f  consumer h to le o confidence.

Real  PCE  is rojected  o  rise  bout  3-1/4 ercent n  1998 and 1-3/4 ercent  n p t a p i p i 1999. Income trends re  expected o  soften  s  more moderate  demands from  the a t a business  ector  nd  the ontinued ecline  n  net  exports low  growth  in  employment. s a c d i s

Furthermore,  ousehold  wealth s ssumed to  turn rom a  marked positive  actor  or h i a f f f consumer demand in  1996 and 1997 to  a  relatively  utral  nfluence  y  the  end  of ne i b 1998. As we have  discussed  efore,  ur  various conometric odels  suggest hat  o b o e m t n more than  two-thirds  f  the ffect  n  consumption  of  an  increase  n  stock arket o e o i m wealth  might  be  expected ithin  year.  In  our  forecast  or  1998,  the  boost o  PCE w a f t from earlier ins n  wealth  offsets e  effects  f  the etrenchment  n  the  stock arket ga i th o r i m assumed for hat ear.  By 1999,  however,  the  net ealth ffects  n  PCE  from  the t y w e o stock arket  turn o  a small  negative. m t

On the  face  of  it,  he cceleration   compensation ver  the  past t a of o year  would seem  to  be  due in  large art o  the ikes n  the  minimum  wage;  sectors p t h i with  many low-paid orkers  have  seen  a  sizable  age rise,  hile  those n  which w w w i prevailing ges are  high  enough  to  be  little  fected  irectly   the ederal  inimum wa af d by f m have  exhibited  light  r  no wage acceleration.   suspect,  owever,  that  he CI data s o We h t E may understate  he  true ise  n  the  labor osts f any employers: Among t r i c o m other things,  here re  many  reports  f ncreased  se  of  equity nterests, ing  onuses, nd t a o i u i hir b a other ypes f  compensation ot  captured  y the  ECI to  attract d  retain  orkers  with t o n b an w "hot  skills."

Wages  have  accelerated ticeably  ince  1995. However, we have  not  carried no s through hat ptilt   wage growth  into 998. We  expect  that age gains  will e t u in 1 w b damped next  year  by a  lagged  response o  the arked deceleration   inflation  at as t m of th h occurred n  1997;  this  as  lowered  inflation  pectations d will ffect  ormal nd i h ex an a f a informal OLAs.

All  told,  t  3.2  percent, e rojected  ncrease  n  the  ECI for otal a th p i i t compensation n  1998 is he  same as  that or  1997.  But  we are  expecting    pickup  to i t f a 3.4  percent  n  1999. Despite   rise n  the nemployment rate,  he  labor arkets i a i u t m remain  quite ight, d  price nflation  s  turned p.

Recent Developments

Turmoil  in  financial  rkets, hich  had  previously  een  confined o  southeast  sian ma w b t A countries, s  spread  since he  September  30 FOMC ha t meeting.  Equity rices  n  all p i areas--especially  a--have  allen  ubstantially,  eit  n  many  cases rom  levels  hat Asi f s alb i f t might  have  been  viewed  as  inflated. rrency  movements  have  been  mixed. Most Cu Asian  and some major  Latin merican currencies  ave  depreciated  gainst  he  dollar, A h a t while  European  currencies  ave  appreciated  n balance.  The effects  f nrest  n h o o u i financial rkets  have begun to  show through o  reduced  growth  in  Thailand nd are ma t a expected  to  depress ctivity bstantially ewhere n  Asia  and  to  a  lesser  xtent  n a su els i e i Latin  America,  but  only  modestly n  industrial  untries  n  the  whole. i co o

Since  the  September  FOMC meeting, he  foreign  xchange  value  of he  dollar t e t has  risen  harply gainst  everal  sian  and  Latin merican currencies--most  tably s a s A A no against  he  Thai  baht,  he aiwan  dollar, d  the  Korean  won (about   to  10 percent t t T an 6 on balance),  nd  the  Mexican peso  (about -1/2 ercent). t the  same time, he  dollar a 5 p A t has  depreciated  bout  2 percent n  terms  of  the  mark and  other uropean  currencies a i E as the  Bundesbank tightened  onetary  conditions  hile  expectations   a  Fed tightening m w of eased.  Further  esolution  ncertainties  rrounding  MU r ofu su E may also  have  contributed to  the  firming f uropean  currencies.  n  balance,  he  dollar  as  depreciated 1/2 o E O t h 1percent n average  against  he  currencies  f ther -10 countries, spite   1-1/2 o t o o G de a percent  appreciation ainst  he  yen,  but t as  appreciated  ore than  1-1/2 ercent ag t i h m p against    broader eighted  average  of 0 currencies,  cluding  hose f  the  key a w 2 in t o emerging  market  countries.

Early  in  the  period,  he  financial rmoil  n hailand nd elsewhere n  southeast t tu i T a i Asia  spread o  Indonesia,  nd  the ndonesian  upiah ell  harply. y mid-October, t a I r f s B pressures  n currency nd  stock  markets  in  Taiwan had grown to  the oint here o a p w monetary  authorities  ose  to  end  their  ractice  f  managing  the  currency. he ch p o T resulting  epreciation   the  Taiwan dollar  ndercut onfidence  n  the  resolve f ong d of u c i o H Kong authorities    maintain heir  urrency eg,  and led o  increasing essures  n the to t c p t pr o Hong  Kong  dollar.  n  October  23,  the  Hong Kong  Monetary Authority ountered  he O c t exchange  market  pressure, iefly  ushing  overnight  ates  o  more than  250 percent. br p r t This  move  triggered  sharp  fall  n  the  Hang Seng stock ndex, hich, n  turn,  parked a i i w i s a  global elloff    equity arkets.  In  late ctober, urrency egs  in  Brazil nd s in m O c p a Argentina ame under  attack,  nd  pressures  n  their  quity arkets, s  well  as  on c a o e m a Korea's,  ere  especially tense. oward the  end  of  the  period,  ollowing he w in T f t announcement  of  an IMF-led  support ackage  for ndonesia  nd after  oordinated p I a c exchange  market  intervention   Asian  central  anks, he  rupiah eversed  ts  arlier by b t r i e

decline  amid  a  general  strengthening  of financial  markets  in  emerging  market economies. For the entire intermeeting  period,  net  declines  in  stock markets  ranged from  0.6 percent  in  the  United  States  (NYSE)  and  5-1/2  to  6  percent  in  major European  exchanges  to  11  percent in  Korea, more  than  14  percent  in Brazil  and Argentina,  and nearly  30 percent  in Hong  Kong. In  some  cases,  these  moves  at  least partially  reversed  sharp  increases  in  price-earnings  ratios  that had occurred  in  recent years.

Short-term interest  rates  in the  major  foreign  industrial  countries  have risen about  20 basis  points  on  average  since  the  September  FOMC,  reflecting  moderate tightening  by  the  Bundesbank  (with  other continental  European  central  banks following  suit)  and  the  Bank  of Canada  early  in  the  period  and  a  25-basis-point tightening  by the  Bank  of England  today. Long-term  rates  were  little  changed  on average,  as  rates  fell  25  basis  points  in Japan  and  15  basis  points  in  Canada  but rose somewhat  in Europe. Interest  rates  rose  more  substantially  in developing  countries, reflecting  both  widening  risk  spreads  and,  in  some  cases,  monetary  tightening. The spreads  of Brady  bonds  over U.S.  Treasury  securities  had  doubled in Latin  America  in Brazil  and  Argentina  (although  to  well  below  the  peak  during the  Mexican  crisis),  but have  since  rectraced  half those increases. On  balance,  these  spreads  have  risen  about 200  basis  points  during  the intermeeting  period. Increases  in  Asian  Yankee  bond spreads  were  somewhat  more  subdued,  ranging  from less  than  50 basis  points  in  some countries  to  more  than  100  basis points  in  the  Philippines  and  Korea. Short-term  (1month)  interest  rates  in countries  that have  thus far  defended  currency  pegs  have  risen sharply--up  22  percentage  points for the  period  in  Brazil,  9  in Argentina,  and 5 in Hong  Kong.

The  Desk did  not intervene.

Indicators  of economic  activity  in  the third  quarter  showed  robust expansion  in the major foreign  industrial  countries  except  Japan,  in  some cases  above  our expectations. Preliminary  U.K. GDP was  up 4 percent  for the  quarter,  and Canadian monthly  data on GDP  and employment  suggest a second consecutive  quarter  of expansion  around 5  percent. In  Germany,  industrial  production  rose at an  annual  rate of about  6  percent  in the  third  quarter  and  orders  continued  on  an  upward  trend through. French industrial  production  rose  strongly  in July-August,  and  consumption of manufactured  goods  rose at rate  of 10  percent  in the  third quarter. Italy's
