International Developments

The global  economy's rebound  from its recent  slowdown  continues, led by a burgeoning  recovery in the Asian emerging  market economies. Recent information also  suggests  a pickup in Mexico  and Brazil.  However,  although the improvement  in activity  is fairly  widespread  among countries,  there are  some notable exceptions. In particular, Japanese  prospects  are still  uncertain,  and several  other Latin American economies  remain weak.

Recent information  suggests  that the pace  of the overall rebound exceeds  our previous  expectations. Export-weighted  foreign real  GDP is estimated  to have increased  at an annual  rate of 3  1/2 percent in the first half of 1999,  more  than  1 percentage point  higher than previously  projected.  We have also revised  up our projection  for  growth over  the forecast  period  to an  average  rate of 3 percent, almost  1/2  ercentage  point higher than previously projected. p Consequently, we have raised  our forecast  for U.S.  net exports  and lowered  our path for the dollar a small amount.  We have also revised up our projected path for oil  prices in response  to recent developments,  primarily  continued production  discipline among OPEC countries.

Recent  Developments

International financial markets. Since  the June FOMC  meeting, the weighted average  foreign  exchange  value of the dollar, as measured by  the  staff's  broad nominal  index,  has dropped about  1 percent on balance. The two major components  of the index have moved  in opposite  directions,  with the  dollar falling  2  1/2  percent  relative  to the major foreign currencies  while rising almost 1 percent in terms of the currencies  of our other  important trading partners.

The decline in the major foreign  currency  index occurred  in response  to information  suggesting a pickup in activity in Europe  and the possibility  of light at  the end  of the tunnel for  Japan.

Japanese monetary policy has remained on hold,  and government bond yields have  been  stable over the period. The Nikkei  index has declined slightly in response to concerns  about  the effect of the  stronger yen  on the economy. Japanese  monetary  authorities intervened  to restrain  the rise in the  yen three times in July,

Since  the latest operation  on  July 21,  the yen has  appreciated  another 5  percent.

In  the euro area, ten-year government bond yields  have risen more  than 30 basis points since  the June FOMC,  narrowing the  spread relative  to comparable U.S. Treasuries. Long-term interest rates have  also moved  up somewhat  in the United Kingdom and Canada.  These movements  apparently reflected some increase in market perceptions  of the likelihood of official  interest rate hikes

over the next year.  Share  prices in  the major foreign  industrial  countries changed  little over the period.

The appreciation  of the dollar relative to the currencies  of other major trading partners  reflects  increased  uncertainty  in both Asian  and Latin  American financial  markets. Over the intermeeting  period, the  dollar appreciated  about 4 percent  in terms  of the Thai baht, the  Korean won,  and the Philippine  peso, and 10  percent against  the Indonesian  rupiah.  Tensions between  China and Taiwan, as  well  as  a heightened perception  of a possible devaluation  of the renminbi, contributed to  falling equity prices in much  of the region.

Latin  American financial  markets appeared particularly  sensitive  to prospects  for rising  interest rates  in the  United States. The Mexican  peso moved  up slightly on balance  over the period,  supported in part by rising crude  oil prices, but the Brazilian real depreciated  6 percent. Concerns  over the future of Argentina's currency  board persist, as the recession  has  appeared to deepen  and political uncertainty  before this fall's presidential  election  has  increased. Equity prices fell  13  percent  in Brazil,  8  percent in  Argentina  and 6 percent in Mexico. Brady yield spreads  over Treasuries  widened  appreciably on balance  during the intermeeting period,  with  the Emerging Market Bond Index  spread increasing 100 basis  points.

. The  Desk did not intervene during the period  for the accounts  of the System or the Treasury.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent indicators  for economic  activity in the foreign industrial  economies  suggest  that the recovery  in Europe  is gaining momentum in the current quarter,  while the Japanese  contraction  shows tenuous signs of bottoming out.  Meanwhile, the  Canadian  economy continues  to thrive.

Second-quarter data for Japan  indicate  a reversal  of some of the surprising jump in  GDP in the first quarter.  Both production  and  orders have  fallen,  and the unemployment  rate has  continued  to climb. One of the few  bright spots is housing  construction,  which  has continued to rise,  largely  reflecting government incentives. Forward-looking  indicators  are  mixed.  Machinery  orders have fallen  sharply,  more  than reversing  their first-quarter rise,  but the June  Tankan survey  showed  some improvement  in business confidence.

In  contrast, recent indicators  for the euro  area point to a brightening  outlook. Although euro-zone  industrial production in April  and May was below the first-

quarter  verage,  orward-looking dicators ch  as  orders nd  business  nd a f in su a a consumer sentiment  ave  turned ecidedly  ositive. h d p
