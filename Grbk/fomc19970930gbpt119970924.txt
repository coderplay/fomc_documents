Domestic Developments

Overview

Once again,  he  incoming  information  n the conomy's  performance  has  provided t o e some pleasant  urprises.  eal  GDP  grew considerably re in  the  second  quarter  han s R mo t we had thought,  ainly  because  of  impressive,  ngoing  strength  n  exports. nd m o i A although DP  may have decelerated  uring  the  current  uarter, tivity ill ems to G d q ac st se be expanding  faster  han  we predicted  n  the ugust  Greenbook. Meanwhile,  there t i A have  been  few signs hat he  pressures  n resources  re  resulting   any pickup  in t t o a in wage or  price nflation. i

The financial rkets  have  greeted his  ews enthusiastically,  hing  bond ma t n pus yields  ack  close o  their  997 lows  and stock rices,  verall,   new highs.  Investors b t 1 p o to seem increasingly  thralled  y  the  "New  Era"  view--that  e are  in  an  extended en b w period  of  much-improved trend rowth, ropelled  mportantly  y  technological g p i b advance  and  by revolutionary  anges  in  the  economies  of  the  developing orld, ith ch w w inflation   worse  than  a  remote  risk  ecause  of ntensified  mpetition. no b i co

It  is ar rom clear  o  us  at  this  uncture  hat hat  has  occurred equires  hat e f f t j t w r t w scrap  our  existing  nalytical proach.  Indeed, or ll he alk f  a  new "paradigm"  to a ap f a t t o go with  the  New  Era,  we have  not  seen  a  fully  rticulated, ernative  croeconomic a alt ma model. It  may be  that ittle  re is eally  equired  o  understand  he  recent l mo r r t t phenomena than  some new parameters or  our  standard  odel,  rather  han  a  fullf m t fledged ew paradigm.  Even in  this  egard,  owever,  some caution s  warranted.  The n r h i ongoing  strength  f  domestic  demand may simply  be  a conventional  esponse o  an o r t irrationally berant tock  market--a isk hat e have  often dentified    the  outlook. exu s r t w i in And by many  analysts' ckoning,  he  favorable  nflation  th  of  the  past ear  can  be re t i pa y largely,  f ot  entirely,  plained  y  the  substantial  preciation   the ollar. i n ex b ap of d Nonetheless,  n  what we hope  is  a  judicious  esponse o  the  incoming  news,  we have i r t made some further  odifications   our  projection,  corporating  somewhat more m to in a optimistic ew of  productivity  ospects  nd of  the  likely  ear-term esponse f vi pr a n r o wages and  prices  o  given  levels  f esource tilization. t o r u

We  expect hat eal DP  growth  will verage  a  little  ss han  3 percent ver t r G a le t o the  second  half f  1997 and the irst  alf  f  1998.  This  is  a  considerable grading o f h o up from the  last  orecast,    which growth  averaged  2-1/4 ercent. he revision  eflects f in p T r both  the  favorable  inancial rket  developments  of  the  intermeeting riod nd the f ma pe a indications   greater-than-expected  oing  thrust  rom  exports nd business  ixed of ong f a f investment.  The strength  n  these ectors,   turn,  s ikely  o  have  positive  ultiplier i s in i l t m effects  n other omponents of  demand.  However, the  appreciation   the  dollar  ill o c of w gradually  ap  some of  the  energy  from export emand, and  capital  pending  is ikely s d s l

to  be  damped  eventually  y a  waning of  accelerator fects, attening  sh  flows, nd b ef fl ca a what we anticipate ll e  a less timulative nancial vironment merging  next wi b s fi en e year.  As a  consequence, e are  projecting at rowth  will low  appreciably  ver  the w th g s o latter lf f  1998 and remain  low in  1999,  averaging ittle  re than  1-1/2 ercent,  t ha o l mo p a an annual  rate,  ver  the  six uarters. o q

With this  ew forecast  ontour,  utput rows fast nough to  push  the n c o g e unemployment rate own to  around  4-1/2  percent ext  spring ersus -3/4 ercent n d n v 4 p i the  last  reenbook,  and even  with  the  subsequent lackening  f  the  expansion,  he G s o t unemployment rate emains  below 5 percent hrough  1999. Despite he  generally r t t higher  level f  resource  tilization s  ime, owever,  the ath  of  inflation o u thi t h p is somewhat lower  in  this  orecast  han  in  the ast. f t l

We  still ink hat he  tightness   the  labor arket  and a peaking  of  the th t t of m exchange  value  of  the  dollar  ill ikely  ead o  a  rise  n  inflation,   recent  ews on w l l t i but n wages and prices as  prompted  us  to  trim,  gain, he  dimension f  the  step-up. n h a t o I particular,   are  impressed y  the  degree  to  which the xpansion f  plant apacity  n we b e o c i manufacturing,  long  with  foreign ompetition, ems to  be  muting  price ncreases  n a c se i i the  goods sector. hese  competitive  ressures, d the  diminution  f  inflation T p an o expectations,  so  appear  to  be putting   damper on wages:  Although  there re  many al a a reports  f  companies  boosting ompensation o  attract   retain  carce orkers, he o c t or s w t available  ggregate tatistics  vide o evidence  of  a general  ngoing  acceleration, a s pro n o suggesting  hat ay  increases  re  being  given  more selectively  r n  less isible t p a (o i v forms)  than n  the ast. n  any event, e have  tempered  the  response f  wages  to he i p I w o t low level f  unemployment. The dollar  oes  not  begin  to  depreciate  ntil  ater  n  this o d u l i forecast,  that he  disinflationary  ssures  rom falling  mport rices  o not  abate o so t pre f i p d s quickly.

All  told,  e are  predicting at ublished ore  CPI inflation,  ich has  been w th p c wh 2.3  percent n  the  past welve  months,  will ise  o  2.6  percent ext  year  and 2.8 i t r t n percent n  1999. This  acceleration   each  year  is  damped about  0.2  percentage  oint i in p by technical  hanges  to  the  index. c

Key  Background  Factors

With inflation d inflation  pectations ving  come down  as  they  have,  real nterest an ex ha i rates o not  look  low by historical  andards.  onetheless,  inancial ctors  verall  o d st N f fa o d not  appear  to  be exerting    drag  on spending rowth  at  this  ime. Credit s eadily a g t i r available, d  the  cost f  equity apital  s ow. Indeed, he  mood  of  the  markets  at an o c i l t this oint  seems  to  be  such  that he ear-term  ehavior f  the conomy may  not p t n b o e

prevent n extension  f  the  recent ond market  rally--although are  not  anticipating a o b we that o  occur.  In  our  forecast,  have  assumed a  shock  to  the arkets  of  at  least t we m modest  proportions,    the orm  of  an  upturn n  the  federal  unds ate  y next pring; in f i f r b s the  tightening gins  a little  rlier d ultimately ounts  to  somewhat more than be ea an am that ssumed  in  the  last ew Greenbooks. We  project  hat ntermediate-  d long-term a f t i an interest tes ill rift  pward through ext  year, roducing   flatter  eld urve  than ra w d u n p a yi c now prevails.

Based on previous erformance,  ur  stock arket  prognostications  ould  have p o m sh little  edibility  this  oint. evertheless,  feel bliged o  say  something  on this cr at p N we o t score  because e believe  hat quity  rices re  a significant  ement  in  the conomic w t e p a el e outlook.  Price-earnings ltiples  or  major  market  indexes  are  historically h  today, mu f hig at  a time  when profits and t  record evels;  n  the  past,  he ighest  Es tended  to st a l i t h P occur  around  cyclical  roughs n  earnings. nly recently  ave  analysts  nd investors t i O h a manifested  ny doubts  that arge  ompanies  can  indefinitely  stain  ouble-digit  ofit a l c su d pr gains  against    backdrop  of  moderate  nominal  GDP  expansion. ut  the arket  seems a B m still    be demanding little, ny,  compensation or  the  risk  hat omething  might  go to if a f t s awry with  the  New  Era  economic  scenario. n  our  forecast, ere re  some significant I th a surprises,  cluding  isappointing ofits d,  probably  at  least  s  important,  he in d pr an a t currently  nanticipated  ghtening   monetary  conditions;   we are  predicting at u ti of so th share  prices,  fter  avering  in  the ext  few months,  will urn own  substantially a w n t d in 1998.

Federal iscal  olicy ikely  ill e  providing o  major  impulses--positive f p l w b n or negative--to gregate  emand  during he  forecast  eriod.  We  are  assuming  that  he ag d t p t 1998 appropriations  lls  ill eep  things n  line ith  the  recent iscal  greement. bi w k i w f a Although  there s  a risk  hat he ood news on revenues ill timulate  roposals  or i t t g w s p f spending  increases  r  further  ax  cuts,  e have  not  assumed any  additional licy o t w po actions n  the rojection.  e  now expect he  unified  udget  deficit r  fiscal  997 to i p W t b fo 1 come in  at  $28 billion,  mewhat below our  previous stimate. ith  the  higher ath so e W p for  nominal  GDP  likely  o  boost  revenues ver  the  forecast  eriod,  e have  also t o p w lowered  the  projected  eficit r iscal  998 to  $51  billion,  d we are  projecting d fo f 1 an $50 billion   fiscal  999. in 1

The dollar  as  experienced  uite ixed movements recently  gainst  arious h q m a v currencies  ince he  last  OMC s t F meeting.  On  a  trade-weighted sis gainst ther ba a o G-10 currencies,  as  declined omewhat.  With our  interest  tes  ow  projected  o ith s ra n t rise  onsiderably  ver  the  next  year  or  so, e have  the  G-10 dollar  ndex  holding c o w i steady  over  1998 and then  edging  downward  in  1999.  This  trajectory  ntrasts arply co sh

with  the 0 percent ise ver  the  past wo years.  With regard o  foreign ctivity, 2 r o t t a a weaker  outlook or  Asian  economies  is oughly ffset  y stronger  rowth  elsewhere; f r o b g on  net, rowth  in  aggregate  oreign  DP  is  expected o  remain  close o  4 percent n g f G t t i 1998 and then  to dge down to  3-3/4 ercent n  1999.

Recent  Developments  and Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

The BEA's preliminary  stimate  f  second-quarter P  growth  was 3.6  percent t  an e o GD a annual  rate,  ell bove  the  2.6  percent  igure  n  the  August  Greenbook. We  see  no w a f i reason  to  expect  a significant  vision  n  the  "final"  stimate  hat  ill e  released  his re i e t w b t Friday.  The biggest urprise lative   our  forecast  and  relative   BEA's advance s re to ( to estimate)  as in  exports,  s  the une  figures  howed an  unexpectedly arge ncrease. w a J s l i In  addition, thing n  the  incoming  data  leads s  to  expect  a downward  revision  o no i u t the  very  high  second-quarter ventory  nvestment umber--in ontrast  o  our in i n c t speculations  n  the  last  reenbook. i G

We  expect eal DP  growth  to  slow  to  about  2-3/4 ercent t  an annual  rate n r G p a i the  third  uarter,    little  low the -1/2  percent verage ace  over  the  past ear  and a q a be 3 a p y half ut  appreciably  bove the  forecast  n  the ugust  Greenbook.

In  addition, mestic  final  emand  appears o  be growing  rapidly. n  the do d t I household  sector,  ooming employment,  rising  ncome and wealth,  nd favorable b i a sentiment ave  been  lifting  nsumer  demand, as  expected.

Given that i i a t l indicators  f  demand  have  remained  quite ullish  nd  that nventories   unsold ew o b a i of n homes are  lean,  e are  expecting    rebound  in  starts  n  September. w a i

(Percent  hange  at nnual  rate  xcept s  noted) c a e a

<!-- missing-text -->

Growth in  real usiness  ixed nvestment s  now projected  o  top  20 percent b f i i t (annual ate)  n  the  current  uarter--the  ggest  ncrease  n  more than  a decade. Gains r i q bi i i in  this  ector  ontinue o  be  led s c t by investment  n  office  nd  computing  equipment; i a shipments  have  been  rising  n  nominal  terms, nd prices  ave been  plummeting,  so i a h growth  in  real utlays ppears ikely  o  exceed o a l t 50 percent  (annual ate)  his  uarter. r t q Meanwhile,  data  on construction  t  in  place hrough uly  point o  a likely  ebound  in pu t J t r outlays or  nonresidential  ructures  is uarter. f st th q

In  contrast  o he  strength  n  domestic inal  emand, the ook-value nventory t t i f d b i figures  or uly  are  consistent th  our  notion hat he  rate f  stock ccumulation  ill f J wi t t o a w drop  back  considerably.  or  manufacturing nd  trade,  xcluding otor vehicles, e F a e m th annualized  ate f  stockbuilding   July  was r o in $26 billion,  rsus n average  of  nearly ve a $50 billion   the  second  quarter. lthough  we have  raised ur  prediction in A o of inventory  uilding  or he  current  uarter  s  a whole,  the  deceleration    still pected b f t q a is ex to  subtract  ore than  a percentage  oint rom m p f GDP growth.

Incoming  data  on  prices  ave  been  a  tad  softer  han e had  expected.  The CPI h t w rose  another .2  percent n  August, espite  arger  ncreases  n  food  and energy  prices 0 i d l i i than  in  previous onths;  excluding ood  and energy, he  increase  n  August  was only m f t i 0.1  percent. lthough  the  unexpectedly  mall  rise  n  August  partly  eflected ecial A s i r sp factors  hat ill ikely  e  reversed  n  September  (especially  e  declines  n  apparel t w l b i th i prices  nd airfares),  creases  n  both  the  total  PI and core  prices  re  now projected a in i C a at  about  2 percent annual ate)  his uarter, out  1/4  percentage  oint elow our ( r t q ab p b previous  rojection.  ith  regard o  wages,  the welve-month hange  in  average p W t t c hourly  earnings  as  held  steady n  the  3-1/2 ercent o  3-3/4 ercent ange  recently; h i p t p r with  the  higher inimum  wage taking ffect  n September  1, e think hat his m e o w t t measure  will ove back  to  the  upper  end of  that ange  in  the  next ouple  of onthly m r c m readings.

The Longer-Run Outlook

The forecast  as  real DP  growth  holding round  3  percent  n  the  fourth uarter, h G a i q bringing  rowth  for he  year  to  3-1/2  percent. utput  is rojected  o  expand g t O p t 2-1/4  percent n  1998 and 1-1/2  percent n  1999. As noted  earlier,  e  1997-98 i i th projection  s  somewhat stronger  han  in  the ast  reenbook. The upward revision  o i t l G t our  near-term orecast  eflects inly  our  expectations at he  surge n  business  ixed f r ma th t i f investment ill ail  ff ore gradually  han  we had thought reviously  nd  that,  iven w t o m t p a g the  stronger  rend f  final  ales,  he  downshift n  the  pace  of  inventory  ccumulation t o s t i a will e  spread  over  a  longer pan. b s

As was also oted  earlier,  r  forecast  f  a deceleration   GDP  still nges n n ou o in hi o the  same fundamental  arguments  we presented n  previous reenbooks. Although  the i G recent trength  f  exports as  prompted  us  to  raise  ur  forecast  or his omponent of s o h o f t c GDP,  the  lagged  effects  f  the  appreciation  he  dollar  till  ad  us  to  project o oft s le a decline  n  net  exports hroughout  he  forecast riod. n  addition, e  already igh i t t pe I th h levels  f  spending  on  consumer and  producer  durables, d the mplied tock-flow o an i s relationships, gest ome restraint   outlay rowth  from  here.  Our assumption f  a sug s on g o considerable  ise  n  interest  tes nd a  sizable  tock arket  correction  lso ey in r i ra a s m isa k the  damping of  aggregate emand, especially   the  latter rt f  1998 and in  1999. d in pa o All  told,  e now expect inal  ales rowth  to  slow  from  around  3-3/4  percent  ver  the w f s g o second  half f  this  ear  to  2-1/2 ercent n  1998 and 1-1/2  percent  n  1999. o y p i i

Residential  nvestment. i We  are  projecting  moderate  decline n  residential a i investment ver  the  forecast  eriod.  For  the  near  term, any  of he asic actors o p m t b f conditioning  emand are  still  ite ositive:  ob  and  income growth  have  been  solid, d qu p J household  wealth s  high, nd consumers  report omebuying conditions  especially i a h ( mortgage  rates)  o  be  very  good. Consequently,  e feel easonably  omfortable  n t w r c i discounting  ast onth's  drop-off  n  single-family  ilding  nd anticipating  at uch l m i bu a th s starts  n  the  next  several  onths will ove back  above  the  1.1  million  nit ark. i m m u m However, as  mortgage  rates nd other undamental eterminants  ecome less avorable a f d b f next  year, ome erosion  f  demand is  likely, though e expect  only  a  relatively  ld s o al w mi decline n  construction tivity   what  will till   a  very  high  employment economy i ac in s be with  a  historically  cash-flow  urden  of  homeownerhip. All  told,  e are  predicting low b w that ingle-family  arts  ill e dropping nly  to  1.08  million  nits  n  1999 from s st w b o u i 1.13  million  his  ear. t y

Multifamily  tarts  ave  essentially  en  on a  plateau or  some time  now, well s h be f above  the  previous yclical ough evel  ut  well  below the eaks  of  past ecades. c tr l b p d With the  movement  to  conventional  ingle-family  uses  and manufactured omes,  the s ho h apartment  vacancy  rate  as  come down only  a  little    the ast  year, nd rents n  many h in p a i markets  have  not  been  strong nough to  inspire great eal  of  building.  iven the e a d G

economic and financial tlook,  e expect  a  moderate  decline  n  multifamily  tarts, ou w i s to 290,000  per  year  by 1999 from  310,000  in  1997.

Business  fixed  investment.

With sales rowth  projected  o  weaken and p g g t corporate  ash  flow  coming under  increasing  ressure,  expect  that  eal FI growth c p we r B will  slow  to round  8  percent n  1998 and 5-1/2 ercent n  1999. a i p i

Investment  n  high-tech  quipment  should  continue  o  grow rapidly, iven y i e t dr b continued harp  price eclines  nd technological novations.  utlays  for  office  nd s d a in O a computing  equipment  are  projected  o  rise 0  percent r  more in  1998 and in  1999. t 3 o While "Year 2000" reprogramming  costs ay strain  ome companies'  information m s system  budgets, any  firms ay  find arlier placement f  older quipment  a costm m e re o e effective y of  addressing  ome of  that pecial  roblem.

Since  the August  FOMC  meeting,  European  stock  prices  have  moved  up, but  to varying  degrees. German  stock prices  have  increased  only  marginally  whereas  Italian stock  prices  are  up  more  than  12  percent  and  U.K. prices  have  risen  nearly  5  percent. In  Japan,  stock  prices  declined  an  additional  4-1/2  percent  on  balance  over the  period. Stock  prices  in  several  southeast Asian  countries,  including  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  and the  Philippines,  fell  further  in late  August  and  early  September  and  have  been  volatile since  then.

Expansion  of real  economic  activity  continues  to be  robust  in  all  the  major foreign  industrial  countries  except  Japan. In  Germany,  second-quarter  real  GDP  grew at  an  annual  rate  of 4.1  percent,  led  by  exports  and  personal  consumption. In  July, industrial  production  and  manufacturing  orders  rose further,  and  according  to  the IFO survey,  the business  climate  improved  sharply. In  the  United  Kingdom,  real  GDP expanded  at  an  annual  rate  of 4.0  percent  in  the  second  quarter;  consumption  and investment  expenditures  were  particularly  strong. Industrial  production  through July and  retail  sales  through  August  were higher  as  well. U.K.  export  orders  declined  in July  and  August,  and  survey  data  suggest  that  growth  in  manufacturing  industries  is slowing,  partly  in  response  to  recent  monetary  tightening  and  the strength  of the pound. Canadian  real GDP  grew  at an  annual  rate of 4.9  percent  in the  second quarter,  led  by  growth  of total  domestic  demand  of nearly  7-1/2  percent. Employment expanded  further  through  August,  but the  unemployment  rate  remained  at  9.0 percent because  the labor  force  grew  rapidly. In  Japan,  real  GDP declined  in  the  second quarter  at  an  annual  rate  of  11.2  percent. As expected,  consumption  fell  sharply,  more than  reversing  its  first-quarter  burst  that preceded  the  increase  in  the  consumption  tax. Private  investment  also  fell. In  contrast,  exports  grew  vigorously. Some  improvement is  suggested  by  a  rebound  in  industrial  production  and  continued  strength  in  machinery orders  in  July;  however,  housing  starts  declined  further  that  month,  and  new  car registrations  through  August  were  down. Problems remain  in  the  financial  sector.

Consumer  price  inflation  remains  low in  the  major  foreign  industrial  countries. German  inflation  moved  above  2  percent  in  August  for  the first  time  in  more  than two years;  partial  data  suggest  that  inflation  edged  back down  in  September. U.K. inflation  declined  slightly  in  August  from  the  July  rate;  but  at 2.8  percent,  it  remained above  the  government's target  of 2-1/2  percent.

Financial  arkets  have  remained  volatile   many of  the  southeast  sian m in A economies. Although  indicators   second-quarter of real economic activity   those in countries  nd some partial ta  for  July  show generally  teady rowth, egative a da s g n implications   the  financial rmoil or heir  eal rowth  may become evident  n  later of tu f t r g i data.  Elsewhere  in  Asia, orean  real DP K G growth  was robust hrough he  second t t quarter,  nd  industrial  oduction  xpanded  further  n  July; ut  several  orporate a pr e i b c bankruptcies  aised oncerns,  ncluding  bout  the  health f  the  financial ctor. eal r c i a o se R output rowth  in  Taiwan appears o  have  slowed  in  the  second  quarter,   part he g t in t result  f  transitory  ather  and  agricultural  oblems  but  also ecause  of  a slowing  of o we pr b export rowth.
