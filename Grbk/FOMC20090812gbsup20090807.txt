Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Job losses continued to abate in July, and aggregate hours of production and nonsupervisory workers were unchanged.  Private payroll employment fell 247,000; in addition, the average monthly decline of 373,000 in May and June is now slightly less than previously reported.  In the manufacturing sector, employment fell 52,000 in July. The step-up in motor vehicle assemblies boosted employment 28,000; elsewhere in manufacturing job losses were smaller in a number of industries, and workweeks generally moved up.  Employment declines in July were also smaller than in recent months in business and financial services while employment in nonbusiness services posted its third monthly gain, supported the continued uptrend in health and education and a small gain in the leisure and hospitality industry.  However, job losses in the construction industry continued at about the recent rate; since the spring, the contraction in establishments associated largely with residential building has eased a bit, but cutbacks have remained sizable in those associated with nonresidential construction.  Elsewhere, declines in employment in continued to be widespread in warehousing and transportation and in retailing.  Employment at state and local governments is now estimated to have edged down in June and July, extending the general downtrend that began in the fall of 2008.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked down in July to 9.4 percent.  In recent months, both the proportion of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons and the proportion of unemployed workers who lost their job in the previous 5 weeks have leveled off.  However, the number of longer term unemployed-particularly those jobless for more than 27 weeks-has continued to move up.  The labor force participation rate fell back in July to its March level of 65.5 percent.

Average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers rose 0.2 percent in July to a level 2.5 percent higher than it was a year earlier.  This measure of wage change has decelerated noticeably over the past year; in the 12 months ending in July 2008, average hourly earnings increased 3.5 percent.

Note: Attached are updated versions of tables on personal consumption expenditures and prices that include newly released detail from the annual NIPA revision.
