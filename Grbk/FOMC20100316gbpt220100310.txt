Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate pace in early 2010.  Business investment in equipment and software seems to have picked up, consumer spending increased further in January, and private employment would likely have turned up in February in the absence of the snowstorms that affected the East Coast.  Moreover, output in the manufacturing sector has continued to trend up as firms have increased production to meet strengthening final demand and to slow the pace of inventory liquidation.  On the downside, the recovery in the housing sector has faltered, and nonresidential construction has weakened further.  Meanwhile, a sizable increase in energy prices has pushed up top-line consumer price inflation in recent months; in contrast, core inflation has been particularly soft.

Labor Market Developments

As best we can judge, the labor market seems to be bottoming out.   Private nonfarm 1 payroll employment fell only 25,000, on average, in January and February and, in the absence of the storms, probably would have risen last month.   The average workweek 2 for production and nonsupervisory workers fell back in February after ticking up to 33.3 hours in January-its highest level since early 2009-but the drop was likely due to the storms.

The recent data from the household survey also point to a bottoming out in the labor market.  After dipping to 9.7 percent in January, the unemployment rate held steady in February, and the fraction of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons remained below the levels of late 2009.  In addition, the number of new job losers as a fraction of employment continued to drop, while unemployment durations-as gauged by the average length of unemployment spells and the share of the unemployed who have been out of work for more than 26 weeks-fell back a bit from their historic highs in January.  The labor force participation rate has inched up over the past two months. Nonetheless, on net, participation has fallen steeply since mid-2009 in response to the scarcity of employment opportunities; indeed, individuals' perceptions of job availability from February's Conference Board survey remain quite negative.

The message from other labor market indicators is mixed.  After smoothing through the volatility induced by storms and various reporting problems, initial claims have risen a bit since the January Greenbook.   However, help-wanted advertising has risen noticeably of 3 late, and readings on future hiring plans from the Manpower survey are up, on net, since the start of 2010.  In contrast, information from JOLTS-the layoff, job openings, and hiring rates-indicates little recent improvement in labor market conditions.  Both the number of firms with hard-to-fill positions and hiring plans as reported in the NFIB survey are also little changed since the end of last year.  Households' expectations of future labor market conditions remain well above their lows from early 2009.

We estimate that output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009-the result of a surge in output

and a small increase in hours.  This rise was the third consecutive outsized quarterly gain in productivity and brought the increase over the four quarters of 2009 to 5.7 percent.

Industrial Production

After increasing briskly in the second half of 2009, industrial production (IP) continued to expand, on net, in the early months of 2010.  IP shot up 0.9 percent in January, and indicators for February (including production worker hours and available product data) suggest that total IP was little changed as higher output at mines and utilities offset a decline in manufacturing production that was, at least in part, due to the effects of the East Coast snowstorms.  In recent months, gains across industries have remained broadly based:  The January reading of the diffusion index of three-month changes in manufacturing IP indicated that two-thirds of individual industries recorded increases in output relative to three months earlier.  According to the staff's flow-of-goods system, recent production gains have reflected a pickup in final demand, both domestic and foreign, and efforts by firms to slow the pace of inventory liquidation.

Capacity utilization in manufacturing rose to 69.2 percent in January, 4 percentage points above its trough in June, but still some 10 percentage points below the longer-term average.  As a result, incentives for firms to expand production capacity are weak. Indeed, based on data for investment, business surveys, and physical measures in some industries, factory capacity is estimated to decrease 1 percent in 2010 after declining 1.2 percent in 2009. 4

Production of light motor vehicles declined a bit in February after stepping up in January. Over the first two months of 2010, assemblies averaged roughly 7½ million units at an annual rate, an increase of ½ million units from the pace in the fourth quarter.  Production in February was held down somewhat by a disruption at Toyota, where a major safety recall led the firm to temporarily halt production and sales of several models in late January and early February.   Dealers' inventories of light vehicles continued to expand 5 in the first two months of 2010, and days' supply moved up to 63 days at the end of February.  Although days' supply is currently slightly below the industry target of 65 days, automakers appear cautious about the outlook for sales, and manufacturers' initial assembly plans suggest that production will remain at an annual rate of about 7½ million units in the second quarter.

Elsewhere in the transportation sector, output of commercial aircraft is likely being held down by the slowing of Boeing's production of 777 passenger planes.

Production in high-tech industries increased moderately in the fourth quarter and posted a solid gain in January.  In the fourth quarter, the output of communications equipment recorded its first quarterly increase in a year as telecommunications service providers continued to increase capital expenditures in order to boost cellular network capacity. U.S. computer spending surged in the fourth quarter, but this jump provided only a limited boost to domestic computer production because the increase in demand was concentrated in products that are primarily imported.  Meanwhile, exports of high-tech products rose in December and have been climbing rapidly since mid-2009.

Upstream, domestic semiconductor production has edged up, on balance, in recent months.  Microprocessor production has flattened out at a high level after surging in the middle of last year, but production of other chips and electronic components has increased steadily.  More broadly, the global semiconductor industry, which slashed capacity during the downturn, has struggled to meet demand from downstream producers. As a result, prices have risen for some semiconductor components, and the industry is spending heavily on new equipment, much of which is manufactured in the United States.

Looking ahead, available indicators suggest that high-tech production will be supported by increased business spending in the coming months.  Surveys indicate that businesses are intending to replace aging equipment and have increased IT budgets for 2010.  With inventories of high-tech equipment already lean, any pickup in investment will likely lead to higher production.  That said, outside forecasters generally expect revenues for major U.S. information technology companies to only move sideways in 2010, which would be consistent with just a modest increase in production.

Energy output has boosted IP in recent months.  As a result of unseasonably cold weather, utilities output jumped in December and rose further in January; for February, weekly electricity data point to another solid increase in the output of utilities.  In addition, weekly product data suggest that oil and gas drilling, which has risen sharply since mid-2009, moved up further in February and will boost the output of mined energy products for the month.

Outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, and high-tech industries, production rebounded 0.9 percent in January after moving sideways in December.  Gains

were widespread across major market groups, as consumer goods, business equipment, construction supplies, and materials each increased about 1 percent.  The available data suggest that production in February was likely little changed, as a number of industries were negatively affected by last month's snowstorms.

The available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity point to moderate gains in IP in the coming months.  The new orders diffusion indexes from the national ISM survey and from the regional manufacturing surveys remain at levels consistent with a further expansion in production in the near term.  The three-month moving average of the staff's series on real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude industries for which reported orders have little information content for predicting shipments) also suggests moderate gains in the near future.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending has continued to move up.  In total, real PCE rose a solid 0.3 percent in January after similar gains, on average, over the preceding three months.  The rise in spending in recent months has been driven by sizable increases in outlays for a wide variety of goods, while real outlays for services have remained on a more gradual uptrend.

On average, sales of new automobiles and light trucks were at an annual rate of 10.6 million units in January and February, slightly less than in the fourth quarter of 2009.  The softening was concentrated in the retail segment and appears to reflect, in part, the safety recall at Toyota, which led the firm to halt sales of eight models in late January and the first half of February. 6 Smoothing through the effects of the Toyota suspension-as well as the unwinding of the 'cash for clunkers' effects-we estimate that underlying consumer demand for light vehicles has been essentially steady in recent months, consistent with the stability in households' assessments of car-buying conditions. Incentive programs were little changed in January and February; however, in early March, Toyota announced an aggressive incentive program to lure customers back into showrooms, a move that was quickly followed by other automakers.

Household income looks less supportive of spending than at the time of the January Greenbook.  After incorporating the unemployment insurance tax records for the third quarter of 2009, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) lowered its estimates for wages and salaries in the second half of last year by roughly $100 billion at an annual rate; as a result, real DPI is now estimated to have risen just 1 percent over the year as a whole, and even this small gain reflected a substantial boost from fiscal stimulus.  In January, real

DPI fell 0.6 percent, dragged down by a large increase in the BEA's estimate of personal taxes, and the personal saving rate dropped to 3.3 percent, ¾ percentage point below its fourth-quarter average, but still almost 2 percentage points above its pre-recession level. 7

With equity prices having posted moderate gains and house prices holding steady in the fourth quarter of 2009, the ratio of household net worth to income was little changed after increasing appreciably over the prior two quarters.  At the end of last year, the wealth-toincome ratio stood close to its long-run average, but the loss in household net worth from mid-2007 to the end of last year was still equivalent to nearly 1½ years of household income.  So far in 2010, equity prices have moved up modestly, on net.

Housing

The recovery in the housing market seems to have stalled.  Single-family housing starts moved sideways over the second half of 2009 and remained at an annual rate of about 480,000 in January.  Unusually bad weather apparently depressed new construction in January (and likely did so again in February); this factor, along with the small positive gap between adjusted permits and starts in January, suggests that some improvement in starts may be in the offing once the weather returns to normal.  However, reports from homebuilders and our industry contacts suggest that activity in the new home market is being held down by the large number of distressed properties on the market, new homes selling at prices below building costs, and difficulties in obtaining loans for land acquisition, development, and construction.  In the multifamily sector, starts in January were 18 percent below their year-earlier level as tight credit conditions and elevated vacancy rates continued to restrain activity.

On the sales front, the Census Bureau's measure of new home sales agreements, which had posted sizable declines late last year, dropped a further 11 percent in January to an annual rate of 309,000 units-a record low for this series, which began in 1963. 8 Meanwhile, sales of existing homes, which appear to have received a substantial boost last fall from the originally scheduled expiration of the homebuyer tax credit, fell considerably in December and January; pending home sales agreements also decreased in January.

Prices of Existing Homes

<!-- missing-text -->

The slowdown in sales notwithstanding, housing demand is being supported by a number of factors.  Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages remain very low by historical standards, and the recent news on house prices is likely contributing to a perception that real estate values are near their bottom.  The repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance was about unchanged in the fourth quarter of last year at a level 4 percent above its trough in April 2009.  Moreover, in the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers for February, the number of respondents who expect house prices to increase over the next 12 months continued to exceed the number of respondents who expect prices to decrease.

After moving down dramatically through the end of last year, the inventory of unsold new homes remained at the very low level of 234,000 units in January.  However, measured relative to the slow pace of sales in January, the months' supply of new homes moved back up to just above 9 months-only about one-fourth below its peak last January.  More broadly, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupancy (which includes both existing and completed new homes for sale) edged up in the fourth quarter of last year, and, although significantly below its peak in 2008, it remains high relative to pre-crisis levels.

Equipment and Software

Real spending on equipment and software increased at an annual rate of 18 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009 and appears to have risen further early in the first quarter. Purchases of high-tech equipment are apparently rising briskly, business outlays for motor vehicles seem to be holding up after a sharp increase in the fourth quarter, and incoming data point to some firming in outlays on other equipment.

Real spending on high-tech equipment and software increased at an annual rate of about 30 percent in the fourth quarter, and the latest monthly data for manufacturers' shipments and IP point to further gains in high-tech investment in early 2010.  While demand stemming from the replacement of existing equipment likely remains a major driver of the step-up in high-tech investment, reports from major high-tech companies suggest that some firms may have moved beyond replacing aging capital to actually increasing capacity-for example, both Microsoft and Apple are in the early stages of building large data centers.

Business purchases of motor vehicles are also faring well.  Deliveries of light vehicles to rental car companies and other businesses continued to increase, on average, in January and February.  And although orders for medium and heavy trucks have fallen sharply since mid-autumn (a swing that likely is related to the new environmental regulations on diesel engines that took effect at the start of this year), truck sales were little changed between November and January after moving up, on net, over the preceding few months.

Real business investment in equipment other than high tech and transportation posted another small decline in the fourth quarter, but the incoming data hint that an upturn may be under way.  Shipments and orders for this broad category of nondefense capital goods have moved erratically in recent months, mainly because of swings in the volatile engine and turbines category.  Excluding engines and turbines, shipments rose modestly in January and stood nearly 1½ percent above their average level in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, new orders have been on a steep uptrend since mid-2009 and now stand just below shipments.

The recent step-up in investment spending is consistent with improvements in many indicators of business demand.  Business output rose robustly in the fourth quarter, and the February readings of the ISM and Philadelphia Fed business sentiment indicators were near the top of their ranges for the past several years.  Meanwhile, the cost of capital has fallen sharply over the past four quarters, and corporate bond yields are similar to those seen before the recession began.  However, credit conditions for small businesses remain difficult, as a large number of NFIB survey respondents again reported having trouble obtaining credit in February.

Nonresidential construction

Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remain bleak.  After folding in the latest monthly construction data, we estimate that real outlays on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector fell at an annual rate of about 30 percent in the fourth quarter, and nominal expenditures dropped further in January.  The weakness has been widespread across categories and likely reflects the drag from rising vacancy rates, plunging property prices, and difficult financing conditions for new projects.  In addition, the current level of architectural billings is consistent with further declines in spending over the next six months, and the nonresidential construction industry has continued to shed workers.

In contrast, real spending on drilling and mining structures has picked up strongly in response to the rebound in oil and natural gas prices in the second half of last year. Spending was up about 70 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, and increases in the number of drilling rigs in operation and footage drilled suggest that spending will remain robust in the first quarter.  Nonetheless, this pickup follows a massive decline in the first half of 2009, and spending still stands well below late 2008 levels.

Business Inventories

The pace of inventory liquidation slowed dramatically in late 2009.  Indeed, as measured in the NIPA, real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles were drawn down at an annual rate of less than $35 billion in the fourth quarter, compared with reductions of

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Financial conditions remained supportive of economic growth over the intermeeting period, despite economic data that were somewhat weaker than expected, on balance, and a temporary escalation in concerns about fiscal strains in Europe.  Investors marked down the expected path of the federal funds rate, on net, over the period.  Nominal Treasury yields were about flat, and TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation declined. Broad stock price indexes increased, boosted by positive earnings news, while risk spreads on corporate bonds were little changed.  The expiration of many of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities on February 1 had no significant effects in financial markets.  Also, despite further tapering of the Federal Reserve's large-scale asset purchases of agency debt and agency-backed MBS and the imminent completion of the program at the end of this month, MBS yields were roughly unchanged.  Conditions in both the commercial and residential mortgage markets remained strained, with delinquency rates rising further.  Meanwhile, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was roughly flat, as solid bond issuance was offset by declines in commercial paper and C&amp;I loans.  Consumer credit expanded in January for the first time in a year.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

The expected path of monetary policy implied by futures market quotes moved lower, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Implied rates on Eurodollar futures contracts maturing around year-end decreased about 10 basis points, and those on contracts maturing in early 2012 fell about 25 basis points.  Although the outcome of the January FOMC meeting was largely in line with expectations, market participants reportedly read the statement's characterization of the economic outlook as somewhat more upbeat than they had anticipated, and Eurodollar futures rates rose a bit in response.  However, subsequent economic data were somewhat weaker than expected, on balance, leading investors to mark down the expected policy path.  The changes to terms for primary credit and TAF loans that were announced on February 18 resulted in a small increase in near-term futures rates, but this uptick proved short lived, as the statement and subsequent Federal Reserve communications-most notably the Chairman's congressional testimony the following week-emphasized that the modifications did not represent a shift in the overall stance of monetary policy.

Based on the staff's usual term premium assumption of 1 basis point per month, futures quotes currently indicate that the federal funds rate is expected to rise above 25 basis points at the end of the third quarter of 2010 and reach about 1¾ percent by the end of 2011.  In contrast, quotes from the market for interest rate caps suggest that the most

likely path of the federal funds rate-that is, the mode rather than the mean of the distribution-involves a later liftoff in the policy rate and was roughly unchanged over the intermeeting period.  The results of the Desk's March primary dealer survey were about in line with those from the January survey, with one-half of the respondents expecting the first policy rate increase to occur by the end of the year.

Nominal Treasury yields were essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period. Yields may have been supported by an easing of flight-to-quality demands with a modest reduction in perceived downside risks to the economic outlook, broadly consistent with increases in equity prices and reductions in implied volatilities on Treasury securities over the period.  TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation moved down at all horizons, likely reflecting the weaker-than-expected incoming economic data and the publication of lower-than-anticipated CPI figures.  Survey measures of inflation expectations that were released during the period also pointed to slight declines in both short- and long-term inflation expectations.  In addition, analysts reported that supply pressures may have boosted yields on TIPS somewhat relative to their nominal counterparts.

Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities

Over the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve continued to taper its large-scale asset purchases.  Cumulative Federal Reserve purchases of agency debt securities and agency MBS reached about $171 billion and $1.22 trillion, respectively.  All purchases are expected to be executed by the end of March.

On February 18, the Federal Reserve announced an increase of 25 basis points in the primary credit rate, effective February 19, and a reduction in the typical maximum maturity for primary credit loans to overnight, beginning on March 18.  These changes were made in light of recent improvements in financial market conditions.

The Federal Reserve's emergency lending facilities continued to wind down with no apparent adverse effects on markets or institutions.  The expiration of the AMLF, CPFF, PDCF, TSLF, and the temporary liquidity swap arrangements with foreign central banks on February 1 had no significant effect on financial markets.  The final two non-CMBS TALF subscriptions took place over the intermeeting period and supported a large number of deals relative to recent subscriptions, as sponsors reportedly sought TALF support for deals that would otherwise have been more difficult to bring to market.  At the mid-February CMBS subscription, $1.3 billion in loans collateralized by legacy CMBS were extended, an amount about in line with recent subscriptions.  The final TAF

auction occurred on March 8, offering $25 billion in 28-day credit.  The minimum bid rate for this auction was raised 25 basis points, to 50 basis points, consistent with the change in the primary credit rate.  The auction was undersubscribed, with bids totaling just $3 billion, compared with $15 billion of maturing loans.

On March 8, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced plans to expand the list of counterparties with which it can conduct reverse repurchase agreements to include domestic money market mutual funds.  The announcement elicited little price reaction.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock price indexes rose about 4 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, boosted in part by favorable earnings reports from the retail sector.  Bank equity prices slightly outperformed the broader equity markets.  Option-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index dropped back to post-crisis lows after ratcheting up early in the period on concerns about Chinese monetary policy tightening and fiscal strains in Europe.  Even so, the gap between the staff's estimate of the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms and the real 10-year Treasury yield-a measure of the equity risk premium-remained well above its average over the past decade.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed.  As a result, spreads on corporate bonds remained at their lowest levels since early 2008.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP held steady at slightly above their pre-crisis levels.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Earnings news was generally favorable, particularly in the retail sector.  Profits of nonfinancial corporations in the S&amp;P 500 continued to rebound, with quarter-over­ quarter growth maintaining a double-digit pace in the fourth quarter.  In contrast, financial corporations, in aggregate, continued to post near-zero profits.  On balance, in the month ending mid-February, analysts again revised up their forecasts of earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms over the coming year.

The credit quality of nonfinancial firms has continued to improve, on balance, in recent months.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations moved lower again in the fourth quarter, while the aggregate liquid asset ratio rose a bit further to a new high of about 11 percent.  Moreover, the pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by Moody's slowed again in the first two months of 2010 and was below the pace of upgrades.  Meanwhile, the six-month trailing bond default rate for nonfinancial

firms edged down in January and February to the low end of its historical range.  The rise in the C&amp;I loan delinquency rate moderated a bit in the fourth quarter, and the year-ahead expected default rate for nonfinancial firms from Moody's KMV was roughly unchanged in February, although at a somewhat elevated level.

Business Finance

In January and February, the pace of gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations remained strong.  In contrast, commercial paper outstanding continued to contract and C&amp;I loans ran off steeply again.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial firms was about zero over the first two months of 2010, consistent with firms' weak demand for credit and banks' tight credit policies.

cash-financed mergers rose sharply as two Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was robust in the fourth quarter of last year.  Meanwhile, equity retirements from large deals in the pharmaceutical industry were completed.  In addition, equity retirements from share repurchases are estimated to have increased a bit from recent low levels.  As a result, net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms, which had been positive in the first three quarters of 2009, turned negative in the fourth quarter.  Since the turn of the year, gross public equity issuance has slowed somewhat, while announcements of both new share repurchase programs and cash-financed mergers and acquisitions have picked up.

Public equity issuance by financial firms declined in January and February following very strong issuance in December, when several large banks issued equity to facilitate the repayment of capital received under the TARP program.  Gross bond issuance by financial firms remained solid.

Commercial Real Estate Finance

The contraction in commercial mortgage debt accelerated in the fourth quarter.  The dollar value of commercial real estate sales remained at a very low level in February, and the share of properties sold at a nominal loss inched higher.  Property prices in December were about 40 percent below their 2007 peaks.  The delinquency rate on commercial mortgages in securitized pools increased to more than 6 percent in January, and the delinquency rate on commercial mortgages at commercial banks deteriorated further in the fourth quarter.  The percentage of delinquent construction loans at banks also ticked higher in the fourth quarter.  Nonetheless, commercial mortgage CDS index prices changed little, on balance, over the intermeeting period.

Household Finance

Mortgage interest rates and spreads were about flat, on net, over the intermeeting period. The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages stayed around 5 percent, and its spread to the 10-year Treasury yield remained at the low end of its range over the past few years.  Agency MBS yields were also little changed, on balance, despite some volatility surrounding the initial announcements and subsequent information about Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's buyouts of delinquent mortgages from agency MBS pools. 1 The tapering of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS purchases over the same period and the impending end of its asset purchase program seems to have had little effect on MBS yields to date.  However, the high level of the Federal Reserve's purchases and the relatively low level of mortgage originations have reportedly contributed to reduced liquidity in the MBS market, leading to a higher incidence of secondary market fails-to-deliver.

Residential mortgage debt declined further in the fourth quarter.  House price data for December were mixed:  The FHFA price index decreased, while the LoanPerformance and S&amp;P/Case-Shiller price indexes increased slightly.  Delinquency rates on prime mortgages continued to climb in January, and the number of delinquent FHA-backed mortgages topped 530,000 in December, up from 320,000 a year earlier.

Consumer credit expanded at an annual rate of about 2 percent in January, its first increase since January 2009.  The three-month percent change in revolving consumer credit became a bit less negative, while the respective change in nonrevolving consumer credit moved up to about zero.  Despite low and stable consumer ABS spreads, the pace of ABS issuance in the first two months of the year was somewhat below that in the fourth quarter, reflecting the very weak pace of consumer credit originations late last year.  The spread of credit card interest rates over the two-year Treasury yield ticked up in January, while spreads on new auto loans declined slightly, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Delinquency rates on credit card loans in securitized pools and auto loans at captive finance companies remained elevated in January but were down a bit from their recent peaks.

Long-term mutual funds continued to receive sizable net inflows in January and February, largely driven by continued robust inflows into bond funds.  Money market

of foreign participation in During the intermeeting period, the Treasury issued about $325 billion of nominal coupon securities across the term structure.  The auctions were generally well received, with bid-to-cover ratios within their recent ranges.  Measures Treasury auctions remained elevated, although they have trended downward somewhat since late 2009.  The Treasury also conducted the first 30-year TIPS auction since 2001. While the yield at the auction was 7 basis points above the when-issued rate prior to the auction, the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.45, and market participants generally characterized it as successful.

In its quarterly refunding statement, the Treasury announced that it expects nominal auction sizes to stabilize near current levels, while noting that TIPS issuance would gradually increase going forward.  Following the passage of legislation raising the federal debt ceiling, the Treasury began increasing the balance in the Supplementary Financing Account; this account now stands at $50 billion and will increase to $200 billion by midApril.

Treasury market functioning was about unchanged over the intermeeting period.  The average absolute fitting error of the staff's nominal Treasury curve-a proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the nominal Treasury market-declined slightly over the period, and fails-to-deliver in the Treasury market remained low.  On-the-run premiums on the 10-year Treasury note increased slightly, while trading volumes in the nominal and TIPS markets were little changed on net.

State and Local Government Finance

Conditions in the municipal bond market showed little sign of strain despite the growing evidence of budget problems faced by many states and municipalities.  Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained solid in January and February, mostly driven by continued strength in new capital issuance.  In contrast, the pace of short-term issuance stayed subdued.  The number of municipal bonds downgraded by Moody's rose further in the fourth quarter, far outpacing the number of upgrades, as a large number of small municipalities saw their ratings lowered.  Even so, yields on long-term municipal bonds were about flat over the intermeeting period, and their ratios to yields on comparablematurity Treasury securities were also roughly unchanged.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 decreased 8½ percent at an annual rate in January, reflecting in part a contraction in liquid deposits.  Several institutions opted out of the FDIC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program because of higher fees associated with participation after the year end, reportedly driving depositors to transfer funds out of transaction accounts and into alternative investments outside of M2.  In February, however, M2 expanded 8 percent at an annual rate, as liquid deposits resumed their growth.  Small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds contracted in January and, to a lesser extent, in February, while currency declined a bit in January but advanced notably in February.  Growth of the monetary base averaged 27½ percent at an annual rate in both months, as the increase in reserve balances resulting from the ongoing large-scale asset purchases more than offset the contraction in reserve balances associated with the decline in credit outstanding under liquidity and credit facilities.

Total bank credit contracted at an 11 percent average annual rate in January and February.  Banks' securities holdings declined at a modest pace in both months after several months of steady growth.  Total loans on banks' books continued to fall at a rapid pace.   C&amp;I loans again declined steeply, as spreads of interest rates on C&amp;I loans over 2 comparable-maturity market instruments climbed further in the first quarter and nonfinancial firms' need for external finance likely remained subdued.  Commercial real estate loans also posted substantial declines.  Household loans on banks' books contracted as well, in part because of a pickup in banks' securitization of first-lien residential mortgages with the GSEs in February.  The decline in consumer loans originated by banks was mostly associated with a big drop in credit card loans.  In contrast, other consumer loans-including auto, student, and tax advance loans-were about flat over the two-month period.

According to Call Reports, bank profitability remained low in the fourth quarter, as slightly improved profits at banks in the 25 largest bank holding companies were about offset by a sixth consecutive quarterly loss at all other banks.  The better results at larger banks primarily reflected higher noninterest income.  Although the rate of banks' provisioning declined somewhat in the fourth quarter, provisions continued to be the most significant drag on earnings.  Reduced provisions are consistent with signs of stabilization in delinquency and charge-off rates for certain categories of loans, particularly credit card loans.

Call Report data also showed a continued decline in unused loan commitments, consistent with industry commentary suggesting that banks have moved to trim credit lines.  The further drop in industry assets last quarter, combined with additional capital infusions from parent holding companies, boosted banks' aggregate regulatory capital ratios from already high levels.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial transactions through January and partial custody data from FRBNY through early March. In several respects, U.S. financial flows have returned to their pre-crisis levels.  In particular, foreign official inflows, bank lending, and outflows associated with U.S. purchases of foreign securities have returned to near pre-crisis levels.  The one notable exception is foreign private purchases of U.S. corporate debt securities.  These purchases have declined steadily since mid-2007 and remain well below their pre-crisis level.

Foreign official inflows slowed a bit in January to $13 billion (see line 1 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions'; see also the figure 'Foreign Official Financial Inflows through January 2010').

Net official financial inflows in January also received a boost from a further $10 billion decline in outstanding drawings by foreign central banks on the Federal Reserve swap lines (line 2).  Drawings on the swap lines involve Federal Reserve purchases of foreign currency, which are recorded as an official claim on foreigners, and repayments of those drawings therefore generate inflows.  These swap lines, which were closed in February, had a balance of only $100 million at the end of January, down from a high of $583 billion in December 2008.

When swap line drawings were on-lent by foreign central banks, they were generally priced at a backstop or penalty rate.  As such, the reduction in drawings reflect a renormalization of funding markets.  Indeed, the small net bank lending abroad in January (line 3) reflects a return to a more normal pattern.
