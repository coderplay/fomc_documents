DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Real GDP continued to grow rapidly in  the third quarter. Domestic final demand surged ahead, while net exports and inventory investment slackened substantially. On  average during the quarter, gains in private employment decelerated slightly, with a  large increase in labor productivity accounting for most of  the gain in nonfarm output. Price inflation remained low, as weak import prices, rapidly growing industrial capacity, and moderating inflation expectations offset the modest effects of  tight labor markets on labor costs.

Labor Market Developments

The September labor market report was surprisingly weak, given the low level of initial claims and other indicators of labor demand. Net of  the effects of  the UPS strike, private payroll employment rose about 125,000 for the second month in a  row. Aggregate hours of  production or nonsupervisory workers fell 0.1 percent. The unemployment rate held steady at 4.9 percent, and household employment and the labor force participation rate edged down.

For the third quarter as a  whole, average monthly growth in private employment, at 187,000, was a  bit slower than in the first half of  the year, with moderation in  both the goodsand serviceproducing sectors. Averaging through the monthly gyrations, growth in government employment in  the third quarter was about on pace with 2 that in  the first half of the year.

The average workweek of  production or  nonsupervisory workers fell slightly in September to 34.5 hours--its mean for the last six months. For the quarter as  a  whole, aggregate hours of  production

or  nonsupervisory workers grew 1.1 percent at  an annual rate, continuing a  decelerating trend since the first quarter of  the year.

In  the household survey, the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate were unchanged in  the third quarter from their second-quarter averages. Recently, growth of  household employment has slowed appreciably--much more than has growth of payroll employment. Such divergences are not uncommon and often reflect differences in the makeup of the two surveys. After adjusting the household survey to payroll survey concepts, employment growth in the two surveys has been quite close over the past year. A  rise in  multiple-job holders and a  switch out of selfemployment, both of  which boost payroll employment relative to household employment, account for the bulk of  the difference in payroll and household employment growth over the past year.

Heading into the fourth quarter, most labor market indicators point to continued strength in  demand. State initial claims have continued to run at a  very low level. The help-wanted index was still at an elevated level in September, and BNA surveys of  hiring plans for the fourth quarter have posted steep increases. Finally, the Michigan and Conference Board surveys continue to point to very favorable perceptions of  labor market conditions, although a  slight cooling of activity is suggested by  the Conference Board survey.

After rising to 67.2 percent in  the first quarter, the aggregate labor force participation rate fell back a  bit in  the last two quarters. The participation rate for adult women has risen further, albeit at a  slightly slower pace; in particular, the uptrend in the participation of  women maintaining families--the group most likely to  have been affected by  welfare reform--has continued. However, the participation rates for adult men and teenagers have fallen over the past two quarters. Nonetheless, the percentage of  the population that wants a  job but is not currently in the labor force has also dropped sharply, to a  historically low level, in recent months. And the BNA survey of jobs difficult to fill rose further in  the third quarter, from an already high level. Given the stage of  the expansion, these observations suggest that there may  be relatively few people left to  be readily drawn into the labor force.

Based on labor input and the advance NIPA data, the staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 3  percent at an annual rate in  the third quarter. Over the year ended in 1997:Q3, labor productivity increased 2-1/4 percent--an acceleration of 1  percentage point over the same period a  year earlier. Random fluctuations in self-employed hours could account for some of the strength in  nonfarm business productivity, but the acceleration has been ongoing for two years now, seemingly indicating a  stronger trend productivity performance than was seen earlier in the expansion. 3

Industrial Production

Industrial production raced ahead at an annual rate of 7  percent in  the third quarter, up from a  4-1/2 percent annual pace over the first half of  the year. Growth was especially strong in the motor vehicle, aircraft, and information-processing industries. In September, industrial production rose 0.7 percent, boosted by  a jump in  the output of  utilities. Manufacturing output grew 0.4 percent, pushing the factory operating rate to 83.4 percent-the highest level since April 1995. Despite this increase, capacity utilization in  manufacturing remains 1.2 percentage points below its

most recent peak in January 1995. The staff's current estimates show  a  marked acceleration in  the growth of  manufacturing capacity over the past three years, from a  bit over 2  percent, on average, in the early 1990s, to around 4-1/4 percent recently. This pickup has tempered the rise in utilization.

data.

Production of motor vehicles and parts has been a  volatile component of industrial production throughout 1997, in large part because of labor disputes. Nearly all local issues at GM have now been resolved, however, so that assemblies should begin to track industry fundamentals more closely. At the end of October, days' supply of  light trucks was somewhat high at 76 days, while days' supply of autos was about 60 days. At  present, industry schedules call for a 4 percent increase in  motor vehicle assemblies in the fourth quarter.

By major market group, the production of  consumer durable goods fell 0.1 percent in September, reflecting a  drop in household appliance production, after a  surge in  August. The output of consumer nondurable goods rose 1.0 percent, owing mainly to increases in energy use and chemical products. Production of business equipment was flat in September, as continued strength in information processing equipment and aircraft production was offset by declines in industrial equipment (most notably construction equipment) and other equipment (especially farm machinery and

equipment). The output of  materials continued to grow briskly, with semiconductors the largest contributor to growth.

Consumption and Personal Income

Real personal consumption expenditures increased 5-3/4 percent at  an annual rate in  the third quarter, and  the fundamentals underlying growth remain strong: Households have accrued tremendous gains in net worth over the past three years and real incomes have registered solid growth. The recent turmoil in  world financial markets conceivably could dampen consumer confidence, but any declines would come from extremely lofty levels.

On  a  monthly basis, real PCE was unchanged in September, after a  0.2 percent gain in  August and a  1  percent jump in July. Outlays for durable goods were held down by  a  decline in spending on new cars and trucks, while expenditures for computers and other electronic equipment were little changed after three months of robust gains. Real expenditures for nondurable goods were flat in September, as increased outlays for gasoline and food were offset by lower outlays for toys and clothing. Many press reports have attributed September's weakness in  apparel purchases to unseasonably warm weather, which reportedly muted enthusiasm for purchases of fall and winter apparel. Real spending for services in  September rose 0.3 percent--boosted by  a  rebound in energy outlays and solid gains in  most other major components of services as well.

Real disposable personal income rose 0.2 percent in  September, and for the third quarter as a  whole, it increased at a  healthy 2.9 percent annual rate. Given the strength of consumer demand, the personal saving rate fell back to  3.6 percent in  the third quarter; over the past four quarters, it  has declined almost a  full percentage point.

As measured by  both the Michigan SRC and Conference Board indexes, consumer confidence remained at quite favorable levels in October, although both measures were down somewhat from their September readings. Both of these surveys were largely completed before the recent turbulence in  world stock markets and cannot be expected to accurately gauge the reaction of  consumers to that episode. 5 The SRC collected only about 18 percent of  its full

sample in the last week of  October. These ninety-two responses were insufficient to discern any response that could be  considered reliable. 6

Motor Vehicles

New  light vehicles sold at an  annual rate of  about 14.7 million units in  October, a  deceleration from the elevated pace of  the third quarter. The third-quarter spurt in sales was attributable, at least in part, to the end of supply disturbances at General Motors. A  pickup of  fleet sales accounted for about one-third of  the gain in motor vehicle sales in  the third quarter as GM, with its supply problems resolved, made up for shortfalls earlier in the year. On average, sales for the year to  date have been at  about the same pace as for 1996 as a  whole.

Light vehicle sales dropped off in October despite improvements in  sales at Toyota and Honda. The pickup at Toyota and Honda reflected some easing of supply constraints as well as  the effects of  a  shift in reporting periods. A  drop in  sales at  GM  more than accounted for the overall industry decline. According to  a  source at  the company, transport problems at Union Pacific significantly inhibited sales and could prove to be a  problem for the next couple of  months. Sources at Ford and Chrysler report their sales are largely immune to problems at  Union Pacific because of the particular locations of their plants.

The strength of the dollar this year, coupled with weak demand for motor vehicles in Japan, induced Japanese automakers to aggressively price their 1998 models. In  turn, the Big Three automakers have also held the line on  many 1998 model prices and have offered generous incentive programs. Some list prices have been cut, including an unprecedented action by Saturn to  mail rebates for purchases made before the announced reduction in prices. Consequently, price increases for light vehicles have been modest to nonexistent this model year, a  factor that should help maintain demand into the fourth quarter.

Housing starts climbed to 1.50 million units at an  annual rate in September. The bounceback, which was in line with the staff's

expectations, more than offset August's anomalous decline. Starts of  single-family homes jumped to 1.17 million units, the second highest level of the year. Permit issuance for single-family units also strengthened, leaving starts well in  line with permits (after adjustment for construction activity in areas where building permits are not required).

Indicators of demand for single-family housing have shown continued strength in recent months, reflecting strong support from growth in  employment and income as  well as declines in  mortgage rates. The volume of  new  home sales was essentially unchanged at a high level in September, and home builders' rating of new  home sales in  early October remained at the most positive reading in a  year and a  half. Existing home sales--which because they are mainly recorded at closing, rather than at contract, respond to changing market conditions somewhat less rapidly than new  home sales--rose to  a  new high in September. In October, consumer assessments of homebuying conditions were the most positive in 3-1/2 years. Furthermore, applications for mortgages to  finance home purchases in early October reached the highest level since the advent of the series in 1990.

Home price increases remained moderate in the third quarter, with the rate of  increase of  both new  and existing home prices at about the midpoint of their recent ranges. New house prices, adjusted for compositional changes in  house quality and geographic location, rose 2.8 percent relative to a  year earlier, while the index of  existing home prices based on repeat sales climbed 4.6 percent from a  year earlier.

Multifamily housing starts bounced back in September to 330,000 units, compared with an  average of  319,000 units for the year to date. Permits for multifamily structures also rose substantially and are consistent with starts at the September level. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units continued to edge down during the third quarter relative to a  year earlier.

Business Fixed Investment

Businesses continued to make major contributions to aggregate demand in  the third quarter as real business fixed investment advanced at a  double-digit pace for the second quarter in a  row. Sizable increases in outlays for all categories of producers' durable equipment led the advance, but there was also a  modest upturn in expenditures on  nonresidential structures. Much of the

credit for the strong performance of  investment comes from  healthy cyclical fundamentals, such as the acceleration in  business output and steady growth in corporate cash flow.

In  the third quarter, the increase in expenditures on producers' durable equipment was again led by  outlays on  office and computing equipment. Nominal shipments advanced strongly, and rapid price declines continued. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the plunge in computer prices is set to continue in the near term. Cyrix and AMD now  appear to pose a  realistic challenge in some market segments to Intel's dominant position. Intel's recent price cuts were larger than normal, and its third-quarter profits were disappointing despite substantial growth in shipments. Along with falling prices for components, margins for PC manufacturers are declining. Sub-$1000 personal computers--such as those manufactured by  Compaq and Hewlett-Packard and often featuring a  non-Intel processor--have been the runaway success of  this year's consumer market, and PC  manufacturers' share prices have weakened in anticipation of  a  price war. Beyond PCs, the demand for networking equipment is expanding rapidly.

Expenditures on  communications equipment advanced at a 32 percent annual rate in  the third quarter as the large capital spending programs of the long-distance companies continued to lift demand. The FCC's regulations for opening local telephone markets to competition have continued to suffer legal setbacks, and just how deregulation will proceed over the next year remains unclear. 7 Nonetheless, the near-term spending picture still looks strong as orders for communications equipment advanced 7  percent per month in both August and September.

Expenditures on transportation equipment also contributed to the third-quarter boom in  PDE. Domestic expenditures on  aircraft were substantial in  the third quarter, despite the well-publicized production difficulties experienced by  Boeing. A lower-than-normal proportion of Boeing's deliveries were for export, boosting the domestic share of expenditures on  aircraft. Boeing's production difficulties and a  return to  normal levels of  exports are likely to depress domestic expenditures on aircraft in  the current quarter. Business expenditures on  motor vehicles raced ahead at  a  25 percent

annual pace in the third quarter. At  an annual rate of  430,000 units, sales of  heavy trucks were high by  historical standards and net new orders continued on the recent upward trend.

Outside the high-tech and transportation equipment categories, real expenditures increased at  a  10 percent annual rate in the third quarter, fueled by strong orders from earlier this year and the healthy expansion in  business output. The orders picture for this sector continues to look robust, with an increase of 7  percent in September and 9  percent for the third quarter as a  whole. The growth in orders was broad based and is likely to translate into further strength in this sector in the fourth quarter.

Based on data that have become available since the GDP release, the staff now  estimates that real outlays on  nonresidential structures expanded at about a  4  percent annual rate in the third quarter, as industrial and office construction registered sizable advances while most other components remained flat. Our estimate is significantly below the 10 percent figure in the advance GDP release because of  a  5  percent fall, for September, in nonresidential building construction put-in-place, a  substantially weaker number than the BEA  assumption underlying the advance release. While a bounceback from September's decline in  construction put-in-place can be expected, the weakness of  the recent data on construction contracts suggests that investment in nonresidential structures is at best on  a  modest uptrend at  this time.

Business Inventories

Inventory investment evidently moderated substantially in the third quarter from the rapid pace of stockbuilding in the second quarter. According to BEA's advance estimate, the slowing lowered growth in real GDP last quarter by  1-1/2 percentage points. In general, inventories remain lean relative to sales, and there may even be room for some additional stockbuilding in  some sectors.

On  a  book-value basis, manufacturing inventories rose at an $8  billion annual rate in September, down from a  revised $22 billion annual pace in  August. The modest September restocking leaves the third-quarter average a  touch under $20 billion, slightly below the second-quarter pace. The inventory-shipments ratio fell back to

1.34 in September--the low  end of  the range recorded over the past twelve months.

In  wholesale trade, nonvehicle inventories rose at about a  $26 billion annual rate in  August, more than reversing a  downwardrevised decline in  July. The buildup was concentrated in  the miscellaneous category, which includes tobacco products. Distributors may  have stocked up in response to manufacturers' price hikes announced for early September. Nonvehicle wholesale sales were down 0.9 percent in  August, and the inventory-sales ratio climbed to 1.24 months, its highest level in  just over a  year.

In retail trade, non-auto inventories fell at a  $21 billion rate in August, enough to more than offset the July buildup. The decline was led by  general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and home furnishings (GAF). The inventory-sales ratio for this group continued to fall in  August, reaching 2.09 months, its lowest level in  ten years. The inventory-sales ratio for the entire non-auto, retail trade sector moved down to 1.41 months, the low end of the past year's range.

Federal Government

Federal government purchases continued to be a  drag on aggregate demand in  the third quarter, falling in  real terms at an annual rate of  a  bit more than 1-1/4 percent, about in line with the recent trend. Nondefense purchases retreated from anomalous increases in  the first half of  the year, falling at a  5-1/2 percent annual rate. Defense purchases bucked the downward trend this quarter and rose 1 percent at an annual rate; increases over the last two quarters have made up for earlier declines that were larger than trend. Over the past four quarters, total real federal purchases are down 1-1/2 percent, defense purchases are down 3  percent, and nondefense purchases are up 1-1/2 percent.

The unified deficit for the fiscal year 1997 was $23 billion, the smallest for any  year since 1974. Adjusted for payment timing shifts, and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, the deficit was $48 billion, down $75 billion from last fiscal year. This improvement owed primarily to strong receipts (up 8-3/4 percent)--most notably personal income and social insurance taxes (up 9-1/2 percent). At 3-1/4 percent, adjusted outlay growth for the fiscal year was up about 1  percentage point from the 1996 pace. Defense spending edged up after several years of declines and "other" spending--principally nondefense discretionary spending--

State and  Local Current Account  Surplus

<!-- missing-text -->

Percent  of

<!-- missing-text -->

rose $9  billion in 1997 after having declined $10 billion in 1996. Expenditures on  health care programs grew about 6-1/2 percent in each of the past two years, down about 3  percentage points from the average pace of  the preceding three years.

The 1997 deficit was $15 billion less than estimated in the Administration's September Midsession Review. Lower-than-expected spending across a  wide range of  outlay categories accounts for the forecast error. The Administration's January estimate of the baseline deficit was also too high, by $105 billion. In this case, however, it  was primarily a  $75 billion underestimate of  receipts that accounted for the forecast error. According to the Midsession Review, roughly 80 percent of  the forecast error was attributable to higher-than-anticipated effective tax rates. One possible explanation is a  surge in  taxes paid on capital gains realizations, but it is likely that other sources of  taxable income contributed as well.

Receipts continued to show strength in September, growing 11 percent from a  year earlier. As has been true throughout this year, year-over-year growth in  nonwithheld individual and social insurance taxes, at 18 percent, was very robust. The September figures for this category of receipts bears watching because that month included the due date for the third quarterly estimated payment on 1997 individual income tax  liability.

State and Local Government Sector

Real spending by  state and local governments rose to 2.2 percent at an  annual rate in the third quarter, about the same average rate as recorded over the preceding three years. Total expenditures in  the third quarter were held down by  flat real spending on construction, following a  string of  negatives posted since February.

The surplus in state and local operating accounts, which excludes social insurance funds, appears to  have moved up substantially in  the third quarter but remained within the range seen in recent years. These surpluses have trended up for most of the 1990s (chart), as revenues continued to come in above expectations, and governments held the line on spending programs. However, recent surpluses, measured as a  percentage of GDP, are not large by  historical standards.

Two key deadlines of  the welfare reform process were on October 1. For the maintenance-of-effort standard, states were

EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX OF HOURLY COMPENSATION FOR PRIVATE INDUSTRY WORKERS

<!-- missing-text -->

required to  maintain their own welfare expenditures at not less than 75 percent of  their fiscal 1994 level for the year ending October 1. For the work participation standard, states were required to have 25 percent of  their total 1997 welfare caseload and 75 percent of their two-caretaker families participating in  work activities by  October 1. Most states appear to  have easily met two of the three requirements. With most states enjoying surpluses for several years, funds have been sufficient to maintain spending levels. Meanwhile, the strong job market, in  combination with a  provision in the federal law that gives states a  break for reductions in caseloads since fiscal 1995, has brought the overall work participation goal within easy reach for most states. Only the twocaretaker requirement appears elusive for some states, likely because of the severe disadvantages faced by  many of these families. States do  not have to report their status on these goals to the Department of  Health and Human Services until forty-five days after the end of  the third quarter, and no penalty will be  levied until the end of  December. Consequently, no official tally on the achievement of  these requirements is likely to  be available until early next year.

Labor Costs

According to the Employment Cost Index, hourly compensation of private industry workers increased at  a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of  3.4 percent in the three months ended in September, the same as in the previous three-month period. Over the twelve months ended in September, the ECI for private-sector hourly compensation increased 3.2 percent, up from 2.9 percent over the previous twelve months. Both benefits and wages and salaries show similar acceleration, although given the historical volatility in  the benefits series, the latest pickup in  benefits does not represent a significant pickup.

By  occupation, the considerable acceleration over the past year in hourly compensation in service and sales occupations is noteworthy. The service grouping has a  larger-than-average proportion of low-wage workers, and thus the large increase over the twelve months through September likely includes the two increases in the minimum wage over this period--one on October 1, 1996, and the other on  September 1, 1997. The minimum wage hike may also have contributed to the acceleration for sales occupations, a  category that includes, for example, retail cashiers. In  contrast to the

sales and service occupations, the acceleration in hourly compensation for blue-collar occupations was much more modest, and hourly compensation for non-sales white-collar workers decelerated.

Benefit costs continue to  moderate overall compensation increases. Over the twelve months ended in September, the ECI for private industry benefit costs increased only 2  percent, considerably less than wages and salaries. Health insurance cost increases remain modest, rising only 3/4 percent in the most recent twelve-month period, the same as the year before. Costs for unemployment insurance and workers' compensation for on-the-job injuries continued to decline, although less rapidly than in the previous twelve months.

Prices

The incoming news on price inflation has continued to be quite favorable. The September consumer price index rose 0.2 percent for the third consecutive month. Over the past twelve months, consumer prices have risen 2.2 percent, down from a  3.0 percent increase in the year-earlier period.

The CPI for energy increased 1.3 percent in  September, on top of a  1.7 percent advance in  August. Energy prices were pushed higher by  a  further increase in gasoline prices and a  jump in natural gas prices. The hike in gasoline prices in August and September owed largely to a  strong end-of-summer driving season; more recently, survey evidence suggests that prices at the pump receded in  October. In contrast to  the recent run-up in gasoline prices, the index for heating oil edged up only 0.1 percent in September, as ample supplies continued to  hold down prices. Over the past twelve months, energy prices have risen 2  percent, down considerably from the 5.2 percent pace a  year earlier.

Retail food prices rose 0.1 percent in September after slightly larger increases in  the preceding two months. Coffee prices, which had risen considerably earlier in the year, dropped back in

Overall, the CPI for food was up 2.1 percent from a  year earlier versus 3.8 percent for the same period a  year earlier.

For items other than food and energy, consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in September, continuing a  string of  very modest increases. On a  twelve-month change basis, the core CPI was up 2.2 percent in September, down 1/2 percentage point from the pace registered a  year earlier. Prices of goods and services each accounted for about half of this deceleration. Within goods--for which falling import prices have been an important restraining influence in recent years--new and used motor vehicles were a particularly notable contributor to the deceleration over the past year.10 Although the pace of  price increases for  many other goods also slowed over the past year, deceleration was not universal among prices of goods; apparel and tobacco prices rose faster over the past twelve months than in  the preceding year. Among services other than energy, price increases slowed for many items, including medical care and auto finance charges.

Turning to the details of the September movement in the core CPI, tobacco prices jumped 1.4 percent, reflecting the increase in cigarette prices put in place around Labor Day.11 Apparel prices were up 0.3 percent after having declined 1  percent in  August when stores delayed somewhat the typical seasonal introduction of fall merchandise. Among other commodities, prices for new cars and light trucks were flat in August, while used car prices edged down a  touch further. Prices of services excluding energy rose only 0.2 percent in September for the second month in a  row, restrained by  an increase of just 0.1 percent in owners' equivalent rent. Elsewhere in nonenergy services, airfares bounced back in September, while tuition and school fees declined slightly and auto finance charges decreased further.

Broad expenditure price measures other than the CPI also registered some slowing in inflation over the past year. Core PCE prices have decelerated about 0.3 percentage point over the past four quarters, a  touch less than the deceleration in  the core CPI over the same period. Among product prices, the pace of increase in the GDP chain price measure has ratcheted down about 1/2 percentage point over the past four quarters. At the same time, inflation expectations as measured by the  Michigan index have also come down. In  the third quarter of this year, one-year-ahead median expectations were about 1/4 percentage point lower than a  year earlier, while mean expectations had fallen about 3/4 percentage point. In  October, one-year-ahead mean expectations ticked down further.

Despite an  uptick in September, the PPI for capital goods is down 0.1 percent over the past year, compared with an increase of 1.2 percent over the previous twelve months. In  September, the capital goods index was pushed up  by a  jump in auto and truck prices. Although the PPI for cars and light trucks continued to decline on a  not seasonally adjusted basis, automakers had offered end-of-model-year incentives earlier than usual this year and discounting in September was not as deep as in some previous years. Elsewhere among capital goods, computer prices fell 2.2 percent further in September. Prices at earlier stages of processing also have been restrained. The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy was flat in September and has changed little over the past year. For core crude materials, prices dropped back in September, more than reversing the jump in  August. In  addition, the Journal of Commerce indexes and the KR-CRB industrial spot price measure have moved lower since the time of  the last Greenbook.

Over the intermeeting period, financial markets--especially equity markets--have been subject to  heightened volatility triggered by  instability in  Asia. The major stock indexes plummeted 6  percent to 7  percent on  October 27, but that was followed by  a  dramatic rebound the next day and by  further price gains since. Indeed, share prices are  down only a  few percent on  balance since the September 30 FOMC meeting. Stock prices of  banks exposed to the mounting problems in emerging market economies have underperformed the  broader market in  the past couple of  weeks.

The gyrations of  the stock market have affected other markets. Steep daily declines in stock prices were associated with rising Treasury bond prices, as investors took refuge in  this safer and more liquid market. A good portion of those increases have since been retraced, although news on  inflation, which has been good, and the economic woes of  emerging market economies have led market participants to rule out any prospect of a System tightening in the months ahead. Over the full intermeeting period, intermediateand long-term Treasury yields have fallen 10 to 15 basis points. (Treasury bill rates have risen several points on  net because of a rebound in issuance.) In  the general flight to safety late last month, quality spreads for corporate bonds widened somewhat; spreads on prime corporate securities rose a  few  basis points while those on junk bonds widened about 30  basis points. Still, most quality spreads are fairly tight by  historical standards.

Borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses remained brisk in  October. Gross bond offerings increased and bank C&amp;I loans grew rapidly, although slowing from the September pace. In the  household sector, incoming data for the third quarter suggest that funds raised in mortgage markets picked up a  bit while consumer credit extended the trend of gradual slowing that has been evident since the middle of last year. Net borrowing by  state and local governments increased, reflecting a  bulge in advance refundings in response to favorable rate movements. Measures of credit quality remained largely favorable in  the business and municipal government sectors, while the picture was more mixed for households. The outlook for credit card accounts has brightened a  bit, but storm clouds appear to  be forming in the subprime segment of  the home equity loan market.

Business Finance

With a  number of firms moving to lock in  attractive long-term interest rates, gross issuance of  bonds by nonfinancial corporations was substantial in September and October (table). Indeed, although issuance fell off in  the last week of  October amid the turmoil in the stock market, it  has picked up  again in recent days as  the markets have calmed. Merger-related financing boosted investmentgrade offerings over the intermeeting period, and junk issuance was robust as  well, accounting for almost half of total issuance (chart, bottom left). Firms rated B  or  below accounted for almost twothirds of  the junk issuance; active among them were oil drilling and exploration firms and telecommunications companies using proceeds for cable and wireless networks. Buttressed by robust demand from mutual funds, spreads in  the junk bond market had stayed near historical lows well into October, but they widened 25 to 30 basis points late in  the month.

Part of  the recent bond issuance was used to  pay down shortterm debt, although C&amp;I loans at banks continued to grow at a  fairly rapid clip. Bank respondents to the November Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated that they continued to ease terms on business loans in response to competitive pressures from bank and nonbank sources. Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding was  up slightly on  net in  October.

Public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations has been strong recently (table), led by technology-oriented firms (chart, bottom right). Initial public offerings were numerous and well received: The proportion of  firms with offering prices above filing prices was the highest in  more than a  year. Investor enthusiasm was also evident in first-day price changes that were the largest since the summer of last year. The wild swings in  stock prices on  October 27 and 28 caused issuers to put new offers on  hold for those two days, but issuance resumed quickly, accompanied by signs of only limited weakening in investor demand. At this point, it is  hard to determine to  what extent the near-term strength may reflect firms with completed registration statements rushing to  market in  fear of another large drop in  prices.

Meanwhile, announcements of  stock repurchase plans have continued at  a  record or near-record pace. The sharp drop in stock prices spurred a  number of companies to announce that they  would boost their repurchase programs, although the number of firms doing

so is far fewer than the hundreds that made such announcements after the crash in  October 1987. Sizable amounts of  equity have also been retired through mergers and acquisitions (chart, top left).

Recent data suggest that corporate credit quality, though currently quite solid, has weakened a  little in recent months. Moody's downgraded slightly more debt than it  upgraded in the third quarter, and its list of nonfinancial companies under review for a rating change suggests that a  further, though small, net lowering of ratings is  expected in  coming months. Still, upgrades exceed downgrades for the year (chart, top right). The rate of nonfinancial business failures is running higher than last year and is now at about the average annual rate of  the last decade. The largest failures have been in the retail, telecommunications, and waste-management sectors.

With about 90 percent of  third-quarter earnings reports now  in, growth in  earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 appears to  have accelerated to  a  12 percent pace on  a  four-quarter basis (chart, middle left). Despite mildly disappointing news from Intel, Sun Microsystems, and a  couple of other computer hardware manufacturers, earnings in  the third quarter once again largely met or exceeded analysts' recent projections. Analysts expect profit growth to continue at the current rate: The five-year earnings growth forecast of  analysts has trended upward since 1995 and stood in October at almost 13-1/2 percent (chart, middle right).

Stock prices, as noted, have declined 2  to 4  percent over the intermeeting period, a  move that leaves the major indexes still up more than 20 percent for the year. In recent weeks, even before the gyrations of  October 27 and 28, stocks of  multinationals and high-technology corporations had been whipsawed by concerns that future earnings might be reduced by  the dollar's strength and that currency devaluations in  Southeast Asian countries could weaken sales abroad. U.S. stock prices moved broadly lower on  October 23 and 24 in  the wake of the rout in  Hong Kong, then plummeted the following Monday, with the exchanges shutting down early after the

selling wave tripped a  market-closing circuit breaker. The  market proved quite resilient in subsequent days, however. On  Tuesday, prices made up  more than half the losses of  the day  before on record NYSE and NASDAQ volume, and they continued to gain ground on  heavy 2 volume over the next few days. The moderate net decline in stock prices since the last FOMC meeting has only slightly lowered the price-earnings ratio for the S&amp;P 500 (chart, lower panel).

Household Sector

Borrowing by  households in consumer credit markets stabilized in  the third quarter at  around a  4  percent annual rate of growth (table). Growth had ratcheted down from a  14 percent rate in 1994 and 1995 to  around 7  to 8  percent last year before easing to  its current moderate pace this spring. Revolving credit--primarily credit card debt--recovered with the pickup in  consumer spending in the third quarter to  a  9  percent pace from the unusually low 4 percent advance of  the second quarter.

Information on  home mortgage debt for the third quarter is still incomplete, although stepped-up issuance of  mortgage-backed securities and modest portfolio increases of  the governmentsponsored enterprises suggest some pickup from the sluggish pace of the second quarter. According to indexes compiled by  the Mortgage Bankers Association, mortgage applications were trending higher going into the quarter and have continued to advance (chart). In October, mortgage applications for home purchase were at the highest level recorded in  the eight years the series has existed. Applications for refinancing, although well below peak levels, have climbed noticeably in  the past few  weeks.

Home equity loans continue to  be the most rapidly growing segment of  the mortgage market, particularly the "B" and "C" quality subsector serving borrowers with past credit problems. Securitization of  home equity loans, a  primary avenue of  funding for subprime lenders, has outstripped credit card securitizations this year by  a  wide margin, although investors have become somewhat more

cautious lately in  light of some notable earnings disappointments at a  few subprime mortgage lenders. Providing some additional boost to the sector, Freddie Mac has recently announced its intention to begin purchasing B  and C mortgages.

Little new information on credit quality has emerged since the last Greenbook. However, some further signs of  improved payment performance on  credit cards are observable: Delinquency rates on securitized credit card receivables, as  measured by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, continued a  decline in  August and September that began in  February, and several of the  major bank-card issuers have noted improved collection experience in their third-quarter earnings reports. Perhaps because of  this better experience, the net fraction of  banks reporting tighter standards for credit cards on the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey narrowed to 20 percent in October. after being as high as 50 percent earlier this year.

In  contrast to  the generally improving situation of credit card issuers, some issuers of subprime home equity loans have begun to experience a  squeeze on  profits from underwriting assumptions about 3 credit and prepayment risk that were evidently too optimistic. Cityscape Financial Corp.. for instance, announced in late October that its third-quarter earnings would fall "materially below analysts' expectations," and warned that it could run out of  cash to meet obligations by the end of the first quarter of 1998. Aames Financial Corp.. one of  the largest subprime home equity lenders, had taken a  substantial charge against second-quarter earnings and in  August put itself up  for sale. Share prices of  the two companies

have been battered since the summer, with Aames losing about half its market value and Cityscape losing 90 percent.

The consolidation that has been taking place in  the credit card market intensified last month when the Bank of  New  York agreed to sell its $4  billion portfolio to Chase Manhattan, and Advanta Corp., after several months of  shopping its underperforming portfolio, arranged a  sale to  Fleet. In addition, AT&amp;T announced its intent to seek a  buyer for its $14 billion credit card business.

As of  June this year, the ten largest bank issuers of  credit cards controlled 63 percent of  all bank-card receivables, compared with the 48 percent share held by  the top ten in  June 1995. Striking as the trend is, the ongoing consolidation in  the industry is likely having little net effect on the availability of  credit. Some transfers might reduce credit supply while others tend to expand it. In  cases in  which a  troubled portfolio is acquired by  a lender with tighter underwriting standards than the seller's, the supply of credit might diminish. The sales by  Advanta and, to a lesser extent, the Bank of  New  York have been in response to high charge-off rates for their portfolios. But the more common impetus to consolidation, particularly in  the case of  the many smaller portfolios that have changed hands, has been the substantial economies of scale in  processing and customer service attributable to the industry's technological advances in recent years. In  these cases the transfer of  accounts to lenders that are more efficient, and often more aggressive, probably increases the availability of credit to some extent.

Government Finance

The Treasury is expected to fund about half its seasonal deficit in  the fourth quarter by  borrowing from the public and the remainder by  drawing down its cash balance. The midquarter refunding consists of  $14 billion of  three-year notes, $11 billion of  9-3/4-year notes (a  reopening of  a  previously issued note), and $10 billion of  thirty-year bonds. As anticipated, the Treasury will need to raise a  substantial amount of funds in  the bill sector, a dramatic turnaround from the past several months.

The net cash borrowing of government-sponsored enterprises has picked up some, with much of  the new  issuance denominated in  foreign currencies, as the GSEs continue efforts to tap global markets. To date, Fannie Mae has issued forty-five global bonds totaling about $24 billion.

Gross offerings of  long-term municipal debt increased in September, reflecting a  seasonal upturn in  new capital issuance and a  spate of refundings in response to the more attractive interest rate environment. The credit quality of  municipal debt continued to improve in  the third quarter. Standard &amp;  Poor's upgraded $54 billion of  municipal debt and downgraded less than $1  billion (chart). Its upgrade of  New  York State's general obligation bonds accounted for about a  third of  the total. Four state credit enhancement programs in  support of  school districts and other local issuers were also upgraded--those of  New  York, Minnesota, Colorado, and South Carolina.

Money and Bank Credit

The monetary aggregates decelerated a  bit further in  October, but to a  still-brisk pace that kept M2 at the top of  its annual range and M3  well above its range. M2 grew at a  4-3/4 percent pace last month after recording a  5-3/4 percent advance in  September. Growth of  M2 for the third quarter was close to  that of  nominal GDP, implying little change in its velocity. 4

The contours of  M3 growth have been similar to  its M2 component, growing at  a  7  percent rate in  October after posting a rate of  8-3/4 percent in September. The growth of the broader aggregate was bolstered by  the continued rapid expansion of institution-only mutual funds, which have been gaining market share in  the cash management business, but the growth of  large time deposits cooled from its torrid pace of  the past few  months.

Bank credit, adjusted for the effects of  mark-to-market accounting rules, grew at an  estimated 4-3/4 percent annual rate in October. Security holdings were flat while loan growth, at a  rate of 6  percent, was slightly faster than in September, buoyed by  a rebound in  the volatile security loan component. Business loans and the revolving home equity component of  real estate credit remained quite strong, though off some from September. Consumer loans contracted again in  October, reflecting the slower pace of  household borrowing in the aggregate and some further substitution toward home equity loans. Real estate lending, apart from home equity loans, was  weak.

Press reports on  corporate earnings for the third quarter indicate that bank holding companies once again posted healthy returns, which owed importantly to continued strong fee income. On a  finer reading, these reports contain little evidence that adverse performance of  credit card portfolios depressed earnings any  more than they had earlier this year. The three "monoline" credit card specialists (Advanta, MBNA, and Capitol One) all reported somewhat higher charge-off rates in  the quarter, but each of  them beat analysts' earnings expectations.

Mutual Funds

Investors redeemed shares from both domestic and international equity funds on  October 27, but these outflows were more than made up  by  heavy inflows on  the following day, according to confidential tabulations of  daily activity at large funds. 5 The run on international funds had carried over from the previous week when substantial sell-offs were rocking foreign stock markets, but these funds reportedly have shared in the subsequent inflows. For October as a  whole, net inflows to stock funds moderated some, but were only a  little below the third-quarter pace. The slowing was concentrated at the riskier growth-oriented funds; inflows to  international funds actually increased slightly for the month as a  whole, despite the late-October redemptions. Among the major types of  bond funds, high-yield funds posted record net inflows in  September but smaller ones in  October as the stock market turmoil led to some caution among investors.

APPENDIX

THE  NOVEMBER SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON BANK LENDING PRACTICES

The November 1997 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices (covering, for the most part, changes over the past three months) posed questions about bank lending standards and terms, loan demand by  businesses and households, collateralized loan obligations, the causes of  the recent rise in  measured spreads on  commercial and industrial loans, and the renegotiation of consumer loans on  concessionary terms. The responses suggest that domestic banks became even more accommodative lenders to businesses and that the tightening of standards on loans to households continued to  abate.

Increased competition for business credit apparently led large percentages of  the domestic respondents to  ease terms on commercial and industrial loans over the past three months, and a  small percentage of  them to ease lending standards. By  contrast, a  few of the  branches and agencies of foreign banks indicated that they had tightened lending standards and some loan terms. Demand for commercial and industrial loans and commercial real estate loans strengthened at  many of  the respondents.

Banks again reported tighter standards on consumer loans, but the percentage that tightened was lower than it  had been earlier in the year. Moreover, several banks expressed increased willingness to  make these loans. The respondents indicated that demand for consumer loans had softened somewhat.

Lending to  Businesses

A  small net percentage of  the domestic respondents--about 5  percent--reported easing standards for commercial and industrial loans to large and middle-market firms and to small businesses over the past three months (chart). About 40 percent, on  net, narrowed spreads of C&amp;I loan rates over their cost of  funds on loans to borrowers in  both size categories. Smaller percentages eased other terms, including the costs of  credit lines, the maximum size of credit lines, and loan covenants. Only a  couple of  banks eased collateralization requirements. The degree of  easing of  business loan standards reported in  the November survey is broadly similar to that found in  the other surveys this year, while the easing of  loan terms was somewhat more widespread in  November, especially for loans to small businesses. As in  the earlier surveys, those banks that eased pointed to increased competition from other banks and from nonbank lenders as the main reasons for the changes.

In contrast, the branches and agencies of foreign banks reported a  small net tightening of  standards and a  tightening of

1.  About 40 percent of  the survey responses were reported to the Reserve Banks on  or  before October 27, when the stock market fell sharply and risk spreads on  private securities widened. Moreover, even for those responses received after October 27, some respondents may  have decided on  their responses well in advance of  the time they were reported to  the Reserve Banks. Thus, a  larger share of  the responses may reflect loan market conditions before the stock market's decline.

some loan terms for commercial and industrial loans. Those respondents tightening standards or terms most frequently indicated that they were doing so because of  a  reduced tolerance for risk by their institutions While this reduced tolerance for risk might reflect the turbulence in  world financial markets last week, the less accommodative stance of  the foreign respondents is also consistent with the last two surveys. In  August and May, the foreign respondents were less likely than the domestic respondents to report easier terms or standards and more likely to report tighter ones. The  November responses are also consistent with the slower growth in  business loans at foreign branches and agencies than at large domestic banks since the second quarter.

The survey results suggest a  broad rise in the demand for commercial and industrial loans. Nearly 20 percent of  the domestic banks, on  net, reported stronger demand from large and middle-market borrowers, roughly the same as the fraction reporting a  pickup in demand by small businesses (chart). A  similar net percentage of  the foreign branches and agencies reported a  rise in  business loan demand. Respondents attributed the increased demand to greater customer financing needs for plant and equipment and also for mergers and acquisitions. In addition, some of  the foreign respondents pointed to  a  shift in demand from other sources of finance.

The survey results show mixed changes in commercial real estate loan standards, while demand for such loans picked up sharply. Less than 10 percent of  the domestic banks reported easier commercial real estate lending standards, and the foreign respondents posted a small net tightening. About a  third of  both the domestic and foreign respondents indicated that demand for commercial real estate loans had strengthened.

Lending to  Households

The November survey was the eighth in a  row to show a  net tightening of standards for consumer loans. However, the net percentage of  banks tightening was lower in  the  August and November surveys than earlier in  the year, suggesting that many banks have completed adjustments to  take account of the deterioration in  the performance of  these loans that occurred over the past three years. In  the latest survey, about 20 percent of  the respondents reported tighter standards for credit card applications and about 10 percent tighter standards for other consumer loans. Both percentages were little changed from the August survey. By contrast, these percentages peaked at nearly 50 percent and 25 percent, respectively, late last year.

Changes in consumer loan terms were mixed. While banks tightened credit limits and increased spreads on credit cards, a  few also reported reducing required minimum payments. On  other types of consumer loans, some banks increased maximum maturities and cut spreads. About 10 percent of  the banks, on net, said that their willingness to  make consumer installment loans had increased over the past three months, about the same as in  August (chart). Consumer loan demand was reportedly a  bit weaker on  net.

Banks reported a  very small net tightening of standards for approving applications for mortgage loans to purchase homes. About a  quarter of the respondents reported increased demand for these loans.

Collateralized Loan Obligations

Recently, several large banks have established programs under which they package and sell securities backed by  commercial and industrial loans. These securities are c  mmonly called collateralized loan obligations, or  CLOs. The  November survey asked the respondents about such programs. Four of the domestic banks and six of  the foreign branches and agencies reported having a program to sell collateralized loan obligations, and three domestic respondents and four foreign respondents indicated that they would have such a  program within a  year. Thus, more than a  tenth of the domestic respondents and nearly half of  the foreign respondents will likely have issued CLOs by  the end of next year. Moreover, nearly a third of  the domestic respondents and a  fifth of  the foreign respondents indicated that they were considering establishing a  CLO program. The respondents attributed the recent interest in  CLOs to a  desire by  banks to  deploy their capital efficiently by  moving relatively low risk loans off their balance sheets. They also noted that the continued development of the asset-backed security market has reduced the cost of  such programs and that, given current market interest rates, CLOs can reduce funding costs.

Although substantial, the total dollar volume of  business loans that the respondents intend to securitize over the coming year is fairly modest compared with the total amount of  business loans on banks' books. The seven domestic respondents that have or plan to have a  program each intend to securitize an  average of  about $2.2 billion of  commercial and industrial loans over the coming year, while the ten foreign respondents each intend to securitize an average of  $1.8 billion. Thus, in  sum, these respondents plan to securitize more than $30 billion of commercial and industrial loans, or about 4  percent of the more than $800 billion of  bank commercial and industrial loans.

Reasons for the Rise in  Measured Spreads on  Large Business Loans

According to the Federal Reserve's quarterly Survey of  Terms of Business Lending, spreads of rates on larger business loans (those of $1  million or  more) over market rates have widened over the past year. This result appears to be at odds with press reports and the results of  past Senior Loan Officer Surveys, which suggest that spreads have narrowed. The November survey asked the respondents what factors likely contributed to this divergence. They indicated that the rise in  measured spreads on  commercial and industrial loans found by  the Survey of  Terms of  Business Lending most likely occurred despite a  narrowing of spreads on  loans of a  given risk and reflected a  more-than-offsetting rise in  the average risk of  new loans. They attributed the rise in risk to  an increased demand for riskier credits, especially those for  mergers and acquisitions. In addition, some banks reported that they had decided to  accept increased risk in order to earn higher returns.

Concessionary Terms on  Household Debt Repayment Plans

In  recent years the number of  households contacting credit counseling services has increased substantially, as has the number of  households establishing debt repayment plans with their creditors

with the assistance of  such services. The  November survey asked banks about their willingness to agree to concessionary terms on consumer loans as a  part of  a  debt repayment plan. The responses showed a  widespread willingness to provide concessionary terms and an increase in  the use of  concessions in  recent years. Threequarters of  the respondents indicated that they were willing to agree to either "substantial" or "some" concessions (perhaps including reduced late fees, lower interest rates, or  longer repayment periods) as a  part of a  debt repayment plan. Less than 10 percent of  the respondents were completely unwilling to  make such concessions. Generally, the banks indicated that the fraction of their banks' consumer loan outstandings restructured on concessionary terms as a  part of  a  debt repayment plan was fairly small--either less than 1  percent or  between 1  percent and 3  percent of outstandings. About half the respondents indicated that this fraction had increased over the past three years. In  part, the rise may reflect a  greater willingness on  the part of  banks to  make concessions. Nearly half of  the banks were more willing to  make such concessions today than they were three years ago. Somewhat surprisingly, many of  the banks apparently restructure consumer loans on concessionary terms directly, rather than through a  credit counseling service. Only 20 percent of  the respondents indicated that debt repayment plans were arranged through a  service "in most cases," and about 15 percent reported that counseling services were "rarely or  never used." A  majority of  the respondents indicated that arrangements were "sometimes" made through a  counseling service.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. International Trade in Goods and  Services

In August, the eficit d in U.S. international de  n goods and tra i services dened, as  exports  os  less  han  imports.  In July/August wi r t combined, the  deficit was significantly  ger lar (at an annual  rate)  han t the  level  ecorded  n  the econd  quarter  nd somewhat larger  han he r i s a t t deficit in the  first quarter.  rade  data or  September  will  e released T f b on November  20.

<!-- missing-text -->

Exports of  goods and services were nearly unchanged in July/August relative to the second-quarter level, as increases in several categories (especially machinery) were offset by  large declines in exports of  gold, aircraft, and aircraft parts.

Imports of  goods and services grew 1-1/4 percent in July/August relative to the second-quarter level. The strongest gains were seen in imports of  automotive and aircraft products, although imports of computers, semiconductors, and industrial supplies also posted healthy increases. These increases were partly offset by  a  sharp decline in imported gold. (Gold exports and imports netted close to zero).

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  oil imported in the second quarter was sharply higher than in the first quarter and well above rates in 1996; imports also remained high in July/August. These relatively high import levels were driven by  extremely strong consumption in the

second and third quarters--up more than three percent compared to a year ago--and a  rebuilding of  oil stocks. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports remained strong in September due to continued high consumption demand and a  substantial increase in  stocks.

After rising 2-1/2 percent in  August, the price of  imported oil was nearly unchanged in  September. Delays in deliveries of Iraqi oil and disruptions of  shipments of  oil from Colombia contributed to the increase in prices during August and their continued strength in  September.

The WTI spot price rose $1.48 per  barrel in October, averaging $21.27 per barrel, due primarily to uncertainty regarding oil supplies from the Middle East. A  confrontation between the United States and Iran caused the spot price to spike above $23, and intensified fighting between Kurdish factions in northern Iraq and continued problems between Iraqi defense agencies and U.N. inspectors also contributed to firmer prices. Oil prices have recently been trading in the $20 to $21 per barrel range. Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in September. There were price declines in  most major import categories, while prices of imported foods resumed an  upward trend. For the third quarter, non-oil import prices continued to fall, but at  a  slightly slower rate than in  the first and second quarters. Declines were recorded in all major end-use categories, with the exception of  prices for non-oil industrial supplies and automotive products.

Prices of  exports decreased slightly in September, following a small increase in  August. The decline was attributable to lower prices for both agricultural and nonagricultural products (particularly to lower prices for semiconductors). On  average in the  third quarter, export prices decreased moderately. Prices of agricultural products declined sharply. Prices of  nonagricultural exports, however, fell only slightly, as decreases in  computer and semiconductor prices were partly offset by  price increases in  other major trade categories.

Trade prices for October will be released on November 19.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the last Greenbook, we  have received Treasury data on capital flows during August and data on foreign official holdings at the FRBNY through late October. In  August, private foreign purchases of  U.S. securities remained strong with demand shifting further toward Treasuries and agency bonds at  the expense of corporate bonds. Official holdings at  the FRBNY declined modestly in September and declined significantly in October.

Foreign official reserve holdings in  the United States rose by $11-1/2 billion in  August (line 1  of  the Summary of  U.S. International Transactions Table), reflecting increases by  OPEC and Mainland China. The increase by  China reverses about one-quarter of the reduction registered in  June when they shifted a  large portion of  their reserves to custodians outside of  the United States. In Latin America, further increases by  Argentina and Brazil were offset by a  reduction in  Mexican holdings associated with the retirement of some Brady bonds.

Official holdings at the FRBNY declined $2  billion in September as reductions in  holdings by  G-10 countries and Mainland China were partially offset by  further increases in OPEC holdings. In October, official reserves at the  FRBNY declined by another $17 billion. Developing economies in  Asia account for much of  this decline, reflecting efforts to resist pressures on  their currencies. Reserve holdings of  Argentina, Brazil, and OPEC members also registered significant declines.

Private foreign purchases of  U.S. securities remained very strong in  August (line 3). Purchases of  Treasuries (line 4a) bounced back from their relative lull in July to resume their heady pace of  the first two quarters. Nearly all of  the Treasury purchases in  August were attributable to UK  residents, providing little information about the residence of  the ultimate purchaser. Japanese residents on  net sold $1-1/2 billion worth of  Treasuries in August--the first month of  significant net sales since December of 1995.

Foreign purchases of  corporate and other bonds remained strong in  August (line 4b). More than half of  these net purchases ($7 billion) were U.S. government agency bonds. Japanese residents

purchased $3 billion of corporate and  other bonds, nearly all of which were agency bonds. Foreign purchases of U.S. equities (line 4c) slowed slightly in  August, but remained near the high pace of the second quarter, bringing total purchases for this year to $41 billion.

U.S. purchases of  foreign securities slowed slightly in  August (line 5) as  a sizable slowing in  bond purchases was only partly offset by a  pickup in equity purchases. The slowing in  bond purchases was widespread. The pickup in  equity purchases was concentrated in  Asia outside of  Japan.

Banks recorded sizable net capital outflows in  August (line 3) primarily through transactions with non-bank foreigners. We note that the bank flow data for July  have been revised significantly since the last Greenbook--from an  outflow of  $22 billion to  an inflow of  $21 billion. (Most of  this revision reflects the correction of  a  single bank's reporting error.) Since June, U.S. banks have, on  net, reduced their net liabilities to their affiliated foreign offices (line 1  of  the International Banking Data Table). Most of  this reduction occurred at the U.S. branches and agencies of  foreign banks, continuing a  trend started in early 1996. Since last February, these branches and agencies have been shifting the composition of  their managed liabilities-lowering the share of  borrowing from foreign affiliates and raising the share of large CDs.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Asset Markets

Equity prices around the globe have moved lower since the September 30  FOMC meeting. Foreign exchange market pressures that had emerged in southeast Asia in  July eventually spread to other Asian Pacific nations, prompting monetary authorities in  the region to raise interest rates to defend their currencies. The sharp downward reaction of local equity prices, particularly in Hong Kong, apparently fostered an increased degree of  uneasiness about possibly lofty equity valuations in  many other world markets, sending stock prices lower in  Europe and the Americas.

A view that U.S. equity market weakness might restrain the Federal Reserve from tightening in the near term, in conjunction with the October 9 increase of 30 basis points in the Bundesbank's RP rate, has prompted a  2  percent decline in  the dollar's foreign exchange value against the  mark since the September FOMC meeting. Changes in  market interest rate differentials are consistent with such a  shift in sentiment about relative policy stances. At  the short end of  the maturity spectrum, the German three-month interbank deposit rate has risen 30 basis points during the period, while the U.S. rate is little changed. At  the long end, the bond yield in Germany has firmed 5 basis points, relative to  a  comparable U.S. yield that has moved down 15 basis points.

Against the yen, the dollar has firmed about 1/2 percent. The yen has been depressed by expectations of sluggish growth in economic activity in Japan. The September Tankan survey, released in  October, was interpreted as showing still more pessimism about Japanese business prospects. Furthermore, the absence of any clear plans for fiscal stimulus in Japan and the competitive pressures exerted by the depreciations of southeast Asian currencies have continued to weigh on the yen. With the monetary policy stance on hold until economic activity becomes more self-sustaining, the three-month CD rate in Japan is little changed. The bellwether bond yield in  Japan ended the period down 25 basis points on balance to near its record low.

Whereas the multilaterally-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against the other G-10 currencies has declined about 11/2 percent during the intermeeting period, a  broader, U.S. importweighted average that includes also the dollar exchange rates of 10

developing economy currencies  has risen more than  1-1/2 percent. Among the currencies in the broader index, the dollar's biggest gains have  come against the Thai baht  (8-1/4 percent),  the Taiwan dollar  (7-1/2 percent),  the Korean won  (5-3/4 percent),  and the Mexican peso  (5-1/2 percent). The baht  came under  renewed pressure amid disappointment with the financial  reform package announced by the government and  some subsequent doubts that Thailand will be able to  deliver on the promised reforms. These pressures  spilled  over into  the market  for the Indonesian rupiah, which had been down more than  13  percent before recovering  substantially following the announcement that Indonesia had  reached an agreement with the IMF  on a 3-year  reform plan.

The Taiwan dollar moved  down following  an announcement on October 17  that Taiwanese authorities had decided to let  market forces determine the  exchange value of their currency. This decline appears to have triggered  the pressures on the Hong Kong dollar that arose during the period. Following actions  on October 23  by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to defend the peg of the Hong Kong currency to the U.S.  dollar, short-term interest  rates in  Hong Kong soared to  levels in the triple digits. The peg has held  so far,  and rates have  since come back down,  although at maturities beyond overnight they are still well above their precrisis levels. Pressures on Latin American currencies developed near the end  of the intermeeting period, and Brady bond  stripped yield  spreads  over U.S.  Treasuries for Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil shot  up 200  to  400 basis  points before retracing about half of these increases.

The price of  gold has  declined about 3-1/2  percent on balance during the intermeeting period. The price had dropped  further  to a 12-year  low, following  an announcement by a Swiss commission recommending that  the Swiss National Bank sell  1,400 metric tons of its  monetary gold  reserves  (about $14  billion equivalent). Swiss government  statements that  only about 800 tons might be  sold  led to a  partial  rebound  in the price  of gold.

Developments in Foreign Industrial  Countries

Available third-quarter data  indicate robust  growth in major industrial countries,  except  Japan. The Canadian and U.K. economies are continuing to  grow  rapidly, while  economic expansion is solidifying in Germany, France and  Italy. The Japanese economy has shown some  signs  of bounceback in the  third quarter from a particularly weak second  quarter, but serious concerns  remain about the  sustainability of the Japanese  recovery.

The quickening pace of growth has raised  concerns  about inflationary pressures  in some countries, but inflation  rates  remain low. In  September, consumer-price inflation  eased  a bit  in  Germany and  Canada after upticks during the  summer. Japanese inflation has moved higher due to  increased health insurance copayments,  but underlying Japanese inflation  remains subdued.

Individual  country notes. In Japan, economic  indicators suggest  some  improvement, following the  sharp drop in  domestic demand during the second quarter. There  is  evidence of a modest rebound  in  consumption:  household expenditures during the third quarter were up  2  /2  ercent  (SAAR),  and  September new car 1 p registrations increased  sharply. Industrial production, however, was  down slightly during the third quarter,  and housing starts registered large declines. The Bank of Japan's September Tankan survey suggested  that business sentiment has become more pessimistic. Relative to the June survey, diffusion indices across all  classes  of firms  fell  sharply and  forecasts  of profit  growth during FY1997 declined. Large manufacturers, however, were  somewhat more positive than other classes  of firms,  apparently reflecting their greater access  to  foreign markets, where Japanese exports  have been very competitive.

Twelve-month consumer-price inflation rose to  2.2 percent in September and 2.3 percent in October,  reflecting an increase in

copayments under reforms to the National Health Insurance System, but  underlying inflationary pressures continue to be subdued. The September unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.4 percent.

Japan's trade surplus declined slightly during the third quarter. Exports remained strong, but import volumes strengthened somewhat--another indication that consumption may  be starting to recover.

Economic activity in Germany appears to  have continued to advance at a  brisk pace in  the third quarter. Although industrial production declined in  August and September following a  sharp increase in  July, it  was up about 1 percent for the quarter as  a whole, and the September figure is expected to  be revised up. Meanwhile, forward-looking indicators are quite positive. Orders were up 2 percent in the July-August period relative to the second quarter, and the IFO business climate survey, an  indicator of current and expected conditions in  industry, rose significantly further in the third quarter. However, conditions in  the labor market remain stagnant, with the all-German unemployment rate rising to 11.8 percent in  October. CPI inflation rose over the summer but has fallen back recently.

In late October, the autumn forecast from Germany's six economic research institutes projected real GDP growth of  2.4 percent in  1997 and 2.8 percent in 1998 (on  an  annual average basis). The  institutes projected that inflation will remain modest, with the consumer price index rising less than 2  percent in 1997 and 1998. Despite the positive economic conditions, the institutes expect no significant improvement in labor market conditions, with unemployment remaining around current levels and an  unemployment rate of 11.5 percent on  average in 1998. The institutes predicted that Germany would register a  fiscal deficit of  3  percent of  GDP in 1997 and that monetary union would commence on  schedule in 1999 with a  broad group of  European countries participating. The institutes' forecast was conditioned on  an  additional small increase in shortterm interest rates before May 1998, with no further change later in the year.

In  France, economic activity appears to have expanded at  a robust pace in  the third quarter on continued strength in net exports and a  sharp increase in consumption. Industrial production surged in  July-August on a  broad-based increase in all categories of production, except energy. Business surveys attributed increased production primarily to foreign demand. Consumption of  manufactured

products rose 2  1/2  ercent p during the third quarter, likely reflecting a  4-percent hike in  the minimum wage and buoyant consumer confidence. Inflation pressures remained subdued as consumer prices in September were 1.3 percent above their year-earlier level.

In Italy, GDP rose a  revised 6.7 percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. The accelerated pace of growth was due, for the most part, to strong durable goods purchases and positive calendar effects (due to two more working days in  the quarter than usual). Private consumption and inventories rose, mostly in response to the passthrough effects of  the government's tax incentive scheme on  auto purchases. Business fixed investment and government expenditures remained flat, however, and net exports contributed negatively to growth.

Third-quarter indicators generally suggest further expansion. In July-August, industrial production rose relative to the second quarter. Consumer confidence reached its highest quarterly average since the first quarter of  1992, and business sentiment rose in July and August. Inflation remains low.

On  September 26, the government presented its 1998 budget proposal to parliament. The proposal includes a  total of  $15 billion equivalent in deficit cutting measures, with roughly $3 billion of  the planned reductions arising from lower welfare spending. On October 9, Prime Minister Romano Prodi resigned after the Communist Refoundation Party (CRP)--which adamantly opposes welfare cuts and on  which the coalition government relies to have

absolute control in the lower house of  parliament--temporarily withdrew its support.

On  October 16, President Scalfaro revoked the resignation of Prime Minister Romano Prodi, as the government reached a  deal with the CRP over the budget. The accord includes a  $290 million reduction in spending cuts (approximately ten  percent of  the planned cuts in the 1998 deficit) and the reduction of  the work week to 35 hours by  2001. The agreement restores Italy's prospects to be  an entry member of  EMU as it  virtually ensures the passage of  the 1998 budget through both houses of the parliament.

Economic activity in the United Kingdom continued at  a  robust pace in the third quarter, with the preliminary GDP estimate indicating real growth of  4  percent (SAAR), the same rate as in  the second quarter, Growth was strong in  both the service and production sectors. The average volume of  retail sales increased 1 percent in the third quarter. A  sharp drop in sales in September largely reflected special factors, including especially low sales during the week leading up to the funeral of  Princess Diana and unseasonably warm weather. There was also reduced consumer spending out of  building society windfalls in  September. The Office of National Statistics estimated that without the special factors, spending would have been little changed in September and would have risen about 1.6 percent in  the third quarter.

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.7 percent over the year to September, still somewhat above the government's inflation target of 2 percent for underlying inflation. Producer input prices continued to decline in the third quarter, reflecting the strength of sterling. Conditions in the labor market continued to tighten. The official claimant unemployment rate dropped further in September to 5.2 percent, the lowest rate since August 1980. The  unemployment rate derived from the  Labor Force Survey for the June-August period was 7.1 percent. Growth of  annual nominal earnings remains moderate; when earnings are adjusted for the impact of  bonuses, the rate of  growth in underlying earnings has been largely unchanged at slightly under 4 percent since early this year. However, this rate is up from the 3.75 percent rate in the first half of  last year.

On October 27, Chancellor of  the Exchequer Gordon Brown announced in  Parliament that "it is not in this country's interest to join in  the first wave of  EMU starting on 1st January 1999" and "barring some fundamental and unforeseen change in economic circumstances" a  decision to join within the life of  the current parliament "is not realistic." Chancellor Brown also stated that "if a  single currency works and is successful Britain should join it," and said that Britain should begin to prepare so a  decision can be  made to join a  successful single currency early in the next Parliament, due by  2002.

The Canadian economy showed signs of  continued strong growth in the third quarter. Monthly GDP at factor cost was 4  percent higher (at an  annual rate) in  the July/August period than its second quarter average. While August retail sales data and September employment data were a  bit weaker than expected in  the headline data, a  closer reading showed strength in both reports. Retail sales contracted 0.1 percent overall, but rose 0.7 percent excluding the volatile auto sector. Employment grew only 0.1 percent, but there was a  significant shift of  jobs from part-time to full-time.

August trade data provided another sign of  strong domestic demand, with the trade surplus shrinking due to rapid import growth.

The Canadian Finance Ministry issued its mid-year economic and fiscal update on  October 15. It  was announced that the 1996/97 federal budget was in  deficit by  only C$8.9 billion, well below the original target of  C$24.3 billion and  the most recent government estimate (in  May 1997) of  about C$16 billion. The government has projected fiscal balance by  in  the 1998/99 fiscal year, but it is on a  path to achieve balance before then. Although the government did not change its 1997/98 target of  a  C$14 billion deficit, monthly budget data show tax receipts running 10 percent above year-ago levels and spending 5  percent below year-ago levels, so  that the budget may  well be in surplus this fiscal year.

In  Greece, the "hard drachma" policy of  pegging to the ECU came under speculative attack in late October, forcing a  sharp rise in  Greek short-term interest rates. Under the ECU peg, Greece has seen a  decline of  inflation from 9  percent in 1995 to 4.9 percent in September 1997, a  25-year low, but the current account deficit has

widened from 2.5 percent of  GDP in 1995 to 3.7 percent in  1996 and has  widened further in  the first half of 1997.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

In the major Asian and Latin American countries growth has remained steady, and inflation to  date is low to  moderate. With the exception of  Thailand, the financial crises that erupted in Southeast Asia during the summer and have since spread have yet to yielc discernable indications of a  slowdown of  activity in the region. External balances in  most Latin American countries have deteriorated.

Southeast Asia's financial market crises have moved north to Northeast Asia and, to a  certain extent, have spilled over to other emerging markets as  well. Many of  the ASEAN currencies and some Latin American currencies have depreciated against the dollar or come under downward pressure. Policy responses to the currency turmoil have differed across countries.

Individual country notes. Thailand's prime minister announced that he  would resign on November 6,  after less than a  year in office. It  has been reported, but not yet officially confirmed, that the new  Prime Minister is opposition leader Chuan Leekpai. It is not clear how  long any  new prime minister might be  asked to serve; the Thai Parliament is scheduled to vote on election laws under a  new Constitution this week and an  election could be  held early next year.

The political instability has made it  difficult to  move forward with implementation of  the reforms envisaged under the country's IMF program. On  October 14, the government announced a financial reform package, the core elements of  which were to: (1) establish a  financial restructuring agency to supervise and restructure 58 finance companies, and set the terms of repayment for depositors and creditors of  those companies; (2)  establish an  asset management agency to act as a  "bad loans" bank; (3)  offer deposit insurance to the surviving finance companies and commercial banks; (4)  raise the cap on foreign equity participation in Thai financial institutions to allow majority control on a  case-by-case basis for a ten-year period; (5)  tighten loan classification rules starting December 1997; (6)  set conditions under which suspended finance companies will be  allowed to re-open--they must meet a  15 percent capital adequacy requirement, with an  independent audit by  an internationally recognized firm to verify that this requirement is

met; and (7) state that there would be  no discrimination between domestic and foreign creditors to suspended institutions.

The financial reform package won qualified support from the IMF but fell short of  market expectations. Market concern was due to the lack of  specifics about how much the package would cost, who would pay  for it, and  when it  would be  implemented. The government's ability to  meet its fiscal targets is also becoming doubtful, in part because the Thai cabinet rescinded an  oil tax  hike that was intended to raise a  substantial part of  the new revenues needed to meet fiscal targets under the IMF package.

Thailand's economic indicators are starting to show the impact of the financial crisis and the political turmoil. According to indicators released by  the  Bank of  Thailand, an  index of manufacturing activity declined at an  annual rate of 5  percent in August, with particularly sharp declines in interest-sensitive sectors such as  vehicles and transportation production. Private investment also slowed down, driven by  a  significant reduction of investment in  the construction sector.

On  November 1,  Indonesian authorities announced the elements of  an IMF-led assistance plan to be implemented over a  three-year period. There are four main elements of  the program. First, the program's exchange rate policy is  aimed at reversing some of  the rupiah's depreciation, or at least preventing its further depreciation, initially through partially sterilized intervention. Second, the plan calls for financial sector restructuring through bank closures and regulatory reforms. Third, the fiscal program aims for a  surplus this fiscal year (ending March 31, 1998) and next, primarily to  cover the current cost of  bank restructuring. Fourth, various structural measures, such as the elimination of  some monopolies and the gradual reduction of  import tariffs, are planned to improve the functioning of  the Indonesian economy.

Indonesia's reform package is backed by  financial support from numerous sources. IMF  Managing Director Camdessus stated that the "first line of  defense" is  a  package consisting of  loans from the IMF ($10 billion over three years), the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and "part of  Indonesia's own substantial external assets." The United States and other countries are providing contingent additional financial support that could be  made available

for a  temporary period, if  necessary to supplement the resources made available by  the IMF package. The  United States is  prepared to provide up to $3 billion in assistance from the Exchange Stabilization Fund.

On  the day  after the announcement of  the IMF package, the Finance Minister announced that the  government was closing 16 banks that "are insolvent to the point of  endangering business continuity, disturbing the overall banking system, and harming the interests of society." The government intends to reimburse depositors for up to 20  million rupiah ($5,555) per account, which covers over 90 percent of  depositors.

On November 3, the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the Bank of  Japan and Bank Indonesia intervened in  the Singapore forex market; the rupiah strengthened about 9  percent against the dollar following the concerted intervention. In  a statement confirming the operations, Singapore's Finance Minister said "the depreciation of the rupiah in recent months is  excessive. Today's joint intervention is  aimed at promoting a  strengthening of the rupiah to levels more consistent with the fundamentals of  the Indonesian economy." Japan's Finance Minister and Indonesia's Finance Ministry issued similar statements.

To add to the troubles in  the ASEAN region, smoke from forest fires--set on the Indonesian islands of Borneo and Sumatra to  clear land for crops--have continued to spread from Indonesia into other ASEAN countries, mingling with urban air pollution. The haze has affected economic activity as a  result of disruptions in transportation, loss of working days as people have fallen ill with respiratory ailments, and loss of  tourism revenues.

The Malaysian Finance Minister presented a  belt-tightening budget to allay market concerns about the rapid credit growth in  the economy and the burgeoning current account deficit. The  key measures are to: (1) defer several infrastructure projects; (2) raise import duties on  heavy construction equipment 5-10 percentage points; (3)  raise employers' Provident Fund contributions by  2 percentage points to 19 percent; and (4) cut corporate taxes two percentage points to 28 percent.

In the Philippines, the government has been attempting to follow an IMF program under difficult circumstances. Over the last

few  months the authorities have attempted to bolster the peso through direct intervention in  the spot market; forward transactions with commercial banks (in limited amounts); direct restrictions such as suspension of  nondeliverable forward contracts to nonresidents; and somewhat erratic attempts at tightening liquidity either by increasing official interest rates or raising reserve requirements. These measures have had limited success in preventing a  slide of  the peso. On  October 7, the Bankers Association introduced a  volatility band for the peso/dollar rate with the intent of  limiting movements in the exchange rate to 4  percent in either direction on any day.

An  important element of  the IMF program with the Philippines is passage of  a  comprehensive tax reform bill, which is currently languishing in  the legislature. According to  news reports, the IMF has urged the Philippine authorities to look for alternate sources of  revenue to offset possible losses if legislators dilute the proposed package.

In  Korea, industrial production in  August grew by  about 8-1/2 percent from year-earlier levels. Inflation remained moderate in September. Korea's trade surplus in  August was $0.1 billion, compared with a  deficit of  $2.9 billion in the same month last year; the current account deficit was $0.7 billion, compared with $3.5 billion a  year ago.

The health of  the Korean financial sector continues to be  a source of concern. The government announced a  plan for restructuring the financially strapped Kia Group. Meanwhile, the parade of  near-bankruptcies that started in February this year continued in  mid-October, with the country's largest computer parts maker facing serious cash flow problems; creditors have extended $12 million in  emergency loans to  the company and granted a  grace period for debt repayment. Sangyong Group, the country's sixth-largest conglomerate, is also said to  be  facing cash flow problems, which may  have motivated its recent decision to agree to sell a controlling share of  its paper company to Proctor &amp;  Gamble.

There has been substantial pressure on  the Korean won in the wake of  these domestic financial troubles and some spillover effects from the currency crisis in  the rest of  Asia. The won has depreciated about 8  percent since July 1  and by  nearly 15 percent since the start of  the year. Overnight interest rates are about 150

basis points above their July 1 level, whereas the yield on three-year corporate bonds, a  benchmark long-term interest rate, has edged up  by  over 100 basis points.

In Taiwan, industrial production grew strongly in  the third quarter, while consumer prices remained relatively flat. Strong import growth contributed to a  narrowing of  Taiwan's trade surplus in the first nine months of  1997, compared with the comparable period last year. Exports rose 5  percent over this period, while imports rose 10 percent. Import growth was particularly strong in the third quarter, rising 19 percent from the year-earlier period.

Following speculative pressure on  Taiwan's currency and a  23 percent decline in  the stock market since late August, authorities announced on  October 17 that they would no longer defend the Taiwanese dollar. Taiwan's currency depreciated about 6  percent against the U.S. dollar, bringing total depreciation of  the currency since July to  about 10 percent. At the end of  September, international reserves were $86 billion, down $2  billion from a

month earlier. According to press reports. Taiwan's central bank governor has indicated that reserves probably fell by  another $4-5 billion in  the first half of  October.

In  Hong Kong, GDP grew 6.1 percent in  the first quarter of 1997 (the latest period available) from a  year earlier, and the current account has been roughly in balance. Nevertheless,the spread between U.S. and Hong Kong interest rates widened by 1-2 percentage points beginning in  mid-July. In addition Hong Kong's stock market came under downward pressure in September. Following Taiwan's currency depreciation, speculative pressure mounted against the  Hong Kong dollar. After intervening to support the Hong Kong dollar for several days the  Hong Kong Monetary Authority countered exchange market pressure by  tightening liquidity conditions on October 23, when overnight interest rates temporarily reached more than 250 percent. Overnight rates soon came back down, but the spread between the U.S. notes and Hong Kong notes remained. As of November 4,  the Hang Seng stock market index was down 35 percent from its peak in  August, and down 20 percent for the year. The property component of  the Hang Seng fell even further to a  two-year low. Historically, the property component is  a  statistically significant predictor of  future property price movements.

On  October 30, Moody's downgraded its outlook for Hong Kong banks from stable to  negative, reflecting concern that higher interest rates and lower property prices would reduce bank profitability. As  of  June 1997, local property loans accounted for 43 percent of  the domestic loans of  Hong Kong banks and about 20 percent of total (domestic and foreign) loans of  those banks.

In  China, output growth has continued to  moderate in 1997, while inflation has remained low. For the first three quarters, GDP rose 9.0 percent from the year-earlier period. (For  the third quarter alone, Chinese statistical authorities report only that GDP grew "an estimated 8  percent" from the year-early period.) In the first nine months of 1997, surging exports led to  a  trade surplus of nearly $31 billion, compared with a  surplus of  $8  billion in the year-earlier period. The value of  exports rose 24 percent while the value of  imports rose 3  percent from the year-earlier period. Although no  details are available on  the components of  GDP, the

strength of  net exports, combined with moderating GDP, suggests a weakening of  domestic demand.

The People's Bank of  China cut interest rates on both loans and deposits in  October 1997. The one-year deposit rate, for example, which stood at 11 percent from the middle of  1993 through April 1996, currently stands at 5.7 percent.

So far, China has remained relatively unaffected by  the current financial crisis in  Asia. China's exchange rate has remained stable against the U.S. dollar, while foreign exchange reserves have risen steadily; through September, foreign exchange reserves were up $29 billion for the year, reaching a  level of $136 billion. China's currency is  not convertible on the capital account, making a  speculative attack difficult.

Mexico's economy apparently continued to grow strongly in  the third quarter. The unemployment rate declined to levels prevailing before the 1995 recession, while seasonally adjusted industrial production in July and August averaged 3.4 percent above its second quarter level. The rise in  the construction component of  the industrial production index was particularly marked, pointing to the increasing importance of  domestic demand in the recovery. Notwithstanding continued growth, monthly consumer price inflation remained subdued in July and August, while an  uptick in September reflected seasonal pressures associated with the new school year; inflation subsequently dropped in the first half of  October.

The trade balance moved into deficit in the third quarter for the  first time since the 1994 devaluation, reflecting both the growth of  domestic demand and the continued real appreciation of the

peso during that period. In  spite of  these developments, export growth remained strong, although it has slowed from earlier high rates.

Mexican financial markets experienced significant downward pressures following the sharp sell-offs in  the Hong Kong stock market and their spillover into other markets around the globe on October 27. Since October 22, Mexican stock prices have declined about 8  percent on  balance, the exchange rate has depreciated by about 6  percent to  8.2 pesos per dollar, and 28-day interest rates have climbed by  about 170 basis points to 18.95 percent at the most recent Treasury bill auction. Additionally, spreads on  Mexican Brady bonds, adjusted for collateral, have climbed about 130 basis points.

In  Argentina, output growth continues to be strong; industrial production rose 15.1 percent in  September over a  year ago, although partially this high number is a  result of  a  general strike in September 1996. Inflation remains non-existent. Strong imports of capital goods have led to a  trade deficit of  $0.8 billion over the period from January to  August, compared with a  surplus of  $1.8 billion over the same period a  year ago.

In  the Argentine congressional elections on  October 26 the Peronists party lost substantial ground and its majority in the lower house to the Alliance formed by  the two leading opposition parties. The balance of  power is now  in  the hands of  the small provincial parties. The Peronists still control the Senate, in which there were no elections this year. Alliance gains were expected due to voter concerns about high unemployment (currently over 16 percent) and corruption. The  Alliance has vowed to support the free-market reforms and currency convertibility and no shortterm changes in economic policies are expected.

The Argentine blue-chip Merval stock index fell by  roughly 25 percent over the period October 23-30. Since then, it  has recovered partially, closing on  November 3  at 16 percent below its value on October 23. International reserves (excluding gold) fell over 3 percent between October 24-28 and stood at $18 billion at the end of October, down 5  percent over a  month ago, but still up  about a  third over a  year ago. Overnight interbank lending rates were over 13 percent on  November 3  and have risen by  more than 3  percentage points over the past week. Argentine Brady spreads have increased by about 150 basis points since October 22. These developments have most likely been touched off  by  events in  Asia, rather than the increased uncertainty of  the economic outlook following the election results. So far, there is no evidence that these changes have put any pressure on  bank deposits.

In Brazil, indications are that economic activity moderated in the third quarter after real GDP surged by  a  whopping 14 percent at

an  annual rate in  the second quarter. Consumer prices changed little in September. Year-over-year, inflation in September was about 4  percent.

Brazil has been experiencing considerable financial turmoil over the past two weeks. Between October 21 and November 4, the Bovespa index fell by  about 25 percent on  balance. The spread between stripped yields on Brazilian Brady bonds and comparable U.S. Treasuries has risen by  nearly 200 basis points. The "real" has come under heavy downward pressure and the Central Bank of  Brazil sold, net of  repurchases, about $7  billion of its $62 billion in reserves between October 28 and 30. Only a  portion of  the amount sold has been sterilized, leading to a  liquidity squeeze that has sent the 30-day interbank rate from 21 percent to  29 percent on October 29. On  October 31, the central bank also raised its minimum discount rate from 21 to 43 percent.

In  another show of  support for the "real", on October 29 the central bank sold $1  billion in 7-month dollar-indexed bonds at a average rate of  9  percent. However, it canceled its planned auction of 2-year dollar-linked bonds. Since early 1997, the central bank has held several special auctions of dollar-indexed bonds during periods of  exchange rate turmoil.

Possibly fueling some of  the downward pressure on  the "real" is the perception that the currency is overvalued and that some realignment is thus needed to restore international competitiveness. The "real" has appreciated by  about 25 percent in real terms since

mid-1994, when the government began to limit the  extent to  which the currency would depreciate against the dollar to restrain inflationary pressures. The Cardoso government has announced that it  will devote more effort to enacting fiscal reforms that are necessary for long run fiscal and monetary stability, and is expected to  announce a  package of  austerity measures within the  next few days.

In Venezuela, there are indications that the recent pick-up in economic activity continues as evidenced by  a  fall of  about 1 percentage point in  the unemployment rate in the third quarter. The economy grew  by  4  percent in  the first half of  this year, with the non-oil sector growing by  2  percent and the oil sector by  roughly 9 percent. Inflation has been on  an  upward trend since about June this year, partly reflecting increases due to  public sector workers as a  result of  the recent labor reform. The increase in economic activity widened the non-oil trade deficit somewhat for January -July 1997, compared with the same period last year. As a  result of contagion effects from the Asian situation, the Caracas stock index has fallen about 10 percent since October 22.

In Russia, recent economic trends have been favorable. For the third quarter as a  whole, real GDP showed an  increase from its year-earlier level of  1  percent, while industrial production registered a  rise of  over 3  percent over the same period. This suggests at least some overall increase in  economic activity this year following sharp declines in recent years. The inflation rate

has continued to  moderate, with the 12-month increase in  consumer prices declining to  a  record low 14 percent in September.

Despite these favorable macroeconomic trends, at the end of October it was announced by  the IMF that the current quarterly disbursement under the Fund's EFF agreement with Russia was being withheld, due to a  continued substantial shortfall of  tax  revenues relative to target. Russian Finance Minister Chubais recently acknowledged that in  the first nine months of  this year actual tax collections had only been slightly over half of  the budgeted amount.

Negotiations between the government and the oppositioncontrolled Duma over the 1998 budget are continuing. At one point President Yeltsin seemed to indicate that the government would withdraw its proposal for a  new federal tax code--a key element in the government's fiscal reform measures--as part of  an  agreement to dissuade the Communist Party and other opposition groups from pursuing a  vote of  no-confidence in the government. However, subsequent statements by  other government officials suggest that the new  tax code remains a  priority and will not be  withdrawn.

On  October 6,  Russian officials and representatives of  the London Club of  commercial banks signed an  agreement to restructure over $30 billion of  debts owed by  the former Soviet Union to foreign bankers.

Russian financial markets have not entirely escaped the fallout from the recent turmoil in  emerging country financial markets. While the ruble exchange rate and domestic interest rates have remained relatively stable, stock prices (which had risen more

than in any  other major market this year) have fallen. The main Russian equity index dropped nearly 20  percent last Tuesday, and, although nearly three-quarters of  this decline was reversed the  next day, for the week as a  whole stock prices were down about 10 percent. (Equity markets in  Eastern European countries registered similar declines last week.)
