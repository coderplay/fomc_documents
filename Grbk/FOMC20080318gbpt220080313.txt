Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The economy appears to have stalled this quarter following a very weak fourth quarter. Labor market conditions deteriorated at the beginning of the year, with private payroll employment contracting in February for the third month in a row.  Residential construction activity has continued its steep descent.  Consumer spending looks to be about flat this quarter, as gains in household wealth and real income have diminished and sentiment has slumped.  Business spending generally also appears to have been sluggish around the turn of the year, while forward-looking indicators such as business sentiment have soured, and manufacturing output has faltered.  Meanwhile, the acceleration in prices since the middle of last year has continued, led by increases in food and energy prices.  Core inflation has also stepped up in recent months, although the twelve-month change in core prices in January remained slightly below what it was a year ago.

Labor Market Developments

Labor demand has deteriorated markedly in recent months.  In February, private payroll employment fell 101,000 following smaller job losses in the previous two months.  With the exception of nonbusiness services, the recent employment declines were widespread. Manufacturing payrolls decreased at an average rate of 41,000 per month so far this year, about twice the pace seen in the second half of last year.   Job losses in the temporary 1 help industry also steepened over this period, while employment in wholesale tradewhich often moves closely with the manufacturing sector-turned down.  Employment in the residential construction industry and related financial services industries continued to decline in early 2008.  The average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls moved down to 33.7 hours in January and held at that level in February.  Accordingly, aggregate weekly hours fell in January and edged down a bit further in February to a level 0.4 percent (not at an annual rate) below the fourth-quarter average.

Turning to the household survey, the unemployment rate has averaged 4.9 percent over the past three months, up from 4.5 percent in the first half of last year.  Most of the increase since that time is attributable to a rise in unemployed job losers.  The labor force participation rate moved down 0.2 percentage point in February, to 65.9 percent, and has changed little, on net, since last spring.

Most other indicators of labor demand have weakened of late.  In particular, the fourweek moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance climbed further to 359,000 for the week ending March 8, about 35,000 above the level that prevailed last fall; continuing claims for unemployment insurance also moved higher over this period. The most recent readings on net hiring plans from Manpower and the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB) point to a further slowdown in hiring, and the vacancy rate (job openings as a percent of private employment) in the Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLT) survey has moved lower in recent months.  In contrast, announcements of job cuts reported by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas have not shown the same deterioration as other indicators, and the rate of layoffs and discharges in the JOLT survey moved back down at the turn of the year after rising in the fall.

Measures of labor market tightness are also generally consistent with a softening in labor market conditions since late last year.  Unemployment expectations in the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey jumped in December and remained elevated through February, while respondents to the Conference Board survey reported that job availability continued to erode through last month.  After having moved down over the second half of last year, the fraction of firms reporting hard-to-fill positions has changed little in recent months, according to the NFIB.

The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  Over the four quarters of 2007, productivity increased 2.9 percent, up from 0.9 percent in 2006.   Over the past four years, 2 productivity growth has averaged 1.8 percent.

Industrial Production

The available indicators suggest that industrial production (IP) dropped back in February after having edged up in the previous two months.  Factory output appears to have slipped last month, and utilities output fell sharply after a weather-related rise in January. While weakness in the construction and motor vehicle sectors has restrained manufacturing output recently, robust exports have provided a partial buffer.  Capacity utilization in manufacturing stood at 81.5 percent in January, ¾ percentage point below the previous peak last July but still ½ percentage point above its 1972-2007 average.

The output of motor vehicles and parts moved down further early this year.  Total motor vehicle assemblies in January and February averaged an annual rate of 10.1 million units, down about 400,000 units from their pace in the fourth quarter of last year.  The automakers have been diligent in their efforts to keep production aligned with sales. Thus, despite the recent step-down in sales, days' supply of light vehicles in February remained near its historical average.  The latest production schedules, which do not incorporate the strike-related plant shutdowns at General Motors (GM),  call for 3 assemblies to edge up slightly in both March and the second quarter.  Elsewhere in transportation, commercial aircraft production continued to rise at the beginning of the year, as Boeing prepares for the launch of its new 787 Dreamliner.

Output in high-tech industries has increased moderately of late.  Semiconductor outputMPU and non-MPU chips-has slowed since the middle of last year, and domestic orders of printed circuit boards, a nonchip category of semiconductor IP, slumped further in January.  Strong consumer demand led to a jump in unit sales of personal computers (PC) in the fourth quarter, but sales of servers only edged up.  Elsewhere in high-tech, the output of communications equipment continued to post solid gains in January after a strong fourth quarter.

Forward-looking indicators suggest that high-tech output will continue to increase but at only a modest pace.  Intel's latest guidance for the current quarter points to little change in nominal revenue and is consistent with a moderate rise in real MPU production.  The International Data Corporation (IDC) projects that the pace of PC sales will slow this quarter, and recent anecdotal reports from large computer producers such as HewlettPackard and IBM indicate that domestic demand has decelerated noticeably.  Firstquarter earnings guidance from Cisco, a large producer of high-end data networking equipment, suggests that demand for this category of communications equipment softened appreciably since the turn of the year.

Outside of energy, transportation, and high-tech, production was little changed in the three months ending in January, and the available data suggest that output declined in February.  Among the major market groups, production of materials fell in January, as did production of construction supplies, which was 1.3 percent below its level a year earlier.  Supplies associated with residential construction were down more than 7 percent relative to their year-earlier level, while the production of supplies associated with nonresidential construction was little changed.  Elsewhere, consumer goods output declined for the fourth consecutive month in January, while business equipment production rose modestly.

Near-term indicators of manufacturing activity generally suggest that production will remain sluggish, at best, over the next few months.  In particular, the three-month moving average of real adjusted durable goods orders was flat in January, the Institute of Supply Management's (ISM) diffusion index of new orders stood below 50 for a third month in February, and the new orders indexes from regional surveys continued to decline, on balance.  On a more positive note, the staff's series on announced layoffs in the manufacturing sector has remained at a relatively low level the past several months.

Motor Vehicles

The average pace of light vehicle sales stepped down in January and February to an average annual rate of 15.3 million units, or 800,000 units below the fourth-quarter pace. .  The available indicators of vehicle demand suggest that sales will remain soft in the near term: Employment has fallen, real income gains have been weak, and the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey index of car-buying attitudes remained near its historic low in February. Through the first ten days of March, the pace of sales at Toyota, Honda, Nissan, and Mazda was about the same as last month, and our contacts at the major domestic firms are also projecting flat sales for March.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending has slowed in recent months.  Nominal sales in the retail control category, which excludes sales at auto dealers and building material and supply stores, moved down in February on sharply lower sales at gasoline stations and weakness at most types of establishments.  Factoring in our estimate of PCE prices, real spending in the retail control category of goods has now fallen at an average rate of 0.2 percent per month over the past three months.  As noted above, spending on motor vehicles has also sagged recently.  And, although real spending on services is reported to have increased solidly from November through January, part of this strength reflected a jump in outlays for energy services, which was likely transitory.  Moreover, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) lacks timely data on many categories of services consumption, and its estimates for these categories are often extrapolations of past trends that may not accurately reflect the recent pace of spending. 4

The slowing in consumer spending likely reflects the deterioration in its fundamental determinants and tighter credit conditions for some households.  House prices fell in the fourth quarter of 2007, and equity prices have declined appreciably since the start of this year; both developments point to a noticeable decline in the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income (DPI) this quarter.  In addition, real DPI was unchanged in the fourth quarter, held down by higher prices for food and imported oil, and was reported to have only edged up in January despite a temporary boost from the BEA's estimate of turn-of-the-year bonuses.  While interest rates on credit cards and auto loans have edged down recently, industry reports suggest that tighter standards in consumer

loan markets are limiting some households' access to credit, which may be constraining their spending.  Despite that credit tightening, the personal saving rate in January remained a shade below zero for the third straight month, as households are apparently adjusting only slowly to their reduced purchasing power.

Consumer sentiment, as measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan and Conference Board surveys, deteriorated sharply in February on heightened concerns about current economic conditions and the near-term outlook.  The index from the Reuters/Michigan survey now stands 20 points below its level in midsummer and is around the lows reached in the early 1990s.  About two-thirds of Reuters/Michigan survey respondents said they expect business conditions to be 'bad' next year, and about half said they expect an increase in unemployment.

Housing

The sharp contraction in residential construction has continued into 2008.  Single-family housing starts fell another 5 percent in January-similar to the average rate of decline in the second half of last year-to an annual rate of 743,000 units.  Adjusted single-family permit issuance-generally a useful indicator of current and future construction activity-also moved down in January and remained below starts.  Meanwhile, multifamily starts moved up in January from their unusually low reading in December but remained below the range that this series has occupied for the past ten years. However, recent multifamily permit issuance points to a return to the low end of this range in the near term.

Home sales also weakened further in the past few months.  The Census Bureau's estimate of new single-family home sales stepped down 3 percent in January following an average monthly decline of 4 percent in the fourth quarter.

.  In the market for existing homes, single-family sales edged up 0.5 percent in January after having moved down at an average rate of 1 percent per month in the fourth quarter.  In addition, the index of pending sales agreements-which tends to lead sales of existing singlefamily homes by one to two months-suggests that sales will be flat in February and March.

Because sales of new homes continued to fall sharply over the past six months, builders have made little progress in paring their bloated inventories.  Despite a 10 percent contraction in the inventory of new homes for sale over the six-month period ending in

Price of New Homes

<!-- missing-text -->

January, the months' supply of unsold new homes remained more than twice as high as the upper end of the fairly tight range that it had occupied between 1997 and the summer of 2005.

On balance, financing conditions have remained hostile to housing demand.  The supply of credit for nonprime and nonconforming loans continues to be extremely tight. Issuance of securities backed by nonprime mortgages (which include the subprime and alt-A categories) suggests that originations of these types of loans were quite rare in January and February.  Meanwhile, data from the Federal Housing Finance Board's Monthly Interest Rate Survey suggest that the share of jumbo loans in prime mortgage originations was about 4 percent in January, roughly half of its average share since early 2006.  Moreover, spreads between rates for jumbo and conforming thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages increased to around 100 basis points at the beginning of the year-about 75 basis points wider than the average spread between 2001 and mid-2007.   Interest rates 5 on prime conforming loans have also moved up recently, although they remain well below levels seen in the middle of last year.

Price declines for existing homes steepened in the fourth quarter of last year.  The purchase-only version of the repeat-sales price index calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) decreased at an annual rate of 5 percent in the fourth quarter after slipping at a 1½ percent pace in the third quarter.   The ten-city 6 version of the Case-Shiller repeat-sales price index-which includes houses financed by nonconforming loans and is more heavily concentrated in urban areas that had seen greater appreciation in earlier years-plunged at an annual rate of more than 20 percent in December after declining at a 15 percent pace over the preceding three months.  In the market for new homes, the constant-quality price index fell at an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the fourth quarter.  This decline in new home prices is consistent with

anecdotal evidence that many large homebuilders are resorting to price reductions, in addition to nonprice incentives, to bolster sales and unload inventory.

Equipment and Software

Real spending on equipment and software has decelerated in recent months as business conditions have deteriorated and financial markets have tightened.  We estimate that, in the fourth quarter, real equipment and software expenditures rose at a sluggish annual rate of 2 percent.  In January, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft stood above their fourth-quarter averages, but more-timely surveys of business sentiment have a darker cast.

The subpar rise in spending on equipment and software last quarter is broadly in line with that quarter's sharp deceleration in business output and the effect of higher interest rates on the user cost of capital.  Since then, business financing conditions have continued to worsen.  In particular, corporate bond yields have increased, and spreads over Treasury yields have widened.  Furthermore, recent surveys have shown a sharp deterioration in businesses' assessments of economic conditions.  After plunging in January, the Philadelphia Fed's index of business activity in the manufacturing sector edged down further in February, while a similar index from the Empire State manufacturing survey slumped last month.  In addition, the ISM manufacturing diffusion index, which had ticked up in January, fell back in February to about its low December value.

Real business outlays on transportation equipment fell in the fourth quarter; more recently, the data have been mixed.  A January increase in aircraft shipments and a stepdown in exports suggest that domestic spending on aircraft will increase this quarter. Meanwhile, sales of medium and heavy trucks (classes 4 through 8) have been flat for several months after reaching a four-year low last year; the recent strength in truck orders suggests that truck sales will firm over the next few months.  On the other side of the ledger, fleet sales of light motor vehicles declined, on balance, in January and February, with much of the weakness due to lower sales to daily rental firms; our contact at Chrysler reported that his firm plans to cut back noticeably on these types of sales in 2008.

Real spending on high-tech equipment and software rose at a solid annual rate of 13½ percent in the fourth quarter.  However, this vigor does not appear to have been maintained past year-end: Weak shipments, a steep decline in orders, and higher net exports in January point to only modest gains in domestic spending this quarter.  Also, as noted earlier, anecdotes from large PC producers indicate that some deceleration in the

pace of domestic demand for computers and peripherals is under way.  Moreover, Cisco is now reporting weaker demand for communications equipment, particularly in the retail and transportation sectors.

After having contracted at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the fourth quarter, real business investment in equipment other than high-tech and transportation appears likely to step down again in the current quarter.  While orders and shipments rose briskly in December and moved up further in January, most of the January increase in shipments was exported.  Imports of this broad category of equipment fell in both December and January, a sign that domestic demand remains subdued.

Nonresidential Construction

On the heels of robust gains during most of last year, nominal spending on nonresidential structures decelerated in December and posted an outright decline in January.  Although spending in this sector is quite volatile, the recent deceleration is consistent with mounting indications of slowing demand for nonresidential buildings and tightening credit conditions.  Vacancy rates in the retail sector continued to trend up in the fourth quarter, while increases in commercial property values have been slowing, even posting outright declines in some markets.  In addition, the three-month average of the architectural billings diffusion index-which is reasonably well correlated with construction spending six months hence-moved down, on net, in the second half of 2007.

This sector is likely also feeling the effects of financial turmoil.  The sharp contraction in issuance of commercial mortgage-backed securities in the fourth quarter of last year may signal a more general deterioration in financing conditions.  Indeed, nonresidential construction contractors have indicated that funding has become more difficult to obtain in recent months, especially for more speculative projects.   These responses are 7 consistent with results from the January Senior Loan Officer Survey, in which about 80 percent of domestic banks reported tightening lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the preceding three months.  Moreover, a marked increase in delinquency rates on nonresidential construction loans held by banks in the fourth quarter suggests that a growing share of builders are under financial strain.

The BEA reported that real expenditures on drilling and mining structures rose at an annual rate of 7 percent in the fourth quarter after unusually large increases in the second

and third quarters.   Data on drilling rigs in operation and on footage of new wells drilled 8 suggest that investment in the current quarter will rise at a pace close to that of the fourthquarter.

Business Inventories

Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of $12 billion in the fourth quarter, a rate of accumulation similar to that registered in the first three quarters of last year.  The pace of stockbuilding was modest enough to keep the inventory-sales ratio flat last quarter.  In the latest book-value data, the ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to sales remained at a relatively low level in January.

Data from the staff's flow-of-goods system indicate that the months' supply of inventories for the major industry and market groups excluding motor vehicles ticked up in January, but few indications of serious inventory imbalances are evident.  The months' supply for construction supplies and materials dipped in January but remains moderately above its trend.  Meanwhile, the ISM customers' inventories index stood at 49 in February, an indication that, on net, purchasing managers do not think their customers' stocks of inventories are elevated.

Federal Government Sector

Federal spending has stepped up in recent months.  Outlays in January and February, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, were almost 7 percent above the level recorded a year earlier.  Defense spending posted a 14 percent increase, and interest outlays rose about 10 percent, as high readings on inflation boosted interest accruals on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).  The strength in defense spending in January and February suggests that real defense purchases, as measured in the NIPAs, will pick up this quarter after having been essentially flat in the fourth quarter.

Receipts in January and February were a bit lower than in the comparable period last year, as robust inflows of non-withheld income and social insurance taxes were offset by a pickup in individual and corporate income tax refunds.  Our information on refunds paid to date suggests that the IRS is processing them at about the same pace as last year. Evidently, the IRS was able to respond quickly to the December enactment of alternative minimum tax (AMT) relief legislation and avoided refund delays.

Recent Federal Outlays and Receipts

(Billions of dollars except as noted)

Given the recent strength in outlays and weakness in receipts, the budget outlook has deteriorated.  The federal budget deficit, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions, was $134 billion in January and February, up considerably from the adjusted deficit of $92 billion recorded during this same period last year.

In February, Congress passed a stimulus package totaling $163 billion, which consisted of roughly $113 billion in tax rebates to households and $50 billion in bonus depreciation on business investment in 2008.  Rebates will range from $300 for low-income individuals to as much as $1,200 for middle-income and upper-middle-income couples, plus an additional $300 per child.  According to the Treasury Department, rebate payments will begin on May 1 and will be almost complete by the end of July.  The bonus depreciation provision allows firms to immediately depreciate an additional 50 percent of the cost of most new equipment placed in service during 2008.  This provision lowers tax revenues from businesses in 2008 and 2009 but raises tax revenues in later years as depreciation allowances are reduced. Consequently, the total cost of the provision through 2018 is about $7 billion.

The Administration released its proposed budget for fiscal 2009 on February 4.  In that document, the Administration forecasted a budget deficit of around $410 billion in both the current fiscal year, 2008, and in fiscal 2009; the forecast assumed the enactment of the President's proposals (which contained a somewhat smaller fiscal stimulus package than the one that was ultimately enacted).  The key near-term policy proposals include increased defense spending-mostly for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistanand a one-year extension of AMT relief.

State and Local Government Sector

The available data on the state and local sector suggest that real purchases will rise somewhat less in the first quarter than during the final quarter of 2007 because of weaker spending on construction.  Nominal outlays for state and local construction in January were 1 percent (not at an annual rate) below their fourth-quarter level.  In contrast, hiring appears to still be rising steadily:  State and local employment increased an average of 25,000 per month in January and February, about the same pace as in the fourth quarter.

The NIPA data show a noticeable deterioration in the budget balances of state and local governments over the second half of 2007, a result of rapidly increasing nominal expenditures coupled with a slowing in receipts.  Press reports suggest that state governments are responding to the weakening revenue environment through a variety of

measures aimed chiefly at fiscal 2009 budgets, including reducing the planned growth of expenditures, increasing taxes, and tapping into rainy-day funds.

Prices

Consumer prices have remained on a relatively steep upward trajectory in recent months. We estimate that total PCE prices rose 0.3 percent in January after a similar-sized increase in the previous month.   The twelve-month change in PCE prices through 9 January stood at 3¾ percent, boosted by surges in the prices of both food and energy. Excluding food and energy, the pace of PCE price increases has stepped up from the low rates posted last summer.  Although long-term inflation expectations appear to have increased since the fall, they remain broadly in the range seen in recent years.

We estimate that core PCE prices rose 0.2 percent in January for the fourth consecutive month.  The increase in core PCE prices of 2¼ percent over the twelve months ending in January is slightly smaller than the increase over the previous twelve months, but this twelve-month change masks an acceleration in prices since mid-2007:  Over the past six months, core PCE prices rose at an annual rate of 2¾ percent, significantly above the 1½ percent rate over the previous six months.  Prices of core goods, which had fallen through 2006 and most of 2007, have since reversed course.  The upturn has been led by prices for apparel and prescription drugs, which have risen sharply after large declines in early 2007.  Price increases in other goods categories also have picked up since late summer, as have price increases for both market and non-market consumer services.

After jumping substantially in the fall, PCE energy prices continued their upward climb in December and January.  Retail gasoline prices appear to have dropped back in February, as demand flattened and gasoline inventories surged.  But by the end of the month, sharp increases in crude oil prices were again pushing up gasoline prices.  Over the twelve months ending in January, consumer energy prices rose 23 percent-a striking turnaround from the decline registered over the previous twelve months.

After slowing late last year, PCE food and beverage inflation bounced back up to 0.6 percent in January; the gain left the twelve-month change in the PCE price index for food and beverages at 4¾ percent, considerably higher than the 2½ percent increase recorded in the previous twelve-month period.  In large part, the acceleration in food

prices reflects widespread increases in the prices of agricultural commodities.  Spot prices for corn, wheat, and soybeans moved up substantially last year and have continued their run-up so far this year:  Soybean prices have increased another 13 percent since the January Greenbook, corn prices are up 18 percent, and wheat prices have risen 28 percent.  The recent increase in wheat prices was especially pronounced because stocks-particularly for the spring wheat varieties used in pasta and related productsare currently quite lean.  More generally, the rise in grain prices over the past year likely reflects a combination of increased ethanol production, demand from emerging market countries, weather-related disruptions, and high input costs.  In contrast, spot prices of animal products, especially beef, pork, and dairy products, have turned down of late, as supplies have been expanding gradually in response to earlier high prices.

The high readings on overall consumer price inflation in the past six months appear to have contributed to a pickup in near-term inflation expectations; as for longer-term expectations, the weight of the evidence suggests that these expectations have also drifted up a touch recently.  As measured by the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey, median expectations for year-ahead inflation moved up from 3.1 percent in October to 3.6 percent in February, with half of this change coming since the January Greenbook. Regarding longer-term expectations, increases in the Reuters/Michigan measure of median inflation expectations over the next five to ten years have amounted to only twotenths since October, with no change since late January; the February reading of 3.0 percent was close to its average level over the past couple of years.  According to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, expected inflation over the next ten years has edged up recently with both the CPI- and PCE-based expectations rising one-tenth, although this uptick just reversed the downtick a year earlier.  Inflation compensation derived from TIPS has moved up more noticeably of late.  Five-year inflation compensation has risen 0.3 percentage point since the January Greenbook after having declined from the fall until late January.  The five-year, five-year-ahead measure has also moved up 0.3 percentage point since the January Greenbook and is 0.4 percentage point higher than it was in the fall.

Strong global demand and higher prices for energy and other commodities have contributed to continued price pressures at earlier stages of processing of late.  The producer price index for core intermediate materials rose ¾ percent in January after a cumulative increase of 1 percent over the previous two months.  Prices for energyintensive products, such as plastics and agricultural and industrial chemicals, have increased sharply over the past few months, but these gains have been offset, to some extent, by a downturn in prices for lumber, plywood, and gypsum.  On balance, the index

for core intermediate materials increased 4 percent over the twelve months ending in January, about ½ percentage point more than in the preceding year.

Commodity prices have risen significantly since the January Greenbook.  The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials and the Commodity Research Bureau spot index of industrial materials have both jumped 8¼ percent since mid-January.  Over the past year, these indexes increased at a slightly faster pace than the 15 percent average annual increase registered since the current surge in commodity prices began in mid-2002.

Labor Costs

Labor costs have continued to increase at a moderate rate, with little sign, as yet, of higher price inflation passing through to higher compensation.  The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private-industry workers rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent over the three months ending in December.  The twelve-month change was 3.0 percent, about equal to its average pace over the previous couple of years.  Wages and salaries rose at a 3.1 percent rate for the third quarter in a row, while benefits costs accelerated slightly to a 3.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.  However, the twelvemonth change in benefits costs remains below the change in the previous year because of a significant decline in retirement and savings costs in early 2007.

Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the fourth quarter and was up 4 percent for 2007 as a whole. 10 This four-quarter change is a step down from the 5 percent rate posted in 2006, which was boosted by the timing of large bonus payments.  Bonus payments appear to have been smaller this bonus season-though recent reports suggest that these payments may not have been as small as early reports had indicated. 11 After falling for the previous two quarters, unit labor costs are estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  For 2007 as a whole, unit labor costs increased 1.0 percent, significantly below the substantial rise observed in 2006.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Concerns about the economic outlook and the exposure of financial institutions to further losses weighed on financial markets over the intermeeting period.  Late in the period, significant strains resurfaced in short-term funding markets, prompting the Federal Reserve to take several steps to increase liquidity.  On net, investors marked down the expected path for monetary policy substantially.  Two-year nominal yields declined markedly, while ten-year nominal yields fell less, thereby leaving the yield curve noticeably steeper.  Amid higher-than-expected inflation readings and notable increases in oil prices, TIPS-based inflation compensation rose across the term structure.  Broad equity market indexes declined, and corporate bond spreads widened to multiyear highs. Indicators of household credit quality showed further deterioration, particularly for nonprime mortgages.  According to Call Report data, commercial bank profits in the fourth quarter of 2007 were at their lowest level since the early 1990s, in part because of a sharp increase in loan-loss provisioning.

Money Market Functioning

Conditions in some short-term funding markets deteriorated over the intermeeting period.

Spreads of Libor and term federal funds rates over those on comparable-maturity overnight index swaps (OIS) jumped in late February amid renewed funding pressures. The spread on lower-rated nonfinancial unsecured commercial paper also widened, on net, and asset-backed commercial paper outstanding contracted a bit.   In addition, 1 dealers reported that liquidity conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated because of concerns about the health of some financial institutions that provide liquidity and credit support to the market.  Starting in mid-February, repurchase agreements backed by agency and private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) also came under significant pressure, with reports of larger 'haircuts' being applied by lenders and news of market participants missing margin calls on positions.

Consistent with a step-up in funding pressures, auctions through the Term Auction Facility (TAF) during the intermeeting period drew more demand than those immediately following the turn of the year.  On March 7, the Federal Reserve announced that it would increase the size of TAF auctions in March from $30 billion to $50 billion, which will result in $100 billion of TAF credit outstanding, and that it would begin a series of

twenty-eight-day, single-tranche, term repurchase agreements that are expected to cumulate to $100 billion.  The first larger TAF auction held on March 10 generated strong demand.  On March 11, the Federal Reserve announced an increase in the sizes of its swap lines with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, and those central banks announced that they would draw on those lines to provide dollar funding as long as necessary.  In addition, the Federal Reserve announced a new term securities lending facility that will allow primary dealers to borrow as much as $200 billion of Treasury securities from the portfolio of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) for a term of twenty-eight days, collateralized by agency debt, agency-backed MBS, and AAA-rated private-label MBS.  Following these announcements, Libor-OIS spreads and spreads in markets for agency-guaranteed MBS over comparable maturity Treasury securities narrowed somewhat.

Yields on three-month Treasury bills dropped over the intermeeting period, mostly because of downward revisions to policy expectations, but some safe-haven demands may have also pressured yields lower, as the spread below comparable-maturity OIS widened somewhat in recent weeks, albeit to not to the levels observed last August. Liquidity in the bill market was strained at some points during the intermeeting period, but has reportedly improved amid increased issuance, particularly at the shortest maturities.  The heightened demand for Treasury debt continued to be reflected in periodic downward spikes in the overnight repurchase agreement rate for general Treasury collateral.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

The Committee's decision to lower the target federal funds rate 50 basis points at the January meeting elicited a modest general reaction in financial markets, but near-term futures rates declined a few basis points, as investors had apparently placed some odds on a smaller easing.  The expected path of monetary policy over the next two years subsequently shifted down substantially, on net, as market perceptions of deterioration in the economic outlook and increasing concerns about the financial sector apparently outweighed higher-than-expected incoming readings on inflation and soaring energy prices.  The release of the January FOMC meeting minutes produced little market reaction.

Federal funds futures and options indicate that investors are now virtually certain of at least 50 basis points of easing at the March FOMC meeting.  Further ahead, Eurodollar futures quotes suggest that investors expect the federal funds rate to fall to around 1.75

percent over the next half-year, and to remain at that level until early 2009.  Implied uncertainty around the near-term policy path has fallen a touch since the January FOMC meeting and remains higher than before the onset of the financial market turmoil.

Consistent with the downward revision to policy expectations, two-year nominal Treasury yields fell markedly; ten-year yields declined less, leaving the yield curve noticeably steeper.  Judging from TIPS yields, the change in the slope of the nominal yield curve largely reflected a steepening in the term structure of real yields.  Inflation compensation rose across the term structure, likely prompted by higher-than-expected inflation data, climbing oil prices, dollar depreciation, and, perhaps, perceptions that the FOMC is especially focused on downside risks to growth.  Survey measures of inflation expectations also suggest higher expected inflation as well as greater inflation uncertainty.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock price indexes decreased about 4 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period.   Stocks tumbled on negative economic news as well as concerns about the 2 financial guarantors and the portfolios of financial intermediaries, but recovered some of their losses on the day that the Federal Reserve announced the new term securities lending program.  The Dow Jones index of financial sector stocks was especially volatile and substantially underperformed the broader market, but the indexes for the energy and basic materials sectors rose somewhat on the surge in oil and other commodity prices. The spread between the twelve-month-forward trend earnings-to-price ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premiumwas little changed at the upper end of its range over the past two decades.  Optionimplied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index remained on the high side of the average for the past several months.

Yields on BBB-rated and high-yield corporate bonds increased over the intermeeting period, despite the decline in Treasury yields, pushing their spreads to the highest levels since 2002.  Near-term forward spreads are particularly wide, suggesting greater concern among investors about the outlook for corporate credit quality over the next few years. Spreads on corporate bonds rated A and AA increased to their highest levels in over a decade, likely a reflection of the high proportion of financial firms with these ratings.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With fourth-quarter earnings reports nearly complete, operating earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 firms are estimated to have plunged more than 25 percent from year-earlier levels; huge write-downs by financial firms led to a large decline in that sector's earnings.  In contrast, earnings per share for nonfinancial firms increased 13 percent on a year-over-year basis, and reports from most nonfinancial S&amp;P 500 firms met or exceeded forecasts.  Looking forward, year-ahead earnings for both financial and nonfinancial S&amp;P 500 firms were marked down significantly in January and February.

Data on nonfinancial corporate balance sheets for the fourth quarter of 2007 suggest that corporate credit quality is holding up.  The aggregate ratio of liquid assets to total assets remained high by historical standards, and the aggregate leverage ratio stayed low.  The delinquency rate on C&amp;I loans ticked up again in the fourth quarter but remained low.  In January, ratings changes for corporate bonds were sparse, and the realized six-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds continued to hover near zero.  However, a forward-looking measure of credit quality, the KMV forecast of the aggregate year-ahead default rate, jumped in January.

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms was solid in January and February, but nearly all the issues were rated investment grade.  Outstanding nonfinancial commercial paper also expanded at a moderate pace, while growth in C&amp;I loans stalled in February after a gain in January.  Aggregating across bonds, commercial paper, and C&amp;I loans, net debt financing expanded at a modest pace over the past two months.

Net equity issuance was deeply negative in the fourth quarter (the most recently available data), as public and private equity issuance was dwarfed by equity retirements. Retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions set a new record, largely because of the completion of a number of blockbuster leveraged buyouts.  In 2008, the pace of merger completions has slowed, and very few large deals have been announced. Repurchases remained strong in the fourth quarter, but the pace at which new programs (from nonfinancial firms) have been announced has moderated a bit this year.

In January and February, gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was sluggish, with IPO activity particularly sparse in the face of lower and more volatile equity prices. Financial issuance was sizable, reflecting several large offerings of preferred shares from major financial institutions.

Commercial Real Estate

Conditions in commercial real estate credit markets have remained somewhat tight. Commercial mortgage debt growth moderated a bit further in the fourth quarter.  Sales of commercial real estate dropped back sharply in January and February after hovering in an extremely high range in 2007.  Spreads of yields on AAA-rated and BBB-rated commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities soared further over the intermeeting period amid continued concerns about high leverage on recently securitized mortgages and investor distrust of structured financial products in general.  Issuance of CMBS has been scant thus far this quarter.

Fundamentals for existing commercial properties remained solid, on balance, in the fourth quarter, with little change in the vacancy rate and growth in commercial rents staying fairly high.  Delinquency rates on CMBS and on commercial real estate loans held at life insurance companies were low in the fourth quarter.  However, delinquencies on commercial real estate loans held by commercial banks rose further on continued deterioration in the performance of loans funding commercial and residential development projects.

Household Finance

Residential mortgage debt decelerated further in the fourth quarter.  Loan performance continued to deteriorate; delinquency rates on subprime mortgages climbed steeply further, and delinquency rates on prime mortgages reached multiyear highs.

Credit default swap (CDS) premiums for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac increased to historical highs in the early months of 2008, likely reflecting continued concerns about mortgage credit quality and, relatedly, these firms' announcements of substantial fourthquarter losses.   A heightened supply of agency-guaranteed MBS and higher required 3 compensation for prepayment risk have pushed up spreads over Treasury yields in this market over the past several months.  In addition, in early March, diminished liquidity in the agency MBS market boosted spreads even further.  Spreads peaked on March 6 and have since fallen back a bit.  The increase in secondary market spreads, along with increased guarantee fees charged by the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), pushed up interest rates in the primary market for conforming mortgages.

agency-guaranteed MBS, supported by an elevated pace of refinancing in late January and early February, was robust through mid-March.

Conditions in the nonprime and prime jumbo mortgage markets remain very tight, with issuance of private residential MBS scant in January and drying up in February.  The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008, signed into law in mid-February, included a temporary increase in the size of mortgages in certain high-price areas that can be securitized by the GSEs.  The GSEs announced that the newly conforming loans would be subject to an additional 25 basis point guarantee fee and more stringent underwriting guidelines than standard conforming loans, including lower maximum loan-to-value ratios and higher minimum credit scores.  Rates quoted by lenders on jumbo mortgages have been quite volatile in recent weeks as originators have scrambled to redesign loan programs.

Most delinquency rates on consumer loans have continued to move up and now stand near or above their historical averages.  Consumer credit expanded at a moderate pace in January, with issuance of consumer auto, credit card, and student loan asset-backed securities (ABS) remaining solid through that month.  However, issuance in all three categories declined somewhat in February.  In the secondary market for student loans, investors have considerably reduced their participation owing to concerns about complex securities and reduced federal government support of public and private entities providing government-guaranteed loans.   Spreads on consumer loan ABS have risen 4 notably further in recent weeks, although the available data suggest that retail interest rates on credit card and auto loans have not changed much.

In the fourth quarter, OFHEO's purchase-only index of national home prices dropped at an annual rate of 5 percent, the largest decrease since the start of the series in 1991. Futures quotes indicate that over the intermeeting period market participants sharply marked down the expected path of house prices.  Given declines in housing and stock prices, the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income fell in the fourth quarter.

Long-term mutual funds, which in January experienced net outflows due to heavy redemptions of equity funds, recovered these losses with sizable inflows in February. Money market mutual funds experienced net inflows at the highest pace on record in

nominal terms this year through early March, a surge prompted in part by investors' shift toward relatively safe assets.

Treasury Finance

The five- and ten-year securities auctioned at the Treasury's midquarter refunding in February were received well, but demand in the auctions for two-year notes and thirty-year bonds was below average.  Measures of foreign demand for Treasury securities were somewhat mixed, with indirect bidding at the auctions down a bit further but custody holdings of Treasury securities at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York up modestly.  The Treasury noted that it expects to increase bill issuance, and possibly nominal coupon issuance, in the coming months to address its projected increase in borrowing needs.

Liquidity in the market for Treasury coupon securities has remained somewhat impaired. Bid-ask spreads have stayed higher than they were before the onset of financial turmoil last year, and the on-the-run premium for the ten-year note rose in February to its highest level since 2002.  Borrowing of Treasury securities in the SOMA Securities Lending Program stayed near record levels.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed in January and February.  Although a moderation is typical early in the year, issuance was also likely damped by the troubles facing financial guarantors.  Historically, these guarantors have insured about half of all municipal bonds; this share has declined recently.  Issuance of short-term bonds has been light as of late, an indication that most state and local governments are not experiencing substantial near-term funding pressures.

Relatively few municipal bonds saw ratings changes in February after a spike in downgrades in January associated with a major financial guarantor being downgraded from AAA to AA, which lowered the ratings on most of the bonds it insured.  The likelihood of an even larger wave of municipal bond downgrades was reduced when Standard &amp; Poor's confirmed AAA ratings in late February on the two largest bond insurers.

Even so, yields on long-term municipal bonds have jumped in recent weeks, reportedly reflecting some reluctance of dealers to provide liquidity and an unusually large volume of sales from leveraged investors.  As a result, the ratio of municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasuries has shot up, reaching record levels.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 expanded at an annual rate of 17 percent in February.  Retail money funds extended their blistering advance, likely reflecting continued safe haven demands.  Following a slight boost in January from tax-related flows, liquid deposits accelerated markedly in February as the drop in market rates resulting from the monetary policy easing trimmed their opportunity cost.

Growth of commercial bank credit moderated in January and February.  C&amp;I loans decelerated markedly from their torrid fourth-quarter pace, mainly at large banks. Growth of these loans was likely damped by a reduction in merger and acquisition activity, weak business spending, and fewer previously committed loan deals coming onto banks' books.  The February Survey of Terms of Business Lending suggests that spreads of C&amp;I loan rates over banks' cost of funds rose in the current quarter. Commercial real estate loans advanced relatively briskly again over the first two months of the year, and loans secured by residential real estate continued to expand modestly. Consumer loan growth stayed moderate.

According to the fourth-quarter Call Reports, commercial bank profits plunged last quarter.  The decline was concentrated at large banks and was driven in part by a jump in provisioning for loan losses.  The delinquency rate on all loans and leases increased to a level only a little below its recent peak in 2002.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $58.2 billion in January after narrowing to $57.9 billion in December.  Exports rose sharply in both months, while imports dipped in December before recovering in January.

<!-- missing-text -->

In January, the value of exported goods and services increased 1.6 percent, following a similar increase in December.  The January gain reflected higher exports of both goods and services.  Within goods, exports of agricultural products and consumer goods exhibited robust growth, while exports of industrial supplies increased at a more moderate pace.  In contrast, exports of capital goods fell sharply, led by a decline in exports of aircraft, and exports of automotive products were flat.

The value of exports in the fourth quarter rose by 12.6 percent (a.r.), helped by robust growth in December.  Exports of services increased strongly in the quarter.  The quarterly increase was also supported by strong gains in exports of industrial supplies and capital goods, which more than offset a fall in exports of automobiles and consumer goods. According to the Preliminary NIPA release, real exports of goods and service increased at an annual rate of 4.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  This number is likely to be revised up somewhat when recent revisions to the trade data are incorporated.

The value of imported goods and services rose 1.3 percent in January, reversing a similarly sized decline in December.  Imports in January were importantly boosted by a large increase in the value of oil imports, reflecting both an increase in price and a jump in volumes.  Non-oil imports recorded a steep decline, with imports of consumer goods falling the most. Imports of industrial supplies and capital goods also fell back slightly, whereas imports of services, foods, and automobiles all showed moderate gains.

In the fourth quarter the value of imported goods and services increased 12.6 percent (a.r.), despite December's sharp decline.  A large increase in the value of imported oil resulting from higher oil prices significantly boosted import growth in the quarter. Services imports also exhibited strong growth, while imports of non-oil goods fell back. Imports of non-oil industrial supplies and automotive products declined sharply in the quarter.  In contrast, imports of consumer goods exhibited strong growth, while imports of capital goods increased slightly.  As reported in the Preliminary NIPA release, real imports of goods and services declined at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  As with exports, this figure will likely be revised up, reflecting recent data revisions.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In the first two months of 2008, core import prices rose sharply, boosting their average level 7¼ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter level.  Most of this increase was due to higher prices for material-intensive goods, which were up nearly 17 percent.  Prices for nonfuel industrial supplies rose 17¼ percent, largely reflecting sharply higher prices for imported chemicals.  For imported food, the average level of prices in the first two months was 15½ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter average. Over the same period, prices for finished goods increased 3 percent, with prices for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors, consumer goods, and automotive products all rising at about that pace.

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil rose 4.8 percent in January, and then fell 1.5 percent in February.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged $92.95 per barrel in January.  Since then, however, the spot price of WTI has surged, rising 20 percent to $109.92 per barrel as of March 12.  The price of futures for delivery at the end of 2016 has also risen considerably, closing at $102.91 per barrel on March 12, about $15 higher than at the time of the January Greenbook.  The higher price of oil likely owes to a confluence of factors, including increased geopolitical risk, potentially stronger demand, and the recent fall in the value of the dollar.

Exports. The average level of core export prices in the first two months of 2008 was 11¼ percent (a.r.) above the fourth-quarter level, as prices of material-intensive goods soared 21 percent and prices of finished goods rose 3 percent.  The large increase in material-intensive goods reflected a 44½ percent increase in prices for agricultural exports combined with a 14 percent increase in prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies.  Prices for agricultural exports have risen briskly so far this year because of higher prices for wheat, corn, and soybeans, which all have recently reached record highs.  Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies are up, mostly because of higher prices for chemicals, fuels, and metals.  Within finished goods, the category with the largest increase was capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors, which rose 3¾ percent.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the last Greenbook, we have received data on U.S. international financial transactions for December and January.  The unusually weak foreign official inflows during the third quarter of 2007 (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Financial Transactions Table) were followed by record inflows during the fourth quarter, and for the year as a whole, foreign official inflows were nearly as strong as in 2006.

.  Official net purchases of U.S.

Treasuries accounted for only a little over 10 percent of total official inflows in 2007, down sharply from 2006, with most of the acquisitions focused on agency securities, corporate bonds, and stocks.  In January 2008, foreign official flows registered a record monthly inflow of $101 billion, with strong inflows in all types of U.S. securities.  In both December and January, sizable acquisitions of stocks and corporate bonds largely reflected the well-publicized capital injections into U.S. financial firms from sovereign wealth funds of China, South Korea, Singapore, and Middle East oil exporters.  Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate that foreign official inflows likely moderated somewhat in February from January's very high level.

The chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows offers more perspective on these data. Flows from G-10 and OPEC countries have fluctuated between small inflows and outflows since 2006, with the trend being a fairly small net inflow.  Inflows from other countries have continued to account for the greater part of official inflows, and have experienced significant volatility in the past few months.

Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the table and the top panels of the chart on Private Securities Flows) for 2007 as a whole registered a 10 percent increase from 2006, mainly because of very strong inflows during the first half of the year.  With the start of the financial market turmoil in the third quarter of 2007, however, private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities fell sharply, with foreign net sales recorded for agency bonds, corporate and municipal bonds (a category that also includes asset-backed securities), and corporate stocks (lines 4b, 4c, and 4d of the table).  Net outflows in these categories were offset by increased purchases of U.S. Treasuries (line 4a), indicating a 'flight to quality' in private foreign demand for U.S. securities.  Private purchases of corporate securities recovered somewhat in the fourth quarter, while purchases of U.S. Treasuries rose even further.  In January, foreign private purchases of all security types were small.

After recording strong outflows in the third quarter, U.S. net acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5 of the table and bottom panel of the chart on Private Securities Flows) contracted sharply in the fourth quarter of 2007.  For the year as whole, U.S. net acquisitions of bonds and stocks (lines 4a and 4b) were somewhat smaller than those recorded in 2006.  During December 2007 and January 2008, U.S. purchases of foreign stocks were minimal.  Total U.S. net purchases of foreign securities in January were similar to the monthly average of 2007.

As is typical at a monthly frequency, flows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) were volatile in 2007, with a net outflow of $75.8 billion for the year.  In January 2008, banking offices in the U.S. recorded modest outflows of $36.7 billion.  Some of these outflows may be linked to U.S. banks providing liquidity to European banks, particularly via repurchase agreements.

Complete U.S. balance of payments data for the fourth quarter are not yet available. However, some partial data have come in, including changes in bank-reported foreign currency denominated claims and liabilities, as well as changes in U.S. investors' holdings of foreign short-term securities.  These flows, which will be included in line 10, indicate a further $100 billion in inflows during the fourth quarter in addition to the nearly $300 billion in inflows recorded for lines 1-5, suggesting that the statistical discrepancy will likely swing from positive $86 billion in the third quarter to a sizable negative number in the fourth quarter.

Foreign Financial Markets

Market turmoil stepped up again in late February, in part as investor perceptions of the near-term prospects for U.S. growth declined further.  Less-downbeat economic data in the other advanced economies and statements by some foreign officials warning of inflationary pressures led investors to expect that the Federal Reserve's monetary policy response would be more substantial than that of other major central banks.  As a result, the exchange value of the dollar dropped on net over the intermeeting period, with the trade-weighted major currencies index falling 3¾ percent to a new post-Bretton Woods low.  The dollar depreciated 5 percent against the euro and 6 percent versus the yen over the period.  The dollar depreciated 2¼ percent against sterling and was little changed on net versus the Canadian dollar.

The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada lowered their policy interest rates during the intermeeting period, by 25 and 50 basis points respectively, while the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left their policy rates unchanged.  ECB President Trichet, after the March 6 meeting of the Governing Council, again emphasized his concerns about inflationary pressures.  Similar concerns, driven in part by sharp increases in the prices of many commodities over the period, led the Reserve Bank of Australia and Sweden's Riksbank to increase their policy rates.

Conditions in interbank term money markets for dollar and sterling, which had improved substantially in January, deteriorated again in late February, and spreads between Libor and overnight index swap rates began to rise again.  Although spreads in euro held fairly steady through February, they also turned up in early March as lending conditions continued to deteriorate.  On March 11, as part of a set of coordinated actions by G-10 central banks designed to help calm term funding markets, the FOMC announced that it would increase the size of its dollar swap lines with the ECB and the Swiss National Bank, and the ECB and SNB announced they would resume their dollar auctions and increase their size.  Simultaneously, the Bank of England announced the continuation of its three-month repo operations with an expanded list of acceptable collateral, and the Bank of Canada announced that it would conduct two exceptional 28-day repo operations.  Following these announcements, the spread between dollar Libor and OIS rates declined, but euro and sterling spreads showed little reaction.

In line with expectations of divergent monetary policies, two-year Treasury yields fell about 80 basis points on net over the period, while German two-year yields declined only 20 basis points.  Ten-year sovereign nominal yields declined about 30 basis points in

Germany and 20 basis points in the United States.  In European sovereign bond markets, market liquidity has reportedly worsened since late February, and spreads between less liquid Italian bonds and more liquid German bonds have widened about 25 basis points. European corporate spreads have also moved up over the intermeeting period, although by less than in the United States.

Amid growing concerns about the impact of the global financial turmoil and the pace of U.S. economic activity, major headline equity indexes in Europe, Japan, and the United States ended the period down 3 to 8 percent on net.  Financial sector share prices registered more substantial falls in most major industrial countries.  Euro-area banking share prices dropped about 10 percent on average, and Japanese banking share prices lost almost 15 percent despite a report by Japan's FSA indicating that Japanese banks have only a modest total exposure to U.S. subprime-based assets.  Market analysts were focused over the period on the releases of earnings reports by major European banks, watching in particular for the amounts written down by the various institutions.  The picture was mixed, as some European banks, including UBS, Credit Suisse and Credit Agricole reported larger-than-expected writedowns, but a number of others, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays reported smaller-than-expected writedowns.

Latin American financial markets were relatively unaffected by the global financial turmoil.  The dollar was little changed against the Mexican peso and depreciated 5 percent versus the Brazilian real . Equity indexes in Mexico, Brazil, and Argentina rose 2 to 6 percent.  Latin American dollar-denominated bond spreads widened slightly.  In emerging Asia, dollar exchange rates were mixed, as were movements in equity indexes; Taiwanese, Korean, and Thai indexes rose, but indexes in China and Hong Kong declined.

We received no reports of intervention purchases or sales by the central banks of major industrial countries over the intermeeting period.  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

Real GDP growth slowed in the fourth quarter in the major advanced foreign economies. The source of the slowdown varied substantially across economies.  In the euro area, GDP growth was pulled down by an outright fall in domestic demand.  Domestic demand also slowed in the United Kingdom.  In contrast, Canadian domestic demand remained very strong, but was offset by a steep decline in net exports.

Except in Canada, consumer price inflation has risen in these economies over the past several months, pushed up by higher food and energy prices.  In the euro area, inflation pressures are particularly acute; overall inflation reached 3.2 percent in February, the highest level since euro-area statistics were officially compiled in 1997.  Core inflation in Canada continued to moderate in January, reaching 1.5 percent.

Statements accompanying central bank meetings in March cited increased downside risks to growth.  The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 50 basis points at its March meeting, citing downside risks to growth emanating from the United States.  The Bank of England cut its policy rate 25 basis points in February.  The European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left rates unchanged, indicating concerns over inflationary pressures outweighed risks to growth.

According to the preliminary estimate, Japan 's real GDP grew 3.5 percent (s.a.a.r) in the fourth quarter, spurred by export growth and strong business fixed investment, which bounced back following four quarters of decline.  Net exports contributed 1.8 percentage points to growth, despite a decline in exports to the United States.  The revisions to the Construction Standards Law implemented last summer continued to weigh on housing investment, which subtracted about one percentage point from growth.  However, the Ministry of Finance corporate survey is at odds with the recent strength in business investment, suggesting that the fall in capital investment that started earlier in 2007 accelerated in the fourth quarter, as private capital expenditure fell 7.7 percent from a year earlier.

Recent economic indicators have been mixed.  Industrial production and core capital goods shipments fell in January.  Consumer confidence also dropped in February to its lowest level in almost five years.  However, consumption indicators remain healthy, with strong increases in January retail sales and household spending.  Real exports also rose in the first month of this year, boosted by strong demand from Asia and the Europe.

The labor market continued to be tight, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 3.8 percent in January.  However, the job offers-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) remained at 0.98, its lowest level in two years, indicating that employment may soften. Total cash earnings (which include bonuses) grew 1 percent in January from a year earlier, following 13 months of declines.

The nationwide headline consumer price index (excluding only fresh food) rose 0.7 percent in January from a year earlier.  However, the rise in the index was the result of an increase in oil prices; consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy fell 0.1 percent.

Euro-area real GDP growth slowed to 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter.  Total domestic demand fell 0.1 percent as private consumption contracted and investment growth slowed.  Net exports contributed 1.7 percentage points to growth, although this largely reflects a decline in imports.  The fourth-quarter slowdown in euro-area growth was driven by slowing growth in both Germany and France, which together account for around 50 percent of euro-area GDP.

Recent survey-based indicators point to a further slowing of growth in the first quarter. The European Commission survey of euro-area economic sentiment fell in February for the ninth consecutive month, with declines in confidence widespread across the industrial, consumer, and construction sectors.  Germany's IFO business climate index, although remaining at a low level, unexpectedly rose in February, as firms took a slightly less gloomy view of current conditions.

The final reading on the euro-area services PMI for January declined about 3 points to 50.6 before bouncing back to 52.3 in February.  The manufacturing PMI has been about unchanged over the past three months after recovering from a sharp drop in October. Retail sales and industrial production improved in January.

According to the preliminary estimate, headline inflation was 3.2 percent in February, unchanged from January and its highest level since euro-area statistics began in 1997. Recent headline inflation has been boosted by rising energy and food prices.  January core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) was a more modest 2.3 percent.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP growth moderated to 2.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.  Domestic demand weakened noticeably as private consumption rose and investment contracted.  Net exports made a positive contribution to GDP growth, as imports fell more than exports.  Inventories and government consumption also made positive contributions.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent data on mortgage lending are consistent with a sharp reduction in new loan origination.  Net mortgage lending fell 25 percent in the twelve months to January, while the number of mortgages approved for house purchases tumbled 39 percent.  In contrast, mortgage refinancing posted double-digit gains over the same period.  Twelve-month house price appreciation has slowed from double digit gains last summer to around 2 percent in February.

Consumer confidence slid to a five-year low in February as households were increasingly pessimistic about the general economic situation.  In contrast, business confidence rose in January after reaching a two-year low a month earlier.  The PMI for services rose to 54.1 in February as firms reported an increase in outstanding business and were more optimistic about future business.

The labor market remains robust, with wages up and unemployment remaining low in January.  The number of people claiming unemployment benefits fell for a sixteenth consecutive month in January, and the number of vacancies remained at its highest level since 2001.

The twelve-month rate of headline inflation ticked up to 2.2 percent in January. Excluding energy, food, and alcoholic beverages, inflation slowed 0.1 percentage points to 1.3 percent.

In Canada , real GDP growth slowed sharply in the fourth quarter, with most of the weakness appearing late in the quarter.  Net exports subtracted from growth as exports fell and imports rose.  Final domestic demand accelerated, as private and government consumption soared.  Growth in private consumption was especially impressive as it occurred before a January reduction in the retail sales tax.  Inventory accumulation made only a modest contribution in the fourth quarter following an outsized gain in the third. Investment growth was solid.

<!-- missing-text -->

Employment increased substantially in both January and February, 0.3 percent in each month.  In contrast to the pattern seen throughout 2007, employment growth was concentrated in the private sector.  Consistent with the gains in employment wages have increased at record rates, near 4.9 percent on a twelve-month basis.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation fell 0.2 percentage points to 2.2 percent in January.  Inflation has been supported by rising gasoline prices and increases in mortgage interest costs.  Core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, slowed further in January, reaching 1.4 percent.  The twelve-month growth rate of average hourly wages jumped sharply in December, reaching an impressive 4.9 percent.

The Bank of Canada lowered its policy rate by 75 basis points over the quarter; a 25 basis point reduction in January was followed by a 50 basis point reduction in March.  The BOC cited concerns over downside risks to its outlook driven by a likely further slowing

of activity in the United States.  The BOC indicated that further stimulus 'is likely to be required in the near term.'

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Recent information for emerging market economies suggests that growth has slowed, but is still fairly strong.  In emerging Asia, fourth-quarter GDP data were mixed, as growth picked up in China and South Korea but moderated in India and contracted in Singapore. Indicators point to a slowing of growth in Latin America, but by less than had been expected, especially in Mexico.  Headline inflation continued to rise in the developing world, largely owing to a continued increase in food and energy prices, and prompting governments in several countries to adopt controls on some prices.  In addition, a number of countries have refrained from following the Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, and some, including China, have been allowing more currency appreciation.

In China , real GDP grew 9.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter, up somewhat from the third quarter.  Nevertheless, the pace of growth in the second half slowed markedly relative to the very strong first half, although new seasonal factors suggest that growth was spread a bit more evenly over last year than previously thought.  Incoming data from the current quarter continue to suggest weakness in external demand.  For January and February as a whole, export growth slowed a bit more after a substantial decline in the fourth quarter.  However, import growth also slowed, resulting in a modest increase in the trade surplus to $261 billion (s.a.a.r.) from about $251 billion in the fourth quarter. According to the Ministry of Finance, in 2007 China recorded its first overall fiscal surplus (including both central and local governments) in many years, reflecting strong tax revenues; the central government alone posted a modest deficit of under 1 percent of GDP.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation has risen sharply this year, reaching 8.7 percent in February.  The rise in inflation largely reflects an acceleration of food price inflation: severe snowstorms disrupted transport and the inclement weather has caused some crop damage as well, leading to soaring vegetable prices and further increases in meat prices. 12-month food price inflation increased to 23 percent in February, while non-food inflation remained at around 1½ percent.

Recent indicators for India show a moderation of activity.  Fourth-quarter GDP moderated significantly, after a marked increase in the third quarter.  Industrial production rebounded in December from the previous month, although growth in mining and energy production slowed significantly.  The trade deficit widened sharply in January, as soaring imports swamped a slight increase in exports.  Both consumer and wholesale price inflation held roughly steady in January.  However, more recent weekly data for the wholesale price index indicate a renewed increase in inflation in February, in part driven by higher prices for some food products and cotton.  In addition, the government increased the ceiling on state-controlled fuel prices by 5 percent on February 14.

Leading up to the start of the new fiscal year in April, the government announced its proposed 2008-09 budget in late February.  Expenditure is heavily loaded toward education, health, and infrastructure, and agriculture.  The government projects a 2008-09 fiscal deficit of 2½ percent of GDP, but analysts remain skeptical, pointing to the significant off-budget spending (possibly exceeding 2 percent of GDP).  In February, the government also took steps to allow greater capital outflow, giving firms the option of issuing foreign-currency exchangeable bonds to fund operations abroad.

In the NIEs 1 , fourth-quarter economic performance was mixed, as real GDP growth was strong in South Korea and Hong Kong, but moderated in Taiwan, and was negative in Singapore.  Contributions of external demand to growth generally weakened.  In Singapore, the contraction resulted primarily from a sharp decline in activity in the volatile biomedical sector.  In January, industrial production rebounded in Taiwan, Singapore and South Korea.  Across the region, exports have generally risen in the current quarter, but except in Singapore these gains have been largely offset by strong imports, resulting in lower trade balances.

Except in Singapore, twelve-month consumer price inflation stabilized in most recent months across the NIEs, but inflationary pressures remain.  Food price inflation has retreated from previous peaks in South Korea and Taiwan, as the earlier effects of adverse weather have faded.  In Singapore, inflation picked up, owing mainly to a one-off technical revision in the measurement of accommodation costs.  Amid inflationary pressures, the central bank of Taiwan allowed the local currency to appreciate at a more rapid pace, while South Korea announced some anti-inflationary measures, including a 10 percent reduction in the tax on gasoline and other oil products and a freeze of public services and transportation fees.  On February 1, Taiwan decided to extend for another six months a measure enacted last year to keep lower tariff rates on several farm products.

Data from the ASEAN-4 region indicate that economic growth slowed in Indonesia and Malaysia but picked up in the Philippines and Thailand in the fourth quarter.  Despite weakening demand in Europe and the United States, economic indicators have generally remained robust in the first quarter of 2008, as a result of strengthening domestic consumption and increased regional trade.  Industrial production, on average, picked up due to inventory buildup in Malaysia and expansion in the electronics industry in the Philippines and Thailand.

Across the region, increased food and energy prices continued to push consumer price inflation higher, prompting governments to adopt new measures to control inflation.  On February 1, the Indonesian government introduced progressive export taxes on palm oil, and subsidies for prices of soybeans, in addition to the already in-effect subsidies on fuel and rice prices.  The Philippines' Central Bank lowered interest rates ¼-percentage point in January.  In other countries, policy rates were kept on hold to contain inflationary pressures, despite increasing interest rate differentials vis-à-vis the U.S. policy rate.  On February 13, Malaysian Prime Minister Badawi announced the dissolution of parliament. The new elections were held on March 8.  The ruling Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition won 63 percent of parliamentary seats, down from its previous 90 percent, and falling short of a two-thirds majority.  Abdullah Badawi will continue as Prime Minister. Although BN maintained a simple majority, the results are interpreted by political analysts as a setback for BN and a vote against the government's recent handling of such sensitive issues as racial tension and inflation.  On March 3, Thailand's central bank eliminated capital control measures instituted in 2006 during the military junta rule.

Real GDP for Mexico increased 3 percent (a.r.) in the fourth quarter, more than most analysts had anticipated.  The increase was largely driven by the services sector, while manufacturing continued to show signs of moderation.  The Mexican government met its fiscal target of a balanced budget in 2007, as rising oil and non-oil revenues supported an increase in government expenditures.  Headline inflation ticked down to 3.7 percent in January, below the upper limit of the central bank's target range.  However, core inflation readings continue to be elevated, with large increases in the housing sector price index.

In Brazil , real GDP growth remained strong in the fourth quarter. January industrial production partially rebounded from its dip in December, bringing twelve-month growth to 7¾ percent.  Strong domestic demand also continued to fuel rapid import growth, leading to a further narrowing of the trade surplus in January.  Twelve-month inflation through January remained high at 5 percent, boosted by food prices.  With capacity utilization rates still high and inflationary pressures from food and energy prices still a concern, at its March 6 monetary policy meeting the central bank unanimously voted to keep the target for the overnight interest rate, the Selic rate, at 11¼ percent.  The target has remained at that level since last September.

External and domestic factors continue to support growth in Argentina . The increase in agricultural commodity prices has provided strong stimulus to agricultural production and exports.  The overall trade surplus increased further in the fourth quarter.  Domestic demand remains strong, primarily consumption and residential investment.  Consumer price inflation moderated to a still-elevated rate of 8.2 percent in January.  The figure reported by the national statistical office, though, was once again below market expectations.  Allegations that the authorities understate the rate of inflation continue.

Real GDP for Venezuela increased 16 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter.  Quarterly growth estimates should be viewed with great caution, however, and growth slowed last year on a four-quarter basis to about 8½ percent.  Petroleum output was down by over 4 percent, reflecting managerial problems at the government-owned PDVSA and the hostile environment for foreign investors.  In early February, a UK court issued an injunction that freezes up to $12 billion in PDVSA assets held abroad until the Venezuelan government reaches a settlement with Exxon Mobil for last year's government takeovers of energy projects.  Chavez reacted to the move by halting shipments to Exxon Mobil.  Inflation reached 24 percent in January on a twelve-month basis.

Despite the high price of oil, the current account surplus narrowed $7.1 billion in 2007, as import growth was very strong, fueled by loose macro policies and the below-market official exchange rate.

In Turkey, third-quarter real GDP contracted due to significant cuts in government spending and a drop in exports.  Incoming data suggest that growth rebounded in the fourth quarter.  Average industrial production for the fourth quarter was up 3.7 percent. Twelve-month consumer price inflation has continued to be hoisted by food and energy prices in recent months, reaching 9.1 percent in February, significantly higher than the upper limit of the central bank's year-end target of 4 percent +/- 2 percentage points. Nonetheless, having loosened policy for six consecutive months, in February, the Monetary Policy Committee further cut the borrowing and lending rates 25 basis points to 15¼ percent and to 19¼ percent, respectively.  The Monetary Policy Committee indicated that the lagged effects of previous monetary tightening coupled with weak aggregate demand will continue to support disinflation in the medium term.
