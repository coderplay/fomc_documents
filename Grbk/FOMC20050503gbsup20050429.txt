Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Real Gross Domestic Product

According to the BEA's advance release, real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the first quarter following an increase at a rate of 3.8 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  On balance, the BEA's first-quarter estimate of real GDP was in line with our expectations:  Weaker-than-expected estimates of real net exports and government spending offset stronger-than-anticipated real personal consumption expenditures and inventory investment.

Real private inventories are reported to have risen at an annual rate of $80 billion in the first quarter, contributing 1.2 percentage points to the reported change in real GDP.  In contrast, final sales increased at an annual rate of only 1.9 percent in the first quarter after a 3.4 percent advance in the preceding quarter.  Among the components of final sales, the rise in real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) slowed to an annual rate of 3.5 percent, as a decline in spending for motor vehicles kept outlays for durable goods unchanged last quarter.  Similarly, business fixed investment rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent in the first quarter, well below the pace of 14.5 percent posted in the fourth quarter; spending on equipment and software decelerated, and spending on nonresidential structures declined.  Elsewhere, residential investment rose at a 5.7 percent rate in the first quarter.  The BEA estimated that net exports subtracted 1.5 percentage points from the first-quarter change in real GDP, reflecting a rise in imports at a 14.7 percent rate and a rise in exports at a 7 percent rate.  Total government spending was little changed in the first quarter, with both federal and state and local spending posting small increases.

Consumer Spending and Income

Real PCE edged up 0.1 percent in March after having climbed 0.4 percent in the preceding month.  Outlays for durable goods rose at a modest pace, as a solid gain in spending on motor vehicles was partly offset by net declines elsewhere.  Purchases of nondurable goods declined last month while spending on services moderated a touch despite a jump in expenditures on energy services.

Total nominal personal income rose $48 billion (annual rate) in March following an upward-revised increase of $41 billion in February.  Private wages and salaries gained $17 billion in March, a pace slightly below the average over the past year.  Factoring in contributions for social insurance and personal taxes, nominal disposable personal

income increased at a $42 billion rate.  However, because of a sharp rise in prices, real disposable income (DPI) was roughly flat in March.  The attached chart on changes in real DPI reports figures that are adjusted for two factors:  First, the changes shown exclude the effect on income of the large, one-time Microsoft dividend payment in December.  In addition, because we anticipate that first-quarter nominal DPI will be revised down about $24 billion (annual rate) in the preliminary GDP release next month, we have adjusted the advance BEA estimates accordingly.   Taking these factors into 1 account, we estimate that real DPI increased at an annual rate of 3½ percent over the past two quarters.

With little change in real disposable income in March, the small increase in real outlays nudged the saving rate down 0.1 percentage point.  The BEA reported that the personal saving rate stood at 0.4 percent in March and 0.6 percent for the quarter as a whole. However, because of the expected revision to nominal DPI noted above, we estimate that the published personal saving rate will be revised down about 0.3 percentage point for the quarter.

The Michigan Survey Research Center's index of consumer sentiment decreased further in April to 87.7.  The index, which currently stands somewhat below its average over the preceding twelve months, has been declining since December.  The implied level for the second half of April was 86.4, a bit lower than the reading of 88.7 in the first half of the month.  The April decline reflected a weakening in both the 'current conditions' and the 'expected conditions' components of the index.  Among the items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months deteriorated to a level last seen two years ago.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars and houses moved down, but by less than appeared to be the case in the preliminary index.

Prices and Labor Costs

The GDP price index increased at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the first quarter, bringing the four-quarter change to 2.5 percent-¾ percentage point above the yearearlier reading.  In the first quarter, prices of government consumption and investment posted a large increase reflecting the annual pay increases effective at the beginning of the year; even though such increases occur each year, the BEA chooses not to adjust them

for seasonal variation.  In addition, the increases in prices of some investment goods, including construction prices for oil and gas drilling and prices of some types of capital equipment, were surprisingly sharp.

The PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1 percent last quarter, and core PCE prices increased at a 2.2 percent rate.  In March, PCE prices rose 0.5 percent, reflecting, in part, a jump of 4.2 percent in energy prices.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose 0.3 percent last month.  Over the twelve months ending in March, core PCE prices were up 1.7 percent, ¼ percentage point more than the increase over the preceding twelve-month period.  The market-based component of core PCE prices also showed an acceleration of about ¼ percentage point over the past year, less than the pickup in core CPI inflation.  The smaller acceleration in market-based core PCE prices relative to the core CPI stems in part from the PCE index's smaller weight on housing and its use of PPIs rather than CPIs to measure the price of many medical services.

In the final Michigan survey for April, households' median expectation for inflation over the next twelve months ticked up to 3.3 percent.  The median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years inched up to 3 percent.

First-quarter estimates for productivity and costs in the nonfarm business sector will be released on May 5 th .  Based on data from the advance GDP release and our estimate of the first-quarter increase in hours, the staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in the first quarter following a 2.3 percent advance in the fourth quarter.  Over the four quarters ending last quarter, we estimate that productivity advanced about 2.3 percent, a considerable step-down from its elevated 5.5 percent pace during 2003.  We currently estimate that compensation per hour increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent in the first quarter.

The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at an annual rate of only 2.5 percent over the three months ending in March-down from a 3.2 percent rate during the preceding three months.  For the twelve months ending in March, hourly compensation in private industry increased 3.4 percent, ½ percentage point less than in the preceding year.

The ECI for wages and salaries advanced at an annual rate of 2.4 percent in the three months ending in March; this component of compensation also rose 2.4 percent over the

past twelve months, ¼ percentage point less than during the preceding year.  Benefits costs increased at an annual rate of 4.3 percent in the first three months of 2005, the smallest quarterly increase in this component of labor compensation since 2002.  Over the twelve months ending in March, benefit costs were up 5.8 percent, compared with an increase of 7 percent the preceding year.  Although a sharp jump in bonuses early this year boosted the year-over-year rise in that component of benefits, other employment benefits costs have moderated.  In particular, the retirement and savings category of benefits decelerated noticeably over the period from March 2004 to March 2005, rising 11.7 percent, compared with an increase of 23.7 percent during the preceding twelve months, which included a large pension payment by General Motors.  Health insurance costs also have slowed a bit, with the rise of 7.5 percent over the twelve months ending in March down from the year-over-year increase of 9.3 percent recorded in March 2004.
