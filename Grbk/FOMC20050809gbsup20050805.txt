Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Employment Situation

The labor market continued to improve gradually in July, in line with our expectations.

Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 181,000, little different from average gains over the first half of the year, and the unemployment rate held steady at 5 percent. 1

Employment gains were widespread last month, with the one-month diffusion index moving up to its highest level since May of last year.   Retail trade employment jumped 2 50,000 in July, with most component industries contributing to the increase.  Robust job growth continued in health care services (29,000), food services (30,000) and financial activities (21,000), where job gains were concentrated in real estate and real estate credit. Employment in manufacturing changed little last month (-4,000), as did employment in the related industries of temporary help services (-2,000) and wholesale trade (8,000).

Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls held steady at 33.7 hours in July.  Aggregate hours increased 0.2 percent, on par with average increases over the first half of the year.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate was down slightly from its secondquarter average, while the labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 66.1 percent, slightly above its second-quarter average.  Alternative gauges of labor market slack were mixed.  The number of individuals unemployed for longer than six months, as a percent of unemployment-a proxy for the relative difficulty of job finding-retraced some of its drop in June but remained below its second-quarter average.  However, the number of individuals employed part time for economic reasons in nonagricultural industries was little changed last month and up slightly from the second quarter.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.4 percent in July.  Over the past twelve months, average hourly earnings rose 2.7 percent, above the 2 percent increase over the preceding twelve months.
