Domestic Developments

Overview

The U.S. economy has  produced  an abundance  of  good news thus  far his ear. t y Growth of  real DP  in  the  first arter  reatly  utstripped eryone's  xpectations. G qu g o ev e The unemployment rate,  atching p with  the  gains n  output ince ast  ummer, c u i s l s plunged  to  about  5 percent n  April.  And  although  he ightness   the  labor arket i t t of m has  resulted  n  some bidding p of  wages in  the  past ear, here re  few signs f  a i u y t a o general ickup  in  inflation. p

Activity  n  the  opening  months  of  1997 clearly  as boosted o  an  extent y i w t b special  actors, cluding  ild  weather  and a  recovery n  auto  production  fter  he all f in m i a t f strikes.  oreover,  a substantial  rtion  f  the  acceleration   output as attributable M po o of w to  inventory  estocking.  nder the  circumstances,  s  not  surprising at here re r U iti th t a indications   a softening  n  the  early pring,  xacerbated  y renewed  labor of i s e b skirmishing  n  the  auto ndustry.  ur guess  is hat  eal DP i i O t r G growth  this  uarter  ill q w drop  to  around  1-3/4 ercent. p

More important,  e are  once  again rojecting at rowth  will roceed  on a w p th g p generally  emperate  rack n  subsequent uarters, ing both o  moderation f t t i q ow t o domestic  demand trends nd to  ongoing  drag  from  net  exports,  hich  will ontinue  o a w c t be  affected  or   while  by lagged ffects  f  the  1996-97  appreciation   the  dollar. f a e o of We  offer his  rojection,  wever,  with  the  same caveats  hat ccompanied  our t p ho t a previous,  ncorrect,  edictions   imminent  moderation.  Businesses nd households i pr of a are  in  an  upbeat ood.  So,  too,  re  the  financial rkets.  After lumping  earlier m a ma s in the  intermeeting riod,  artly  ecause  of  the  System's 5-basis-point  ghtening pe p b 2 ti action,  he  stock nd  bond  markets  have  rallied   late. here  is o  shortage f t a of T n o liquidity   the conomy, and people  have  huge  reserves  f  wealth hat hey  can  tap in e o t t for  spending.  Consequently,  lthough e believe hat  e have  made reasonable a w t w assumptions bout  the  spending  propensities    consumers  and firms,  e again a of w underscore he  risk  hat  he  surge  of ecent uarters  ould  be  generating    selft t t r q c a reinforcing mentum  that ill equire    sizable  egree  of  monetary  restraint    rein mo w r a d to in.  Nonetheless,  n  framing his  aseline  orecast,  have  assumed  that  o additional i t b f we n firming f  money market  conditions  ill ccur  until  ell  into 998. o w o w 1

We  continue o  believe  hat  substantial  owing  of  the xpansion s ecessary t t a sl e i n to  avoid  an  upturn n  the nderlying  rend n  price nflation. ready,   variety  f i u t i i Al a o measures  point o  a  step-up n  wage and total  ompensation ncreases  n  the  past ear t i c i i y or  so; lthough ot  sharp nough to  impress any  observers, at cceleration a n e m th a is consistent th  what  might  be  expected hen the  economy is perating  nly  a  little wi w o o beyond full  mployment. Prices,  f  course,  ave  been  quite ell  behaved. But  there e o h w

can  be little  ubt  that he  appreciation   the  dollar  as  helped  to amp  domestic do t of h d inflation.   addition, e  reported  ncreases  n  the  CPI have  been  held  down by the In th i i series  f  technical anges  to  the ndex. o ch i

Looking  forward, he  recent ncrease  n  labor tilization  our  belief  hat  he t i i u and t t dollar's  se  ikely  as  run  its  ourse ead  us  to  expect hat  ompensation nflation  ll ri l h c l t c i wi edge  higher nd that ising  abor osts ill oon  begin o  be  passed  along  in  larger a r l c w s t price ikes.  With  unemployment projected  o  be  under  5  percent,  e look  for eported h t w r core  CPI inflation   dge above  the  3 percent ark in  1998. toe m

Background Factors  in  the  Forecast

Our March forecast  ssumed that he  federal  unds  rate ould remain  at  or  near a t f w 5-1/4  percent ntil  ext  spring. e  are  now assuming  that t ill  e held  at u n W i w b 5-1/2  percent ell  into ext  year  but  then aised  omewhat to  avert   decline  n  real w n r s a i money market  rates  s  inflation  ses.  n  the  very ear  term, he  combination f a ri I n t o a steady ed  stance nd indications   more moderate  growth  should ind avor  among F a of f f bond traders, d we anticipate  further  ild  rally  n  fixed-income  arkets.  We an a m i m might  be  too  conservative  this  core,  or he redicted  nvironment ould  be  one  in on s f t p e c which the ond market  bulls  egain scendance.  Our expectation, wever,  is  that b r a ho market  wariness bout  increased  nflation, ated  n articular    the  pressures  n  the a i rel i p to i labor arket, ill ontain uch  enthusiasm nd  that,  fter  asing ust    little  om  here, m w c s a a e j a fr bond yields  ill egin  to  firm gain  in  the  second  half f  the ear  as  credit  emands w b a o y d grow. Long-term  rates  re  projected  o  move  a  bit bove  the  recent  ange  as  the a t a r System  tightens  ext  year. n

We  previously  ad anticipated at   meaningful orrection   the  stock arket h th a c of m would not  come until  998,  and to  this  oint,  hat  rediction es  not  appear  to ave 1 p t p do h fared oo  badly.  To be  sure, hare rices ell  harply fter  he  March meeting, artly t s p f s a t p on the  prospect  f  rising  nterest  tes,  ut  they  quickly egained he  lost  round  on o i ra b r t g favorable  eports  f  corporate  arnings,  ood  news about  prices  nd  the  economy,  and r o e g a hints  hat  he OMC t t F was not  necessarily mmitted  to  a  sequence  of  firming teps. co s The buoyant  bond market  that e are  postulating  er  the ear erm  could  help  carry w ov n t share  values o  new highs.  In 1998,  however,  stock rices  re  still  pected o  decline t p a ex t appreciably,   corporate  rofit rgins  are  squeezed  by higher osts nd as  actual  nd as p ma c a a anticipated d actions  o  combat  inflation  igh  on  the  market. Fe t we

In  the  last  reenbook,  we lowered  substantially   expectations   what  might G our of be contained  n  a  budget greement.  Consequently,  e were  not  greatly  urprised  y i a w s b the  bargain hat ecently  as struck y  the  President  nd  the  congressional adership: t r w b a le

The agreement, hich still s  many  details ft  o  be  filled , s  heavily  ackloaded w ha le t in i b and  does  nothing o  address he  more serious  udgetary roblems  that  oom after  002. t t b p l 2 As we had  assumed,  the  agreement  does  not  provide or ny  additional ductions f a re in the  deficit r iscal  997,  and only  small  reductions  re  planned  for iscal  998. fo f 1 a f 1 Thus,  we still rceive  he  stance f iscretionary  scal  olicy  o  be  only  slightly pe t o d fi p t restrictive s  ear  and  next.  Meanwhile,  the  strength  f  the  economy and,  from all thi y o appearances,   rise  n  the ffective x  rate ave  continued o  push  up federal  eceipts a i e ta h t r at  a  remarkable lip,  ilting  ar-term  rospects  oward  substantially ller  eficits c t ne p t sma d than  we had  previously  rojected. e  now expect  the  1997 unified  udget  deficit p W b to be $57 billion,  wn from  a projection   $101  billion   the  last  reenbook. On the do of in G assumption hat hatever  factors  ave  been  boosting eceipts  ill argely  arry ver t w h r w l c o into iscal  998,  we have  lowered  the  deficit recast r hat eriod s  well--from f 1 fo fo t p a $119 billion   the  previous reenbook  to  $77 billion   this  ne. in G in o

The foreign  xchange  value  of  the ollar  ontinued  pward for uch of  the e d c u m intermeeting  eriod,  ut t as  recently  ropped  back.  We  are  anticipating  at  t ill p b i h d th i w decline radually  ver  the  remainder f  1997 and  in  1998,  ending  up at he ame point g o o t s as in  the ast  reenbook. Foreign DP  growth  is xpected o  be close o  4 percent l G G e t t both  this ear  and  next; his  orecast  s ssentially  e  same as  that f he  last y t f i e th o t Greenbook. Crude oil rices ave  behaved  about  as  expected n  recent  onths and are p h i m assumed to  hold  near  their  ecent evels  hrough he  end  of  1998;  West Texas r l t t intermediate  tays  t  about  $19.50  per  barrel  ver  this  eriod. s a o p

The Current  Quarter

Although  the  international de eport  or  March still    outstanding  nd  many  other tra r f is a first-quarter  rce ata  are  subject  o  revision,  e nformation  n  hand  suggests  hat sou d t th i i t BEA's initial  timate  ould  be  revised p  to  about  6 percent ecause f  faster es c u b o inventory  ccumulation han he  BEA  had  assumed. Nonfarm stocks ppear  to  have a t t a risen  t  an  annual ate f  more than  5 percent  n  the  first arter; is  ate f  growth a r o i qu th r o was significantly ter  han hat f he  previous eriod,  nd the  step-up s stimated  o fas t t o t p a i e t have  contributed out  2-1/4 ercentage  oints  o  the  annual  rate  f  GDP ab p p t o growth  last quarter.

That  very  high  rate f  stockbuilding  s a  key consideration    our  decision  o o wa in t push  the orecast  or eal DP  growth  in  the  second  quarter  own to  1-3/4  percent. f f r G d While inventories pear  to  have  been  lean verall  t  the nd of he  first arter  nd ap o a e t qu a business ales  xpectations portedly  re  quite ositive,   do not  see  concerns bout s e re a p we a access  to  supplies  iving n extra oost o  desired tocks,  s  happened  in  1994. g a b t s a

Consequently,  e are  predicting    slowing  of  growth  in  nonfarm  inventory w a accumulation o  3-1/2 ercent t  an  annual  rate n  the  current  uarter; is ace  largely t p a i q th p reflects sired estocking,  though   little  anticipated ilding  ay  occur  at  firms de r al a un bu m whose sales all  hort f  more buoyant  expectations.  he slowing  of  inventory  rowth f s o T g from  the irst-quarter  e  subtracts out  3/4  percentage  oint rom  growth  of  real f pac ab p f GDP  this uarter. q

Good weather  this inter robably nabled  homebuilders o  push  construction w p e t ahead  faster, d  we therefore  ave  assumed  that ome of  the irst-quarter  n  in an h s f gai residential  vestment  as,  in  effect, orrowed"  from  the  second  quarter. till,  e in w "b S th demand for  housing  appears o  be  holding p well,  ith  the  restraint  om  the ise n t u w fr r i mortgage  rates  ince ast  all  eing  largely  ffset  y the ffects  f  ongoing  increases s l f b o b e o in employment and income. Consequently,  e project  nly  a  moderate  drop-off  n  starts w o i this  uarter  nd,  given  normal  lags,    further  mall ise n  actual  onstruction q a a s r i c expenditures.

Business ixed nvestment  etains  onsiderable gor,  s  best e can  tell  rom f i r c vi a w f sorting  hrough he  anecdotal  eports  nd the olatile nthly  statistical  icators. t t r a v mo ind In the  first arter, e  monthly  bounces  for omputers  and other igh-tech  quipment qu th c h e translated  to trong ains  on  a quarterly  verage  basis,  ut  the eal ews was perhaps in s g a b r n the  reemergence  of  strength  n  orders or ther ypes  of achinery  and  equipment. i f o t m Although  some of  the  shipments hat hose rders oreshadow  will o  to  foreign  irms, t t o f g f we are  projecting  olid ncreases  n  domestic pending  on equipment  across   broad s i i s a range  of ategories,  th  outlays  or ircraft kely  o  be  particularly ong.

As usual,  ur  prediction  urrent-quarter  tput s  importantly  nfluenced  y o ofc ou i i b our  interpretation he  data rom  the  labor arket. In  the resent ase, e have of  t f m p c w something  of  a  mixed bag. The 140,000  per  month increases  n  payroll  mployment i e in  March and April ere  below the  recent  rend,  ragged  down in  part y  the w t d b unwinding  of  the  previous eather-induced  unup  in  construction  bs.  Still, ese w r jo th gains  are  far rom  paltry, d initial  aims or obless  enefits  ave  remained  low f an cl f j b h enough  to  suggest  hat mployment growth  remained  hefty hrough he ay  survey t e t t M week. On the  other and,  the  workweek dropped  back  in  April rom  the h f extraordinarily h  February-March evel,  o  that e probably  are  on  track  or nly  a hig l s w f o relatively  dest  increase  n  aggregate ours  of roduction  orkers  this  uarter.  e mo i h p w q W are  inclined  o  think  hat he  sharp rop  in he nemployment rate n  April as mainly t t t d t u i w a  catch-up o  the  outsized  DP  gains f  the ast wo quarters  the ate aving  changed t G o p t ( r h little  ring  that  urge  in  growth). du s

The rate f  rise  n  the  CPI in he  second  quarter  s ow projected  o  be  only o i t i n t about  1-1/4 ercent t  an  annual  rate. he second-quarter op  in  consumer  energy p a T dr prices s xpected o  be  much larger  han e had  projected  n  the  last  reenbook. In i e t t w i G addition, r  forecast  or onsumer  food  prices  as  also een  revised own ou f c h b d significantly;    weather  in  Florida  nd California rly his  ear  ended  up  causing bad a ea t y barely   ripple  n  the  food  price ata  for ate  inter nd early pring. e  project  hat a i d l w a s W t the  rate f  rise  n  the  core  CPI will e  boosted o  an  annual ate f  almost  3 percent n o i b t r o i the  second  quarter  y a  moderate  step-up n  the rices f  non-energy ervices;  are b i p o s we anticipating  at ncreases  n  the  prices  f  goods  will rop  back  again n oming th i i o d i c months  after    blip n  April. a i

The Longer-Run  Outlook

We  expect  real DP  to  expand  at  an  average nnual  rate f  close o  2-1/2 ercent n G a o t p i the  second  half f  1997 and 2  percent  n  1998.  Growth of ousehold nd  business o i h a expenditures  s  projected  o  slow  over  time, iven  already igh  rates  f  real sset i t g h o a accumulation nd the  eventual mergence  of  less avorable  inancial ctors.  he a e f f fa T dynamics  of  the eceleration   activity e  due in  large art o  the  expected earing d of ar p t g down of  inventory  nvestment rom  the  unsustainable ce  of  the irst  uarter  nd  to i f pa f q a the  persistence   appreciable  rag  from  the xternal  ector.  he unemployment rate of d e s T may  well  tick  p  in he ear  term  from  the  low reading or pril,  ut  we think  t u t n f A b i likely  hat  he ate ill rop  back  below 5 percent fter  idyear  and generally  emain t t r w d a m r there hrough he  end of  1998. This  degree  of  tightness   the  labor arket  is t t in m expected o  be accompanied  by  a moderate  step-up n  compensation ncreases  etween t i i b now and the  end of  next  year, iving mpetus  to  an acceleration  rices. g i ofp

Consumer  spending. After  rising  t  an  annual ate f  4 percent n he irst a r o i t f half f  1997,  real CE  is rojected  o  increase  t  a  rate f ust  ver  3  percent n  the o P p t a o j o i second  half f  this  ear.  Spending  growth  is redicted  o  slow  further  n  1998 to o y p t i 2-1/2  percent. onsumer outlays or lectronic uipment  are  expected o  continue C f e eq t rising  t  an  impressive  lip ut  less apidly  ver ime.  Moreover,  purchases f otor a c b r o t o m vehicles  ikely  re  topping ut, nd  the nticipated ftening  n  the  housing  sector  ill l a o a a so i w damp  demand for ousehold  goods. Moderation  of  income growth  in  coming quarters h brings bout  a  slowing  of  consumer  purchases ore generally. a m

Our forecast  f  growth  in  real isposable  ersonal ncome  for  1997 has  in  fact o d p i been  knocked down a  bit n  this  reenbook. The trimming  of PI growth  in  the  face i G D

of  stronger  rowth  of  real g GDP was prompted  by the  surprising  rength  n st i nonwithheld ax  receipts,  ich led  us  to  raise  he  ongoing  level f  taxes rom  that t wh t o f shown in  the  last  orecast.  iven  the  lack f  detail  n  the vailable ta,  e can  only f G o i a da w conjecture  bout  what lies  ehind  the  bulge n  nonwithheld ax  payments. But none of a b i t the  most  likely  xplanations,  ch  as  an  understatement   aggregate IPA  income,  a e su of N shift  n  the istribution    taxable  ncome to  high-bracket useholds,  r  a  jump in i d of i ho o capital  ains ealizations,  m to  point o  a  big  hit o  spending.  Thus,  we have  felt g r see t t reasonably  omfortable  etting e  higher ax  payments  come mostly  out  of  personal c l th t saving.

Given our  projection   output rowth, he  productivity  recast  mplies hat of g t fo i t firms  will eed  to  boost abor nput -1/2 ercent n n l i 2 p i 1997 and about  1-1/4  percent  n i 1998. Because  we have allowed  for  a slight  engthening  f  the  average  workweek in l o 1997, payroll  mployment grows roughly  2 percent,  omewhat less apidly  han e s r t aggregate  ours.  Next  year, he  workweek is lat, d  payrolls  xpand h t f an e 1-1/4  percent.

Wages  and prices. Our basic tory ith  respect  o  inflation    a  simple  one: s w t is The economy has  overshot ull mployment,  and we are  witnessing    gradual rift f e a d toward  higher nflation--that ency  having  been  muted  to  date y  the  appreciation i tend b of  the  dollar  nd  by certain  tructural  ocks,  erhaps ost  notably he  changing a s sh p m t character  f he  medical  care arket.  However, the  data n  hand  do not  provide o t m i definitive  pport or  this  tory,  nd  we have  once again eexamined  the  aptness f  our su f s a r o analysis.

The difficulty    getting    clear  ignal  rom  the ata s llustrated  the  latest in a s f d i i by information  n labor ompensation.  The Employment Cost  Index  for he  first arter o c t qu showed a  seasonally  djusted  ncrease  n  hourly ompensation f ust  .5  percent t  an a i i c o j 2 a annual  rate,  he mallest  ise ince he  same period   year  earlier.  owever,  given  the t s r s t a H quarterly  oise n  the  series,  s ise  to  focus  on  the  year-on-year mparisons.  On n i iti w co this  asis,  he  change  in  the  index  for he eriod nded  in  March was 3.0  percent,  ight b t t p e r in  line ith  our  previous rojection d up 0.4  percentage  oint rom its  ow at  the w p an p f l end of  1995.' At the  risk  f  putting  oo  fine   point n a  change  that,  tatistically, o t a o s is only  marginally  ignificant, would note  that his  egree  of  pickup  in  compensation s we t d is  about  what would have  been  expected rom a  Phillips rve  model embodying a f cu NAIRU in  the  range  of -1/2 o  5-3/4 ercent. 5 t p

Looking ahead,  we are  projecting  further  mall  step-up n  compensation a s i inflation  is ear, ringing  he  ECI increase  or  1997 to  nearly -1/2 ercent.  Several th y b t f 3 p factors  upport his  rediction  f  further  cceleration. e is he  lagged  effect  f  the s t p o a On t o larger  ncrease  n  the  CPI in  1996,  which  will e feeding hrough o ages via ormal i i b t t w f or  informal ost-of-living ustments. nother  is he  second  increase  n  the  minimum c adj A t i wage. A third  s  our  prediction  f  a  jobless  ate  elow 5 percent,  hich suggests  hat i o r b w t the  upward pressures  n  real ompensation hould  be  more intense  his  ear  than  last. o c s t y

In  this  nalysis,  are  not  turning    blind ye  to he  possibility t a we a e t ha compensation  practices ve  changed in  ways that ring reater  lexibility ompany ha b g f to  c

wage structures. wever, even  if here s ore targeting  f  pay increases  o  workers Ho t i m o t with  scarce kills,  eater  se  of onuses  as  opposed  to  base-pay ncreases, d  so  on, s gr u b i an these hanges  probably nly  buy companies  some limited  reathing  oom:  When c o b r workers  are  in  short upply,  mployers  will ventually  ave  to  pay  more,  one way or s e e h another,  or abor nput. Although  the  changes  in  pay  practices  ay alter  he  timing f l i 2 m t or  magnitude  of  responses  f  compensation o  changes  in  labor arket  slack,  hey  are o t m t not  likely  o egate hat elationship  tirely. t n t r en

A similar  bservation  an  be  made about  the  effects   worker  insecurity: o c of A shift  o  a  greater  egree  of nsecurity uld be  expected o  lead o  a  lowering  of he t d i wo t t t NAIRU,  but  that eduction  oes  not  nullify e  usual nverse  elationship  tween r d th i r be unemployment and pay increases.  n that oint,    distinct sk  n  the  forecast  s hat, O p a ri i i t with  availability obs erceived o  be increasing, rker  insecurity uld  wane, of  j p t wo co reinforcing ge pressures.  e  have  not  made any special  llowance  for  such  a wa W a development.

If ompensation  is ccelerating,  en  prices,  oo, ventually  ill ccelerate c a th t e w a unless roductivity  ends mprove;  the  squeezing f  markups will rovide nly  a p tr i o p o temporary  stopgap.  Business eople  often ay  that,  n  today's  ompetitive  orld, hey p s i c w t have no scope  for  raising  rices  nd that ny  increments  o  wages will ave  to  be p a a t h offset  hrough ains  in  efficiency.  ut  we question  hether  businesses  an  call  orth t g B w c f productivity vances  in  just  he  right  easure  to  offset  cceleration   ourly ad t m a ofh compensation.  Among other hings,  he  notion hat irms ave  a  reserve f  costt t t f h o reduction  pportunities    tap  does  not  seem to  square ith  the  image of ompanies o to w c being  quick  to eize n every  opportunity  o  maximize profits. s o t

Of  course,  rice ynamics  might  have  changed,  given  the  greater  xposure f p d e o firms  to  international  domestic  competition  nd  the  anchor  of  a  more credible or a anti-inflation  etary  policy. n  the  end,  however,  there s mple evidence hat irms mon I i a t f still   raise  rices  hen product arkets  are  tight; d  the  passthrough  f  the  rising do p w m an o costs f  labor r  other nputs  nto rices  s ore likely  hen those ressures  re o o i i p i m w p a widespread, o  that irms eed  not  fear osing ompetitive  osition.  uch conditions s f n l c p S prevail  n  the orecast:  ot only  are  we anticipating  at idespread cceleration i f N th w a of compensation ates ill e squeezing rofit  argins, ut  the  pricing leverage"  f r w b p m b " o firms  is nhanced  by an  upturn n  non-oil  mport  prices  s  the  dollar  ecedes. he e i i a r T

Next year  brings n t 2 p i mo i a additional derate  pickup  in  this  nflation  asure;  we are  predicting at he mo i me th t increase  ill e  a  little  re than  3  percent n an  official  sis nd 3-1/2 ercent  f w b mo o ba a p i adjustment s  made for he  technical anges  to  the  CPI since  1994. i t ch

Monetary and Credit  Flows

We  are  inclined  o  attribute  e ecent apid rowth  of  the onetary  aggregates  o  the t th r r g m t unusually nd unexpectedly  arge ederal  ax  payments  associated th  the  April iling a l f t wi f deadline.  Households  probably uilt  p  their  oney  balances o  meet  these iabilities b u m t l and,  when those ayments clear,  ill ot  see  fit  o  replenish em. Over the  year  as  a p w n t th whole,  growth  of  M2  is  expected o  be  somewhat below that f  nominal  GDP,  owing t o to  a  rise  n  the  pportunity  ost f olding 2  resulting om  the  policy ction  aken i o c o h M fr a t at  the arch meeting.  Growth of  M2  in  1998 remains  slightly  low the  growth  of M be nominal  GDP.  Brisk rowth  of  M3  is rojected  his  ear  and  next  based  on a  further g p t y solid  xpansion f  bank  credit  nd continued trong rowth  of  money  funds. e o a s g

The surprising rge  in  tax  receipts s  enabled  the reasury o  pay  off ebt su ha T t d this uarter  nd is  expected o  pull own the  growth  of ederal  ebt  to  only q a t d f d

Our assessment s hat inancial nditions  ill emain  quite upportive  o i t f co w r s t business orrowing, ith  only  a  moderate  widening  of he  narrow  spreads ow b w t n prevailing  n  the  securities  rkets  and on bank  loans.

Growth in  household  debt  is rojected  o  edge  lower  in  1997 and 1998 but  to p t remain  at  a  pace  above  that f ominal  income.

As a  result, e  growth  of  mortgage  debt  is xpected o  soften ver  the  forecast th e t o period.

In  the  state  nd local overnment  sector, bt  growth  should emain  quite a g de r modest  in  1997 and 1998. The prevailing litical  nsensus avoring  iscal straint po co f f re should  keep  the apital  pending  of  these  urisdictions  a slow  growth  track,  nd c s j on a with  long-term nterest tes rifting ,  the  opportunities   pre-refund  ebt  will e i ra d up to d b few and far etween. b

All  told,  he ebt  of he  nonfinancial ctor  s  anticipated    grow a little  re t d t se i to mo than  4-1/2 ercent n  1997,  placing t n  the  middle  portion  f  its nnual ange  but p i i i o a r below the  expansion f  nominal  GDP. o Debt  in  1998 is rojected  o  expand  about  5 p t percent,  omewhat faster  han ominal  GDP. s t n

Consequently,  he  forces ecessary  o  ultimately rn nflation in t n t tu i back  down would not  emerge.

The second  alternative  volves    more aggressive  pproach  for apping in a a c inflation--preemptive,  t ere. The fed  funds  rate s  raised 00 basis oints urther as  i w i 1 p f in  a  series  f  steps ver  the emainder f  1997 and  then eld  steady n  1998.

International Developments

Recent Developments

The weighted-average  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  in terms  of the  other  G-10 currencies  has  declined  1 percent  since  the  March  FOMC  meeting. The  dollar rose strongly  in April  on  expectations  of a further  U.S.  monetary  tightening,  but it  has fallen  back in May  as those  expectations  have  ebbed  and  as market  attention  focused on  G-7  officials' concerns  about  exchange  rates.

The  dollar  has  depreciated  5-1/2  percent,  on balance,  against  the  yen  but  has firmed  slightly against  major European  currencies  and the  Canadian dollar. European long-term  interest  rates  have  declined  20 basis  points  (Germany)  to  60  basis points (Italy  and  the United  Kingdom). Japanese  long-term  rates  have  risen  20 basis  points on  perceptions  of some firming  in  Japanese  economic  activity. Short-term  rates  have changed  little  in  most cases. The  Canadian  dollar weakened  when  the Bank  of Canada did not follow  the  firming  move by  the  Federal  Reserve  in  March. Sterling  rose slightly  late  in the  period  and  U.K.  long-term  interest  rates  fell  sharply after  the  new Labour government  announced  that the  repo  rate  was  raised  25  basis points  to  6-1/4 percent  and  that  henceforth  the Bank of England would  be  given  authority  to  set official  interest  rates.

Considerable  market  attention  has been  focused  on  the  prospects  for  official intervention  to  restrain the  dollar,  especially  late  in  the  period  in  response  to  remarks by  German  and Japanese  officials  expressing  concern  about  the weakness  of their currencies  against  the dollar.

The Desk did  not

intervene.

Data  for the  first quarter  and  some preliminary  indicators  for  the  second  quarter suggest  that the growth  of output has  strengthened  somewhat on  average  in  the  foreign G-7 countries. Activity has  been  strong  in  the  United  Kingdom, Canada,  and  Japan, and  weak but  improving  in  continental  Europe. U.K. GDP rose  at an  annual  rate  of 4 percent  in  the  first  quarter,  and  business  sentiment  was  strong  through  April. Canadian industrial  production  and  retail  sales  strengthened  substantially  in JanuaryFebruary  and employment  showed  further  gains  through  April. Recent  data  on  activity in  Japan  have  been  distorted  by  the  April  1 hike  in  the  consumption  tax,  with  strong activity  in  the  first  quarter  followed  by  some  weakening  in  April. German  industrial production  turned  up moderately  in  the  first quarter,  and  export  orders  surged. French consumption  of manufactured  goods grew  modestly  in the first quarter,  and  Italian industrial  output  bounced  back  from  sharp  declines  during  the  second  half of  1996.

The twelve-month ate f  consumer  price nflation  ceded  to  2.5  percent n  the r o i re i United  Kingdom  in pril  as  a  result  f  declines  n  oil nd food  prices. PI inflation A o i a C ranged  between  1  percent  nd 2 percent  n  the  other oreign  -7 countries.  s a i f G A expected,  apanese nflation  ose  to  a  bit  ore than  1  percent  n  April eflecting  e J i r m i r th consumption  tax  increase.  talian flation  clined  o  1.7  percent n  April,  elped  by I in de t i h the  appreciation   the ira  ver  the  past ear. of l o y

With strong DP  growth  and a rise  n  the  value  of he  peso  in  real erms, G i t t Mexico's  current  ccount eficit  rojected  o  widen  from less han  $2 billion a d isp t t in 1996 to  $6  billion   1997.
