The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Manufacturers' Shipments, Orders, and Inventories

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft continued to edge up last month.  Shipments of non-high-tech equipment increased moderately in May following two months of large gains.  In high-tech categories, shipments of computers and peripherals turned up modestly last month while shipments of communications equipment declined for the first time in six months.

New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 1.0 percent in May after having declined 1.9 percent in April.  Last month's increase was led by a jump of 8 percent in orders for communications equipment, which unwound a fraction of the sharp drop in April.  Orders of computers and peripherals, which increased 1.9 percent in May, also rebounded after having declined in April.  Orders for non-high-tech equipment, which have been less volatile recently than the high-tech categories, continued to move up in May; the level of these orders in May was 2Â¼ percent (not at an annual rate) above the first-quarter average.  Backlogs of unfilled orders for these items also continued to rise sharply.

A moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-has historically had some predictive power for industrial production.  In May, its three-month moving average was up 0.5 percent.

The book value of manufacturing durable goods inventories (which constitute about twothirds of total manufacturing inventories) increased $12 billion in May.  Shipments of total durable goods increased 2.6 percent, and the inventory-shipments ratio moved down to 1.32 months.
