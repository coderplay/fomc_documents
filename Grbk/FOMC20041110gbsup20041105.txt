The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Unemployment was little changed in October, but, hiring picked up again.  Private payroll employment increased almost 300,000 from a September level that is 81,000 higher than previously estimated.

According to the payroll survey, large increases in jobs in the professional and business services industries and in non-business services-such as health, education, and social assistance-contributed importantly to the step-up in private sector hiring.  Those industries accounted for 173,000 of the overall private payroll gain of 296,000.  But employment in retail trade, which has remained weak for some time, also turned up last month.  In addition, construction employment was sharply higher, boosted by a surge in jobs in specialty trades that was associated with hurricane repair work.  In contrast, manufacturing employment edged down for a second month in October, and the factory workweek slipped further.  However, the related industries of wholesale trade (6,000) and temporary help services (48,000) experienced noticeable increases, and our contacts in the temporary help industry continue to report strong demand from manufacturing clients. On balance, with the strong gain in private employment overall and the average workweek unchanged, aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent in October to a level ½ percent above the third-quarter average.

In the public sector, employment at state and local governments surged 47,000 in October after large increases in the preceding three months.  The strength in hiring has been in education-both at the state level and at the local level.  However, states also have been adding non-education jobs for most of this year following a long streak of reductions beginning around mid-2002 and ending early in 2004.  These recent trends seem consistent with the fiscal strengthening of the sector.

The household survey also reported a relatively strong monthly increase in employment and only a small rise in unemployment in October, but jobless rates and labor force participation rates for most demographic groups were little different than a month earlier. However, the number of individuals not in the labor force reporting that they want jobs jumped almost ½ million.  Other indicators of the strength of the labor market were mixed.  The number of job losers on temporary layoff remained below the levels of last

Labor Output per Hour

<!-- missing-text -->

Labor Productivity

Output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector is now reported to have increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the third quarter, a marked deceleration from the upward-revised second-quarter rate of 3.9 percent.  The BLS reported that output increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the third quarter and that hours worked increased at a 2.1 percent rate.  In the next release, the hours figure may be revised to incorporate information from today's labor market report.  More important, the BLS figure for output comes from the BEA's advance estimate of third-quarter GDP; our current estimate of output is a bit lower, mainly because of this week's data on construction put-in-place. We now estimate that productivity posted a gain at a rate of 1.5 percent last quarter. Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter, the BLS reported that productivity rose 3.1 percent, well below the increase of 5.2 percent over the preceding four quarters.

Labor Costs

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.3 percent in November to a level 2.6 percent higher than a year earlier.  The twelve-month change in this measure of wages is now up 1 percentage point from the low reached in February; it stood at 2.2 percent in October 2003.

Hourly compensation of all persons in the nonfarm business sector is estimated to have risen at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the third quarter, keeping the year-over-year

change in compensation per hour at 3.7 percent.   Over the four quarters ending in 1 2003:Q3, the rise in hourly compensation was 4.6 percent.  Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter but were up only 0.6 percent from a year earlier.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light motor vehicle dropped back ½ million units in October to an annual rate of 16.9 million units.  Sales of light trucks slipped ¾ million units, while sales of cars moved up.  The slowdown in light truck sales last month brought sales back to the average pace prevailing in the second and third quarters.

Among the Big Three automakers, Chrysler was the only firm to see an increase in sales in October.  Sales at GM tumbled 1 million units, while sales at Ford edged down.  The sharp decline at GM follows a steep run-up in the preceding month when special promotions boosted sales of GM light trucks.

Foreign manufacturers significantly outperformed the overall market in October.  Sales of foreign nameplates built in North America as well as those built elsewhere posted strong gains.  The increases were widespread and boosted the market share of Asian automakers to almost 36 percent.

The International Economy

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) recovered somewhat to $32 billion in September after recording a relatively subdued $26 billion inflow in August. For the third quarter, private inflows were $117 billion, similar to the inflows recorded in each of the first two quarters of the year. For the first nine months of the year, private inflows into U.S. securities amounted to $366 billion, close to the $372 inflows recorded for all of 2003.

Private foreign investors sold $8 billion in agency bonds (line 4b) in September but made record monthly purchases of $39 billion in corporate debt (line 4c).  These movements may reflect portfolio reshuffling following the news of investigations of accounting irregularities at Fannie Mae in September.  For the third quarter, net purchases of agency and corporate debt combined amounted to $99 billion, a record quarterly inflow.  Private foreign investors purchased $4 billion in Treasury securities in September (line 4a), about offsetting net sales recorded in August, and bringing quarterly inflows to a modest $14 billion. Foreigners were net sellers of U.S. equities in September for the second consecutive month (line 4d); for the quarter they acquired only $4 billion in U.S. equities.

Following a strong $29 billion inflow in August, net foreign official inflows (line 1) moderated only slightly to $20 billion in September, reflecting sizable inflows from Norway, Russia, and China. For the third quarter, foreign official inflows were $60 billion, about half of the blistering pace recorded in the first quarter of the year.  For the first nine months of the year, foreign official inflows were $262 billion, exceeding the $245 billion recorded for the year 2003.

U.S. investors made small net sales of foreign securities (line 5) in September, following small net purchases in August.  For the third quarter, U.S. investors acquired $19 billion in foreign securities, reflecting moderate purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) and stocks (line 5b), as well as an acquisition of stocks through a merger-related stock-swap (line 5c). A series break in reported net purchases of foreign bonds makes it difficult to compare current transactions in foreign bonds with the reported sales recorded in previous quarters.

The volatile banking sector (line 3) recorded an outflow of $25 billion in September and $22 billion for the third quarter, reversing much of the inflow recorded in the second quarter.
