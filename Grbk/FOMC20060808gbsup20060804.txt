The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Employment Situation

Employment on private nonfarm payrolls rose 113,000 in July.  The increase was similar to the upward-revised average monthly increase of 99,000 in the second quarter and down from the 169,000 average of the first quarter.  The unemployment rate moved up to 4.8 percent-0.1 percentage point above its second-quarter average-and the labor force participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent.  In July, jobless rates for younger workers, which tend to be more variable, were somewhat higher than during the second quarter while rates of workers aged 25 and older were unchanged from their second-quarter averages.

Employment in manufacturing fell 15,000 in July, although employment in the related industry of transportation and warehousing rose 10,000.  The construction industry added 6,000 jobs, with virtually all the strength continuing to come in the nonresidential components.  Employment in retail trade was unchanged in July after three months of substantial decline.  Employment in services continued to increase, with computer services, engineering services, and accommodations displaying particular vigor. Government employment was unchanged, on net, despite another increase in federal employment.  Employment at state and local governments, which had risen relatively strongly in the first quarter, declined in July, and the increases in May and June are now reported to have been much smaller than previously estimated.

The average workweek remained at 33.9 hours in July.  Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.1 percent and were 0.3 percent (not at an annual rate) above their second-quarter average.  With the revisions to earlier months, the rise in this measure of aggregate hours for the second quarter was revised up slightly to an annual rate of 2.6 percent.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.4 percent in July, close to the average monthly increase in the second quarter.  For the twelve months ending in July, average hourly earnings increased 3.8 percent, up from the 2.9 percent pace of the preceding twelve months.

Motor Vehicle Production

On August 4, industry production plans for the third quarter were reduced by 100,000 units (annual rate), to 11Â½ million units.  For July, scheduled production was cut quite

dramatically (by 800,000 units) and now stands at an annual rate of about 10.9 million units; however, much of this shortfall in production will be made up later in the third quarter.

The International Economy

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) moved up a touch in June, and the pace of official inflows for the first half of 2006 is well above the average pace of 2005.

Official inflows from OPEC (line 1.b) picked up in June, as did inflows from other oil-producing countries including Mexico, Norway, and Russia.  G-10 countries and the ECB (line 1a) continued to reduce their official holdings in the United States.

Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4) decreased slightly in June from May's robust level.  However, total second-quarter securities purchases were well below those of recent quarters because of very weak inflows in April.  Flows into U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a) picked up considerably in June, although purchases for the first half of 2006 were noticeably lower than those recorded in recent years.  Following extremely strong May inflows, private foreign purchases of agency bonds (line 4b) eased in June. Even with this easing, agency bond purchases in the first half of 2006 exceeded those recorded for all of 2005.  Foreign purchases of corporate bonds in June (line 4c) maintained the robust pace of recent months, and were primarily recorded against the United Kingdom.  Private foreigners on net sold corporate stocks in June (line 4d), and net purchases for the second quarter were nil.  Because of strong purchases in the first quarter, however, stock inflows for the first half of 2006 remained sizable relative to historical levels.

U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) fell back in June, although purchases for the first half of 2006 were slightly above last year's robust pace.  Flows into foreign bonds (line 5a) eased, and on net there were minimal stock flows (line 5b).  U.S. investors purchased a fair amount of European equities in June, but these purchases were offset by sales of Asian equities.

There were strong net outflows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) in June after two months of net inflows.  This volatility is not unusual, however, as the magnitude and direction of banking flows often vary significantly from month to month.
