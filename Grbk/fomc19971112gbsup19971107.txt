NONFINANCIAL ECONOMY

Labor Market Developments

Total nonfarm payroll employment increased 284,000 in  October, and the unemployment rate moved down 0.2 percentage point to 4.7 percent, its lowest level since October 1973.

In  the payroll survey, nearly all of  last month's employment gains were concentrated in the private sector; government employment rose only 2,000. Since July, private payrolls have increased 221,000 per  month on  average, similar to the 212,000 per month pace set in  the first half of the year. By  industry, factory payrolls jumped 54,000 last month--their largest gain during the current expansion. Within the service-producing sector, employment in  the services industries rose 100,000, led by sizable increases at computer services and engineering and management services establishments. Elsewhere, employment gains were generally in line with or  above recent trends.

The average workweek of private production or  nonsupervisory workers held steady at 34.5 hours, and aggregate weekly hours increased 0.2 percent. Hours growth in  manufacturing was particularly strong in October. The average workweek for manufacturing production workers rose 0.2 hour to 42.0 hours, and 2 aggregate weekly production worker hours rose 0.8 percent. In the service-producing sector, the  workweek held about steady, and hours growth was considerably more moderate.

Average hourly earnings of  production or nonsupervisory workers rose 0.5 percent last month, following a  0.3 percent rise in September. Wage increases over the past two months have been boosted by  the September 1  rise in  the minimum wage (from $4.75 per hour to $5.15 per hour). Both this year's minimum wage hike and the one that occurred on October 1, 1996, contributed to the pickup in the growth of average hourly earnings to 4  percent over the past twelve months; absent the most recent hike in the minimum wage, we  believe average hourly earnings would have been up about 3-3/4 percent from their level a  year ago.

The household survey continues to point to tight labor markets. The drop in  the aggregate unemployment rate was led by  a 0.5 percentage point decline in  the unemployment rate of  women aged 25 and older; the unemployment rate for  men aged 25 and older held steady, while the rate for teenagers--who account for only a  small share of the labor force--dropped sharply. Household employment posted a  179,000 gain last month, with the increase concentrated largely among teenagers. The labor force participation rate held nearly steady, edging down 0.1 percentage point to 66.9 percent. Except for its bump up to 67.3 percent in  March, the participation rate has fluctuated within a  tenth or  two of  67 percent for the past twelve months.

With this month's release, the BLS also announced that its preliminary estimate of next year's benchmark adjustment to the March 1997 employment count is 475,000, or 0.4 percent of total payroll employment. In addition, the BLS reports that its biasadjustment factor--the adjustment to the sample-based estimates that is intended to capture employment growth at establishments that are underrepresented in  the sample (including new  establishments and smaller establishments)--is 155,000 for the fourth quarter. Wholesale Inventories

Excluding motor vehicles, the book value of wholesale inventories rose at a  $32.9 billion annual rate in September, after growing at  a  revised $25.5 billion pace in  August. Nonvehicle sales of  merchant wholesalers rose 2  percent in September, and the inventory-sales ratio for wholesale trade excluding motor vehicles fell to 1.23 months--within the narrow range posted over the past year.

Most categories of nondurables posted small changes in September. However, stocks in the "other nondurable goods" category--which includes tobacco--continued to accumulate, increasing at a  rate of $9.5 billion. Nonetheless, the September increase was sharply lower than August when  we  suspect that wholesalers stocked up on  tobacco products in advance of September's price increase. Among durables, wholesale inventories in  the professional and commercial equipment and supplies category also contributed to the buildup, advancing $8.3 billion after having fallen in the preceding two months. This strength is  consistent with the continuing strong growth in demand for office and computing equipment. Other industries that registered noteworthy stock

increases were  machinery ($8.0 billion) and electrical goods ($4.9 billion).

The September wholesale inventory accumulation was substantially above the BEA's assumption of $12.3 billion. If other data come in as  the BEA  assumed, overall inventory investment in 1997:Q3 would be revised up about $7  billion, about twice what the staff assumed in  our Greenbook estimate.
