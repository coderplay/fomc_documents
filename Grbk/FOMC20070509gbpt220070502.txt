Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The incoming data suggest that economic activity is continuing to expand at a belowtrend pace.  Payroll employment has continued to post solid gains, and manufacturing production stepped up in March after exhibiting considerable softness over the preceding several months.  However, housing construction remains under pressure from weak demand and outsized inventories of unsold homes, and consumer spending appears to have moved onto a slower growth track in recent months.  In addition, business fixed investment has remained subdued, although the exceptional weakness in some key categories of equipment spending may be starting to dissipate.  Total PCE inflation was pushed up in March by rising energy prices, while the twelve-month change in core PCE prices stood at 2.1 percent, just a tenth above the reading for the preceding year.

Labor Market Developments

Labor demand decelerated in the first quarter but remained relatively strong.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased an average of 124,000 per month, about 40,000 below the average pace recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006.  The gains in private employment, in combination with a relatively stable average workweek, contributed to a 1.5 percent (annual rate) increase in aggregate hours in the first quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in March, to 4.4 percent, and the labor force participation rate held steady at 66.2 percent. The number of job losers unemployed less than five weeks as a percentage of employment-a proxy for the layoff rate-fell in March after having spiked around the turn of the year.

Other indicators of labor demand have remained in a range consistent with moderate employment growth.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance stood at 332,000 for the week ending April 21, just a bit above its fourthquarter average.  Layoff announcements, as measured by Challenger, Gray, and Christmas, have stayed relatively low.  According to Manpower and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), hiring plans have moved down recently but continue to occupy the favorable range that has prevailed since 2004.  Similarly, job openings and new hires, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, edged down in February but remain at high levels.

Measures of labor market tightness suggest that little has changed lately.  The percentage of firms reporting to the NFIB that they had a hard-to-fill position was about flat in March and was about equal to the average level in 2006.  According to the Conference

Board, households' assessments of job availability have not moved much in recent months.  Similarly, the number of individuals who remain on unemployment insurance rolls until their benefits expire (the exhaustion rate) has changed little.

The staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the first quarter.  This modest gain would leave the rate of increase over the past four quarters at 1 percent, 1 percentage point lower than the pace recorded during the preceding four quarters.

Industrial Production

Total industrial production (IP) rose 1.4 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter after a similarly sized decline in the fourth quarter.  The flattening out of production over the past two quarters reflected inventory-related adjustments in a variety of industries, including light motor vehicles, construction supplies, and several upstream materials industries, such as steel and semiconductors.  Although indicators of the inventory situation have been mixed, the bulk of the evidence suggests that businesses have significantly reduced-though probably not eliminated-the overhangs that cropped up in late 2006.

In March, IP declined 0.2 percent after a considerable rise in February; the change in IP in March was reduced ¾ percentage point by a steep drop in utilities output because of a sizable swing in weather conditions from unseasonably cold temperatures in February to

unseasonably mild temperatures in March.  In the manufacturing sector, production increased 0.7 percent in March after having declined, on balance, over the previous six months.  The gains in manufacturing IP in March were spread widely and pushed up the factory operating rate 0.4 percentage point, to 80.1 percent, a level 0.3 percentage point above its 1972-2006 average.

The limited weekly information on IP for April suggests that the total index was likely boosted by an increase in electricity output and the scheduled pickup in motor vehicle assemblies; weekly data on output in other industries-principally crude oil, petroleum refining, steel, and meat products-appear likely to have been a small drag on balance.

The output of high-tech industries rose more than 3 percent in March after several months of sluggish gains.  Much of the weakness earlier in the quarter reflected declining semiconductor production as manufacturers moved to correct inventory imbalances that arose when cell phone sales softened unexpectedly and as the accumulation of chips needed for the roll-out of computers running the new Microsoft Vista operating system ran its course.   Although semiconductor inventories appear to have remained elevated 1 throughout the quarter, production turned up in March.  Intel's latest revenue guidance points to a moderate increase in microprocessor production in the second quarter.

Elsewhere in the high-tech sector, production accelerated during the first quarter.  Gartner reports that faster gains in the production of computers were related to the release of the consumer version of Microsoft Vista, which had led some buyers to delay purchases until this year.  On the business side, sales of small servers moved up smartly, but production of large servers decelerated, a move that Gartner attributes to a nearly completed replacement cycle.  The output of communications equipment rose 30 percent (annual rate) in the first quarter, a marked step-up from the second half of last year.  However, this rate of increase in production is not likely to continue for much longer in light of the relatively moderate increase in capital expenditures planned by telecommunication service providers (TSPs) this year. 2

Inventories of Light Vehicles

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The production of motor vehicles and parts fell 8½ percent in the first quarter, as assemblies sank to their lowest level since the third quarter of 1993.  However, with inventories back down to desirable levels at the end of the quarter, assemblies of light vehicles are estimated to have picked up to an annual rate of about 11 million units in April and are scheduled to remain at about this level in May and June.  Despite the sizable increase in production, days' supply of light vehicles should remain in check this quarter if sales remain close to the first-quarter pace.   Meanwhile, production of medium 3 and heavy trucks has continued to move lower in response to a falloff in demand after the new EPA regulations went into effect earlier this year.

Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products, output rose in March in nearly all of the major market groups.  The production of consumer goods increased ½ percent:  Continued strength in nondurables accompanied a small gain in durables that followed weak production earlier in the quarter.  The output of business equipment rose 0.8 percent in March, thereby partly reversing declines over the previous two months. The production of construction supplies popped up in March, though it remained well below levels observed from late 2005 to mid-2006; the March gain was likely due, at least in part, to unseasonably warm weather.  The output of materials rose 0.6 percent, a move that likely reflects the recent rise in construction supplies and the upturn in motor vehicle assemblies in April.  The only major market group that declined in March was defense and space equipment, which was pulled down by a one-month strike at a Northrop Grumman shipyard in Pascagoula, Mississippi.

Near-term indicators suggest modest production gains in coming months.  In April, the new orders diffusion index from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) jumped, while the corresponding indexes from the various regional surveys were little changed on balance.  In addition, a variety of materials-related industries-such as primary metals and plastics and rubber products-should benefit from the scheduled step-up in motor vehicle assemblies this quarter.  However, the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders has declined, on balance, since the end of last summer.

Light Motor Vehicles

Sales of automobiles and light trucks averaged an annual rate of 16½ million units in the first quarter, a little above the pace in the fourth quarter of last year and the same as that over 2006 as a whole.

. 4 In April, sales declined a bit, mainly because of lower sales of foreign-produced vehicles.  As a result, the Big Three's domestic market share moved back up to its level of last year.

The Conference Board measure of new car purchases improved in April, while the Reuters/University of Michigan index of car-buying attitudes remained in the neutral range seen over the past several months.  According to the Reuters/Michigan survey, high gasoline prices are not as big a deterrent to car buying as they were in 2006, although respondents to recent surveys have expressed concern about higher financing rates. Manufacturers' pricing incentives for light vehicles remained at a relatively low level in April.

Consumer Spending

Real personal consumption expenditures increased at an annual rate of 3¾ percent in the first quarter, but spending growth slowed over the course of the quarter, in part because of swings in weather-related outlays on energy goods (such as fuel oil) and energy services (such as natural gas and electricity).  Real spending on goods other than motor vehicles, which had shown exceptional vigor late last year, was little changed, on balance, between December and March.  However, real outlays on non-energy services were reported to have posted solid gains, especially in March.

Consumer spending appears to have entered the second quarter on a soft note.  Chain store sales were up just a little, on balance, in recent weeks.  In addition, the Conference Board and the Reuters/Michigan surveys reported small declines in consumer confidence in April, perhaps because of the run-up in gasoline prices.  Even so, both sentiment measures remain consistent with modest gains in spending in the near term.

With regard to the fundamentals, real disposable personal income rose at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter.  Although roughly half of this gain reflects an estimate by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of unusually large bonus payments and stock option exercises in January, wages and salaries increased solidly, on average, over

February and March.  Consumer spending has also continued to draw support from the increases in household wealth that have occurred over the past two years, although the boost to spending from wealth has likely been offset to some extent by the lagged effects of the upward trend in borrowing costs since 2004.  In the first quarter of this year, the wealth-income ratio likely ticked down, as the stock market rose only a little and house prices remained soft.  However, much of the lost ground has probably since been made up as a result of the surge in stock prices in April.

The personal saving rate averaged negative 1 percent in the first quarter after having been in the vicinity of negative 1¼ percent to negative 1½ percent over the preceding three quarters.  All else being equal, this year's annual retail sales revision implies a small downward adjustment to consumer spending and a small upward adjustment to the saving rate in recent years.  The revision is expected to raise the saving rate in the first quarter about ¼ percentage point, but it is not expected to significantly alter its pattern over the past few quarters.

Housing

Residential construction activity remains soft overall as builders attempt to work off an elevated inventory of unsold new homes.  Recent readings on home sales suggest that housing demand has continued to weaken, and the tightening of lending standards for nonprime borrowers that began in February will likely further restrain home sales in the coming months.

Single-family housing starts rose 2 percent in March, and adjusted permit issuance in this sector increased.  Unusually warm and dry weather almost certainly boosted the level of single-family starts in March; it may have raised permit issuance as well.  Although the correlation between permit issuance and weather patterns is not typically strong, the only increases in the number of permits issued since September 2005 have been in January 2006, December 2006, and March 2007-all months that were unseasonably warm.

The incoming data on home sales are sending mixed signals about the current tenor of housing demand.  Although existing home sales declined in March, that drop followed sizable increases in January and February, and the level of sales in March was only slightly below the steady pace that prevailed in the second half of 2006.  New home sales present a considerably less sanguine view of demand:  They fell sharply in the first two months of the year and recovered only a bit in March, developments that left their level about 14 percent below the average of the second half of last year.

The recent tightening of lending standards may have exerted some restraint on new home sales in March, and it will likely show up in the existing home sales statistics (which are based on closings) in the second quarter.  The decline in the pending home sales index in March may partly reflect reduced sales to nonprime borrowers.  The four-week moving average of the MBA index of mortgage purchase applications has also slipped a little since the end of February.   However, in contrast to the difficulties faced by nonprime 5 borrowers and lenders, relatively low mortgage rates should help to support housing demand among prime borrowers:  The average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages is currently about 60 basis points below the level of last July, while average rates for oneyear adjustable-rate mortgages are about 30 basis points lower.

Combined with a large remaining inventory of new homes for sale, the contraction in new home sales has noticeably raised the months' supply of new homes for sale. Relative to the three-month average pace of sales, the months' supply in March was more than 60 percent above the high end of the relatively narrow range it occupied from 1997 to 2005.  Moreover, these published figures probably understate the true inventory overhang in this sector because they do not account for last year's surge in canceled sales, which return homes to the unsold inventory but are not incorporated in the official statistics.  High inventories and low sales in March suggest that homebuilders may have to reduce their construction plans even further to work off their excess inventories of unsold homes.

House-price appreciation continues to slow.  On a constant-quality basis, the average price of new homes was 5 percent above year-earlier levels in the first quarter, compared with an average annual increase of nearly 7 percent in the preceding three years. Furthermore, these figures may understate the actual deceleration in the cost to purchasers of new homes because homebuilders have reportedly stepped up their use of nonprice measures-such as granting more-favorable mortgage terms, paying closing costs, and including optional upgrades at no cost-to bolster sales and unload inventory. For existing homes, the Case-Shiller home-price index-which uses a methodology similar to that of the OFHEO index but is limited to sales in ten large U.S. cities-has decelerated substantially since last summer, slipping further in the first two months of this year, and pointing to some further deceleration in the OFHEO index in the first

quarter.  Meanwhile, the average price of existing homes sold-which does not adjust for changes in the quality of homes-moved down in March to a level that was 1.1 percent below that of a year earlier.

Equipment and Software

Real spending on equipment and software (E&amp;S) rose at an annual rate of less than 2 percent last quarter after having fallen 4¾ percent in the fourth quarter.  Spending on high-tech equipment posted a substantial increase in the first quarter.  But spending on transportation equipment was dragged down by a plunge in purchases of medium and heavy trucks.  Outlays outside these categories continued to contract steeply, though the upturn in shipments and orders in March may be a signal that equipment spending is starting to improve as we move into the second quarter.

To be sure, the fundamental determinants of equipment spending have turned less supportive in recent quarters in light of the sharp deceleration in business output.  But with robust corporate cash reserves and with the user cost of high-tech goods continuing to decline, the fundamentals in the aggregate are still consistent with a faster underlying pace of equipment spending than has been seen in recent quarters.  In addition, the deterioration in surveys of business conditions that was evident in 2006 appears to have ended; in fact, the ISM index has rebounded lately.

Real spending on high-tech E&amp;S expanded at an annual rate of 20 percent last quarter, and sharp gains were observed in all major categories.  Real outlays on computers rose at an annual rate of more than 50 percent, in part because of the retail release of Microsoft Vista in January.  As noted, the IP index for computers-the major input into the BEA estimate of computer spending-increased significantly in the first quarter, and shipments and imports also posted solid gains.   The BEA advance estimate of spending 6 on software, which is based in part on outlays for computers, also showed a substantial increase-in fact, anecdotal reports on company earnings point to an even larger number than the BEA estimate.  In addition, purchases of communications equipment-which tend to be volatile quarter to quarter-sped up after a fourth-quarter dip.

Business Conditions

<!-- missing-text -->

Real business outlays on transportation equipment declined at an annual rate of 13½ percent last quarter.  Although domestic spending on aircraft jumped after three weak quarters, spending on motor vehicles contracted significantly as the tightening of emissions standards that took effect in January led to a dramatic drop in purchases of medium and heavy trucks.  Another sharp decline in truck orders in March suggests that these purchases will fall further in the second quarter.

Business investment in equipment other than high-tech and transportation dropped at an annual rate of 8 percent in the first quarter after a fall of nearly 5 percent in the previous quarter.  The weakness in this broad category appears to have been especially pronounced around the turn of the year and to have lessened somewhat over the course of the quarter. In March, shipments of construction and motor-vehicle-related equipment (such as metalworking machinery and construction machinery), which had played a major role in the earlier weakness, continued to decrease.  Orders for these items rose sharply as a result of a surprising jump in bookings for construction machinery.  That said, reports from our contacts suggest that demand for construction-related machinery and supplies remains weak.  Outside of construction and motor vehicles, orders and shipments both posted widespread-albeit modest-gains in March.

Nonresidential Construction

Real outlays for nonresidential construction excluding drilling and mining regained some steam in the first quarter after having hit a lull in late 2006:  After incorporating data on construction spending in March, we estimate that they rose at an annual rate of 12 percent.   The fundamentals in this sector remain solid and point to further increases in 7 the near term, although they will likely be smaller than that recorded in the first quarter of this year.  Vacancy rates in the industrial and office categories have moved down over the past few years.  In the retail sector, the vacancy rate has drifted up since the end of 2005 but remains well below its peak in 2002.  Furthermore, the architectural billings indexwhich is correlated with changes in nonresidential construction about six months hencerebounded in the second half of last year. 8

partly reflect the net decline in energy prices since last summer.  In April, the total number of drilling rigs in operation was flat, suggesting that drilling and mining investment did not change significantly early in the second quarter.

Business Inventories

After factoring in the most recent information on manufacturing inventories, we estimate that real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of $27 billion in the first quarter, $13 billion less than in the fourth quarter of 2006. 9 The apparent downshift in inventory investment has helped to reduce the overhangs that emerged in late 2006, although the available measures provide conflicting signals on how much progress has been made to date.  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales in the manufacturing and trade sector (excluding motor vehicles) was little changed between September and February, and the ratio for the manufacturing sector remained elevated in March.  In contrast, information from the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that the run-up in days' supply was reversed by the end of March, largely eliminating the overhangs.  In addition, the ISM customers' inventories index remained below 50 for a second month in April, indicating that the net number of firms who view the level of their customers' inventories as too high has dropped back from its elevated readings over the previous two quarters.

Federal Government Sector

Incoming data suggest that the federal unified budget deficit continues to narrow, but that revenue growth may be moderating a bit from the fast pace of recent years.  The moderation in revenues has primarily been concentrated in corporate payments, which appear to have decelerated after a period of very rapid increases.  Indeed, the 12 percent rise in corporate receipts in March was only about half the size of the gains seen over the past year. 10 And according to daily Treasury data, corporate receipts in April, which are essentially the first quarterly estimates on 2007 liabilities, were no higher than they were in April 2006, consistent with an easing in profits growth.  In contrast, individual income tax and social insurance collections remained strong in the first quarter.  In addition, daily Treasury data point to another solid increase in withheld individual and social insurance taxes in April.  Nonwithheld individual income tax payments in April and early May-

which are largely net final payments on 2006 liabilities-were running around 15 percent higher than a year earlier.

Federal outlays in March were 5½ percent above their year-earlier level as defense spending continued to fall short of expectations.  The level of defense spending in recent months has been low compared with fiscal-year projections by the Administration; it has also been below projections from the Congressional Budget Office that assume enactment of an additional $100 billion in budget authority for defense in fiscal 2007.  In the NIPA, real federal spending fell at an annual rate of 3 percent in the first quarter, as a 6½ percent (annual rate) drop in real defense expenditures more than offset a moderate increase in nondefense purchases.

On the legislative front, the Congress passed a $124 billion supplemental near the end of April, of which about $100 billion was for the Department of Defense.  It was vetoed by President Bush, and a revised bill is currently in the works.  We believe that the weakness in defense outlays in the first quarter reflects the usual volatility of these purchases and is not attributable to the delay in enacting the supplemental.  Nonetheless, some reports have suggested that spending may be constrained in the second quarter if these additional funds are not enacted soon.

State and Local Government Sector

Consistent with the sector's generally favorable financial situation, near-term indicators suggest brisk growth in the state and local government sector in the first quarter of this year.  Real construction outlays rose at an annual rate of about 10 percent, and employment increased 25,000 per month, on average-similar to the relatively strong pace of hiring in 2006.  After factoring in the March construction data, we estimate that real state and local purchases increased at an annual rate of 4 percent in the first quarter, compared with a rise of 3¼ percent in the advance NIPA release.

State and local revenue inflows have remained fairly robust but have decelerated a bit from the torrid pace in 2005.  According to the Census Bureau, state tax revenues posted another sizable increase in the fourth quarter of 2006, and the National Conference of State Legislators reported that revenues are coming in above expectations in many states. At the local level, property tax receipts have continued to rise rapidly despite the deceleration in house values and the increasing political pressure to reduce property taxes; in 2006, twenty-two states moved to reduce property tax collections, and virtually all ballot measures for property tax relief were approved by voters.  The continued

strength in property tax revenue likely reflects the fact that many localities are subject to state limits on the annual increases in total property tax payments and property value assessments; thus, they may continue to experience rising revenues from property taxes for another few years as tax bills catch up to the earlier increases in market prices.

Prices

The total PCE price index rose 0.4 percent in March after a similar increase in February. The March increase was driven largely by an increase of more than 6 percent in the price of energy, while the February increase was more broadly distributed across categories. On a twelve-month-change basis, PCE price inflation was 2.4 percent in March, down 0.5 percentage point from a year earlier; a deceleration in energy prices more than accounted for the reduction.

Core PCE prices were unchanged in March after a 0.3 percent increase in February; over the past three months, these prices have risen at an annual pace of 2.4 percent.  The low March reading was largely the result of flat prices for medical services, which had increased sharply in the previous two months, and a decline in the prices for apparel, which tend to be especially volatile this time of year.  On balance, price increases in other categories were also a touch lower than in other recent months, most notably in lodging away from home, tobacco, and various non-motor-vehicle-related durable goods. Smoothing through the high-frequency movements, the twelve-month change in the core PCE price index was 2.1 percent in March, just a touch higher than the increase over the year-earlier period.

Over the twelve months ending in March, the core CPI accelerated noticeably more than the core PCE price measure.  Accelerations in the costs of housing and medical services have pushed up both measures over the past year.  Taking account of the relative weights in the two series, housing costs have had an especially large effect on the CPI, while medical costs have had an especially large effect on the PCE measure.  However, the acceleration in core PCE price has been muted by a deceleration in its nonmarket portion-in fact, market-based core PCE price inflation has increased nearly as much as core CPI inflation over the past year.

The energy component of the PCE price index increased substantially in March after a much smaller rise in February.  The twelve-month change in energy prices was 3½ percent, appreciably less than the 17 percent rise during the preceding twelve months. The March increase in energy prices was driven by a 10½ percent jump in the price for

motor fuel, although prices for natural gas and heating fuel also rose noticeably. Inventories of gasoline have tumbled since the early part of the year because of high demand and both scheduled and unscheduled refinery outages.  In response to the inventory declines, gasoline margins have increased significantly over the past few months.  In part for this reason, available survey data point to a continued increase in motor fuel prices during April.

The PCE price index for food and beverages rose 0.3 percent in March after much more rapid increases in the previous two months.  Compared with twelve months earlier, food prices were up 3¼ percent, a step-up from the 2½ percent increase over the preceding twelve-month period.  Prices for meat have risen appreciably in recent months, likely because of higher costs for feed, most notably corn.  Since the end of March, however, corn prices have retreated somewhat on news of a considerable increase in acreage intended for planting.  However, freeze damage affecting winter wheat and some fruit crops in the South may boost food prices in the next few months.

Broader measures of inflation show a slowing of inflation relative to four quarters ago. Despite the small increase in core PCE price inflation, the price index for GDP less food and energy decelerated, reflecting slower rates of increase in the prices for other components of final demand, especially construction.

As measured by the Reuters/Michigan index, the median expectation for year-ahead inflation moved up ¼ percentage point in April, to 3.3 percent.  This step-up is consistent with the larger, energy-driven increases in overall consumer prices of late.  Median fiveto ten-year expectations have moved up 0.2 percentage point, to 3.1 percent, but this level is still in the narrow range seen over the past few years.  Inflation compensation from TIPS is about 0.1 percentage point higher than at the time of the March Greenbook.

At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index (PPI) for core intermediate goods increased just 0.2 percent for a second month in March.  Over the twelve months ending in March, the index for core intermediate materials increased 3½ percent, 1¼ percentage points less than the year-earlier increase.  Part of this slowdown reflected a deceleration in the prices for a number of energy-intensive goods, such as industrial chemicals and plastics.

Commodity prices continue to trend upward.  The Commodity Research Bureau's spot index of industrial materials is up 3¾ percent since the March Greenbook, and the

Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has risen 3½ percent.  Strong international demand has helped drive up metals prices, which continue to contribute to the rise in both indexes.

Labor Costs

Measures of hourly compensation have been heavily influenced by special factors-as well as by a good deal of noise-in recent quarters.  But smoothing through the volatility in the data, the underlying pace of compensation gains seems to have picked up somewhat.  To be sure, the employment cost index (ECI) for private industry workers rose at an annual rate of just 2¼ percent over the three months ending in March. However, the low reading stemmed largely from a sharp drop in contributions to retirement plans as the strong performance of the stock market in 2006, along with a high level of employer contributions over the past several years, boosted the funding levels of defined-benefit plans and allowed firms to lower their payments to these plans in early 2007.  Even with the very small increase for the three months ending in March, the twelve-month change in the ECI moved up to 3¼ percent, ½ percentage point more than the increase over the preceding twelve months.

In contrast to the performance of benefits, the wages and salaries component of the ECI picked up noticeably in March.  The three-month increase in wages-which was at an annual rate of 4¼ percent-was the largest in several years, and it lifted the twelve-month change in this series to 3½ percent, 1¼ percentage points more than the increase over the year-earlier period.  Average hourly earnings for production or nonsupervisory workers have also accelerated over the past couple of years, although the rate of increase shows some signs of leveling out in recent months:  Over the twelve months ending in March, average hourly earnings increased 4 percent, ½ percentage point more than a year earlier.

Like the ECI, hourly compensation in the nonfarm business as measured in the Productivity and Costs (P&amp;C) release appears to have moved up only a little in the first quarter-indeed, using the most recent NIPA data, we estimate that this measure rose at an annual rate of just 1¾ percent after an increase of more than 8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2006.  This pattern reflects the BEA's incorporation of an assumed $50 billion in bonus payments and stock options into its estimate of wage and salary accruals in the

fourth quarter and the subsequent unwinding of these one-time payments in the first quarter. 11 Smoothing through the large spikes in early 2006 and 2007, we estimate that P&amp;C hourly compensation rose at an annual rate of 4 percent over the six quarters since mid-2005-about the same pace as during the preceding three years.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Over the intermeeting period, financial markets largely recovered from the turbulence that preceded the March meeting of the FOMC.  On net, investors pushed up somewhat the expected path of monetary policy beyond the near term.  Market participants now expect between 75 basis points and 100 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, a little less than at the time of the March FOMC meeting.  On balance, nominal Treasury yields edged up slightly along the term structure.  Inflation compensation based on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) were little changed even as oil prices rose markedly. Equity prices climbed steeply amid solid earnings reports and improved sentiment, more than reversing the declines in the previous intermeeting period.  Risk spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were about unchanged, while spreads on speculativegrade corporate bonds narrowed somewhat.  Delinquency rates on subprime variable-rate home mortgages remained elevated, but rates for the much larger group of prime borrowers stayed low.

Policy Expectations and Interest Rates

Market participants largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its March meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged.  Nevertheless, the expected path for monetary policy moved lower on the announcement, as investors apparently were surprised by the somewhat softer tone of the description of economic conditions in the accompanying statement, and by the replacement of the reference to 'additional firming' with language that was interpreted as more balanced.  However, data releases, sent mixed signals and short-term interest rates rose a little, as subsequent FOMC communicationsincluding the Chairman's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee, speeches by various FOMC members, and the minutes of the March meeting-were seen as emphasizing the Committee's concern about upside risks to inflation.  Market participants attach only a small probability to a cut in the target federal funds rate at the May FOMC meeting.  Beyond the near term, investors pushed up somewhat the expected path of monetary policy.  Market participants now seem to anticipate between 75 basis points and 100 basis points of policy easing by the end of 2008, a little less than at the time of the March FOMC meeting.

Option-implied measures of market uncertainty about the path of policy were little changed over the intermeeting period and remained within recent historical ranges. Implied probability distributions for the target funds rate between six and twelve months ahead remained skewed toward lower rates.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on nominal Treasury securities edged up at all maturities.  On net, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead were little changed despite a significant rise in oil prices.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Over the intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes climbed about 5 percent.  The rise was driven by solid first-quarter earnings reports, which mostly exceeded expectations.  Overall market sentiment also seemed to improve some because of reduced anxiety about spillovers from problems in the subprime mortgage market.  Equity prices rose in most industries, although energy firms outperformed the broader market.  Implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 generally trended lower and is now only a little above the historically low levels that prevailed early this year.  The spread between the twelvemonth forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-narrowed a touch but remained within its range over the past few years.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, and so their spreads were little changed at fairly low levels.  Meanwhile, spreads on speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed about 25 basis points.  Spreads on bonds for five investment banks with reported exposure to the subprime mortgage market-all of which carry an investmentgrade rating-remained slightly above the levels that prevailed earlier this year.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

On the basis of reports from more than 300 companies, earnings per share for firms in the S&amp;P 500 are estimated to have increased 9 percent through the year ending in the first quarter-the first single-digit rate of increase since 2003.  A further deceleration in corporate earnings had been widely anticipated, and, indeed, more than the usual share of company reports exceeded analysts' forecasts.  Through mid-April, analysts seem to have made just small revisions to forecasts of year-ahead earnings for the S&amp;P 500 as a whole.

Overall, the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to be solid.  Balance sheet liquidity ticked up from an already elevated level in the fourth quarter, while aggregate corporate leverage remained low.  In March, the volume of bond upgrades significantly outpaced that of downgrades, and the realized six-month trailing bond default rate stayed near zero.  In the fourth quarter of last year, the delinquency rate on C&amp;I loans at commercial banks was the lowest in more than a decade.  The near-term outlook for

corporate credit quality also remains good, as the aggregate year-ahead default rate based on the KMV model stayed low in March.

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations slowed in April from its torrid firstquarter pace.  Acquisition-related financing has continued to fuel the issuance of both investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds.  Commercial paper outstanding declined last month, but C&amp;I loans accelerated, a pattern broadly consistent with the easing of some terms on such loans that was reported in the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Overall, net debt financing in April was well below the volume in the first quarter.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations was tepid again in April.  The calendar of planned offerings suggests that the pace of IPOs will pick up in coming months.  Private equity issuance is estimated to have increased a bit in the first quarter, as leveraged buyout activity continued to climb.  Even so, given that estimated share repurchases and actual retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions continued at near-record levels, equity retirements likely dwarfed total issuance again in the first quarter.

Commercial Real Estate

Total commercial mortgage borrowing has likely remained robust so far this year, as indicated by the pace of commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) issuance. Gross CMBS issuance was quite strong in the first quarter, and the issuance calendar points to a similar pace in the current quarter.

Spreads on BBB-rated CMBS have soared since late February, reportedly in part because of reduced demand for collateralized debt obligations, which, in recent years, have been large purchasers of these tranches of CMBS.  Rising leverage in pools of commercial mortgages underlying CMBS may also have been a factor in the recent widening in spreads.  The share of newly securitized commercial mortgages with loan-to-value ratios at or above 0.8 has increased significantly over the past several months.  In response, rating agencies recently announced plans to increase the level of credit support required for CMBS.  Despite the greater leverage, increases in commercial property rents have kept the ratio of mortgage payments to rental income on newly securitized commercial mortgages within its range of the past several years.  In March, delinquency rates on CMBS remained very low.

Increases in commercial property prices in the first quarter led to a further decline in the ratio of net operating income to property prices.  The spread of this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield-a rough measure of the risk premium on commercial real estate assets-declined in the first quarter to its lowest level since 1992.

Household Finance

Over the intermeeting period, interest rates available to prime borrowers for thirty-year fixed-rate and one-year adjustable-rate mortgages increased slightly, and for both, the spreads over Treasuries were little changed.  The growth of home mortgage debt likely slowed a bit further in the first quarter, as home price appreciation appears to have remained sluggish.  Growth of consumer credit continued to be moderate early in the year.

The most recent data continued to show very low delinquency rates on prime and subprime fixed-rate mortgages.  However, in March, delinquencies on subprime variablerate mortgages were roughly unchanged at high levels.  Foreclosures started on properties climbed in the fourth quarter; all told, we estimate that about 1 million properties began the foreclosure process in 2006.  A substantial increase in the subprime segment has accounted for most of the increase in new foreclosures overall.

Respondents to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported having tightened standards on residential mortgages over the past three months, particularly for nontraditional and subprime loans.  Spreads on indexes of subprime mortgage credit default swaps remained in the elevated range that has prevailed since late February. Spreads for newly issued securities used to fund subprime mortgage pools also stayed elevated as investors continue to scrutinize pools more closely.

The handful of monthly indicators of home prices available for the first quarter suggest a very small aggregate price increase.  The trajectory of expected home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets, derived from futures quotes on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller homeprice index, was essentially unchanged over the intermeeting period and continues to imply an expectation of moderate price declines in these markets over 2007.  On balance, the combination of solid stock market returns and sluggish home-price appreciation has left the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income at a relatively high level in recent quarters.  Propelled by strong inflows to both equity and bond funds, net inflows to long-term mutual funds have been approaching record levels so far this year.

Treasury and Agency Finance

Nonwithheld federal receipts have been very strong this tax season, and the Treasury scaled back regular issuance of bill and coupon securities in anticipation of further strong revenues.  During the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned two- and five-year nominal securities as well as five-year TIPS and reopened January's ten-year TIPS offering; most issues were well received.  At its mid-quarter refunding, the Treasury announced that it was discontinuing issuance of the three-year nominal note-a move that most primary dealers reportedly had anticipated.  The proportion of the issues awarded to indirect bidders-a rough gauge of interest by foreign investors-was somewhat below recent values, while custody holdings by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of foreign official institutions edged up over the intermeeting period. Although secondary-market volumes were subdued last month, bid-ask spreads were in normal range, and markets functioned well.

Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's stock prices rose over the intermeeting period even as the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight continued to express concerns over internal controls at the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and as regulatoryreform legislation moved ahead in the Congress.  However, yields on long-term agency debt fell slightly relative to those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity, and GSE credit default swap spreads held steady.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed in April from the rapid first-quarter pace.  Advance refundings, which surged in March because of a drop in interest rates, decelerated last month.  New capital issuance also moderated in April; the bulk of the proceeds were targeted to support spending on education and transportation.  Short-term issuance was negligible last month, a development consistent with healthy state and local budgets and the typical seasonal pattern.  The credit quality of municipal bonds remained solid, as the number of bond-rating upgrades continued to outpace the number of downgrades.  The ratio of municipal bond yields to those on comparable Treasury securities remained at the low end of its range over the past decade.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 accelerated to an average annual growth rate of 9 percent during March and April. The acceleration was due primarily to faster growth in liquid deposits, which were likely boosted in April by tax-related flows.  Retail money market funds surged at the beginning of March after the turbulence in financial markets in late February, but flows slowed in

April.  In both March and April, small time deposits expanded moderately, while currency continued to grow slowly, largely because of soft foreign demand.

Growth of commercial bank credit continued to be solid during March and April but was down a bit from earlier in the year.  The slowdown primarily reflected reduced lending to households, most notably a contraction in residential real estate loans on banks' books. However, the runoff in residential real estate loans was attributable, in part, to sales of such loans to nonbank institutions-transactions that frequently cause large swings in this category of loans.  Adjusted for securitizations, consumer loans have also slowed of late. The pace of lending to businesses picked up a bit, on balance, as C&amp;I loans accelerated and commercial real estate loans continued to expand briskly.

Appendix

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices

The April 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  In light of recent developments in the subprime mortgage market, banks were queried separately about standards on and demand for prime, nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgages.  This appendix is based on responses from fifty-one domestic banks and nineteen foreign banking institutions.

Overall, the respondent banks reported mixed changes in lending standards and terms over the past three months and somewhat weaker demand for most loan types. Domestic and foreign institutions indicated that they had eased terms on commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans over the past three months and that credit standards on such loans had changed little.  Domestic respondents reported that they had tightened credit standards on commercial real estate loans over the previous three months.  Demand for both C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans at domestic banks was reportedly weaker, on net, in the April survey.  By contrast, foreign institutions noted that the demand for both C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans had changed little over the survey period.

With regard to loans to households, a relatively small net fraction of respondents reported having tightened lending standards on prime residential mortgages over the past three months, while considerable net fractions of respondents indicated that they had tightened lending standards on nontraditional and subprime mortgage loans.  The banks reported that demand for subprime residential mortgages was little changed, on net, whereas significant net fractions of respondents reported that they had seen weaker demand for both prime and nontraditional residential mortgages over the past three months.  A significant net percentage of institutions also reported weaker demand for consumer loans over the same period.

Business Lending

In the April survey, domestic institutions reported that lending standards on C&amp;I loans to large and middle-market firms were about unchanged, on net, over the past three months. The respondents noted, however, that they had further eased some terms on C&amp;I loans to such firms over the same period.  About half of respondents-a slightly larger net fraction than in the January survey-indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the previous three months, and smaller net fractions reported that they had reduced the costs of credit lines and eased loan covenants.

* The questions on residential mortgages were separated into three questions (for prime, nontraditional, and subprime mortgages) in the latest survey. Responses to the new questions are shown separately. For the lines, values for 2007:Q2 have been constructed using  weights based on answers to questions in the July 2006 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey (see text note for details).

Credit standards on C&amp;I loans to small firms were also reportedly unchanged, on balance, in the April survey.  Nonetheless, about one-third of the domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the past three months, and smaller net fractions reported that they had reduced the cost of credit lines and reduced premiums charged on riskier loans.

As they did in previous surveys, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that their standards on C&amp;I loans were essentially unchanged.  However, significant net fractions of these institutions indicated that they had eased loan covenants, increased the maximum size of credit lines, and narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds.

In the April survey, nearly all domestic banks and all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having eased their lending standards and terms pointed to more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  Considerable fractions of domestic and foreign institutions also cited increased liquidity in the secondary market for these loans as a reason for their move toward less-stringent business lending policies.

On net, about one-fifth of the domestic respondents noted that they had experienced weaker demand for C&amp;I loans from large and middle-market firms and from small firms. Among domestic respondents that saw weaker demand for such loans, about four-fifths attributed the softening in part to borrowers' decreased need to finance investment in plant or equipment, and about two-thirds pointed to borrowers' increased use of internally generated funds.  The U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that demand for C&amp;I loans was about unchanged, on net, over the past three months.

Regarding future business, 12 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased over the previous three months, a somewhat larger net percentage than in the January survey.  By contrast, foreign respondents indicated that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers was little changed in the April survey.

About one-third of domestic institutions-a larger net fraction than in the previous survey-indicated that they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  As in the January survey, about 40 percent of domestic respondents noted that they had experienced weaker demand for such loans over the same period.  By contrast, the vast majority of foreign respondents reported that lending standards on commercial real estate loans had remained basically

unchanged in the April survey.  Demand for such loans at these institutions was also said to be about unchanged over the past three months.

Household Lending

In order to track developments regarding the major categories of residential real estate loans, the April survey asked banks to report changes in standards on and demand for prime, nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgages.   A large majority of 1 respondents indicated that standards on prime residential mortgages had remained basically unchanged over the past three months, with about 15 percent reporting somewhat tighter standards.  Of the forty-two domestic institutions that originated nontraditional residential mortgages, about 45 percent noted a tightening of standards on such loans, whereas the rest reported that their standards had remained basically unchanged.  Similarly, of the sixteen institutions that indicated they had originated subprime residential mortgages, about 45 percent, on net, reported that they had tightened standards on such loans. 2

A tightening of standards for subprime and nontraditional mortgage loans did not appear to prompt a move toward more-stringent lending policies for prime mortgages. Indeed, of the nine institutions that reported having tightened standards on subprime residential mortgages, only one indicated that it had also tightened standards on prime residential mortgages.  Five of the nineteen institutions that reported tightening standards on nontraditional mortgages also tightened standards on prime mortgages.

On net, about one-fifth of domestic institutions indicated that they had seen weaker demand for prime and nontraditional residential mortgages over the past three months, while the demand for subprime mortgages was reportedly little changed.

On balance, 10 percent of domestic respondents indicated that their willingness to make consumer installment loans had increased in the April survey.  A small fraction of

III-A-7

institutions reported that they had eased lending standards on credit card loans; standards and terms on non-credit-card loans were reportedly little changed over the past three months. About one-fourth of domestic institutions indicated that they had experienced weaker demand for consumer loans, a somewhat smaller net percentage than in the January survey.

Trade in Goods and Services

In February, the trade deficit narrowed to $58.4 billion from $58.9 billion in January (revised).  The narrowing of the deficit reflected a steep decline in imports, which more than offset a sizable decline in exports.  The value of exports of goods and services fell 2.2 percent, following a 1.2 percent increase in January.  The lion's share of the February decline was in exports of capital goods.  Within capital goods, exports of aircraft, hightech goods, and other capital goods all moved lower.  There were smaller declines in exports of industrial supplies (particularly fuels), consumer goods, and services. Automotive exports rose in February after falling in January.

<!-- missing-text -->

The average value of exports in January and February increased 2.9 percent (a.r.) from the fourth quarter.  Strong exports of consumer goods pulled up the growth rate, while exports of services, industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products were all close to their fourth-quarter levels.  In the advance NIPA release for the first quarter, real exports of goods and services were reported to have fallen at an annual rate of 1.2 percent.

The value of imported goods and services fell 1.7 percent in February, after falling 0.6 percent in January.  Oil imports plunged, reflecting declines in both prices and quantities.  Imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products also fell.  These declines were partially offset by a sizable increase in imports of consumer goods.

The average value of imports in January and February was flat relative to the fourth quarter.  Imports of capital goods, services, and petroleum were all above their fourthquarter levels, but these increases were offset by lower imports of industrial supplies and automotive products.  In the advance NIPA release for the first quarter, real imports of goods and services were reported to have increased 2.3 percent at an annual rate.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In March, import prices for both non-oil goods and core goods rose 0.3 percent.  Prices for imported material-intensive goods rose 0.7 percent, in large part reflecting higher prices for imported metals.  Prices for imported finished goods were up almost 0.2 percent in March.  Within finished goods, consumer goods experienced the largest price increase, rising 0.2 percent.  Outside of core imports, the price for imported natural gas rose 4.7 percent in March.  Prices for imported computers and semiconductors fell 0.8 and 0.1 percent, respectively.

In the first quarter, as reported in the advance NIPA release, import prices increased 1.3 percent at an annual rate, as lower prices for imported oil, computers, and semiconductors tempered higher prices for imported services, natural gas, and core goods.  Prices of imported core goods increased 2.8 percent, largely on account of higher prices for material-intensive goods.

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil rose 9 percent in March, following little change in February.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased to a similar extent over the two months, but the timing differed; spot WTI rose 9 percent in February and 2 percent in March.  In April, the spot price averaged about $64 per barrel, up about $3.50 per barrel from the March average, and it closed at $64.41 per barrel on May 1.  The rise in oil prices since February reflects OPEC production restraint, production problems in Iraq and Nigeria, and increased concern about a possible disruption of exports from Iran.  Strong oil demand in the United States, owing in part to below-normal temperatures in February and early March, has also supported oil prices.

Exports. In March, export prices for core goods rose 0.8 percent, the same rate of increase as in February.  Prices for exported nonagricultural industrial supplies rose 1.9 percent, owing to higher prices for exported metals, chemicals, and fuels.  Prices for agricultural products also shot up in March, with higher prices for corn, vegetables, meat, and wheat all contributing to the increase.  Prices for finished goods were little changed in March for the second consecutive month, after rising robustly in January.

In the advance NIPA release for the first quarter, exports prices climbed 3.6 percent at an annual rate, as higher prices for exports of core goods and services more than offset steep declines in prices of exported computers and semiconductors.  Core export prices increased 5.9 percent, boosted by a sharp increase in prices for exports of industrial supplies and agricultural goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Foreign official flows into the United States (line 1 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) moved up noticeably in the first three months of the year, continuing the upward trend that began in early 2005.  Most of these inflows came from countries other than the G10 and OPEC (line 1c),

.

The chart on Foreign Official Financial Flows provides a broader perspective on these data.  The G-10 countries have fluctuated between small inflows to and outflows from the United States in recent months, with the trend remaining a modest net outflow.  Although inflows attributed to OPEC countries have tapered off in recent months, the June 2006 survey data on foreign holdings of U.S. securities indicate that inflows from OPEC have been stronger than recorded in these monthly data.  Securities acquired by OPEC through financial centers are assigned to those financial centers in the Treasury International Capital data, but often can be reclassified with aid of the survey data.  Inflows from countries other than the G-10 and OPEC have been growing over the past few years, with quite strong inflows in recent months.

Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the table and the top panels of the chart on Private Securities Flows) in the first quarter of this year are near the pace recorded in 2006.  Demand for Treasuries (line 4a) and equities (line 4d) strengthened from an already healthy level set in the fourth quarter, with purchases of Treasuries in March exceeding all those registered in 2006.  However, purchases of corporate bonds

(line 4c) moderated a tad and private foreigners sold agencies (line 4b), on net.  Most transactions took place through the financial centers of the United Kingdom and the Cayman Islands.

U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5 of the table and the bottom panels of the chart on Private Securities Flows) remained strong in the first quarter of this year.  Net acquisitions of bonds (line 5a) jumped up in March, pulling the quarter up in line with the pace recorded in 2006 and in line with new issuance by foreign firms.  Purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b), although slowing slightly from the strong pace set in the fourth quarter, remained elevated.

Flows recorded by the banking sector (line 3) tend to be volatile.  They recorded net inflows for 2006 as a whole, and a modest outflow for the first quarter of this year.

Foreign Financial Markets

The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign currencies fell 2 percent over the intermeeting period, with the dollar depreciating against all currencies in the index except against the yen.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated about 4 percent against the Canadian dollar and 2 percent against the euro and sterling, but it appreciated 2 percent against the Japanese yen.  Much of the yen's depreciation against the dollar occurred in early April, reportedly on the re-establishment of yen-funded carry trades after the beginning of the new Japanese fiscal year.  The appreciation of the euro, the Canadian dollar, and sterling over the intermeeting period was in part due to economic data releases in Europe and Canada that exceeded market expectations.  In particular, German employment growth in February, French GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2006, U.K. and Canadian consumer price inflation in February and March, and Canadian employment growth in March were higher than had been expected.  Governor King was required to write an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer because 12-month inflation rose to 3.1 percent in March, more than one percentage point higher than the Bank of England's target.  The letter had to explain what the Bank of England would do to redress this situation.

Over the intermeeting period, headline equity indexes rose 3 to 7 percent on net in the euro area, United Kingdom, Canada, and United States, but they were little changed in Japan.  Market participants attributed the increases in Europe and North America to better than expected economic data and quarterly earnings reports. Japan's lagging stock index performance was linked to indications that inflation and activity are not expected to accelerate.

There were no monetary policy changes in major foreign industrial countries over the intermeeting period. Inflation compensation, as implied by the difference between long-term nominal yields and yields on inflation-indexed notes, were little changed. Option-implied volatilities on both the dollar-yen and dollar-euro exchange rates declined over the intermeeting period.  The euro-dollar implied volatility remains at very low levels, and the dollar-yen implied volatility retraced previous upswings, possibly signaling an end to the late-February/early-March 'flight to quality' episode.  Realized volatility of stock market indexes and ten-year government bonds in Japan, Europe, and the United States was little changed over the intermeeting period.

Towards the end of the intermeeting period, the Turkish lira depreciated 7 percent over two days and the Istanbul headline equity index declined 4 percent on growing tensions over the Islamist AK Party's presidential candidate, Abdullah Gul.  On Saturday, April 28, the Turkish military released a statement warning the AK Party government that it would protect the secular state; the secular opposition requested an annulment of Friday's first-round parliamentary vote, and approximately 700,000 civilians demonstrated against the ruling party on Sunday April 29.  On May 1, Turkey's Constitutional Court issued a ruling in favor of the opposition by stating that a quorum was not achieved in the first presidential vote on Friday.  On May 2, the likelihood of an escalation of the political crisis decreased further after Prime Minister Erdogan announced his intention to call early parliamentary elections and to change the constitution so the president is elected directly by popular vote. Since May 1 the lira has appreciated about 1 percent, the Istanbul headline index has increased almost 2 percent, and Turkey's EMBI+ spread narrowed 4 bps to 205 bps.  Other emerging market currencies, exchange indices and the EMBI+ spread were relatively stable over this episode, showing no signs of spillovers so far.

The dollar depreciated about 2 percent against the Brazilian real , 1-1/3 percent against the Mexican peso, about 1 percent against the Korean won and only 0.4 percent against the renminbi over the intermeeting period.  The overall EMBI+ spread declined 16 basis points, on balance.  The Mexican and Brazilian EMBI+ spreads narrowed 18 and 33 basis points, respectively, while the Argentina EMBI+ spread rose 55 basis points on news that April's inflation data will not reflect the actual rise in consumer prices because of government alterations to the index. Latin American and emerging Asia equity indexes rose 6 to 10 percent, and the Shanghai Composite index soared 25 percent.  The outsized equity index gain in China coincided with the report of higher than expected GDP growth data in 2007 Q1.  The People's Bank of China raised the deposits to required reserves ratio twice by 50 basis points over the intermeeting period to 11 percent, and it raised the benchmark one-year lending and deposit rates by 27 basis points.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

The advanced foreign economies appear to be growing at a steady rate.  Canadian growth seems to have rebounded from a disappointing fourth quarter.  Renewed household demand in Japan points toward further strong growth in the first quarter, while investment demand seems to be underpinning growth in the United Kingdom.  Although euro-area exports have slowed from the rapid pace set in the fourth quarter and the hike in the German value added tax appears to have had a noticeable impact on purchases of consumer durables at the start of the year, overall economic conditions remain quite good.

The inflation picture has been much more mixed by comparison.  Inflation in the euro area has remained steady at just below 2 percent since the end of last year, but inflation in the United Kingdom rose more than 1 percentage point above the Bank of England's target for the first time since that Bank was granted independence while in Canada twelve-month inflation jumped 90 basis points to over 2 percent.  In stark contrast, consumer prices fell back into deflation in Japan, and there are indications that a return to positive rates of inflation may be several months off.  Central bank officials held their policy rates constant in the intervening period, although markets expect each of the four major foreign central banks to raise rates later this year.

Japanese consumer prices returned to deflation in February after ten months of positive twelve-month inflation rates.  As of March, the headline CPI had declined 0.1 percent from a year ago and the core (which excludes fresh food only) CPI declined 0.3 percent. Rising food and energy prices caused the Tokyo headline CPI to increase over the month of April, but consumer prices excluding fresh food and energy were unchanged, indicating that a return to positive nationwide inflation may not occur for several months. There appears to be little inflationary impulse from wages despite a strong labor market; nominal wages fell 1.8 percent in February compared with a year earlier.  In more positive news, it was reported that average land prices rose last year for the first time since 1990.  Residential land prices rose 0.1 percent and commercial land prices rose 2.3 percent.

Measures of activity in the first-quarter are encouraging.  Real expenditures by households and retail sales both rose over the first quarter, indicating that some of the strength in household demand witnessed in the fourth quarter has carried over into the

current year.  Household wealth rose a further 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, and both high levels of wealth and the strong labor market seem to be driving the resurgence in private consumption.  The external sector also appears poised to contribute further to growth; the trade surplus rose to $23.7 billion in the first quarter, its highest level in two years, spurred by the weak value of the yen and rising exports to Europe.

In contrast, core machinery orders fell in February, and shipments of investment goods and public works orders fell in both January and February, pointing to a potential cooling of investment and government spending after surprisingly strong growth in the fourth quarter.  The Tankan diffusion index of business confidence remained steady in March, suggesting that the cooling of investment may only be temporary.  Although the diffusion index for large manufacturers declined for the first time in a year, those firms nevertheless reported plans to boost spending on plant and equipment in fiscal 2007 by 2.9 percent, topping the amount reported a year ago for fiscal 2006, and they also indicated plans to further increase employment.

Incoming data suggest that external demand in the euro area has slowed after the surprising strength shown in the fourth quarter, when net exports accounted for most of GDP growth.  Merchandise exports rose 1.3 percent on average over January and February from the fourth-quarter level, substantially less than the 4 percent quarterly growth rate registered in the three months to December.  Furthermore, merchandise imports accelerated in the first two months of the year.  In contrast, domestic economic conditions have improved in the intermeeting period.  According to the European Commission, industrial confidence rose to record levels, and consumer confidence, buoyed by improving labor market prospects, rose to its highest level since mid-2001. The survey evidence has been confirmed by incoming production data for the first quarter.  Euro-area industrial production averaged over January and February was 0.7 percent higher than the fourth-quarter level.

Germany's IFO bounced back in March and April, suggesting that economic activity is recovering quickly after a start-of-the-year moderation due to January's increase in the value-added tax.  The effect of the VAT hike was mostly limited to the timing of German purchases of consumer durables, automobiles in particular: car registrations soared 14 percent in the fourth quarter and then plunged 22 percent in the first three months of 2007.  For the euro area as a whole, retail sales rebounded in February after dropping in January and stand just slightly below the fourth-quarter level.

The twelve-month rates of headline and core (excluding energy and unprocessed food) consumer price inflation have converged in recent months.  The twelve-month rate of headline consumer price inflation edged down to 1.8 percent in April from 1.9 percent in March.  While no details are available, the April slowdown is likely to be entirely attributable to base year effects.  Although the euro-area unemployment rate declined to 7.2 percent in March, down more than a percentage point since the beginning of 2006, there is thus far little evidence that the improved labor market is causing significant wage pressure.  Unit labor costs for the euro area fell over the second half of 2006, and ongoing negotiations in Germany suggest that wage growth will pick up only slightly from the modest pace registered over the past few years.

Headline inflation in the United Kingdom rose to 3.1 percent in March, its highest reading since inflation targeting was instituted in 1997.  As mandated when inflation is more than a percentage point away from the official target of 2 percent, the Governor of the Bank of England wrote an open letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on April 16. In his letter, he indicated that around half of the pick up in inflation over the past year can be accounted for by unexpected sharp increases in domestic energy prices and a rise in food prices related to weather conditions.  Although the Bank's central projection has inflation falling a little below target by the end of 2007, the Governor noted that capacity pressures had increased, and that monthly inflation has recently been volatile.

The preliminary estimate of GDP growth in the first quarter was 2.6 percent, quite close to the pace in the fourth quarter.  GDP components for the first quarter are not yet available, but whereas consumption showed signs of having softened, investment activities most likely continued at a brisk pace.  Retail sales grew 0.4 percent in the first quarter, well below their average of 1.3 percent over the previous three quarters. However, the Bank of England's survey of U.K. private businesses suggests that investment intentions in the service sector are at their highest since the survey began in 1997.  Moreover, investment intentions in the manufacturing sector were at their highest since January 1998 despite the recent appreciation of sterling.

The labor market showed signs of softening as both employment and the participation rate fell slightly over the three months to February compared to a quarter earlier.  The claimant count and Labor Force Survey measures of the unemployment rate were both unchanged.  Average earnings rose 5.1 percent in the twelve months to February, their largest increase in two years.  However, growth in average earnings excluding bonuses

was more modest, at 3.6 percent, and unit labor costs in the manufacturing sector fell over the same period, indicating that wage inflation has so far remained contained.

In Canada , the level of real GDP by industry averaged over January and February was 2.9 percent (a.r.) higher than in the fourth quarter.  Goods-producing industries outpaced services, with the utilities and oil and gas extraction sectors leading the way.  The average level of construction activity was also up compared to the fourth quarter. Services were held down by poor retail trade figures, consistent with a dip in real retail sales in both January and February.  Overall business conditions remain strong.  The Purchasing Managers Index and the composite index of leading indicators both rose sharply in the first quarter.  The nominal merchandise trade balance averaged over January and February was up compared to the fourth quarter; in volume terms, average exports posted a healthy advance, while average imports declined about 1 percent.

The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation rose sharply, hitting 2.2 percent in March.  A surge in gasoline prices put upward pressure on consumer prices, as prices at the pump jumped nearly 13 percent between February and March and were up nearly 10 percent from a year earlier.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of indirect taxes, ticked down to 2.3 percent in March despite continued upward pressure from housing costs.  The twelve-month rate of new home price inflation remained elevated at 10 percent in February, down just slightly from previous months.  House prices increases over the past year have been driven largely by the western provinces, especially the oil-producing province of Alberta, where twelve-month house price inflation is still 40 percent even after decelerating since the fall.

Employment continued to expand rapidly, growing 1 percent in the first quarter, the largest quarterly gain in nearly five years.  Full-time employment growth has been especially strong, indicating that firms are confident that business conditions will remain buoyant for some time.  The strong market has attracted more job seekers (the labor force rose 0.9 percent in the first quarter) and reduced the unemployment rate to a generational low.  This may result in greater pressure on wages.  Twelve-month wage growth of hourly manufacturing employees rose to 3 percent in January, although the wage growth for salaried employees remained steady at 2.4 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Economic activity in the emerging markets appears to have remained robust in the first quarter.  In Asia, performance was supported by surging growth in China and continued strength, for the most part, elsewhere in the region.  In Latin America, indicators point to further lackluster growth in Mexico and some weakening in Argentina, but in other countries, especially Brazil, conditions appear positive.  Inflation has picked up in some countries, notably China and India, but appears generally well contained for the emerging market economies as a whole.

In China , activity accelerated significantly in the first quarter.  Real GDP increased at a blistering pace of more than 13½ percent (a.r.) according to staff estimates, primarily supported by soaring investment and exports.  Nominal growth of fixed asset investment picked up to 26 percent in the first quarter (four-quarter change) from just over 20 percent in the previous two quarters.  The pace of investment is now back to the very high rate seen in the first half of 2006.  A surge in exports in the first two months of the year led to a $50 billion increase (a.r.) in the trade surplus in the first quarter, to $264 billion (a.r.).  The increase in exports was fairly broad-based and reflected the continued strength of global demand for Chinese goods, with some tentative indications that Europe and Latin America are accounting for a rising share of this demand.  The surge in exports in January and February was in part due to an acceleration of shipments in anticipation of a curtailment of export rebates on the VAT for many goods.  Indeed, export growth slumped in March when some of the export rebates were removed, narrowing the trade balance month-on-month.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation picked up a bit more in March, to about 3¼ percent.  Much of the inflation stems from increases in food prices, which were up more than 7½ percent (twelve-month change) in March.  Non-food price inflation remained in the neighborhood of 1 percent.  Foreign exchange reserves surged $140 billion in the first quarter to a level of more than $1.2 trillion.  At most, half of the surge can be accounted for by the change in the current account surplus and FDI inflows, suggesting that 'hot money' inflows have picked up again.  The increase in foreign currency reserves was mostly sterilized, and authorities raised benchmark interest rates in March by 27 basis points and continued to boost the required reserve ratio (by a total of 100 basis points in April).  However, money growth remained above 17 percent year-over-year, still higher than desired by Chinese authorities.

In Hong Kong , recent indicators for the first quarter suggest continued strength.  The nominal merchandise trade deficit narrowed sharply.  The expiration of export rebates in China may have contributed to the increase in Hong Kong's re-exports of Chinese goods this quarter.  Separate data on the quantity of exports for January and February suggest that net exports may make a positive contribution to growth in the first quarter. Twelve-month inflation fell in February, reflecting a one-month holiday on public housing rent, but picked up again in March.

The merchandise trade surplus narrowed, and export orders for electronic products declined in the first quarter.  After turning negative at the end of last year, four-quarter consumer price inflation picked up to 1 percent in the first quarter.  In late March, the Taiwanese central bank raised its discount rate 12.5 basis points.

In Korea , first-quarter GDP growth was 3.6 percent, just a touch below that in the fourth quarter.  Domestic demand showed considerable strength, with both private consumption and business investment rising sharply.  Export growth was also robust but was outweighed by outsized gains in non-oil imports, especially capital goods.  Strong imports of services helped generate a current account deficit in the first quarter.  The most recent production and spending indicators suggest continued moderate gains in output.  The unemployment rate edged down to 3.2 percent in the first quarter; and twelve-month consumer price inflation ticked up to 2.5 percent in April, but remains low relative to the Bank of Korea's 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent target range.  In early April, Korean and U.S. negotiators concluded a bilateral free trade agreement.  If ratified by the legislatures of both countries, market participants expect the agreement to help support Korean growth over the longer term.

Indian economic indicators have remained robust.  On average, industrial production was up nearly 2 percent in January and February from the previous quarter.  The trade deficit narrowed in the first quarter as exports increased slightly and imports fell. Inflation remains a concern, with the most recent twelve-month changes of the closely watched wholesale price index and the CPI near or above 6 percent.  At its April meeting, the Reserve Bank of India left interest rates unchanged, after tightening in earlier months, but announced its resolve to 'condition policy and perceptions for inflation in the range of 4 to 4½ percent over the medium term' compared to its previous 'comfort range' for wholesale price inflation of 5 to 5½ percent.  The RBI also announced a series of measures to encourage capital outflows (e.g. raising the cap on overseas investment by

Indian companies) and discourage capital inflows (e.g. reducing interest rates on nonresident Indian deposits at Indian banks.)

Economic indicators in the ASEAN region, on balance, suggest continued expansion in the first quarter.  In Singapore, the advance unofficial estimate (not shown) indicates that first-quarter real GDP rose 7 percent, despite weaker industrial production, as domestic demand, notably construction and services, supported activity.  Industrial production recovered in Thailand, but was generally down elsewhere in the region so far in the first quarter.  On the other hand, regional trade balances have remained strong in recent months.

Outside of Indonesia and Singapore, twelve-month consumer price inflation across the region continued to decline, owing to more subdued energy price inflation, and in some countries, the unwinding of previous food prices increases and appreciation of the exchange rate.  In the Philippines and Malaysia, in particular, inflation dipped as the effects of last year's VAT increase in the Philippines and the reduction in domestic fuel subsidies in Malaysia fell out of the calculations.  Citing the moderation in inflation and the need to stimulate domestic demand, Bank of Thailand cut interest rates ½ percentage point in early April following two previous ¼ percentage point cuts in January and February.

Recent indicators for Mexico point to further weakness in economic activity.  Both industrial production and the overall index of economic activity fell in January, as soft performances in manufacturing, mining, and agriculture overwhelmed strength in the construction industry and the utilities sectors.  In February, industrial production declined further as weakness continued in manufacturing, particularly automobiles, but also spread to construction, a previous source of strength.

Twelve-month headline inflation was 4.2 percent in March, the seventh consecutive month of inflation at or slightly above the upper limit of the central bank's 2 to 4 percent inflation target range.  The Bank of Mexico (BOM) tightened policy in its late-April meeting, with the overnight lending rate rising ¼ percentage point to 7.25 percent.  The Bank cited the need to prevent previous food price increases from spreading to other sectors.  Analysts had expected that the BOM would leave monetary policy unchanged, as incoming data from the first half of April suggested inflation was beginning to recede. This was the first time the BOM had tightened policy since March 2005.

In Brazil , data released since the last Greenbook provided some signs that economic expansion in the first quarter continued.  Industrial production in February did not recover fully from its January decline, but capital goods imports in March rose further. Retail sales in February were solid.  Twelve-month inflation has been about 3 percent,

well below the 4½ percent mid-point of the target range for this year and next.  On April 18, the central bank reduced its policy rate, the Selic Rate, ¼ percentage point to 12.5 percent, with three of the seven members having voted for a ½ percentage point decline.

In late March, the government released a benchmark revision of national income and product accounts.  Real GDP growth from 2000 to 2005 was revised up ¾ percentage point per year.  For 2006, the revision was 1 percentage point, bringing real GDP growth last year to 4.7 percent (Q4/Q4).  On the production side, the major revision was an increase to services output.  In terms of demand components, private consumption was revised up, but fixed investment was lowered a result of less investment in structures. The upward revision to GDP also lowered the net debt-GDP ratio to 45 percent from 50 percent previously.

Recent indicators for Argentina suggest economic growth moderated in the first quarter. Industrial production grew just 0.3 percent in Q1, a sharp deceleration from the previous quarter's performance.  The index of economic activity, a monthly proxy of GDP, also indicates that output growth weakened through February.  In addition, the merchandise trade surplus narrowed a bit in the first quarter.  Labor market conditions, at least for the fourth quarter, appear favorable, with the unemployment rate (n.s.a.) dipping into the single digits for the first time since well before the crisis.  Twelve-month inflation edged

down in March, reflecting more subdued increases in the prices for food, clothing, and education.

In Venezuela , the few available indicators for the first quarter suggest continued growth and high inflation.  March auto sales were very strong and twelve-month CPI inflation was close to 20 percent in April.  The Chavez government further increased its control over the oil sector in early May, when foreign oil companies ceded operational control of heavy-oil projects, as previously agreed.  Companies must come to agreement with the government on the terms of the takeover by late June. The government has stated that some companies might not be compensated and any compensation will be at most the book value of the projects and not in cash.  President Chavez also announced this week that Venezuela will withdraw its membership in the IMF and World Bank.

In April, the government petroleum company (PDVSA) issued $7.5 billion of dollardenominated bonds to local investors in exchange for bolivares.  The sale was widely interpreted as an attempt to relieve some of the strong downward pressure on the bolivar. The bolivar has been pegged at about 2,150 per dollar since 2005 but, before the issue was announced, was trading in the parallel market at about 4,000 per dollar.  The demand for bonds far exceeded the supply at the government's price, leading some investors to resell their bonds on the parallel market for dollars at a profit.  (The parallel market exchange rate on May 1 stood at over 3,700 bolivares/dollar.)

In Turkey , economic activity continued to moderate, with GDP rising 5.2 percent over the four quarters of last year, sustained by strong domestic demand.  More recently, average industrial production in January and February rose 0.6 percent from the previous quarter.  Large trade and current account deficits persisted in the first quarter.  Despite real interest rates of over 10 percent, consumer price inflation has risen recently, driven by double-digit increases in food and energy prices.

Political tensions mounted between the Islamist and the secular parties at the start of the presidential election cycle.  In late April, Prime Minister Erdogan, of the Islamist AK party, unexpectedly declined the Presidential nomination and named Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, subject to parliamentary approval.  Gul failed to garner the necessary twothirds support, due to boycotts by the secular opposition.  As a result, the Prime Minister has called for full parliamentary elections in late June.  Separately, the Turkish military issued a statement warning the government to continue the secular tradition in governance.  The EU responded negatively to military involvement in Turkey's domestic politics, but was supportive of early elections.

In South Africa , recent indicators point to continued growth.  Average manufacturing production in January and February was up 1.3 percent from the fourth quarter.  The current account deficit rose to 6.4 percent of GDP in 2006.  In the first quarter, however, the merchandise trade deficit contracted, as purchases of foreign capital goods cooled and exports increased across all categories.  Twelve-month consumer prices rose to 5.5 percent in March, nearing the ceiling of the South African Reserve Banks'

3 to 6 percent target range.  A fuel price hike in March offset the effects of downward trending food prices.
