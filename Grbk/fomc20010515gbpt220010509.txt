The U.S.  trade deficit  in goods  and  services was  $27.0  billion in February, much smaller  than the  deficit  in January. For January-February  combined, the deficit at  an  annual  rate  was  $35  billion  smaller than in the  fourth quarter  of last year.

In February,  the value of exports  of goods and  services moved up for the second consecutive month,  with the increase  largely  due to  a jump in  aircraft exports. However, exports  in January-February  combined were still below the fourth-quarter  average. Sharp declines  in exports of automotive products (largely  to  Canada), industrial  supplies, and semiconductors  were  only partly offset by significant  increases  in  exports of aircraft  and consumer goods.  In January-February,  exports of capital  goods other than  aircraft  and semiconductors  held at about the fourth-quarter  average.  By  area, declines  in exports  to countries  in Asia,  Latin America,  and Canada  were partly  offset by an increase  in exports  to Western  Europe.

The value of imports plunged  a record  $5.4 billion  in February  (not at annual rate). The fall  was widespread  across trade categories,  with  the largest declines in  imported  consumer  goods, a  wide range  of high-tech  and other machinery,  oil (entirely quantity),  and  other industrial  supplies. Notably, automotive  imports held  at about the  same level  as recorded  in December  and January.  Imports in January-February  were 3 percent  lower (not at annual  rate)  than the fourth-quarter  average. The decline  was broadly  based  (and strongest  in automotive  products, high-tech  goods, and oil)  with  only the value  of non-oil industrial  supplies  and service  payments  showing an  increase.

Over the period, equity prices in Asian  emerging markets  were mixed.  Concerns about  the demand for technology  exports  and prospects  for earnings  going forward weighed  on the  tech-heavy  Asian equity markets  early in  the period, but prices rebounded sharpy  after the FOMC's intermeeting rate cut.

While Latin American  equity market indices were  also mixed over the intermeeting period,  share prices  were extremely  volatile.  Equity market  indices jumped higher following  the FOMC's interest rate cut, but subsequently reversed  much of these  gains amid uncertainty  surrounding  the turmoil in Argentina.  On balance,  EMBI+ spreads for Argentina  and Brazil widened 65 and 18 basis  points,  respectively,  over the intermeeting  period,  but the overall EMBI+  spread narrowed 19 basis points.
