Labor Market Developments

Employment strengthened in  November, with  private  onfarm n payrolls ising r 249,000--more  than  in  other recent onths.1  In  the m household survey,  employment rose  even  faster,  d  the nemployment rate ropped  back  to  4.4  percent. an u d

Job gains  were widespread in  November  with  the  notable xception f e o manufacturing, here employment  shrank w another 7,000. 4 2 Construction  ayrolls p have surged in  the  past two months, boosted  by strong  housing demand. Retail mployment e rebounded 65,000 in  November  after a subpar  October,  and employment  growth in FIRE  remained robust. Gains in  the  services ndustries i totaled 150,000; business services--including  lp  supply--and  engineering nd management he a services ccounted a for  much  of  the  rise.

Aggregate hours of  production  or  nonsupervisory  workers on private nonagricultural  ayrolls ose  0.1  percent  last onth, and the  average  workweek p r m remained  essentially unchanged.  After  correcting  or  difficulties h  the  seasonal f wit adjustment  of  the  workweek in  September, e estimate  hat w t production  worker hours in  November stood  about 1-1/4  percent  (annual  rate) bove the  third-quarter  erage. a av 3

Foreign Exchange  Markets

Since the November FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange value of the dollar on a weighted average basis against other major currencies declined  about 1 1/4 ercent on p balance,  led by a 3 percent depreciation  against the yen.  Factors weighing  on the dollar during the period  included perceptions  that U.S.  economic activity remains vulnerable to financial turbulence in Latin America, especially Brazil, as well as  the impeachment proceedings.  The dollar was buoyed during the period by interest rate  cuts abroad and continued signs of strength in the U.S. economy, which led market participants to discount the probability of further monetary easing in the near future.

Commodity prices continued to fall  in the intermeeting period, with the Commodity Research Bureau index declining to a 21-year low and oil prices reaching a 12-year  low.  The dollar appreciated  about 2 /2 percent against the Australian dollar 1 during the period, as weakness in commodity  prices weighed on the latter currency.  The decline in oil prices tended to weaken currencies of oil exporters  such as Norway; the dollar gained about 3 /2 percent against the Norwegian  krone 1

- . Weak commodity prices was one of several factors behind the  15  percent depreciation of the Russian ruble during the period.  More importantly, the moratorium on foreign debt repayment ended, Russian households were  allowed to withdraw savings, which  some used to buy foreign currency,  and there has been substantial growth in the monetary base.

The dollar's  movements  against other major currencies were more moderate during the period.  The dollar depreciated percent against the mark, on balance. The surprise coordinated interest rate cut by the Bundesbank  and other euro-area central banks on December 3 contributed to the dollar's stability against the mark.  The Bundesbank lowered its repo rate 30 basis points to 3 percent as did the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium,  and the Netherlands  Bank.  Most other euro-area  central banks  lowered official  interest rates  to 3 percent during the period, largely  completing  the convergence process ahead of the launch of the monetary union in January.  This amounted to a cut of 40 basis points by the Finnish central  bank, a decrease  of 50  basis points by the Bank of Spain, a reduction  of  69 basis points by the Central  Bank of Ireland,  and a 75-point cut in Portugal.  The Bank of Italy was the only euro-area  central bank that did not lower its official interest rates to 3 percent, instead cutting its discount rate  50 basis points to 3  1/2  ercent. p However, the Bank of Italy  did conduct repurchase operations at an interest rate near  3 percent during the period.
