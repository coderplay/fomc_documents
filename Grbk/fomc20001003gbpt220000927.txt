On September  14 the ECB  announced  that it would repatriate  €2.5  billion of interest earnings  on  its foreign exchange  portfolio,  stating that the operation  was not for intervention  purposes.  Most market  participants,  however,  considered the ECB's repatriation  operations to be de facto intervention. In  the  event, these operations,  which  took place  between September  14 and September 22, had little effect on the value  of the  euro, which touched  a new  low  against  the dollar during this period. On  September 22, a few hours after the day's repatriation operation,  the joint intervention  operation  commenced.  For this operation, the Desk sold $1.33  billion for the accounts  of the Treasury  and the System. The European  Central  Bank  sold , the Bank  of Japan  purchased  a very large amount of euros,  while the Bank of Canada  and Bank of England each bought a small  sum of euros.  This was the first operation for U.S.  accounts  since June  17,  1998.  Immediately  following the first wave of the intervention  operation, the European Central  Bank released  a statement that at their initiative, the  monetary authorities  of the United States and Japan  had joined the  ECB in concerted  intervention  in exchange  markets because of the shared concern over the potential  implications of recent movements  in  the euro . This announcement, together  with the overall size of the operation,  served to immediately boost the euro. Since  the afternoon  of the  operation, the euro has traded in a relatively narrow range.  The communique stemming from the September 23  G-7 meeting, which  stated that exchange  rates would continue to be monitored and that member nations would cooperate in the exchange market as appropriate,  appeared to have little  net effect on the exchange  value of the euro.  On balance,  the dollar appreciated  2 percent versus the euro  over the intermeeting  period.

The August 31  rate hike by the ECB was largely anticipated by market participants,  and had little effect  on short-term interest rates in the euro area. Share prices in the euro  area fell  about 4 percent  on declines  of around 10 percent in the manufacturing  and construction  sectors.

The dollar appreciated  2 percent  against the British pound.  For most of the life of the euro,  sterling seemed to  be more closely linked with the dollar than with the euro.  However, over the past two months, sterling's moves against the dollar have been closely linked with movements  of the euro.

The dollar depreciated  1 percent versus the yen during the intermeeting period. The yield  on ten-year Japanese government  bonds rose  10 basis points amid annual wrangling over the size  of the supplementary budget  and renewed interest by market participants  in the Japanese government's aggregate  fiscal condition. The yield on  the ten-year Japanese government bond, at  1.9 percent,  is near the upper end of the narrow  30 basis point range it has been  in since March 1999, when the Bank of Japan initiated its zero-interest-rate  policy.  Since  August  11,
