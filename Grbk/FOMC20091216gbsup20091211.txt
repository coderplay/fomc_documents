Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment

Nominal retail sales rose 1.3 percent in November, and revisions to the two previous months were largely offsetting.  Sales in the retail control category, which excludes sales at auto dealers and building material and supply stores, and are the component of overall retail sales used by the BEA in constructing the national accounts, moved up 0.5 percent. The gains were fairly widespread across establishment types but were especially robust at general merchandise stores, food and beverage stores, electronics and appliance stores, and nonstore retailers.  Folding in our forecast for November PCE prices, we estimate that real PCE control rose 0.4 percent last month, the sixth consecutive monthly gain.

The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment moved up in early December, as assessments of current conditions were more favorable than in November. The December sentiment reading remained within the range of values observed over the past 6 months.

The preliminary survey results for median inflation expectations of households in the Reuters/Michigan sample-both over the next 12 months and over the next 5 to 10 years-moved down noticeably.  At 2.1 percent and 2.6 percent, respectively, these early December readings were the lowest since March.

Business Inventories

Folding in a small decline in the book-value of retail inventories (excluding motor vehicles and parts), the combined book-value of inventories in the manufacturing and trade sector (excluding motor vehicles and parts) rose at an annual rate of $21 billion in October.  The increase was the first in more than a year, suggesting some slowing in the pace of real inventory liquidation may be under way.  Of course, because changes in book-value inventories can be heavily influenced by price changes that lead to a revaluation of existing stocks, these book-value data can differ substantially from real inventory changes.  Despite the apparent restocking in October, businesses likely continued to make progress in better aligning their inventories with sales:  The ratio of book-value inventories to sales (excluding motor vehicles) edged down further in October.

Federal Government

Based on data for defense spending in the Monthly Treasury Statement for November, real defense purchases declined last month following a drop in October.

The unified federal budget remained wide over the first two months of fiscal 2010. Receipts were 13 percent lower in October-November than in the same period last year. Federal spending in October-November declined 4 percent relative to the same period a year ago, primarily because of a marked decrease in outlays for the TARP.  Excluding the TARP payments, federal spending increased in the first two months of fiscal 2010 relative to a year earlier.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $32.9 billion in October, as a large increase in exports of goods and services more than offset a moderate increase in imports.

The value of exports of goods and services jumped up 2.6 percent in October, following a similar-sized gain in September.  The October increase was widely spread across major categories of exports.  Capital goods and consumer goods recorded particularly large gains.  The increase in consumer goods was importantly boosted by pharmaceuticals and artwork, two of the more volatile categories of exports.

The value of imports of goods and services rose only 0.4 percent in October, after shooting up 5.6 percent in September, as a robust increase in imports of non-oil goods was muted by a large decline in oil imports (both on account of lower volumes as well as a decrease in price).  The increase in non-oil imports was broadbased across categories of goods.  Capital goods grew strongly, supported by a jump in imports of computers. Imports of consumer goods also contributed significantly to the overall increase, led by higher imports of pharmaceutical goods.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In November, prices of core imports rose 0.4 percent, about in line with the growth over previous months.  Whereas prices for finished goods were unchanged, prices for material-intensive goods moved up 1.2 percent, with both foods and industrial supplies prices rising at rates similar to October.  Taking the average of prices in October and November, core import prices have risen at an annual rate of 5.5 percent, fueled by material-intensive goods price growth of 16 percent and more mild growth in finished goods prices.

Oil. The BLS price index for imported oil moved higher for the second straight month in November, rising 6.2 percent for the month as a whole.  This increase came on the heels of a 2 percent increase in October, revised up a full percentage point from the previous release.

Exports. Core export prices rose a brisk 1 percent in November.  Material-intensive goods were solely responsible for the price growth.  Prices for agricultural exports rose 3.7 percent, reversing the previous two months' price declines.  Nonagricultural industrial supplies prices rose 1.7 percent, much faster than in the two previous months.  Prices for finished goods were flat on net, with a small increase in the price for consumer goods counterbalanced by a small decline in the price of capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors.  In October and November on average, prices for core exported goods have risen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent.
