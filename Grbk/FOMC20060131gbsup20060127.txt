The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

According to the BEA's advance estimate, real GDP rose at an annual rate of 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter after having increased at a rate of 4.1 percent in the third quarter. The slowdown in the fourth quarter reflected decelerations in most major categories of spending with the notable exception of private inventory investment.  Real PCE increased at an annual rate of 1.1 percent following an increase at a 4.1 percent rate in the third quarter; the deceleration was the result of a sharp drop in purchases of durable goods, as spending on motor vehicles fell.  Total government spending decreased 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter; a small increase in state and local government expenditures was more than offset by a large decline in federal spending.  Business fixed investment rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter, down from the 8.5 percent pace in the third quarter; spending on both equipment and software and nonresidential structures decelerated.  In the foreign sector, the BEA estimated that real exports rose at a moderate rate for a second quarter but that real imports accelerated; as a result, the arithmetic contribution of net exports to the change in real GDP was -1.2 percentage points last quarter compared with just -0.1 percentage point in the third quarter.  In contrast, real private inventories are reported to have increased $25.7 billion in the fourth quarter, adding 1.5 percentage points to the change in real GDP; in the third quarter, the change in private inventory investment held down the change in real GDP by about ½ percentage point.

Real output in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter.  Based on the data currently available, the staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector fell at an annual rate of 0.4 percent last quarter following an increase at a 4.4 percent rate in the third quarter.  These estimates put the four-quarter change in nonfarm business productivity for 2005 at just under 2½ percent.

On the income side of the accounts, real disposable personal income rebounded at an annual rate of 7.0 percent in the fourth quarter after having been severely restrained in the third quarter by the effects of the hurricane.  The personal saving rate edged up a bit, but remained below zero.  The staff currently estimates that compensation per hour increased at an annual rate of 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter, implying an increase of just under ½ percent from the fourth quarter of 2004.

GDP Prices

The GDP price index increased at an annual rate of 3.0 percent in the fourth quarter after having risen at a 3.3 percent rate in the preceding quarter.  A fairly sharp increase in construction prices boosted the overall GDP price index, but was more than offset by a deceleration in energy prices.  The slowing in energy prices also contributed to the deceleration in PCE prices, which rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent in the fourth quarter compared with a rate of 3.7 percent in the third quarter.  Core PCE prices increased 2.2 percent last quarter after having moved up at a 1.4 percent rate in the third quarter; the price index for GDP excluding food and energy also accelerated in the fourth quarter.

Manufacturers' Orders, Shipments, and Inventories

New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 3.5 percent in December following an upward-revised increase of 0.2 percent in November.  Orders for non-hightech equipment shot up 4.6 percent after having changed little in November, and orders for computers and peripherals rose strongly for a second month; in contrast, orders for communications equipment posted their second straight large decline.

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft jumped 3.2 percent in December following an increase of 0.6 percent in November.  Increases in shipments were broad-based across categories of equipment last month.  The increase of 3.8 percent in shipments of communications equipment retraced about half of the cumulative decline posted over the preceding two months while shipments of computers and other capital equipment remained on their strong upward trajectories.

The book value of inventories held by manufacturers of durable goods (which constitute about two-thirds of total manufacturing inventories) increased at an annual rate of $0.7 billion in December.  Shipments of total durable goods increased 3.5 percent, and the inventory-shipments ratio fell to 1.29 months.

Sales of New Homes

Sales of new homes moved up 3 percent in December to an annual rate of 1.27 million units on the heels of a decline of 9¼ percent in November.  Sales in December were up sharply in the West and the Midwest, which more than offset declines in the South and the Northeast.  All told, the level of sales in the fourth quarter was about in line with the average level during the first three quarters of 2005.  The stock of new homes for sale continued to edge up in December and represented 4.9 months of sales at December's
