Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Prices

The consumer price index advanced 0.5 percent in August, following a similar increase in July.   The increase in August, as in July, was primarily the result of a jump in consumer 1 energy prices.  On a twelve-month-change basis, overall CPI inflation was 3.6 percent last month, about a percentage point higher than its pace over the preceding year. Excluding food and energy, the CPI moved up 0.1 percent for the fourth consecutive month; this left the twelve-month change in this index at 2.1 percent, a little above the pace in the year-earlier period.  The increase in the core CPI last month was somewhat less than we had anticipated, mostly because prices for lodging away from home and medical care services were lower than expected.

Energy prices ran up 5 percent in August as motor fuel prices jumped 8 percent.  This is the second consecutive large monthly increase in gasoline prices, and available survey data point to a rise roughly double this size in September.  In all, consumer energy prices climbed 20 percent over the twelve months ending in August, about twice the rise seen in the preceding twelve months.

Consumer food prices were unchanged in August after having increased 0.2 percent in July.  Prices of fruits and vegetables fell 1.3 percent, nearly reversing the spike in July. Over the twelve months ending in August, the CPI for food decelerated, rising 2¼ percent, compared with a 3½ percent increase over the preceding twelve-month period.

Prices of core consumer goods rose 0.1 percent last month as prices for apparel jumped 1 percent after having fallen by almost this amount in July.  Prices for new motor vehicles declined considerably for a second consecutive month in August, apparently reflecting the continued influence of employee-discount programs at the Big Three domestic automakers.  In August, prices of core goods were ¾ percent above their yearearlier level, compared with a decline of 1 percent over the preceding year.

Prices of non-energy services also moved up 0.1 percent in August.  Shelter prices were unchanged as the volatile 'lodging away from home' component fell 1.6 percent-more than reversing the previous month's increase.  Apart from shelter, prices of core services rose 0.2 percent.  In August, airfares fell for the first time since January, and, for the first time in thirty years, prices of medical care services did not increase during the month. Prices of non-energy services rose 2¾ percent during the year ending in August, ¼ percentage point less than their year-earlier rise.

The chained CPI, or C-CPI-U, rose 3 percent over the twelve months ending in August, 0.6 percentage point less than the change in the official index.   The corresponding 2 change in the core C-CPI-U was 1.8 percent, 0.3 percentage point lower than the official core CPI.

Productivity and Costs

We now estimate that output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.7 percent in the second quarter, following an increase at a 3.2 percent rate in the first quarter.   Over the four quarters ending in 2005:Q2, 3 productivity increased 2.2 percent by our estimate, roughly half of the pace during the preceding four quarters.

having risen 6.5 percent over that period, unit labor costs rose 4.3 percent-a noticeable turnaround from the preceding three years during which they were little changed.  We estimate that output per hour in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in the second quarter to a level 6.3 percent higher than a year earlier.  Hourly compensation rose 4.3 percent over the year ending in 2005:Q2, and unit labor costs continued to be little changed.

Insured Unemployment

Initial claims for unemployment insurance under state programs jumped 71,000 to 398,000 for the week ending September 10, which raised the four-week moving average of new claims 20,000 to 341,000.  According to our contact at the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), nearly all of this week's increase can be directly attributed to the hurricane.  He also noted that upward revisions to this week's figure are likely:  Given the nature and scale of the disaster, the states have faced problems in processing new claims, and the ETA will require more time than usual to accurately determine the number of claims and to apportion them among the states.  In addition, some claimants, who are not eligible for regular state programs, may be eligible for Disaster Unemployment Assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency; because those claims are reported on a monthly basis, information on the numbers involved may not be available until next month.

Insured unemployment under state programs for the week ending September 3 was 2.6 million, close to the level at which it has held since the beginning of April.  The insured unemployment rate remained at 2 percent.

Consumer Sentiment

The Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) reported that its overall index of consumer sentiment plunged 12.2 points in early September to 76.9, a level well below its average over the previous twelve months.  The deterioration probably reflects recent increases in the price of gasoline and the effects of Hurricane Katrina, and it is likely restraining consumer spending somewhat.

The early-September drop in sentiment was the result of striking declines in both the 'current conditions' and 'expected conditions' components of the index.  Among questions not included in the overall index, consumers reported that their expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened noticeably.

Note. Figures on financial, business, and buying conditions are the percent reporting 'good times' (or 'better') minus the percent reporting 'bad times' (or 'worse'), plus 100.   Expected change in unemployment is the fraction expecting unemployment to rise minus the fraction expecting unemployment to fall, plus 100.

- 2.  Indicates the question is one of the five equally-weighted components of the index of sentiment.

Appraisals of buying conditions for houses tumbled to their lowest level since February 1991, and appraisals of buying conditions for cars fell back to their spring levels.

The mean of expected inflation over the next twelve months ramped up to 5.7 percent, and the median climbed to 4.6 percent.  The mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years moved up to 3.8 percent, and the median moved up to 3.1 percent.

Business Inventories

Retail inventories, on a book value basis, plummeted at an annual rate of $99 billion in July and are now estimated to have dropped at a $28 billion rate in June-more than previously reported.  July's massive run-off, the second-largest in the thirteen-year history of the series, occurred at motor vehicle and parts dealers, likely the result of the employee-discount program on new vehicles.  Elsewhere, retail inventories decreased at a $1 billion pace in July, and the inventory-sales ratio, excluding motor vehicles and parts, edged down to 1.31 months.

For the entire manufacturing and trade sector excluding motor vehicles and parts, bookvalue inventories increased at an annual rate of $22 billion in July.  In the second quarter as a whole, inventories in this sector rose at a downward-revised annual rate of $29 billion.

The International Economy

U.S. Current Account

In the second quarter, the U.S. current account deficit was $783 billion (s.a.a.r.), an improvement of $12 billion over the first quarter (revised).  Although the trade deficit held relatively steady, a decrease in unilateral transfers dominated the movement in the current account.  The majority of the decrease in transfers is associated with a reduction in grants for military purchases of nearly $15 billion (a.r.)

The current account deficit in the first quarter was revised down (larger deficit) by $9 billion, primarily reflecting a downward revision to net direct investment income receipts.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

We have received second quarter Balance of Payments data, which include preliminary estimates of direct investment data and new figures for foreign securities transactions.

-

The new data report inflows through foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities to be $122 billion in the second quarter (line 4), compared with $95 billion estimated in the Greenbook.  The difference reflects adjustment factors applied by BEA that differ from their usual methodology and result in larger net purchases of U.S. securities.  The largest adjustment is to agency bonds (line 4b), with net purchases of nearly $21 billion, up $16 billion from the Greenbook estimate.  There are upward adjustments to corporate bonds (line 4c) and corporate stocks swaps (included in line 4d) as well.

Preliminary data for United States direct investment abroad (line 6) indicate net outflows of $34 billion in the second quarter, with new equity flows and reinvested earnings continuing at their first quarter pace.  For the year to date, outflows have not indicated large remittances by U.S multinationals' foreign affiliates in response to the partial tax holiday included in the American Jobs Creation Act.  Direct investment into the United States (line 7) slowed in the second quarter to $18 billion.  New equity flows and reinvested earnings continued at their first quarter pace, but the volatile intercompany debt component of direct investment switched to an outflow and pulled down recorded inflows.

The statistical discrepancy (the last line of the table) in the second quarter is positive $54 billion, indicating some combination of over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial inflows.  For the first half of 2005 the discrepancy is nearly $95 billion.
