Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Economic activity appears to have expanded at a moderate rate in the first quarter, as private final demand has strengthened further and the pace of inventory liquidation has greatly diminished.  Consumer spending has increased solidly since the beginning of the year, and business investment in equipment and software appears to have posted another sizable gain last quarter.  On the downside, activity in the housing market has remained lackluster since the middle of last year, and conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remain bleak.  In addition, budgetary pressures led to a further significant contraction in state and local expenditures last quarter.  Turning to other indicators of economic activity, industrial production advanced briskly again in the first quarter, and labor market conditions improved, on net.  Meanwhile, both headline and core consumer price inflation have been soft in recent months.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market is showing signs of a nascent recovery.  After falling steeply through most of 2009, private nonfarm payroll employment increased about 50,000 per month, on average, over the first quarter of 2010-the first quarterly increase since the onset of the recession.   With the average workweek also up last quarter, aggregate hours of all 1 employees increased at an annual rate of about 2 percent for the quarter, after declining 6 percent in 2009.   The upturn in private employment has been widespread across 2 industries, as the three-month diffusion index in March moved above 50 for the first time since January 2008.

Data from the household survey also point to a firming in labor market conditions. 3 The unemployment rate held steady at 9.7 percent throughout the first quarter-

quarter of this year, employment increases in the household survey (adjusted for updates per month, about 400,000 per month more than the employment quarter of last year, for 235,000 per month more, on average, than view the establishment survey as the more reliable employment at quarterly frequencies. 3 In the first to population estimates) averaged 450,000 gains in the establishment survey.  Large discrepancies are common; in the fourth example, employment in the household survey fell by employment in the establishment survey.  We tend to indicator of changes in

0.3 percentage point lower than the fourth-quarter average.   Furthermore, the number of 4 new job losers as a percent of household employment continued to drop, and the fraction of workers on part-time schedules for economic reasons has moved down, on net, since the end of last year.  In addition, the labor force participation rate has increased over the past few months following sharp declines over the second half of last year.  Nonetheless, finding a job remains very difficult, and unemployment durations-as gauged by the mean duration of unemployment and by the share of the unemployed out of work for more than 26 weeks-continued to rise.

at least part of that rise Other labor market indicators have improved somewhat in recent months.  The layoff rate from JOLTS remained on a downward trajectory in February.  And, although initial UI claims moved up over the first half of April, we think that reflected seasonal adjustment difficulties and the four-week average still remains modestly lower than at the end of 2009.  Vacancies, as measured by the job openings rate from JOLTS and the help-wanted advertising index, have moved noticeably above their end-of-year levels.  In addition, alternative measures of labor market slack, namely the number of small firms with hard-to-fill positions and households' perceptions of job availability, have improved slightly, on balance, since the beginning of 2010.  To be sure, the hiring rate in the JOLTS has yet to show clear evidence of a rebound.  However, the signal from hiring plans in the March NFIB survey was more optimistic than the one suggested by the hiring rate, as the fraction of small firms planning to increase employment in the next three months exceeded the fraction planning to decrease employment for the first time since fall 2008.  Finally, households' expectations of future labor market conditions, though only moving sideways in recent months, remained well above recession lows.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) continued to expand at a brisk pace last quarter.  Despite only modest gains in February and March, total IP increased at an annual rate of nearly 8 percent in the first quarter, while manufacturing output rose more than 6½ percent. 5 In addition, the production gains were widespread across industries, with the March diffusion index of three-month changes in manufacturing IP reaching its highest level in almost seven years.  According to the staff's flow-of-goods system, both foreign demand and a mild restocking of inventories contributed positively to output gains last quarter.

Capacity utilization in manufacturing, at 70.0 percent in March, stood nearly 5 percentage points above the trough recorded last June but was still more than 9 percentage points below its 1972-2009 average.  With the exception of the aerospace product and parts and the food industries, most major industry groups continue to operate at rates of utilization well below their historical averages.

For the first quarter as a whole, light vehicle assemblies were at a pace of The production of light motor vehicles stepped up to an annual rate of 7.4 million units in March after being held down in February by a recall-related suspension of production at Toyota. 6 7.4 million units, 400,000 units above the fourth-quarter average, as automakers cautiously began to rebuild dealers' inventories.  Indeed, the overall stock-sales ratio-at 59 days in the first quarter-was well below the industry target of 65 days.  Moreover, initial assembly plans for the second quarter indicate that light motor vehicle production will hold steady at first-quarter levels.

Production in high-tech industries increased solidly in the first quarter.  The output of semiconductors rose briskly, and gains were widespread across chip types.  The production of communications equipment accelerated substantially, with export demand surging early this year.  By contrast, the rate of increase in computer output slowed somewhat last quarter following a fourth-quarter leap in output fueled by consumer demand.

Looking ahead, the available indicators point to a further expansion in the high-tech sector in the near term.  Orders received by North American factories for circuit boardsa key input into electronics of all kinds-stood well above shipments in February, suggesting that further production gains are in train.  In addition, Intel recently noted clear signs of improving business demand for personal computers, as corporate customers have moved to replace their aging stocks.  Capital expenditure plans announced by major telecommunications service providers for this year also suggest further support for computer and communications equipment production in coming quarters.

Energy output rose at an annual rate of nearly 9 percent in the first quarter, reflecting increases in utilities output and in drilling activity.  Available weekly product data indicate that energy output will contribute little to IP growth this month.

Production outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, and high-tech industries-which accounts for roughly two-thirds of total IP-accelerated in the first

quarter.  Indeed, the nearly 7 percent annual rate of increase was the largest since late 1999, and gains were widespread across all major market groups.  In particular, the production of business equipment increased 16½ percent last quarter.

On balance, the available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity remain quite positive.  The new orders diffusion index from the national ISM survey and the average of the new orders indexes from the regional surveys moved up in March to levels consistent with brisk increases in manufacturing output in the second quarter.  Moreover, the first readings on new orders for April, from the New York and Philadelphia surveys, both increased.  In contrast, the three-month moving average of the staff's series on real orders for durable goods (adjusted to exclude industries for which reported orders have little information content for predicting shipments) flattened out in February and suggests only moderate gains in the near future.

Motor Vehicle Sales

Sales of light motor vehicles jumped in March to an annual rate of 11.8 million units after falling for two consecutive months.  This increase was likely due, in large part, to Toyota's aggressive incentive program and the quick matching of these incentives by other automakers.   J.D. Power and Associates estimates that sales this month have been 7 running below the March pace despite the recent improvement in consumer attitudes toward car-buying conditions and the continuation of automakers' generous financing incentives.

For the first quarter as a whole, sales of light motor vehicles averaged about 200,000 units above their fourth-quarter level.

.  Orders for medium and heavy trucks fell sharply, on net, in the first quarter, likely because of the new environmental regulations on diesel engines that took effect at the start of the year.  Even so, truck sales in the first quarter were little changed from their modest fourth-quarter level.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending has continued to rise at a solid pace so far this year.  Real PCE increased at an average monthly rate of 0.4 percent in January and February, and nominal

sales at establishments in the retail control category-which the BEA uses to estimate expenditures on most non-auto goods and food services-moved up robustly again in March.  Together, these data suggest that spending for the first quarter as a whole increased noticeably faster than the 2¼ percent annual rate in the second half of last year.

The recent spending gains have been especially pronounced for most non-auto goods and food services.  Factoring in our estimate of prices in March, increases in real spending in the control category averaged about ¾ percent per month in the first three months of this year-stronger than the already solid increases in the second half of last year.  Real spending on services continued to increase at a moderate pace early this year, abstracting from the weather-related pickup in energy services through February.  In contrast, outlays on new and used motor vehicles fell again in the first quarter. 8

Although the usual determinants of spending have shown some signs of improvement recently, they remain at generally lackluster levels.  For example, while equity prices have risen strongly since the start of the year, household net worth remains well below its pre-recession level and is likely a continued source of restraint on spending.  Similarly, although wages and salaries picked up earlier this year with the apparent stabilization in the labor market, real disposable income was flat in February after a ½ percent decline in January that reflected a one-time jump in personal taxes.  Furthermore, banks have indicated somewhat greater willingness to lend to consumers in recent months, which has likely provided some support to spending increases, but terms and standards on consumer loans remain restrictive.  (For more information, see the appendix on SLOOS at the end of the financial section.)  Finally, as a sign that households are still anxious about their economic prospects, consumer sentiment dropped back in early April and has changed little, on net, since the beginning of the year.

Housing

The recovery in the housing market remains stalled.  Single-family housing starts edged up, on net, over February and March, but much of this gain likely reflected delayed projects getting under way as weather conditions returned to normal.  The small positive gap between adjusted permits and starts in March suggests that we might see some further pickup in starts in April.  Weather effects aside, new construction has not moved up much since last summer.  Activity has likely been held down by builders' difficulties in obtaining construction financing, by new homes selling below construction costs, and by the large number of distressed properties on the market.  Multifamily starts have also

remained at a low level due to elevated vacancy rates and tight credit conditions for builders.

The demand for new homes has been especially weak in recent months.  The Census Bureau's measure of new home sales agreements inched down further in February following a sizable decline in January.

- . 9 As the pace of sales has slowed, the inventory of unsold new homes has edged up after sharp declines last year.  Consequently, the months' supply of new homes moved back up above nine months in February-only about three months below its peak in January 2009.  Sales of existing homes, which are recorded at closing, also ticked down in February, but the increase in pending home sales in February suggests that resales might move up some as the homebuyer tax credit expiration deadline approaches. 10

The softness in housing demand has persisted despite a favorable level of housing affordability and an apparent stabilization of residential real estate values.  Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have changed little in recent months and remain at levels that are very low by historical standards.  And, while the repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance edged down in February, its current level is 3 percent above its trough in April 2009.  Looking forward, the early April reading of the diffusion index for year-ahead house price expectations constructed from the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers remained markedly more positive than it was last spring, with the number of respondents who expect house prices to increase about the same as the number of respondents who expect prices to decrease.

Equipment and Software

Real spending on equipment and software continued to rebound in the first quarter. Investment in both high-tech and transportation equipment advanced further, and the gains now appear to be spreading to other categories of capital goods as well.

Real spending on high-tech equipment and software appears to have increased at a solid pace so far this year, albeit less than the gain of over 30 percent (annual rate) posted in the fourth quarter.  The recent increases in high-tech investment continue to be concentrated in computers and software.  The average level of nominal shipments of

Looking ahead, a number of major high-tech companies have reported computers and peripheral equipment in January and February was well above the fourthquarter level, which combined with falling prices implies strong real increases.  In addition, imports of computers increased briskly in February, and IP for this category registered a solid gain last quarter.  Moreover, Adobe, Oracle, and IBM reported substantial revenue gains in the first quarter, which, together with upbeat revenue estimates for other major software companies, indicates another large increase in business spending on software last quarter.  In contrast, shipments of communications equipment in January and February were below their fourth-quarter average, suggesting that the recovery in domestic business outlays on communications equipment may have paused in the first quarter. that business demand appears to be picking up further, as firms continue to replace aging equipment and are starting to expand capacity with the construction of new data centers and the buildup of wireless networks.

Real investment in equipment other than high-tech and transportation, a broad category of capital goods that accounts for nearly half of the total outlays on equipment and software, appears to have turned up sharply in the first quarter after falling for more than a year.  Excluding the volatile engines and turbines category, average orders and shipments of other equipment in January and February were each more than 2 percent above their fourth-quarter average.  This, together with the recent increase in the diffusion index for shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft, suggests that the recovery in spending has now become more broadly based.

The recovery in investment spending is consistent with the strengthening in many indicators of business activity.  Business output likely posted its third consecutive gain in the first quarter, and the recent readings of the ISM and Philadelphia Fed indicators of business conditions have now moved above the levels that prevailed during the recovery that followed the prior recession.  Furthermore, the cost of capital has fallen sharply over the past year, as corporate bond yields returned to levels seen before the recession, and the April SLOOS reported that, for the first time in about three years, a majority of banks eased standards and some terms on loans to large businesses.  In contrast, small businesses, which are more likely to depend on bank credit for funds, continue to face difficult credit conditions:  A relatively high fraction of respondents in the March NFIB survey still reported tighter credit conditions, while the April SLOOS indicated that, on net, banks continued to tighten terms on loans to small businesses.

nominal expenditures through February suggest a further decline in the first quarter.  The weakness has been widespread across categories and likely reflects the drag from elevated vacancy rates, low levels of property prices, and difficult financing conditions for new projects. 11 In addition, the most recent reading from the architectural billings index edged up but remained at a level consistent with further declines in spending over the near term, and, smoothing through weather-induced swings, nonresidential construction employment continued to decline, though at a slower pace compared with the sharp falls early last year.

In contrast, real spending on drilling and mining structures picked up strongly over the second half of last year in response to the rebound in oil and natural gas prices.  And increases in the number of drilling rigs in operation and in footage drilled suggest that spending continued to rise rapidly in the first quarter, likely returning to levels posted prior to the large swings in energy prices over the past four years.

Business Inventories

The data in hand for the nonfarm business sector excluding motor vehicles suggest that the pace of inventory liquidation moderated further in the first quarter after slowing sharply in the fourth quarter of last year.  Moreover, information from the motor vehicle sector indicates that auto dealers added to their stocks in the first quarter.

The staff's flow-of-goods system also suggests that large-scale liquidations have substantially subsided, and indeed, it shows a small uptick in inventories over the past three months.  Inventories appear to be approaching comfortable levels relative to sales in the aggregate, although there is some divergence in inventory positions across industries. Months' supply remains elevated (when measured at the current pace of sales) for equipment, materials, and, to a lesser degree, construction supplies.  By contrast, inventories of consumer goods (particularly motor vehicles), business supplies, and hightech goods appear low relative to demand.  Finally, the ISM index on customers' inventories remained at a very low level in March, despite increasing from its record low in January; this reading implies that supply managers in manufacturing continue to expect their customers to do some restocking in the coming months.

Federal Government Sector

Real federal government purchases appear likely to hold steady in the first quarter.  Data from the Monthly Treasury Statements through March suggest that real defense spending edged down last quarter, reflecting a temporarily slow rate of spend-out from the hefty

amount of budget authority available for these programs.  Meanwhile, nondefense purchases should be bolstered in the first quarter by stimulus-related spending.

Although federal debt continues to climb steeply, the deficit in the federal budget may be starting to stabilize following its significant deterioration over the last year or so:  The budget deficit in the first half of fiscal year 2010 was a little narrower than in the first half of fiscal year 2009.  In particular, receipts in the first quarter were up nearly 5½ percent relative to the same year-earlier period, even though last year's stimulus policies appear to have held down tax receipts this year more than last year; indeed, we think that the revenues excluding the effects of stimulus tax cuts may have increased at a double-digit pace in the first quarter.  Total federal spending fell roughly $100 billion in the first quarter relative to a year earlier, reflecting lower outlays associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). 12 However, outlays excluding financial transactions rose 15 percent compared with a year ago, due both to the effects of the weak labor market on low-income support programs and to the spending associated with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Through the end of March, the ARRA had boosted spending and had reduced taxes by a combined amount of about $370 billion, still less than half of the total $862 billion stimulus package.

State and Local Government Sector

State and local governments continue to struggle with significant budgetary pressures, and incoming data point to a sharp decline in real expenditures by these governments in the first quarter.  Real outlays on construction plunged at an average annual rate of 18 percent in January and February.  Moreover, state and local hiring continued to contract, as employment decreased at an average of about 25,000 per month in the first quarter.

Nonetheless, there are some tentative signs that the fiscal stress faced by states and localities may have begun to ease a bit.  The Census Bureau's Quarterly Summary of State and Local Government Tax Revenue indicates that local government tax receipts posted a strong increase in the fourth quarter relative to the same period a year earlier because of rising property tax collections.  Furthermore, at the state level, the pace of revenue declines moderated noticeably. 13 For the sector as a whole, total tax collections by state and local governments increased almost 1 percent over the four quarters of 2009, the first four-quarter increase in their total revenues since the third quarter of 2008.

Looking forward, the National Conference of State Legislatures reports that 42 states project revenues in fiscal 2011-which will begin on July 1 in most states-to rise above their level in the current fiscal year.  In addition, federal stimulus funds for states and localities continue to ramp up, and municipal borrowing for new capital projects has remained solid at relatively low interest rates.

Prices

Consumer price inflation has been soft recently.  Both headline and core PCE prices are estimated to have inched up 0.1 percent in March after no change in February.  This increase would put the rise in core PCE prices over the past three months at an annual rate of only ½ percent.  Taking a longer view, core consumer price inflation slowed to an estimated 1¼ percent over the 12 months ending in March, compared with 1¾ percent over the year-earlier period.  In contrast, the 12-month change in the headline index moved up noticeably over the past year, to 2 percent in March, as energy prices rebounded.  Survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have been fairly stable in recent months at levels slightly lower than those posted a year ago.

After rising sharply into the beginning of this year, PCE energy prices are estimated to have edged down in both February and March.  Retail prices for gasoline declined again last month, and consumer prices for natural gas moved down after being boosted by unusually cold weather in January and February.  However, these price declines were mostly offset by a sizable jump in consumer electricity prices in March. 14 Survey data through mid-April suggest that consumer prices for gasoline have declined again this month.  The spot price of crude oil has swung widely since the March Greenbook but ended up slightly, on balance.  However, the spot price of natural gas has declined more than 10 percent since the time of the March Greenbook, and this will probably push down retail rates for natural gas somewhat further in coming months.

The PCE price index for food and beverages is estimated to have risen 0.3 percent in March, reflecting a jump in the prices for fruits and vegetables.  Nonetheless, food prices in March remained nearly ½ percentage point below their year-earlier level.  So far this year, spot prices of farm commodities are up a bit, as small declines in crop prices have only partly offset increases in prices for livestock products.

As noted, PCE prices excluding food and energy decelerated over the past year, with the 12-month change ending in March estimated to be ½ percentage point less than in the

previous 12 months.  Market-based core prices decelerated even more noticeably, increasing only about 1 percent over the 12 months ending in March, down 1 percentage point from the increase over the year-earlier period.  Furthermore, this deceleration has been widespread, with the 12-month changes in prices for housing services, market-based services excluding energy and housing, core nondurable goods, and durable goods excluding motor vehicles all down relative to the year-earlier period.

Measures of inflation expectations have held fairly steady in recent months.  In the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary survey for April, median yearahead inflation expectations edged up to 2.9 percent, while median 5-to-10-years-ahead inflation expectations were unchanged at 2.7 percent-a reading that is near the low end of the range observed over the past few years.  Meanwhile, the TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation for both 5 years and 5-to-10 years ahead have both edged up slightly since the March Greenbook.

Cost pressures from rising commodity prices are showing through to prices at earlier stages of processing.  The PPI for core intermediate materials continued to rise at a brisk pace through February, and the 12-month change in this index was nearly 3 percent, compared with a small decline posted over the year-earlier period.  Commodity prices have also extended their sizable rebound following their collapse in 2008.  Since the March Greenbook, the Commodity Research Bureau spot price index of industrial materials has increased about 3 percent, while the Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has moved up 7 percent; commodity prices increases were widespread but especially pronounced for wood products.

Labor Costs

Measures of labor costs decelerated sharply over the past year.  Compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased only ¾ percent over the four quarters of 2009, down from a 3 percent increase over the four quarters of 2008.  As a result of this small increase in compensation and the outsized gain in productivity last year, unit labor costs fell 4½ percent in 2009 after rising 1¾ percent in 2008.

Average hourly earnings of all employees also decelerated during the past year.  Over the 12 months ending in March, this wage measure increased 1¾ percent, down from an increase of 3 percent over the year-earlier period.  In the first three months of this year, the average monthly increase in average hourly earnings was only 0.1 percent.

Thus far in April, spot WTI has continued to edge higher, closing most recently on April 20 at over $83.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the March Greenbook, we have received balance of payments data for the fourth quarter of 2009, Treasury (TIC) data on U.S. international financial transactions for February, and partial and confidential data on custody accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) through mid-April.  The data show that acquisitions of U.S. Treasury securities by foreign official institutions remain strong and that foreign official net purchases continue to provide the major share of net financial inflows.

In February, foreign official net purchases of U.S. Treasuries picked up to nearly $30 billion following two months of relatively small inflows (see lines 1a and 1b of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions').

.  Custody data from FRBNY suggest particularly strong official inflows for March, including the largest acquisition of U.S. agency securities since mid-2008, and similar strength thus far in April.  This strength runs counter to news reports in recent months of slowing official inflows.  Such reports often point to the unadjusted TIC data, particularly for December and January, and the lower share of foreign participation in Treasury auctions in February and March (not shown).  However, official institutions often use private foreign entities to purchase securities, and these purchases would not be recorded as foreign official in the published TIC data.  Confidential adjustments to TIC data for this effect using daily custody data from FRBNY yield the stronger inflows reported here.  Furthermore, while foreign participation in Treasury auctions has declined, the FRBNY custody data confirm that foreign officials are nonetheless acquiring substantial amounts of Treasury securities.

Foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities continue to be mixed, although stronger overall in February than in January.  Private foreign investors, mainly in Asia, made unusually large purchases of Treasury securities in February (line 4a).  In addition, foreign purchases of equities returned to a strong pace in February after a somewhat slower January (line 4b).

Incoming indicators suggest that the recovery continued in the first quarter, led by exports.  In February, real exports rose at a robust 1.1 percent monthly pace, just marginally below the fourth-quarter average; however, real imports continued to accelerate, rising 1.8 percent, indicating that the recovery is gradually spilling over to the domestic sector.  In addition, consumer sentiment continued to improve, car sales reached a five-year peak in March, and the ratio in February of active job openings to applications edged up further.

Financial market reaction to the news was negligible.  Thus far, the facility, which was set up in December and makes available three-month loans at a fixed interest rate of 0.1 percent against a broad range of collateral, has contributed to slightly lower shortterm interest rates.
