Domestic Developments

The information  eceived  ince he  last  eeting f  the  FOMC r s t m o suggests  hat t economic activity s  been  expanding  only  very  slowly f  late  ut  has  not  slid ha o b backwards.  Real GDP now is  estimated  o  have  increased  t  an  annual ate  f t a r o about  1  percent  n  the  fourth  uarter, d our est uess s hat  t ose  at i q an b g i t i r a similar  ace  in  the irst arter.  usinesses  ave  been  working  to orrect p f qu B h c inventory  mbalances,  nd  this  as  led o  sizable  eclines  n  manufacturing i a h t d i output. hus far,  owever,  spillovers    income  and  demand more broadly  ave T h to h been  limited.  espite    plunge  in  sentiment, useholds ave  maintained  heir D a ho h t spending,  lbeit  t  a slower ace  than  in  the  second  half  f ast  ear. oreover, a a p o l y M homebuilding as  picked p,  and  business  utlays  n plant  nd  equipment  held h u o o a up reasonably  ell  early  his  ear. w t y

Despite  the onsiderable op  in  the ederal  unds ate ince he urn f he ear, c dr f f r s t t o t y financial nditions  ave  not  eased  appreciably,   t  all. t s rue  hat orporate co h if a I i t t c bond yields nd  mortgage  rates  ave  declined ince ear-end. owever,  broad a h s y H equity ndexes ave  continued o  slump  despite  he  lower nterest tes, aten i h t t i ra be down by  bad  news about  corporate  arnings nd  by  increased  ncertainty. e a u Given our  outlook or  the conomy,  corporate  arnings  re  likely  o  remain f e e a t disappointing r  a  while, nd  we are  projecting e  Wilshire  000  to ove a  bit fo a th 5 m lower  in  the eriod head.  Although  U.S.  equity  arkets  have  weakened and p a m domestic  interest  tes  ave  moved down, the  exchange  value f he  dollar  as ra h o t h strengthened  urther. f

Though there s  no  evidence f   widespread credit  runch,"  inancing  or i o a " c f f businesses  ontinues  o  be  relatively ht.  onditions  n  the ommercial  paper c t tig C i c market  are  still hospitable  r ower-tier  rms nd  even  for tronger  irms in fo l fi a s f viewed as  susceptible    a  rating  owngrade.

Economic conditions  broad  appear o  be  somewhat weaker  than  we thought t a t a the  time  of he  January reenbook.  We  have  cut ur  estimate  f  foreign  utput t G o o o growth  in  the econd  half  f 000  about  1/4  percentage  oint, d we have s o 2 p an trimmed  the  near-term  utlook s  well.  In  part,  his  eassessment  eflects  e o a t r r th fact  hat  he lowdown in  the  United  States  nd  the  global igh-tech  orrection t t s a h c now appear  to  have  damped foreign  conomic  activity  re than  we had e mo previously  hought. t

The forecast  ssumes  another 0-basis-point  duction  n  the  federal  unds  rate a 5 re i f in  the ear erm--bringing e  change  vis-Ã -vis e  January reenbook to 5 n t th th G 7 basis oints.  y our  estimates, is  ower  level f  short-term terest  tes p B th l o in ra essentially  fsets e  implications  r conomic  activity   the  more negative of th fo e of assumptions bout  the  stock arket, xchange  rate,  nd  foreign  ctivity.  a a m e a a As result,  r  projection lls  or eal DP  to  increase  t  an  annual ate f bout ou ca f r G a r o a 1-1/4  percent  n  the  second  quarter  efore radually  trengthening    a 3-3/4 i b g s to percent  ate  n  2002--about  he  same as  in  the anuary reenbook. We  continue r i t J G to  expect he  inventory  djustment  n  the  manufacturing  ector  nd  the hakeout t a i s a s in  high-tech  ndustries    largely ay  out  over  the irst lf  f his  ear. ollowi to pl f ha o t y F on effects  business  nd  household pending ay still   evident  s  we move on a s m be a through  midyear, ut  those ffects  hould  diminish s  the ear  progresses. b e s a y Given our  estimate  f  a still-high e f  return  n  new investment, pital o rat o o ca spending  picks p somewhat in  the  second  half  f his  ear,  nd  consumer u o t y a spending  firms fter    weak second  quarter,   part  ecause  of  a  step-up  n a a in b i income growth.

We  view  the  current  conomic  environment s  fragile,  th  the conomy e a wi e vulnerable  o  adverse hocks.  Alternative del simulations ter  n  this  ection t s mo la i s explore he  implications r conomic  activity d  inflation    a  more t fo e an of pronounced, ut  temporary,  lowdown in  high-tech  nvestment,  lower  rate  f b s i a o technical  rogress, d  a sustained  oss f  consumer  confidence.  e  also p an l o W consider  he  possibility t ome of  the ore positive ending ndicators t tha s m sp i of late ay be  signaling  reater  nderlying  trength   the  economy than e have m g u s in w assumed in  the aseline  rojection. b p

Key  Background Factors

Long-term  corporate  ond  yields  ave  fallen  ince he  January OMC b h s t F meeting. We  expect hem  to  inch p over  the rojection riod n our  view  that  he ond t u p pe o t b market  will e  surprised  the  absence  of  any  additional netary  easing b by mo beyond the  first arter. th  earnings  eports  xpected o  continue  o  be qu Wi r e t t disappointing,  uity rices  re  assumed  to  decline    bit  urther   the econd eq p a a f in s quarter  o  a  level  early 0 percent  elow  that n he  January reenbook  but  to t n 1 b i t G remain  flat  hereafter. t

On the  fiscal ont,  e have  adjusted  ur  assumptions  o  reflect e udget fr w o t h b developments f  the ast wo months.

Specifically, have an p oft we trimmed the  size f he  assumed  tax  cut n  2002 o t i by $10 billion rom  $50 billion (f to  $40  billion)  ile  adding  a  similar  mount to iscretionary  ending. he wh a d sp T

Recent  Developments and the  Near-term  Outlook

We  now project  hat eal DP  is  increasing   an  annual ate f .8  percent  n t r G at r o 0 i the  current  uarter, mpared with  the rojected  ecline  f .5  percent  n  the q co p d o 0 i January  Greenbook.

Roughly one-third  f he  upward revision  o  GDP  in  the  current  uarter  eflects o t t q r developments n  the otor  vehicle  ector, ere sales  ave  been  running uch i m s wh h m higher han  we had  anticipated.  e additional les  tem  importantly om t Th sa s fr another ound  of ncentives  nd  from  the  moving forward f  some fleet  ales r i a o s from later  n  the ear.

The automakers' s sh p f G latest hedules  all or ssemblies  o  rise  o  12 million  nits  n he  second sc c f a t t u i t quarter;  owever, iven  the  likelihood at nventories specially    light h g th i (e of trucks)  ill till    high  at  the nd  of he urrent  uarter,  are  anticipating w s be e t c q we a much smaller  ncrease--to million  nits,  hich would  be  a  small lus or ext i 11 u w p f n quarter's  P.

International Developments

Overview

Growth  abroad has weakened  as foreign  activity  has been hit by  spillovers from the U.S.  slowdown,  the global slump in high-tech  industries,  and softer domestic demand  in some countries. Accordingly, the  staff's  projection  of foreign growth for the  first half of this  year  has been lowered  from the January  Greenbook. A large  part of the downward  revision reflects  reduced growth prospects  in Mexico in  light of a contraction  of exports  in the fourth  quarter that produced  a sharp drop  in Mexican  GDP.  Our outlook for growth  in Japan was marked  down as well. A fourth-quarter  surge in  private investment  is likely to be reversed  in response to  weakness of both private  consumption  and external  demand.  The expected recovery of U.S.  activity,  lower oil prices, and some policy easing abroad should  help boost foreign  growth to near its potential  rate in the second half of this year and in 2002. However, recent volatility in global financial markets has increased  downside  risks to this  outlook.  The near-term  projection for foreign  inflation  has been  lowered--partly because  of a very  abrupt deceleration of consumer  prices in Mexico in recent months--but  average  foreign inflation is expected  to return  later this  year to a rate of about  3 percent  as global economic  growth picks up.

NOTE. Changes for years  are  measured  as Q4/Q4;  for half-years,  Q2/Q4 or

Q4/Q2;  and for quarters,  from previous  quarter.

Our oil price  projection,  in line with  futures  prices, continues  to call  for a  gradual decline over the forecast  period.  The projected  path of oil prices runs along  a somewhat  higher track than in the January Greenbook,  however, as OPEC appears to have become more willing to trade off a smaller market share for higher prices. The foreign  exchange  value of the dollar once again is expected  to decline over the forecast  period.  However, the dollar starts  from  a higher level and depreciates  at a slower  pace than projected  in the January  Greenbook, reflecting  its recent  resilience  and  softer growth  abroad. The projected 2 percent depreciation of the real broad  dollar index  over the next  seven quarters  puts the dollar  at a level  that is 4 percent  higher than in the  January  Greenbook.

Financial  market  contagion from  the crisis in Turkey  has been muted  so far. Bond spreads  for most emerging-market  countries  have held steady  since  the January  FOMC  meeting, while  stock prices  have  moved down in a pattern similar to that  seen in industrial  countries.

Economic  activity abroad. In foreign industrial  countries, data  from the  fourth quarter confirm  that average  growth maintained  a moderate pace  of about 2 /2 percent. 1 More recent indicators,  however, point to slower growth  in the current quarter. Growth in the euro area picked up in the fourth quarter to nearly 3 percent, but the  pattern  across the  major countries  was uneven,  with growth  in France  quite strong  and Germany lagging  behind at less than  1 percent. Canadian manufacturing  has taken a fairly  severe hit from the U.S.  slowdown, but other sectors,  such as construction  and  services,  appear to have remained strong. In  Japan,  a fourth-quarter  bounceback  of investment  spending  pushed GDP growth in 2000:H2 a little above zero.  However, consumption was  very weak in the fourth quarter, and recent  indicators--including  industrial  production, machinery  orders, construction  starts, and exports--suggest  that the economy  is faltering. Political turmoil and  an  intensifying debate  about emergency  policies have  added uncertainty  to prospects  for recovery.

Deflation of core consumer prices in Japan quickened  a bit in February to slightly more than  1 percent.  In some  other industrial  countries, core  inflation rates  have edged up, but price pressures  generally  remain  subdued.  Lower oil prices helped headline  consumer-price  inflation  in the  euro  area fall  slightly to 2.4 percent in January. The figure was  outside the European  Central Bank's 2 percent  target ceiling  for the eighth consecutive  month, but core  inflation was only  1.6 percent. Canadian consumer-price  inflation  in January  was  at the 3  percent  ceiling  of  the Bank of Canada's inflation  band, but core inflation  was 2  percent.  In the  United  Kingdom, retail-price  inflation remained  well below the target  rate  of 2.5  percent.

Growth in the major developing  countries has  slowed.  Weakness  in exports to the United  States  prompted a sharp fourth-quarter  contraction  in Mexico,  and activity in  Argentina remains  sluggish. Growth in emerging Asia has been undercut by weaker global  demand  and ongoing adjustments  in the high-tech sector.  Indeed,  industrial production in  some countries in the region has been contracting,  and  growth in China appears  to have  slowed.  The  situation in Turkey  remains unsettled as  the authorities  await finalization  of a new IMF-supported  stabilization program.  Following  the decision  on February 22 to allow the Turkish lira to  float,  it has  depreciated  30 percent on balance.
