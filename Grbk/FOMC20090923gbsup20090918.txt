The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Housing Starts

Single-family housing starts inched down to an annual rate of 480,000 units in August but remained substantially above the record low reached in the first quarter.  Adjusted single-family permit issuance-which usually leads starts activity by a month or soheld steady in August at a level just below the rate of starts.  Meanwhile, tight credit conditions and elevated vacancy rates continued to hold back activity in the much smaller multifamily sector, with starts registering another very weak reading of 120,000 units (annual rate) in August.

Note: Attached is an updated version of the table on nonfarm inventory investment that appeared on page II-26 of Part 2.

The International Economy

U.S. Current Account

Balance of payments data for the second quarter were released on Wednesday.  The current account deficit narrowed slightly in the second quarter of 2009 to $395 billion at an annual rate.  The decrease relative to the previous quarter was more than accounted for by a shrinking of the deficit on goods and services, as imports have fallen by more than exports.  However, this improvement in the goods and services balance was partly offset by a somewhat smaller surplus in investment income and larger deficit in other income and transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The recently released balance of payments data also included more complete information on financial flows in the second quarter.  U.S. direct investment abroad and foreign direct investment into the United States remained weak in the second quarter (see lines 6 and 7 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions'), and on net generated an outflow of $19 billion.  Transactions by non-banking concerns and other bank flows reported quarterly resulted in an inflow of $54 billion (line 10).

The statistical discrepancy for the first half of 2009 was a sizable $111 billion, more than half the current account deficit recorded during the period.  This positive discrepancy suggests some over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial flows.
