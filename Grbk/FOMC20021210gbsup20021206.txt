Labor Markets

The labor market report for November was a touch weaker than we had expected.  Labor market conditions appear to have slipped a little between October and November, with private employment on nonfarm payrolls falling 48,000, a second noticeable monthly decline.  In addition, the unemployment rate popped up to 6.0 percent last month, after having averaged 5.7 percent over the preceding three months.

Manufacturing industries continued to perform poorly, shedding 45,000 jobs in November, roughly the same rate of decrease as in the previous several months.  The help supply and wholesale trade industries, which are closely related to manufacturing, posted cutbacks of 23,000 and 5,000 respectively, although these losses were somewhat smaller than in October.  Outside of manufacturing the largest reduction in employment in November occurred in retail trade where the loss of 39,000 jobs may have been driven in part by poor holiday hiring.  Jobs in the transportation and public utilities industries also continued to contract.

The services industry (excluding help supply) remained a relative bright spot as employment rose 73,000, matching the average increase since mid-year. Within services, health and education establishments continued their strong expansion, recording gains of 27,000 and 15,000 respectively.  The finance, insurance, and real estate industry added 7,000 jobs last month, but the gain was well below the average gains of prior months.

Hiring for the Transportation Security Administration continued to boost government payrolls last month, but the Postal Service reported that, because of technological advances, it needed fewer holiday workers than in the past. On net government employment was up 8,000.

Aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined 0.1 percent in November for the second month in a row; however, because of September's large increase, the level of hours last month stood just above the third-quarter average.  Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in November from October's upward revised level of 34.2 hours.

The rise in the unemployment rate in November brings the movement of that series more closely in line with other recent labor market indicators.  The overthe-month increase was concentrated among adult men, although the unemployment rate among teenagers also moved up considerably.  Meanwhile, the labor force participation rate moved down 0.3 percentage point to

66.4 percent, the lowest level since January 1996.   Household employment 1 plummeted 689,000 in November.  Over the past two months, household employment has fallen 960,000, retracing most of the 1.1 million increase that took place in August and September.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls increased 0.3 percent in November.  Over the twelve months ended in November, the change in average hourly earnings was 2.9 percent, down from 3.9 percent over the previous twelve months.

In the weeks following the reference week for the labor market reports, initial claims for unemployment insurance moved lower.  The drop in new claims in the week ended November 30 put the four-week moving average at 377,000; using alternative seasonal factors-calculated excluding the spike in claims after September 11, 2001-that figure was 391,000, 40,000 below the late October level.  However, Labor Department staff caution that the unevenness of weekly filings during holiday periods may have contributed to the most recent decline.
