Overview

The last  reenbook described   turbulent nancial vironment hat aised  ome G a fi en t r s significant  estions  bout  the  prospects  or ustained onomic expansion.  Our qu a f s ec a th e F t m w financial rkets efore hey  got  better--especially  he  case  of  equities. ma b t in  t forecast  nticipated  at,  ven  with  a near-term  ed  easing,  hings  ight  get orse  in Consequently,  e predicted  hat  eal DP  growth  would slow  to  a very  meager  pace w t r G in  early 999 and  remain  subpar nto 000. 1 i 2

Things  not  only  got  worse  in  the atter rt f  September  and  early ctober, l pa o O they  got  downright orrible  n  some respects, th  fear ncreasingly  minating  greed h i wi i do in  many  financial ctors.  he quarter-point  t  in  the ederal  unds  target  nnounced se T cu f f a on the  day  of  the  FOMC meeting  proved  a  weak palliative  r he  markets'  oncerns, fo t c with  the  craving or afety  nd  liquidity coming,  if  nything,  ore intense  or f s a be a m f a time.  However, the  second  quarter-point  imming  of  the  funds  rate,  nnounced  along tr a with  an  equal  cut  in he  discount  ate n  October  15,  came sooner han  expected y t r o t b the  market  and  proved  a  powerful lixir.  onvinced  that  he ed  meant to o e C t F d whatever  it ight  take o  buoy  the  economy,  participants   he  stock arket  turned n m t int m a incipient turn nto   roaring  ally  hat as  brought he  major  indexes ost  of he up i a r t h t m t way back  toward  their  arlier ghs.  With confidence olstered   well y  signs hat e hi b as b t the  world  community is obilizing  o  support he  Brazilian  conomy, many--but ot m t t e n all--segments   the  capital  arkets ave  begun  to  reopen or ew issuance  usiness, of m h f n b and risk preads  ave  narrowed  to  some degree. s h

Meanwhile,  the  incoming  data  on  the eal conomy have  been  mixed. Thirdr e quarter  DP  growth  was stronger  han  we estimated  n  September;  on  the ther and, G t i o h that pside  surprise  as largely  n  inventory  nvestment,  nd  indications  oftening u w i i a ofs labor emand and  an  increasingly gative one  to  the  news from  the  manufacturing d ne t sector  eem to  point o  an  economy in  transition    a lower  growth  path.  We  now are s t to predicting at eal  DP  growth  in  the ourth uarter  ill e  somewhere around th r G f q w b 2 percent,  nd we continue  o  foresee    further  otching  own of  growth  in arly a t a n d e 1999. However,  the  projected  ace  of xpansion ext  year  is  little  gher han  in  the p e n a hi t last orecast,  ing mainly  to  three,  artly  nterrelated,  siderations  at  uggest f ow p i con th s a somewhat more positive  rajectory r ggregate emand:  the  more aggressive  asing t fo a d e of  monetary  conditions,  e  resurgence  f  share rices, d a  sharper  epreciation th o p an d of the  dollar  han  we anticipated    the  last  reenbook. Real  GDP t in G is ow projected  o n t

grow a  little  re than  1-1/2 ercent ver  the  course f mo p o o 1999, a  few tenths  ore than m last  ime, nd  then -1/4 ercent  n  2000. t a 2 p i

The upward revision  o he  GDP  path  implies  hat he  unemployment rate  ill t t t t w rise ess;  ow,  we do  not  have  it reaching he  5 percent ark until  he  end  of  1999. l n b t m t That  fact,  long  with  an  earlier  d  more substantial  preciation   the ollar, ght a an de of d mi suggest hat he  inflation  tlook ould  be  less avorable.  owever,  those  factors t t ou w f H have  been  largely  ffset  n  our  updated  projection   a  reassessment  f he utlook or o i by o t o f wages and  by another rimming  of nergy  prices. hus,  we are  still edicting at t e T pr th overall  PI increases  ill arely xceed  2 percent  n  the  next wo years,  amped a C w b e i t d couple  of enths  y  the  adoption f "geo-means"  for alculating  e ndex  starting t b o c th i in January.

Key  Background  Factors

The easing f  monetary  policy as  occurred aster an  we anticipated    the  last o h f th in Greenbook,  and  we have  extrapolated at endency n  a small  way by assuming  that th t i the  last  eg  f he  assumed  moderate  easing rocess lso ill ccur airly  oon.  In  the l o t p a w o f s longer-term  arkets, e are  expecting hat reasury ields ill emain  somewhere in m w t T y w r the  vicinity   the urrent  evels, t  that rivate  ates ill rift  own, narrowing he of c l bu p r w d d t unusually ide spreads ver  Treasuries  till evailing day.  That  said,    key  element w o s pr to a in  our  forecast  f  notable eceleration    domestic pending s  our  view  that he o a d in s i t overall  inancial vironment ill estrain tivity ing  forward, espite  he  decline f en w r ac go d t in  real hort-term  ates. s r

In  the redit  arkets,  anks  have  tightened  heir  erms  and  standards  urther, c m b t t f especially r  business nd  commercial  real state  oans. nd although e expect hat fo a e l A w t some of  the  pressures  ffecting nk  lending ill ase  in  the  coming months,  we do a ba w e not  think t ikely  hat  vailability  pricing  ill eturn  oon  to  the i l t a and w r s status o  ante; qu banks  that  ely eavily n  purchased oney to  fund  on-balance-sheet nding r  on the r h o m le o capital  arkets o  resell  oans ill ikely  e  inclined  o  maintain   tighter sture. n m t l w l b t a po I the  bond  markets, oo, e would be surprised   see  a quick eturn  o  the  previous t w to r t norms of  liquidity  d minuscule isk  preads. hile  high-rated  irms ave  regained an r s W f h access o  the  primary  market, ower-rated  orporate  onds  have  only  begun  to  resume t l c b selling  nd  only  for ome select  orrowers.  We  are  anticipating  at  arkets  will a s b th m serve   wider  range  of  borrowers a by early ext  year, verting  hat might  otherwise e n a w b a  serious  onstraint   capital  xpenditures. c on e

We  also  expect hat he  public quity arkets  will eopen  more  fully  efore t t e m r b long, oth  to  seasoned ssuers  nd  to  IPOs. But our  forecast  uggests  hat ome b i a s t s

reverses  re  ahead  for quity nvestors.  lthough  our  assumed funds  rate ath  is  not a e i A p at  odds  with  the revailing pectation,  r  projection  f  corporate  arnings  s: e  see p ex ou o e i W profits  alling   1999,  whereas  most Wall Street  trategists   securities  alysts  till f in s and an s are  talking  bout  moderate  to  huge  increases  n  earnings  er hare.  Consequently,  e a i p s w anticipate  at here ill e a  partial tracing  f  the  recent  ally  nd  that  he  major th t w b re o r a t indexes ill verage  appreciably  elow  the  current  evels  n  both  1999 and 2000. The w a b l i stock rice ath  is igher han  in  the  last reenbook,  but  it till  plies n  appreciable p p h t G s im a decline n  the atio  f  household ealth o  income. Once again, e would suggest i r o w t w that he istorically h  price-earnings  tios  n  our  forecast present   downside  risk t h hig ra i re a to  share rices nd  the  outlook or emand; however,  a  more immediate  risk  s p a f d i perhaps  that he  momentum t of  the  current  ally  ill arry quity alues ell  above  the r w c e v w levels  mbedded in  this  DP  projection. e G

This  revision t fu o t implies   more favorable  ompetitive  osition  or .S.  producers,  lthough he  effects a c p f U a t on our  trade alance re  lessened  y some negative  ews on foreign  conomic activity. b a b n e Japan  looks o e even  weaker  than e had  thought,  nd  the  outlook  or uropean t b w a f E growth  appears   bit ess ositive   well.  The announcement of  an impending a l p as support ackage  for  Brazil s ssumed  to  head  off ome of  the  scarier  utcomes  for p i a s o that  ountry,  ut  the  accompanying  shift  o iscal  estraint  ere s rojected  o  result c b t f r th i p t in  a  significant  wnturn  in  economic activity rough  1999. All  told,  oreign  eal do th f r GDP  now is  projected  o ise bout  1-1/2  percent  n  1999 and  2-1/4 ercent  n t r a i p i 2000--somewhat  less han orecast  n  September. t f i

Real  personal onsumption  expenditures ntinued o  rise apidly  n  the hird c co t r i t quarter--albeit  ell  below  the  breakneck peed  of he  first lf f he  year--and  e at  w s t ha o t w are  projecting other efty dvance  this  uarter. an h a q PCE rose  0.6  percent  n  real erms i t in  September, nd  light  ehicle  ales  urged  in  October,  esponding o  the  favorable a v s s r t pricing  roduced  by  the utomakers'  ompetition  or arket  share.

Consumer  spending. One  of  the  critical  ements n  our  forecast  f  a  slowing el i o of economic expansion n  1999 is  a  moderation n  the  growth  of onsumption.

We  are  projecting  hat  omestic ebt  growth  will low  substantially--to t d d s 4-1/2  percent n  1999 and  to  3-1/2 ercent n  2000. This  would  raise  he  ratio  f  debt i p i t o to  nominal GDP further  n  1999 but  trim t lightly er  the  course f he  following i i s ov o t year.

OMB's May 1998 surplus estimates (assuming the  enactment of the  President's proposals), excluding deposit insurance spending, are $35 billion in  FY98, $51 billion in  FY99 and $58 billion in  FY00, and  CBO's August baseline estimates are $59 billion in  FY98, $76 billion in  FY99 and  $76 billion in  FY0O.

- 4 HEB is the  NIPA current and  capital account surplus in current dollars, with cyclically sensitive receipts and outlays adjusted to the level of potential output associated with an  unemployment rate of 6 percent. Real potential GDP  growth is assumed to  be 2.8 percent beginning 1995:Q3. Quarterly figures for change in HEB and  FI are  not at  annual rates. Change in  HEB, as  a  percent of nominal potential GDP, is reversed in  sign. FI is the weighted difference of  discretionary changes in federal spending and taxes in chained (1992) dollars, scaled by real federal consumption plus investment, For change in  HEB and  FI, negative values indicate restraint.

26 percent, reversing  some of its earlier, exceptionally  large decline against the dollar as some signs of progress  in economic restructuring have been noted and interest rates have been kept high.  Stock markets in these countries have rallied strongly since the September FOMC meeting, and both their domestic interest rates and spreads  on their off-shore  dollar interest rates over U.S. Treasuries have declined.

Financial  market developments in the major Latin American countries  have been mixed.  Stock markets  have rebounded, especially  since the U.S. rate cut in mid-October. Domestic short-term interest  rates have receded somewhat,  but remain high in real terms (over  30 percent in Brazil).  Brady bond spreads  declined slightly  further on balance during  the period;  these  spreads--now  in a range of 8 percent to  12 percent for Argentina, Mexico, and Brazil--are well below the peaks reached  in September but are still nearly double their relatively low levels at the beginning of August.  The Mexican peso rose slightly against the dollar on balance during the period.

The Brazilian real continued  under pressure for much of the period, although the rate of reserve loss slowed substantially.  Brazil's reserves fell another $2 billion and stood at $44 billion at the end of the period.  Cardoso emerged from Brazil's  presidential election victorious as expected, but the outcome of congressional  and gubernatorial elections pointed to mixed support for his  legislative agenda.  In connection  with its IMF program, the Brazilian government has unveiled a fairly ambitious fiscal agenda, which aimed to raise the primary budget balance by about 4 percent  of GDP in 1999, relative  to baseline projections,  to a surplus of 2-1/2 percent of GDP.  The funding of the international  support package  for Brazil  is expected to  amount to a little over $40 billion, including  $18  billion from the IMF, $9 billion from multilateral  development banks,  and nearly $15  billion in bilateral support from 20 participating countries  and the BIS (including $5 billion from the United States).' Given uncertainties about Brazil's ability to deliver on its fiscal plans, the risks associated with this  program are high.  The markets' reaction  in anticipation of the program has been generally favorable  so far, but patience over delays in concluding  the letter of intent may be wearing thin.
