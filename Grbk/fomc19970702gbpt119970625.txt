Domestic Developments

Overview

Real GDP growth  appears o  have  slowed in  the  second  quarter  bout  as  we predicted t a in  the ast reenbook--probably  o  somewhere around  2 percent t  an  annual  rate. l G t a Nonetheless,  e  have  raised ur  projection r  activity   coming quarters.  n  part,  e w o fo in I w are  impressed y the  momentum b of  industrial  oduction, ich  is eing  sustained  y pr wh b b strong emand for  durable oods and  the  low level f  inventories lative   sales. d g o re to And although etail les agged  this  pring,  urveys ndicate  hat onsumers  are r sa l s s i t c feeling  xtraordinarily eat;  hey  clearly  ave  the  wherewithal,  ncluding  ubstantial e upb t h i s wealth  and ample credit  ines,  o  support efty pending  gains.  Exuberance  marks the l t h s financial rkets  as  well, nd  stock nd bond prices ave  climbed  even  more than  we ma a a h anticipated st  onth;  this  emains  a  highly iquid  conomy.  All  told,  e see  little la m r l e w to prevent  domestic emand from  maintaining    fairly  risk  rowth  pace  into he  second d a b g t half.

We  now project  hat eal t r GDP will  grow just   little  ss han a le t 3 percent,  t  an a annual  rate,  ver  the  second  half f o o 1997, 1/2  percentage oint aster  han  predicted  n p f t i the  last reenbook. However, activity   projected  o  decelerate  ubstantially  er  the G is t s ov course  of  1998,  with GDP increasing  nly  a touch  more than  the  2 percent redicted o p last  onth. We  believe his  orecast  etter  alances  he  risks  n he  outlook or eal m t f b b t i t f r growth  than  has  been  the ase  in  our  recent  aseline  orecasts.  ven so,  we remain c b f E concerned  that e may  still  understating e ear-term trength  f  the  economy-w be th n s o and  the  potential r ore of  a  boom-bust  pattern, th  a buildup f  inflationary fo m wi o pressures  rompting  a marked tightening  f onetary  policy.  In  this orecast, flation p o m f in gathers peed  only  gradually, d  we have  once  again  assumed  no further  nugging  of s an s money market  conditions  ntil  ell  into 998. u w 1

Indeed, ven  though  the  higher utput ath  in  this  reenbook implies e o p G a somewhat tighter  abor arket;  we have  trimmed our  forecast  f  inflation  ightly. l m o sl The recent ews on  consumer  prices  as  been  on track ith  our  earlier ediction,  t n h w pr bu the  emerging  balance f  supply nd demand in  the  agricultural  energy  sectors  as o a and h tilted  bit ore favorably  han  we anticipated.   addition,  have given  greater a m t In we weight  this  ime  to  the  damping effect  n  goods  markets  of he  rapid rowth  of t i t g productive  apacity  n  manufacturing. he resultant lder ncrease  n  living  osts c i T mi i i c suggests  ess ressure  n nominal  wages and a  general uting  of  inflation l p o m expectations.  ll  told,  verall  PI inflation   xpected  to  be  only  about  2-1/4 ercent A o C ise p this  ear  and  to  remain elow 3  percent n 1998. y b i

Background  Factors  in  the  Forecast

As in  prior  orecasts,   have assumed  that he  federal  unds  rate olds t  the  present f we t f h a level ntil  bout  the  middle  of ext  year, hen,  as  inflation  cks p,  the  FOMC u a n w pi u initiates oderate  increase  o  avert  decline  n  real  hort ates. ong-term  interest a m t a i s r L rates  ave fallen  oticeably  ver  the ast onth,  reflecting e umulating vidence f h n o p m th c e o more moderate  growth  and  restrained flation  d the  growing  conviction  mong in an a financial rket  participants  at he  FOMC ma th t will old  policy teady ver  the  near h s o term. Over time, owever,  market  wariness bout  increased  nflation,  lated  n h a i re i particular    the  pressures  n  the  labor arket, s ikely  o ontain uch  enthusiasm nd to i m i l t c s a to  be  reflected   some firming  n  bond  yields. ong-term  rates re rojected  o  rise in i L a p t a bit  further  s  the  System  tightens xt  year. a ne

Meanwhile,  equity  rices ave  continued o  outstrip r  expectations d  now p h t ou an stand  substantially ve  the  levels  e had  expected n  the  last  reenbook. The abo w i G market  is  likely  o  remain  skittish,   we see  nothing n  the ear-term  utlook hat t but i n o t will rick hat increasingly    looking o  be  a speculative bble--and  e have  built p w is t bu w into ur  forecast    modest  further  arket  advance  in  the  second  half f  the ear, o a m o y despite  he  presence f  already  istorically h  price-earnings  ltiples.  owever, t o h hig mu H we are  anticipating onsiderable  etreat   share  values n a c r in i 1998 as  the  "new paradigm"  that s urrently  scendant mong  analysts  s  called  nto uestion  y a i c a a i i q b squeeze  on  corporate  rofit  argins  and an  updrift  n  inflation. tual  and anticipated p m i Ac Fed actions  o ombat that nflation  e  expected o  weigh on  the  market  as  well. t c i ar t

On the  fiscal  ront,  e have  edged  up our  projections r he  unified  udget f w fo t b deficit  o  $59 billion   fiscal  997 and t in 1 $85 billion  n  fiscal i 1998, compared with projections   $57 billion d $77 billion   the  May  Greenbook. This  moderate of an in increase  n  the  deficit llows ive ears  of  steady eclines.  he increase  s rimarily i fo f y d T i p due to  a  projected  lowing n  the  growth  of eceipts,  flecting  th  a slowing  in  the s i r re bo growth  of  nominal  incomes  and the  absence  of  any further tsized evenue ains uch ou r g s as  have  occurred n  each  of he  past wo  years. i t t 1 Outlays,  n the  other and,  continue o h to  grow at  around  the  same pace  of ecent  ears. r y

We  have also ade some adjustments  o  our  fiscal  olicy ssumptions o m t p a t reflect e  thrust  f  the  emerging  budget  legislation.    particular, have  raised th o In we discretionary  ending  in  fiscal sp 1998 to  reflect e  proposed  raising  f he  spending h o t caps  included n  the  congressional dget  resolution. though  the  specifics   the  tax i bu Al of

legislation  main  in  flux,  t ow  seems likely  hat ome key tax  cuts ill o into re i n t s w g effect  ater  han  we had  assumed. In  addition, e  child ax  credit  ill robably e l t th t w p b more generous  than  we had built  nto ur  previous rojection.  ll  told,  e now i o p A w expect  this  ear's  pending  and tax  legislation   ncrease  he  budget  deficit  1  billion y s toi t $ in  fiscal  998,  whereas  the ackage  we had  assumed in  May  would have lowered  the 1 p deficit  1  billion. $

In  the xternal  ector,  rowth  in  foreign  conomic  activity,    the  aggregate, e s g e in appears o  be  roughly n  line ith  our  expectations r he  first lf f  1997,  and we t i w fo t ha o have retained  ur  forecast  hat oreign  DP o t f G will ise  bout  4 percent his  ear  and r a t y next.  Recent  developments  in  foreign  xchange  markets ave also een  about  as e h b expected, ith  the  trade-weighted lue  of  the  dollar  n  terms  of  other -10 currencies w va i G continuing  o  fluctuate   a  narrow  range  after  aving  soared ver he  first rt f  the t in h o t pa o year.  Looking ahead, e  still pect he  dollar  o  edge down over  the  next  year  and a w ex t t half nd to  end 1998 about  2 percent elow  recent evels.  eanwhile,  crude  oil rices a b l M p have  dropped  over  the ast onth,  and  the  spot rice f  West Texas  intermediate p m p o currently  tands ust  elow $19 per  barrel. ith worldwide  stocks igh  relative s j b W h to projected  emand, the  WTI  price ay settle  round  $18.50 in  the  second  half f  1997, d m a o $1  lower  than n  the  May  Greenbook. We  anticipate at  he  price ill rift  p to i th t w d u $19.50 by the  second  half f  1998,  the  same level s  in  the ay  Greenbook. o a M

The Current  Quarter

We  now estimate  hat eal DP  will ave  grown at  an annual  rate f  2.2  percent n t r G h o i the  current  uarter, ly  a bit ore rapidly  han  we had  predicted  ast  onth. q on m t l m Although  consumer spending  has  decelerated re sharply han  we had anticipated, mo t other omponents of  final  emand appear  to  be  growing  faster  han  previously c d t projected,  nd we no longer oresee uch drag  from  inventory  nvestment. ggregate a f m i A hours  also oint o  only  a  moderate  gain  in  output his  uarter,   balance: p t t q on Employment growth  has  remained  brisk,  fter  ne cuts hrough he  noise ssociated a o t t a with  statistical  blems  in  April,  ut  the verage  workweek has  dropped  back. pro b a

The Longer-Run  Outlook

As indicated  n  the  overview, e raised ur  forecast  f  aggregate  emand  growth  over i w o o d the  next  few quarters  argely  n  the  basis f  our  assessment f  the  implications   the l o o o of prevailing  bullience ong  households nd businesses  nd the  friendly  onditions  n e am a a c i the  financial rkets.  Nonetheless,  e continue o  anticipate nsiderable  eceleration ma w t co d in  economic  activity   1998. The slowing  is vident  n  both  household  and business in e i expenditures  nd  largely  eflects e  already  igh  rates f  real sset ccumulation  nd a r th h o a a a the  less avorable  inancial vironment  anticipated  r  1998.  In  addition, nfarm f f en fo no inventory  nvestment s  expected  to  be  a  fairly  eutral  nfluence  n GDP i i n i o growth hereafter,  ving  contributed 4  percentage  oint,  n average, o  real rowth  over  the ha 3/ p o t g first  alf f  1997. Declining eal et  exports re  expected  to  remain  a drag  on h o r n a domestic  production  ver  the  forecast  eriod. o p

The unemployment rate s  projected  o  fall  nly  a couple  of  tenths  urther  ver i t o f o the  next  few quarters  nd  then, s  GDP  decelerates   1998,  it evels  ut  at  just  ver a a in l o o 4-1/2 ercent.  In  this  xtremely ight  abor arket, e expect  that mployers  are p e t l m w e going  to  have  to oost ompensation ncreases  o  attract d retain  he orkers  they b c i t an t w need. Productivity  rowth  appears o  have  picked p in  the ast ear, ut  we continue g t u p y b to  think hat his  mprovement  is ainly  a  short-run  eflection    the  acceleration t t i m r of in output  and thus  are  projecting ly  moderate  increases  n  output er  hour  through ext on i p n year.

estimate  or  spending  growth  over  the  first lf.  e  have  been  influenced  ainly  by f ha W m the  recent  rends n  the  fundamentals: ob  increases  emain  sizable, al ages are t i J r re w rising, nsumer sentiment  s  buoyant, nd the  record-setting  ock arket  has  pushed co i a st m the  household  sector  ealth-to-income  atio  harply  igher,  roviding  dditional w r s h p a wherewithal or ousehold  purchases. f h

We  still pect  spending  growth  to  fall  o  2-1/2 ercent n  1998 as  the ex t p i projected  oderation f  job  gains lows  the  growth  in  real isposable  ncome. And m o s d i although agged  responses  o  this  ear's  un-up  in  share rices  re  likely  o e  a plus l t y r p a t b for  consumer  demand well  into he  year, he  stock arket  decline  e are  projecting t t m w may begin  cutting  nto pending y year-end--via  e  direct  ffect  n household ealth i s b th e o w and  through  contribution    some decline n  sentiment. n  addition, though enders a to i I al l seem to  be  getting    handle  on the roblem  of redit  ard  delinquencies,  arge-offs a p c c ch on various ypes  of  credit  o ouseholds re  likely  o  be  high  enough to  induce  banks t t h a t and other ntermediaries    tighten  p  further  n  their  ending o  relatively  sky i to u o l t ri borrowers.

We  continue o  expect  outlays or urables o  be  the  strongest  omponent of t f d t c spending.  Declining  elative ices  nd the  availability  innovative  roducts ill r pr a of p w continue o  lift  emand for ome electronic uipment.  However, sales f  light  otor t d h eq o m vehicles  re  likely  o emain  near  their  ecent evel f  around  15 million  nits er  year a t r r l o u p through  mid-1998  and edge  down thereafter.   addition, r  forecast  f  some In ou o softening  in  housing  construction  ould estrain e  growth  in  demand for ousehold sh r th h goods.

Residential  nvestment. i Cutting hrough he  ups  and downs in  the  data, t t housing  activity s  been  essentially  at ver  the  past ew quarters, d we see  little ha fl o f an reason  to  expect  much  change  over  the est f  1997.  Income and  employment r o conditions  re  likely  o  remain  supportive; useholds'  erceptions  f omebuying a t ho p o h conditions  re  extremely avorable;  nd the  recent eclines  n  mortgage  rates  ave a f a d i h increased  ash-flow ffordability.    still pect he  demand for  single-family  uses c a We ex t ho to  decline    bit ver he ourse f  1998 as  income  growth  slows  and mortgage  rates a o t c o turn p. Consequently,  tarts  f  these nits re  projected  o  average  1.12  million  nits u s o u a t u in  the  second  half f  1997,  similar  o he  average ince he ourth uarter f  1996,  and o t t s t f q o then  to  drop  about  5  percent ext ear. n y

We  also xpect  multifamily  tarts   edge  down next  year. he projected  ise  n e s to T r i interest tes nd  the  slowing  of  the  economy are  key  factors. n  addition, cancy ra a I va rates  emain  high  on a  national  asis,  hereby imiting  he  opportunities  r rofitable r b t l t fo p construction--and  rhaps  prompting  lenders  o  be a  bit ore cautious  n  providing pe t m i

Business  fixed  investment. Business  fixed nvestment hould  remain  strong n i s i the  near  term. Orders  are  still   a  marked uptrend,  nd reports  rom some companies on a f suggest hat he  plunge  in  computer  prices  s ikely  o  intensify. vestment pending t t i l t In s continues  o  be  boosted  as  well  by positive  ales  xpectations   many industries, t s e in healthy ash  flow,  and a  perceived pportunity,   ot  a  necessity,   install w c o ifn to ne technology n  order o  remain  competitive.  s the  economy slows  later  his  ear  and i t A t y in  1998,  these acro influences ll ikely  ecome  somewhat less onducive  to  growth m wi l b c of  investment. onetheless,  ains  in  real FI are  expected o  continue utpacing N g B t o overall  rowth  of  the  economy by a substantial  rgin: We  are  projecting at   rise g ma th a of  10-1/2  percent  his  ear  will e  followed y an increase  f  about  6-1/2 ercent  n t y b b o p i 1998.

We  expect  equipment  spending o  decelerate  oticeably  ver  the  next  several t n o quarters.  rowth of  computer  outlays s  expected o  remain  around G i t 25 percent o  30 t percent  per  year  over  the  next ouple  of uarters  efore apering  ff omewhat in c q b t o s 1998.  We  expect pending  for  communications  equipment  also o  remain  brisk  n s t i light  f  the ntense  ressures  o  add capacity  o  accommodate the  growth  of o i p t t networking,  he  rapid ace  of echnological vance, specially   wireless t p t ad e in communications, nd regulatory  hanges.

But our  projected  eveling  ff f t i r t l o o corporate  arnings--which  ould come as  a disappointment  o  financial rkets--could e w t ma disproportionately  se  osts f  external  inance or igher-risk  terprises,  ich rai c o f f h en wh have recently  een  enjoying iberal cess o  funds  at  increasingly  in preads nd b l ac t th s a with  looser ovenants. c

International Developments

Recent  Developments

The weighted-average  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  in  terms  of the  other  G-10 currencies  is  little  changed  on  balance  since  the  day  before  the  May  FOMC  meeting. The  dollar appreciated  around  3/4  percent  against  the mark  and  other  major  continental European  currencies  and  somewhat  more  against  the  Canadian  dollar, but  it depreciated  about  2  percent  against  the  yen  and  the  pound.

Continental  European  currencies  weakened  as  the chances  of Italy,  Spain,  and Portugal joining EMU  at its  outset  increased. The  victorious  French  Socialist  Party had  been  on  record  as  favoring  both  broad EMU  membership  and  greater flexibility  in achieving  Maastricht  fiscal  standards.' The  flawed  and  failed  attempt  to  revalue  the Bundesbank's gold  and  foreign  exchange  holdings  to  help  meet  the  Maastricht  fiscal standards  in  1997  also  called into  question  Germany's commitment  to  their  strict interpretation. The  yen  strengthened  on  concerns  about  the  rising  Japanese  external surpluses  and  Japan-U.S.  trade relations. The pound rose  late  in  the  period  in anticipation  of another  tightening  by the  Bank  of England  after  that  on  June  6.

Short-term  interest  rates  in  most  of the  foreign  G-7  countries  were little changed  over  the  intermeeting  period,  except  in  the  United  Kingdom  where  they  rose nearly  40 basis  points. Long-term  rates  fell  about  30 basis  points  in  Italy  as  prospects for  EMU  membership  increased  and  inflation  in  Italy  declined  further. Canadian  longterm rates  fell  nearly  40  basis  points  on  news  of the  reappointment  of the  fiscally conservative  Finance  Minister  Paul Martin  after  Canada's Liberal  Party  retained  a narrow  majority  in  the  recent  federal  election. Long-term  rates  elsewhere  were  little changed  on  balance.

The Desk did  not intervene.

Recent  data  support  our  view that  economic  activity  in  the  major foreign industrial  countries  has  strengthened,  on  balance,  during  the  first  half  of  1997. In Germany,  GDP  grew  moderately  in  the  first quarter,  and manufacturing  orders  surged in  April. French  GDP  was  sluggish  in  the  first quarter  and  Italian GDP  declined,  but both  countries  showed  strong  increases  in  industrial  production  in  April. U.K.  GDP grew  at  nearly  a  4  percent  annual  rate  in  the  first  quarter,  and  industrial  production jumped  in  April. Japanese  GDP rose  at a stronger-than-expected 6-1/2 percent  annual
