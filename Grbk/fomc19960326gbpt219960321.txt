RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Despite storms, strikes, shutdowns--and inventory imbalances-the economic expansion evidently survived the winter. Employment and industrial production surged in  February to  levels that suggest that real GDP  will post a  decent gain in  the  first quarter after almost stalling out in  the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, inflation has remained on a  fairly steady trend, with the core CPI continuing to run in  the vicinity of  3  percent on a  twelve-month basis.

The General Motors Strike

The UAW  has  announced an  end to the strike at Delphi Chassis Systems, which produces brake systems for  General Motors. The strike, which began on March 5,  forced GM  to shut down virtually all of  its North American assembly plants and severely curtail parts production. Outsourcing of  parts production was the  main issue in dispute. In  total, GM  had  furloughed about 175,000 North American workers: layoffs at  GM's suppliers were also beginning to  mount but are difficult to estimate.1 The union will vote on  the agreement on  March 23.

Confidential information from GM  indicates that the strike reduced production about 2  million units at  an  annual rate. The staff forecast assumed that assembly line workers would be  back on the job on  March 25 and that production for the industry as a  whole would total 9.7 million units in  March, more than 2 million units below the industry's pre-strike schedules. (As  the Greenbook was

In  contrast to Chrysler and Ford, GM  had fairly high inventories at the end of  February--its dealers had a  seventy-sevenday supply of  cars and a  sixty-eight-day supply of  trucks, measured using a  three-month average of sales. Thus, the strike is  not likely to  have much effect on  sales in  March. Rather, it allowed GM to accelerate an  inventory adjustment that probably would have occurred in  the second quarter in  the absence of the strike.

We estimate that the strike will subtract about a percentage point from the growth in  industrial production in  March. We also expect it to reduce real GDP growth about 3/4 percentage point at  an  annual rate in  the first quarter.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market report for February was very strong: Payroll employment and aggregate hours soared, reaching levels substantially above those recorded in  December, and the  unemployment rate fell back to around its year-end level. However, it seems likely that the December-February movements overstate the underlying strength of  labor demand. The resurgence in  hiring by  suppliers of

temporary help and by  firms in  some other categories may be  driven in part by  efforts to make up  January's production losses, particularly in  manufacturing. Furthermore, the BLS cites seasonal influences as contributing to the big gains in  construction and retail trade jobs early this year. 2 Finally, although initial claims have been trending lower of  late (abstracting from  the GM strike), they still do not display the exceptional robustness indicated by  the February employment report.

In contrast to  the gains in  most other sectors, manufacturing employment dropped 50,000 between December and February, in line with the average rate at which jobs have been shed since the most recent peak in factory employment in  March 1995. The average factory workweek, which also weakened last year and  was further depressed by  the blizzard in  January, rebounded sharply in February to the highest level since last September. The lengthening of  the workweek likely reflected in  part firms' efforts to recoup the production lost during the blizzard, but it  may also be  a precursor of  strengthening activity in  manufacturing. All  told, aggregate hours of  manufacturing production workers were 3/4 percent higher in  February than in  December.

In the nonfarm business sector as a  whole, a  February rise in  the average workweek of  production or  nonsupervisory workers more than reversed a  steep January decline. This swing in  the workweek, together with the monthly changes in  payroll employment, led aggregate hours to decline 2.0 percent in  January and rise 3.2 percent in  February. Although the average level of aggregate

hours for the two months was 0.7 percent below the fourth-quarter average, the actual labor input probably was greater than these data indicate because the January survey period included the week most affected by  the  blizzard. Making plausible adjustments to correct for the blizzard, we estimate that the average level of  hours in January and February would have been up roughly 1/2 percent from the fourth quarter. Such a  gain normally would indicate moderate growth in real GDP.

A  similar message comes from application of  the Okun's law model to the results of  the household survey. After ticking up in January to 5.8 percent, the civilian unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point in  February, to  5.5 percent. Using concurrent seasonal factors and taking into account the slight overstatement of the January unemployment rate because of  the blizzard, we  estimate that the  unemployment rate in  January and February was unchanged from its December level of 5.6 percent; this points to a  gain in aggregate output roughly in  line with long-run potential growth, which we  put at about 2 percent per year.

Among other indicators of labor market activity, initial claims have improved a  bit recently. Although claims under state programs jumped to  384,000 in  the week ending on  March 16, the increase probably was attributable to  the strike at General Motors. In  the three preceding weeks, claims had averaged 358,000 versus 374,000 between January and mid-February. Additionally, the Conference Board's index of  help wanted held nearly steady in January after rising 6 points in  December. On  the other hand, the Manpower Employment Outlook Survey shows that expectations of  net hiring (for the second quarter) have fallen to their lowest level in two years.

Industrial Production

Industrial production is estimated to  have risen 1.2 percent in  February after a  0.4 percent decline in  January that was related in  part to the blizzard. Roughly one-third of  the 0.8 percent net rise in  output from December to  February reflected an  upturn in  aircraft production after the settlement of  the strike at  Boeing. In  addition, output of office and computing machines continued to soar. And, in  February, a  surge in  semiconductor production boosted the index for durable goods materials, and production of other business equipment picked up. Motor vehicles assemblies rose 3/4  million units to  an 11.9 million unit annual rate in  February, thus making a  substantial contribution to  IP growth that month, but this increase only reversed a  decline in January, and motor vehicles had little net effect on overall output growth over the two months. Output of  non-auto consumer goods dropped sharply in  January, likely in response to the effects of  the blizzard and firms' efforts to reduce inventories, and a  February rebound carried production of  these goods only back to  about its December level. Output of construction supplies also showed little net change over the two months.

<!-- missing-text -->

Information on  industrial activity in  March is limited, but production will, of  course, be  depressed substantially by  the strike at GM,  which we expect to subtract about 1  percentage point from IP growth. Outside of  motor vehicles and parts, the available information thus far suggests little change in  output this month.

On  net, manufacturing output has grown about in  line with estimated capacity over the  past few  months, leaving the utilization 3 rate at  around 82 percent in February. The overall factory utilization rate now  stands about 1/2 percentage point above its 1967-95 average, buoyed by  sustained high readings for industrial machinery and computer equipment, primary metals, and petroleum products. In  contrast, operating rates for nondurables, notably textiles, apparel, and paper, have fallen sharply over the past year, a  drop reflecting producers' efforts to adjust production to softer sales; operating rates for these nondurables now  are  well below their long-term averages.

Personal Income and Consumption

Consumer spending appears to  have returned to  a  moderate growth path after hitting a  lull in late 1995. Although readings on consumer sentiment from both the Michigan SRC and the  Conference Board surveys sagged in  early 1996, the  most recent results in  both surveys have been quite positive. In  addition, data on  motor vehicles and retail sales suggest that real outlays for goods in February were noticeably above their fourth-quarter levels.

Sales of  new light vehicles averaged 15 million units at  an annual rate in December and January and climbed to  a  hefty 15-3/4 million unit rate in  February. The recent strength has been

concentrated in  the retail segment of  the market--confidential data from Ford and GM  indicate that their combined fleet sales have fallen below the fourth-quarter pace. Retail light vehicle purchases in  the past few  months have been bolstered by  incentives from Ford and Chrysler, which were introduced around the turn of  the year. The incentives also contributed to the  more favorable readings of the  Michigan index of car buying conditions in  February and early March.

Spending at the "control" category of  retail stores, which excludes automotive dealers and building materials and supply outlets, increased 0.4 percent in  February after a  flat January. Most major categories of retail sales turned upward in  February. Nominal spending at furniture and appliance and "other" durable goods stores rose a  little, although it remained noticeably below its level at the end of  last year. Sales at apparel stores posted a sizable gain in  February after a  languid performance in  1995, and outlays at general merchandise stores surged after declining in the fourth quarter and edging up in  January.

Official estimates of spending for services are available only through January, but outlays apparently remain on  the moderate uptrend that has been evident over the past few  years. Real spending on non-energy services, which had posted solid gains in November and December, edged up in  January to a  level roughly 1/2 percent (not  at  an  annual rate) above its fourth-quarter average. In contrast, energy services declined in January, and data on  weather for the nation as a whole suggest that spending on  energy services may  have declined a  bit further in  February; however, these declines were not large enough to put  much of  a  dent in overall PCE.

Taking a  longer view, consumer spending has fallen short of the gain in  real disposable income over the past few quarters, and the

personal saving rate has moved up--despite the large increase in household wealth since the end of 1994. This upturn may prove just to  be short-term noise in  the time series; it could even disappear in  later NIPA revisions. But there are possible explanations for this seemingly anomalous pattern. First, it is important to  note that econometric models that capture significant stock market wealth effects also suggest that the effects may take some time to play out; the effect on the saving rate of the recent rally would be small to  this point, perhaps on  the order of  1/4 percentage point (ceteris paribus). Second, other factors could be  masking the stock market effect. For example, increased debt burdens may  be  hindering spending--the ratio of  debt service payments to disposable income in the fourth quarter was 3/4 percentage point higher than its level one year earlier. Moreover, consumer delinquency rates have generally risen over the past year, suggesting that some households are having greater difficulty servicing their increased debt burdens. However, as long as income growth remains sound, these financial stresses are probably not  widespread enough to  be  a significant deterrent to overall consumption.

The recent increases in the saving rate also could be part of  a longer-run upward adjustment in response to demographic changes and heightened awareness of  the need to provide for retirement and medical costs. In addition, the media focus on  job insecurity may have contributed to a  greater perceived need for precautionary saving.

Housing Markets

New  housing construction edged up in  January--despite the blizzard--and rose still further in  February. Total housing starts last month, at 1.49 million units, were the highest since December 1994.

Single-family housing starts edged down in January and increased moderately in  February; starts for the two months averaged 1.16 million units at  an  annual rate, about 2-1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter average. Permit issuance for single-family homes also edged up in  February, after falling in  January. Judging from historical relationships, starts in  January and  February were  well in line with permit issuance.

Most other indicators of single-family housing activity have also shown signs of  strengthening. New  home sales rose 4.2 percent in January to 693,000 units, the most rapid pace since last August. Moreover, the  March sampling of  builders' opinions suggests that new home sales rose substantially in  late February and early March. Consumer appraisals of  homebuying conditions, as sampled by  the Michigan survey, improved noticeably in  February and early March, owing mainly to a more general perception that mortgage rates are low. Applications for home financing at  mortgage bankers remained relatively strong through mid-March, although they are down a bit from the very high range of late 1995.

In  contrast to the rise in  new  home sales, existing home sales declined for the fourth consecutive month in  January. This series tends to be  a  lagging indicator of  housing demand, however, because a  substantial share of  existing home sales are recorded at  the closing, often months after a  purchase contract has been signed. Thus, existing home sales may not reflect changes that are evident in  more timely measures of  demand for single-family housing.

In  the  multifamily housing sector, starts rose substantially in January and  moderately in  February, largely offsetting a  decline in December. A  step-up from the extremely low levels of  multifamily construction seen in  recent years is not surprising, but the vacancy

rate for multifamily rental units is still high--suggesting some limit on  the near-term potential for  further gains.

Business Fixed Investment

At the time of the last Greenbook, investment indicators were lagging to  an unusual degree because of the government shutdown. The data releases, though back on schedule, are still not  as current as one would like. However, they now  suggest that equipment demand remained fairly robust into early 1996--indeed, surprisingly so-while construction spending decelerated somewhat.

New orders reported by  U.S. manufacturers of  business equipment were particularly strong in  the office and computing category, rising 3  percent in January after surging in  the fourth quarter. Shipments of  these items also continued to  post healthy gains. The sustained strength in computer spending seems at  odds with the pounding that computer company stocks have taken in recent weeks: Our industry contacts' explanation is that competitive pressures have reduced margins and profitability, with the corresponding price competition helping to  maintain demand.

Orders at  producers of  other nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts, were also quite positive through January, although shipments dropped back after rising moderately in the fourth quarter. Notably, much of  the January drop in shipments was in  two industries: communications equipment, for which shipments had soared in  late 1995, and railroad equipment, which tends to gyrate wildly from month to month.

As for transportation equipment, business purchases of  motor vehicles have been about flat so far this year despite the sharp decline in  new orders for heavy trucks in 1995. Shipments of complete aircraft have been weak in recent months, in part because of  the Boeing strike. However, the weakness in  aircraft should be

transitory: Airline profits are high, new  products are coming on line, and orders are surging. Boeing has announced plans to hire additional workers and expand production, and the prospective improvement in activity is affecting many of  its suppliers as  well.

A  glance at the chart showing the  fundamental determinants suggests the sources of  the continued expansion in  equipment spending. While accelerator effects have been about neutral over the past year, recent movements in the  user cost of  capital and in cash flow  have been favorable. The user cost of  computers has continued to plummet because of  falling prices, and this pattern is likely to  be  extended in  the near term with, among other things, a sharp drop in semiconductor prices contributing to  the trend.

Growth in  outlays for nonresidential construction appears to have slowed recently after three years of  progressively stronger increases. Although non-office commercial construction has continued to trend up, the data on  construction put-in-place suggest that activity has slowed noticeably in  recent months in  the office, institutional building, and industrial sectors. Contracts for these sectors have also been softening over the past several months. Other indicators are  more favorable: Senior examiners and asset managers at  federal banking agencies remain fairly upbeat in  their assessments of  commercial real estate conditions (as compiled in  the FDIC's January Survey of  Real Estate Trends); vacancy rates in  the commercial and industrial sectors are well below the levels of a  few years ago; and prices, as measured by  the NREI index, have continued to firm.

Inventories

Following only a modest increase in  November and outright liquidation of stocks in  December, business inventories expanded sharply in  January. Excluding motor vehicles at trade

establishments, book-value stocks in  manufacturing and trade increased at  an annual rate of  more than $50 billion in  January, after rising only about $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Interpretation of  the January data is complicated by  the winter storms, which caused delays in shipments and sales and thus may  have caused inventories to  back up  at manufacturers and  wholesalers. Retail stocks edged down, despite flat sales. In  any event, firms apparently made considerable progress in  rectifying inventory imbalances in  late 1995, and recent trends in  orders and production bode well for further improvement in  early 1996.

<!-- missing-text -->

Sizable increases in  manufacturing inventories in  January were evident in  both capital goods industries and elsewhere. Within capital goods, stocks of  information-related equipment have continued to rise briskly in recent months, while stocks of industrial machinery and "other" producers' durable equipment have shown little net increase since mid-1995. The inventory-shipments ratio for manufacturing capital goods moved up in  January, but the jump was largely due to  a  sharp drop in shipments, which the firmness of  orders suggests was transitory. The picture for inventories outside of  capital goods is less sanguine--for example,

<!-- missing-text -->

manufacturers' stocks of  home goods and apparel, as well as some materials, probably remain above desired levels--and the inventorysales ratio for this group as a whole has changed little, on  net, in recent months, after rising sharply over the first half of 1995.

In  wholesale trade, inventories also expanded substantially in January. In  addition, the wholesalers' December inventory change was revised up  to show a  small accumulation instead of the sharp drawdown indicated in  the preliminary report. As in  manufacturing, stocks of  capital goods have continued to rise at a  rapid pace in recent months, and the inventory-sales ratio has fluctuated in  a fairly narrow range. Elsewhere in  wholesale trade, changes in stocks have been small in  the aggregate in recent months, and although the inventory-sales ratio edged up  in  January, it  remained well below the  highs of last fall.

In  the retail sector, nonvehicle inventories fell a bit further in January, after plunging in  December. The January decrease may have been related in  part to the  blizzard disruptions and the backup of goods at earlier stages of  the distribution channel. Stores selling apparel and furniture recorded sizable net liquidations over the two months; as a  result, the inventory-sales ratio for apparel stores has fallen well below the levels that prevailed over much of 1995, while the ratio for furniture stores has also dropped somewhat. In  contrast, the inventory-sales ratio for general merchandisers remained at  the elevated level that has been evident since late fall: the strong gain in general merchandise sales in February should have helped restore stocks to  more comfortable levels.

12 percent in  the fourth quarter of 1995, with double-digit declines for both nondefense and defense purchases. The drop in  defense outlays was much sharper than the underlying trend as a  consequence of a plunge in  deliveries of  aircraft and other military equipment. Nondefense spending was depressed by  the reduction in real employee compensation during the  two government shutdowns and the restraint implied by  the appropriations and continuing resolutions for fiscal 1996.

In  the unified budget, receipts have grown at a  solid pace this fiscal year, and outlays have risen only a  little. Thus, the deficit for the first four months of  fiscal 1996 was just $37 billion, $21 billion below that recorded during the comparable period one  year earlier.

The Congress has made only slight progress on appropriations since the last Greenbook, and programs covered by the five unpassed appropriations bills are  being funded by  the latest in  a  string of continuing resolutions. In  the aggregate, the current funding levels for discretionary programs are  more generous than those in the continuing resolutions in place during the first few  months of fiscal 1996. Moreover, some agencies are now  in  a  position to  make certain large annual payments, normally disbursed in  the fall, that were delayed by  the difficulties in  the appropriations process; for example, the annual foreign aid payment to Israel, which totals about $3 billion, was not remitted in its entirety until February.

On  March 15 the President signed a  one-week extension of  the continuing resolution, and he  is expected to sign a  further

ADMINISTRATION BUDGET AND  ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS 1

<!-- missing-text -->

extension by  tomorrow, March 22. These extensions are designed to give the President and the Congress more time for negotiations on  an omnibus appropriations bill for the remainder of  the fiscal year. The bill is expected to set overall spending at  the levels specified in  the  budget resolution, with any  increases for particular programs offset by  reductions in  spending for other programs or increases in receipts. In  other recent legislation, the President signed a  bill providing for a  short-term increase in  the  debt ceiling, now set to expire on  March 29.

On  March 19 the Administration released its fiscal year 1997 budget. The President's policy proposals are similar to  those incorporated in  the preliminary budget document issued in February. However, in contrast to the budget projections in  the February document, the Administration's new  projections are based on a  full set of  updated economic and technical assumptions. According to OMB, if  the President's plan were enacted, the deficit would drop to $146 billion in  fiscal 1996 and edge down to $140 billion in fiscal 1997; the  budget position would improve steadily thereafter, showing a  sizable surplus by  fiscal 2002. Under CBO's December economic and technical assumptions (with  adjustments by  OMB), the budget would also show a  surplus in  fiscal 2002, but it  would be  much smaller than OMB's estimate. CBO  will revise its assumptions this spring; if  the President's budget shows a  deficit in  fiscal 2002 under the revised assumptions, the President will reduce his proposals for discretionary spending by  the amount needed to eliminate the deficit.

State and Local Government Sector

Total real consumption and gross investment spending by  state and local governments has remained on  the moderate uptrend that has been evident since 1992. The 1-1/2 percent annual rate increase in

State and  Local Sector Current Account  Surplus

<!-- missing-text -->

real spending in  the fourth quarter was a bit below trend, but much of  the slowing reflected developments in  the volatile construction category. A  noticeable upturn in  outlays seems to  be  under way in the current quarter, mainly because of  a  1.6 percent jump in real construction spending in  January. The increase in  construction in January was broadly based and followed average gains of  0.3 percent per month in  the second half of last year. Employment grew 15,000 per month, on average, in  January and February, about the same as the pace over 1995 as a whole.

The fiscal position of  the state and local sector remains sound in  the aggregate. The NIPA surplus of  current operating accounts, excluding social insurance funds, probably remained in  the area of $35 billion to $40 billion in  the fourth quarter, a  level similar to the readings for the past two years and considerably above those of the early 1990s. As fiscal positions have improved, many states have cut taxes, in  most cases by  small amounts. This year again, governors of  many states are proposing fairly limited tax  cuts. Prices

Although data collection problems related to the government shutdown and the January blizzard have created some uncertainty about the reliability of  the statistics, inflation appears to have remained relatively stable over the past few months. Notably, the core CPI increased an  average of  0.2 percent per month over the past three months, and  the twelve-month change has held steady at  around 3  percent. Prices have also remained in  check at the  producer level; on  net, the PPI for items other than food and energy was flat between December and February.

Consumer energy prices increased 0.4 percent in  February after having posted much larger increases in  December and  January. Most of  the rise in  February reflected a  surge in  natural gas prices as

the unusually cold winter depleted natural gas stocks in  many parts of the country. In  contrast, prices of  gasoline and heating oil were little changed in  February; these prices had soared around the turn of  the year as increases in  crude oil prices in late 1995 fed through the system. However, the lull in  prices of  petroleum-based products may  be  short-lived: Stocks of  both gasoline and crude oil remain low, and prices for crude oil surged in  mid-March.

Food prices edged up  just 0.1 percent in  February and have increased just a  little more than 2 percent over the past twelve months. Prices for fruits and vegetables dropped a  bit further in February, while prices of  meats, poultry, fish, and eggs were little changed for a  second month. In recent months, price increases in grain markets seem to  have shown through in  some components of  the CPI for food, notably cereal and bakery products and dairy products, but those increases have been offset by  favorable developments in other categories. Grain stocks at  the end of  the summer still are projected to  be  tight, and the  markets remain sensitive to changes in  conditions for the 1996 crop, as shown most recently by  market perceptions of  changing weather conditions in  the southern and central plains, a major wheat-producing area.

The CPI for commodities other than food and energy slipped 0.1 percent in  February after having risen 0.4 percent in  January. In  part, this pattern reflects the one-week delay in the January survey period because of  the government shutdown. The effect was especially pronounced for merchandise for  which the delayed survey missed the usual post-holiday markdowns. Notably, apparel prices fell 1 percent in  February after spurting 0.7 percent in  January.

Elsewhere, prices for new  cars and trucks rose moderately in February after having remained essentially unchanged over December and January. Prices of  vehicles have been held down in recent months by  price-based incentives introduced by  Ford and Chrysler in order to reduce bloated stocks; these incentive programs have also included generous financing options, which have contributed to  the sharp drop in the auto-finance component of  the CPI for services in recent months.

The CPI for non-energy services rose 0.3 percent in  February, a rise identical to that in  January and similar to the trend for the past two  years. The February increase was fueled by  a  turnaround in airfares, which had fallen sharply over the preceding several months. On  the other hand, the increase for shelter costs (which account for about half  of  non-energy services) was a  bit below trend, and the CPI for  medical services rose a  relatively modest 0.2 percent. Taking a  longer perspective, the twelve-month change in  the CPI for medical services has dropped to around 4  percent after having increased about 5-1/2 percent per  year over the 6 previous two years.

At  the producer level, prices for finished goods excluding food and energy rose 0.1 percent in  February after falling a  bit in January; these prices have risen about 2  percent in  the past twelve months. Prices for intermediate materials excluding food and energy

Prices of  industrial commodities have eased a  bit since the last Greenbook. The Journal of  Commerce index of industrial commodity prices has changed little on  net since late January, with a  sharp decline in its textile component mostly offset by  a  run-up in  the petroleum index. The JOC metals index has risen about 1-1/2 percent since the last Greenbook. Copper prices, volatile in recent weeks, were pushed down earlier this year by  weaker economic activity and, to some extent, by  weak export demand, but they appear to have recovered and now stand about 3-1/2 percent above their level in  late January. Prices for aluminum, also volatile recently, are about 4  percent higher than at  the time of  the last Greenbook. Lead prices soared 7-1/2 percent this week, as supplies became very tight in  U.S. markets. In  contrast, steel scrap prices have fallen about 4  percent since the last Greenbook, but  they remain at about the average level for 1995.

Labor Costs

As  measured by  the employment cost index (ECI), the  hourly compensation of  private industry workers increased at  an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent over the three months ended in  December 1995, up from a  2-1/2 percent annual rate over the first nine months of  the year. The uptick in  compensation growth was  widespread across industrial and occupational groups and largely reflected an acceleration in  payments for  health insurance benefits. Wages and salaries increased 2-1/2 percent at  a  seasonally adjusted annual rate in  the fourth quarter, a  bit less than over the first nine months of  the year, and costs of  most nonhealth benefits--such as

paid leave, retirement and savings, and legally required benefits-also continued to increase in  line with their recent trends. 7 Over 1995 as a  whole, the ECI rose only 2-3/4 percent, the smallest increase since the series began in 1981.

Despite the step-up in  the cost of  health insurance in  the fourth quarter, the decelerating trend in these benefits remained intact through 1995. Over the  year as a  whole, health costs rose only 1/2 percent, compared with an increase of 4  percent in 1994 and a  high of  about 14 percent in  the late 1980s. In  addition to the slowing in  medical care costs, the switch in  insurance arrangements from  traditional indemnity plans to  HMOs and other managed care plans and changes in  the provisions of  the health plans (including greater sharing of  health care costs with employees) may also have contributed to  the slowdown in employer-paid health benefits. 8 Analysts remain uncertain about how  much of  the slowing is sustainable and  how much is a  one-time saving associated mainly with the shift from traditional insurance plans to lower-cost alternatives. On  one hand, the recent CPI and PPI data suggest that the trends in  underlying medical costs remain favorable; these should affect insurance premiums with a  lag. On  the other hand, some experts, who note that insurance premiums have decelerated more over the past few years than have underlying medical costs, see some catch-up in  the offing.

Compensation per Hour

(Change  from comparable  period  one year  earlier)

<!-- missing-text -->

Nonfarm hourly compensation, from the productivity and cost data, rose 3  percent at  a  seasonally adjusted annual rate in  the fourth quarter; for all of 1995, nonfarm hourly compensation increased about 4  percent, after rising 2-1/2 percent in 1994. Because this pattern differs so  dramatically from that in the  ECI, it is useful to  note that although the two compensation measures show fairly similar long-run patterns, they often diverge substantially over shorter periods--especially in  recent years, when the NIPA compensation data have not yet been benchmarked to comprehensive source data. Much of  the discrepancy arises simply because the data are collected from different sources. In addition, because nonfarm hourly compensation does not use fixed weights as does the ECI, it can be  affected by  changes in  the composition of employment. 9 Also, the  ECI explicitly incorporates current information on  benefit costs, whereas the hourly compensation measure tends to extrapolate recent trends in  benefits.

Productivity in  the nonfarm business sector apparently fell in the fourth quarter as  output decelerated sharply. 1 0 The decline followed strong gains over the preceding two quarters; nonetheless, over 1995 as a whole, productivity growth fell short of its longterm trend, which we  estimate at about 1  percent per year.

establishments edged down in  February after jumping 0.4 percent in January. For the twelve-month period ended in  February, average hourly earnings grew 2.9 percent--in the middle of the range observed since late 1994.

Recession Probabilities

The recession probability measures based on  the indexes of leading economic indicators continue to diverge. According to  a measure based on the Conference Board's index of leading economic indicators (LEI). the  probability of a  recession starting within six months was 60 percent in  January, after readings in  the range of 30 percent to  50 percent since the spring of 1995. These relatively high probabilities reflect the sizable decline in sensitive materials prices, which make up about 40 percent of the index, since mid-1995. It  is difficult to interpret the declines in sensitive materials prices because they have been largely concentrated in wastepaper, where prices have reversed the huge run-up between mid-1994 and  mid-1995. The probability of recession from a  version of the LEI that excludes materials prices was just 16 percent in January. The recession probability was also boosted substantially in January by  the decline in the manufacturing workweek (which  was more than reversed in  February).

The January reading of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) measure, which places a  heavier weight on financial variables, puts the probability of recession at  only 1 percent. An alternative version of  the NBER index that excludes interest rates and interest rate spreads puts the probability of recession at 13 percent. The NBER indexes do not include the manufacturing workweek, but they do  include part-time employment due to slack work; this variable declined in  January, possibly because of the blizzard, making a  positive contribution to the indexes.

Selected Interest Rates

Short-Term

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

1996

Intermediateand long-term interest rates have backed up about 55 to 65 basis points since the beginning of  February, primarily on stronger economic data. Short-term interest rates fluctuated during the period, but now  stand near their levels at the January FOMC meeting. Short-term interest rates initially had edged down about 1/4 percentage point following the System policy change at the January meeting and, judging from federal funds futures data in early February, market participants appeared to place high odds on a further 25 basis point cut in  the funds rate at the  March FOMC meeting with additional easing by  early summer (chart). However, Chairman Greenspan's testimony before the Congress regarding the FOMC's forecasts of  moderate economic growth along with the subsequent release of stunningly strong employment data in early March were seen as  largely erasing any possibility of  near-term System easing and as raising questions about the direction of monetary policy down the road. Moreover, election-year rhetoric suggested that agreement on  a major deficit-reduction plan was an even more remote probability. Despite the rise in  interest rates, major stock-price indexes advanced between 3  and 5-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.

The growth of aggregate nonfederal debt has not deviated appreciably from  the moderate pace of  the past two years. Although some recent signs point to a  slowing in  household borrowing, consumer credit has continued to climb relative to  disposable income. Corporate bond issuance has slackened with the backup in rates; overall business borrowing this quarter will be  buoyed, however, by  the completion of  large merger transactions. New issuance of  state and local government securities also dipped with

the rise in  yields in  late February; on  balance, tax-exempt debt has continued to contract with heavy retirements of  pre-refunded debt.

The federal government's borrowing has picked up after the disruptions of  the fourth quarter. The Treasury's plans have been complicated to a  small degree by  the continuing dispute over the debt ceiling, but regular monthly twoand five-year note auctions proceeded on schedule.

Equity Price Developments

Although share prices posted strong gains over the intermeeting period, broad measures of  stock prices declined sharply on Friday, March 8,  after the release of  unexpectedly strong employment data for February. At one point that day, the Dow  Jones Industrial average had declined 215 points--approaching the 250 point trigger that would have suspended trading on  the NYSE for one hour. However, prices recovered, finishing down 171 points, and most broad indexes have since recouped that day's decline; indeed, some, including the DJI, have proceeded to register new  highs (chart). At the same time, the  markets have been quite volatile (chart).

The run-up in stock prices this year seems hard to reconcile with higher interest rates and  with reports that securities analysts have, if  anything, lowered their earnings forecasts for 1996. Based on some benchmarks for equity valuation, stock prices appear somewhat overvalued. For example, the expected earnings yield for the S&amp;P 500--the ratio of  security analysts' expectations for yearahead earnings to current price--moved roughly in  parallel with long-term bond yields during 1994 and 1995, but has fallen appreciably this year to a  rather low  level (chart, middle panel). This decline, viewed against the recent backup in  long-term yields, implies a  considerable decline of  the so-called equity premium, which some have asserted was already unsustainably narrow.

Nonetheless, at least one indicator suggests that confidence in the prospects for a  continuation of  the bull market has not been weakening. On  certain assumptions, the ratio of  prices on out-ofthe-money put and call options on stock price indexes can help to gauge the market's assessment of  risks associated with prevailing stock prices. A  put-to-call price ratio greater than 1, for example, can be interpreted as implying a  greater likelihood of a downward movement in  stock prices. For futures contracts on  the S&amp;P 500 stock index, the put-call ratio has fallen considerably on balance since the end of 1994, suggesting that investors have become less concerned about the prospects for a  significant drop in stock prices. Indeed, the historical record of sharp sizable stock price declines over the past forty years--declines on  the order of 10 percent or  more over a  two-month period--reveals little precedent for such  market breaks in  the absence of  a  significant Federal Reserve tightening or  a  jump in oil prices. The only instance in which stock prices fell in  the absence of  at least one of  these factors was in 1962, when the Kennedy administration pressured the major steel producers to roll back large price increases, setting off fears that the administration would pursue anti-business policies.

Mutual Funds

Stock mutual funds continued to experience sizable inflows through early March, although the recent volatility in  the  market may  have diminished somewhat the enthusiasm for equity investment. Preliminary weekly data suggest that stock fund inflows, though still positive, moderated during the week ended March 13--the week including the sharp one-day market decline. Inflows to  bond funds, which had trended down over February and early March, turned negative that week.

Various industry reports suggest that mutual fund investors generally have long investment horizons. For their part, mutual fund managers have been holding relatively small cash and short-term securities positions, suggesting that they do  not perceive themselves to  be particularly vulnerable to a  surge in redemptions (chart).l Indeed, in  the weeks following the October 1987 stock market break, investors redeemed less than 4  percent of  their stock fund holdings, and  net outflows have been far smaller during other periods of  falling prices.

Money and Depository Credit

The strength in  mutual fund inflows early this year does not appear to  have come at the expense of  the broad monetary aggregates. Spurred by  the policy easings at the December and January FOMC meetings, M2  and M3 growth picked up over the first two months of the year. Moreover, preliminary data for March suggest a considerable further acceleration of  M2 and continued robust growth in  M3, placing them both further above the upper bounds of  their respective annual ranges. Much of  the recent advance of  the broad aggregates has been fueled by growth in retail and institution-only money funds. Money fund yields lag changes in  short-term market interest rates, thus making them  particularly attractive investments in  the wake of  System policy easings.

In  contrast to  the broad aggregates, M1 continued to contract over the first two months of  the year, with the impact of  new retail OCD "sweep" accounts far outweighing the impetus from narrowing opportunity costs. More than $25 billion of  OCD balances have been swept just this year. Partial data suggest positive M1 growth in

The growth of  bank credit slowed to a  tepid 3-1/2 percent rate in  February (table) with a  deceleration in loans more than offsetting an  uptick in  securities. All  major categories of bank lending weakened in  February, and preliminary data point toward continued sluggish growth in  March. Bank securities portfolios expanded considerably in  February, with much of  the increase concentrated at  branches and agencies of  foreign banks.

To an  extent, the  weakening in  consumer lending in  February probably reflected a  rapid pace of  securitizations. Even adjusting for securitizations, however, bank consumer loans expanded at a  pace well below that over much of last year. Although delinquency and chargeoff rates for consumer loans have turned up in recent months, the January Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated only a slight tightening in  lending standards for consumer loans.

Business loans expanded at a  6  percent pace in  February--down considerably from the previous month, but about in line with the average growth over the final months of last year. The deceleration in  business loans has likely reflected moderation in  demand, as banks reportedly remain willing lenders and have been pricing loans attractively. Indeed, the February Survey of  Terms of  Bank  Lending shows a  narrowing of  spreads over the federal funds rate on loans larger than $100,000. The average spread on  business loans has now fallen to levels not seen since the mid-1980s (chart). Call Report data for the fourth quarter of 1995 indicate that delinquency and charge-off rates for C&amp;I loans are at  or  near their lows for the series (chart).

Growth of real estate loans dropped off in February, perhaps slowed by  securitizations of  fixed rate mortgages originated in recent months. Delinquency and charge-off rates on  bank real estate loans fell to record lows. The decline in  the overall delinquency rate of  bank real estate loans was largely associated with improvements in  commercial mortgage loan performance. In contrast, delinquency rates on single-family residential loans at  banks edged up over 1995.

With most measures of  loan performance quite favorable, banks remained highly profitable in  the fourth quarter, pushing their return on assets for the year to a  level just short of  the record set in  1993 (chart). Low  provisioning for loan losses, cuts in deposit insurance premiums, and strong fee income helped buoy bank profits last year. Given the ongoing cost cutting and consolidation efforts in the industry, market participants appear to be looking for another strong earnings year for banks in 1996. Overall, bank stock prices have climbed substantially this year, generally outpacing broad market averages.

Preliminary Call Report data for the fourth quarter indicate savings associations expanded assets, albeit slightly, last year for the  first time since 1988 while their return on assets was essentially unchanged from the previous year. Clouding the outlook somewhat for thrifts is the gap in  deposit insurance premiums between BIFand SAIF-insured institutions, which industry representatives say is impairing their competitive position and encouraging them to pursue nondeposit funding more aggressively. 2 Both the  FDIC and the Treasury have expressed concern that if legislation to restructure SAIF is not enacted soon, large declines

in the SAIF deposit base might ensue--leaving SAIF insurance premiums insufficient to cover the interest on  Financing Corporation (FICO) bonds.

Business Finance

Public bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations remained strong through mid-February as  many firms took advantage of  low rates to lock in favorable long-term funding and  pay down higher cost debt. However, the backup in long-term rates since midFebruary has greatly depressed bond offerings. At the same time, nonfinancial commercial paper has increased quite a  bit in recent weeks, fueled primarily by  merger financing.

Gross equity issuance by  nonfinancial firms picked up in February and remained substantial through mid-March. Data on registrations point to a  continued hefty pace of  issuance in  the near term. Initial public offerings have accounted for nearly onehalf of  total nonfinancial equity issuance since the fourth quarter of last year--an unusually high share--as many rapidly growing companies have taken advantage of  the funding opportunities provided by  the ebullient stock market.

Even with the pickup in  total gross issuance, net issuance has remained negative because of  the continuing wave of equity retirements. In addition to  merger activity, share repurchase programs have been a  significant factor driving retirements of equity shares. Firms undertaking repurchase programs have generally been quite profitable, and they generate cash flow  well in excess of that needed to fund current capital expenditures and dividends (chart). Many firms that have implemented repurchase programs have also deployed excess funds to pare debt outstanding, leaving their leverage ratios little changed on  balance (chart).

Overall, nonfinancial business credit quality this year appears to have slipped just a bit. The volume of  credit rating downgrades has exceeded upgrades by  a  small margin, and Moody's Watchlist of potential actions includes many  more new potential downgrades than upgrades (chart). Utilities, facing changes in  regulation and new competition, and retailers, facing market saturation, have accounted for all of  the volume of  downgraded debt and for nearly two-thirds of  the debt under review for a  downgrade. In addition, ratings actions this year have reflected the agencies' growing concern with the debt service obligations implicit in  some recent merger transactions. Still, signs of  deteriorating credit quality in  the nonfinancial business sector have not produced any notable market reaction. Spreads of  investment-grade bond yields over Treasuries have changed little since year-end, while spreads in the junk bond market, where defaults have been running below last year's pace, have narrowed.

Treasury Finance

Secretary Rubin's decision to disinvest several government trust funds for  up to  $19.9 billion, along with congressional approval a  $29 billion increase in  the debt ceiling until March 15, allowed the Treasury to  hold normal coupon auctions in  January and February and to cover social security payments in  early March. A further temporary increase in  the debt ceiling enacted earlier this month allowed the Treasury to continue borrowing until March 29. Longer-term solutions to  the debt ceiling problem are currently being considered by  the Congress; one proposal recently approved by both houses contains a  longer-lasting debt limit extension tied to provisions for a  line item veto.

State and Local Government Finance

The general pattern of  tax-exempt borrowing has paralleled that in  the nonfinancial business sector. Until mid-February, state and local governments had been issuing substantial gross volumes of long-term debt targeted, in  part, to  refund existing higher cost debt. With the backup in  long-term interest rates, refunding volumes have diminished substantially. On  net, debt continues to contract as heavy retirements outpace new  issues.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Includes issues for public and private purposes.

Yields on  municipal bonds rose less than those on  comparable Treasuries between year-end and late February, apparently reflecting fading concerns over prospective "flat tax" reforms that might affect the value of  the tax-exemption for interest on  municipal bonds. In recent weeks, the ratio of  tax-exempt to  Treasury yields on longer-term securities has backed up, possibly in  response to  the growing backlog of  issues that have been postponed since rates climbed (chart).

In  the fourth quarter, Standard and Poor's upgraded about $8 billion of  debt and downgraded about $4  billion (chart), but for the year as a  whole, the dollar volume of  downgrades exceeded upgrades by a  sizable margin. These rating actions reflected problems for a few large cities and counties and  the utility sector, but have not affected the bulk of  state and local issuers. Quality spreads on long-term municipal debt have remained rather narrow since the beginning of  1995.

Mortgage Markets

Data on  mortgage lending in the current quarter suggest that credit growth may  have slowed a  little. Consistent with the backup in  mortgage rates, the  Mortgage Bankers Association's index of  loan applications for home purchases in  the first quarter is running about 8  percent below the fourth quarter of last year (chart). The refinancing index also has declined sharply and is likely to show further weakness in  coming reports. Partial first-quarter data for securitized mortgage credit reveal a  continued climb in gross issuance of  mortgage-backed securities, evidently fueled by  the large share of  fixed rate mortgage originations in recent months (chart). Most new  issuance has been in  the form of  pass-through securities, but the CMO  market--which had been moribund until very recently--has shown some stirrings with an appreciable pickup in issuance this year.

The  MBA's broadest measure of  home mortgage delinquency rates was about unchanged in  the fourth quarter at 4.25 percent. The average delinquency rate on  loans thirty days or  more past due rose 9  basis points, to 2.95 percent (chart). By  contrast, the average delinquency rate on  mortgages sixty days or  more past due was unchanged last quarter, while delinquency rates on  loans ninety days or more past due moved down 8  basis points.

Several trade reports indicate that mortgage credit quality problems have been concentrated in loans originated in recent years. For example, an analysis of 25 million to  30  million loans across thirty-five states by  Mortgage Research Group--a New  Jersey-based market research firm--indicates that mortgages originated in 1994 and 1995 are experiencing much higher rates of  foreclosure than more seasoned loans. Moreover, compared with loans originated in 1992 and 1993, default rates on  the newer mortgages have reached levels in only a  few  months after closing that typically are not observed until after a  few years of  seasoning. The upward trend in  default rates and foreclosures is evident in all regions of  the country, but the incidence is greatest in  the West, where real estate prices in many states have remained depressed.

To some extent, the poorer performance of recently originated loans is consistent with the reported easings of  lending standards by  mortgage bankers in recent years. Not surprisingly, for example, both lenders and mortgage insurers have begun to report that loans originated in  the past two years under special "affordable" home loan programs have performed especially poorly. 3

Consumer Credit

Consumer installment credit continued to  exhibit brisk growth in January, increasing at a  12 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate after an  upward-revised 11-1/2 percent gain in  December (table). Nevertheless, over the past few  months, the pace of consumer credit growth appears to have slowed a  notch from that reached in 1994 and early last year (chart). Slowing growth in February at commercial banks, which account for nearly half of  total

outstandings, suggests that the gradual deceleration may  have continued in  February as  well.

A  broad-based but  modest rise in  delinquency rates on consumer loans occurred in  the fourth quarter. Credit card delinquency rates--calculated from the Call Report data--rose each quarter in 1995, approaching 4  percent in  the fourth quarter from a  low of  3.3 percent in  the second half of 1994 (chart). Even at 4  percent, however, credit card delinquency rates were still well below the most recent peaks in 1991. The  American Bankers Association (ABA) reported a  small increase in  credit card delinquencies for the fourth quarter. After rising sharply in  the final quarter of 1994 and the  first quarter of 1995, this series rose only  marginally over the rest of  last year. The ABA recorded moderate increases in delinquencies on closed end loans throughout the  year; nevertheless, this series is still much closer to its lows than its highs of  the past twenty years.

Delinquencies on  auto loans at the captive finance companies are at historically levels, but may  be  leveling off after rising steadily for two years. (Readings on  delinquency rates in January and February are at about the same level as in  the fourth quarter of last year.) According to  a  credit manager at one company, the climb in  delinquency rates was an  expected side-effect of  efforts to sell cars by  liberalizing lending standards. Delinquency rates at captive finance companies have also been boosted a  bit by  the shift away from loans toward leasing in  recent years; performance data for leases are not included in  the loan delinquency rate and lease customers have tended to  be  better-than-average credit risks.

The  upturn in  consumer loan delinquency rates is consistent with the recent climb in  personal bankruptcies over the past few quarters (chart). This increase no doubt reflects in  part the rise

in  debt payment problems but also importantly an increased likelihood for individuals to declare bankruptcy as a  means of dealing with financial strains. Some changes in  federal bankruptcy law  effective last year--principally an increase in  the  dollar amount of  assets that can  be exempted from liquidation--likely made bankruptcy more attractive to troubled debtors.

Despite these signs of  deterioration in  consumer creditworthiness, interest rates on consumer loans declined in the opening months of this year. The average most common rate on  a forty-eight-month new-car loan at banks was 9.1 percent in  the Board's quarterly survey taken in  early February, down from 9.4 percent in  November and  the recent high of 9.8 percent last May. Average new-car rates have dropped more sharply at the auto finance companies, from 12 percent last March to 9.7 percent in  January. This drop stems partly from the effect of special reduced-rate financing programs subsidized by  the  manufacturing parent companies.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

__

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services

In  December, the deficit in  U.S. international trade in goods and services remained at about the same level as in  November. Both exports and imports rose 1 percent between November and December. Data for January are now  scheduled to  be  released on  March 29.

<!-- missing-text -->

Source. U.S. Dept. of  Commerce, Bureaus of  Economic Analysis and Census.

In  the fourth quarter, the deficit narrowed to a  level last recorded in the first quarter of 1994. Exports were 2.2 percent higher than in  the third quarter with the largest increases recorded in  machinery (a wide range of  products) and services (particularly receipts from foreigners' travel and transportation expenditures in the United States). Imports declined 0.5 percent, with decreases recorded largely in  automotive products, consumer goods, and oil. Imports of  non-oil industrial supplies and machinery other than computers and semiconductors declined as well.

The trade deficit for 1995 was only slightly larger than in the previous year. This followed two  years of substantial increases in  the deficit. In price-adjusted dollars, a  distinct downturn appeared during the second half of  1995 in  imports of consumer goods, automotive products, non-oil industrial supplies (especially

metals), and capital goods (other than computers and semiconductors). All of  these categories had been on  an  upward trajectory through early 1995. Exports trended upward during the year (although at a  slower rate than a  year earlier). Most of the increase was in capital goods (even  when computers and semiconductors are excluded) and industrial supplies. Capital goods and industrial supplies together account for nearly 70 percent of the nominal value of  merchandise exports.

Oil Imports

The quantity of  oil imported during November-December declined slightly from October rates. The large seasonal inventory drawdown offset increases in oil consumption. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that in  January-February imports should fall due to a  continued drawdown in oil inventories.

The  price of  imported oil rose slightly in  November, and then accelerated in  December and January resulting in  a  price level 10 percent above that of  January 1995. Spot WTI rose nearly $0.20 per barrel in  February, averaging $19.07 per barrel, roughly unchanged from its average in  December. Prices have risen during March and are trading in the $20.00 per barrel range. Unusually cold weather in  North America and Japan as  well as weather-related production disruptions in the North Sea and Australia helped keep prices firm. Prices have also been  more volatile --  spot WTI jumped to $23 per barrel in  intraday trading on  February 20 --  with inventories reported to be  at very low levels. Refiners have been reluctant to build inventories because of  the fear of  a  sharp price decline if negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations for a  limited oil sale result in an additional 700,000 barrels per day  of  oil on  world markets.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports decreased in  January. The largest declines were in food prices. In  addition, there were smaller price decreases in  most other major trade categories. For the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, prices of  nonoil imports declined 1 percent at an annual rate; this followed ten consecutive quarters of price increases. The largest declines were in capital goods and foods. In  addition, the rate of  increase in prices of  imported industrial supplies slowed to near zero in  Q4 from double-digit rates in the first two quarters of  the year. Data for February are scheduled to  be  released on  March 26.

Prices of exports increased in January, the largest rise since April 1995. Overall, prices of  exports have changed very little since mid-1995; prices of exported agricultural products have risen sharply and (until January) prices of other exported products have declined. Much of the increase in the price of total exports in January was accounted for by  agricultural commodities; agricultural export prices have risen at double-digit annual rates since the first quarter of 1995 in response to  disappointing harvests abroad last year and robust world demand. The price of nonagricultural exports rose moderately in  January--the first monthly increase since last June. Since mid-1994, movements in nonagricultural export prices have been dominated by  sharp swings in  the prices of exported industrial supplies, including a  runup through mid-1995, a  reversal during the third and fourth quarters of last year, and a  pickup in January.

U.S. Current Account

The U.S. current account deficit narrowed $36.7 billion SAAR in the fourth quarter. The largest changes were reductions in the deficits in trade (discussed above) and in  investment income.

The deficit on  investment income narrowed $14.5 billion SAAR in the fourth quarter. This change was more than accounted for by the increase in net direct investment income. Earnings of  U.S. direct investors abroad improved dramatically, by  over $10 billion SAAR, lead by the performance of  the computer industry; profits of foreign direct investors in the United States fell marginally, in line with anecdotal reports of a  weakening of  corporate profits in the  U.S. domestic economy.

For the year 1995, the current account deficit was virtually unchanged from 1994.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Foreign official reserve assets in  the United States continued to increase sharply in  January, after a  record $109 billion increase in 1995. (See line 1  of  the Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table.) Much of  the increase in January was accounted for by  a  wide range of  developing countries in  Asia and Latin America. Partial data for February from FRBNY indicate continued increases by  developing countries as  well as large increases by  G-10 countries associated with foreign exchange market intervention.

Net purchases of  U.S. corporate and government agency bonds by private foreigners were strong in  January (see line 4b). Both U.S. financial corporations and government agencies have been actively issuing bonds in global markets in the first quarter. Some of these issues have been in  exotic currencies (for example, South African rand, Egyptian pound, Polish zloty, and Portuguese escudo), probably to hedge exposure or  to take advantage of  swap opportunities.

Net  purchases of  U.S. Treasury securities by  private foreigners were modest in January, held down by  very large net sales by financial institutions located in  the Caribbean (line 4a). For 1995, Caribbean financial centers accounted for almost 40 percent of the record $100 billion in foreign private net purchases of U.S. Treasury securities. Part of the funding to finance these purchases appears to  have come from RP transactions with nonbank securities dealers located in the United States, contributing to  the outflow reported in line 3. Net purchases of  Treasury securities by residents of  Japan directly from the United States were also substantial in 1995 and in  January 1996.

Foreigners continued to add to  their holdings of  U.S. corporate stock in January (line 4c). For the fourth quarter of 1995, BEA  has added an estimate of stock acquired through a  merger-

related stock swap (discussed below) to the reported data, bringing BEA's published total for the year 1995 to $12.8 billion.

After a  weak first quarter in 1995, U.S. net purchases of foreign securities were very strong; that strength continued in January 1996 (line 5). Stock purchases were concentrated in the industrial countries. Net purchases of stocks in Japan were particularly strong in  January, accounting for 57 percent of  the total, up from 40  percent for 1995. In contrast, since the  Mexican crisis U.S. investors have shown limited interest in adding to their holdings of stocks or bonds from developing countries in Latin America. Interest in stocks from developing countries in  Asia was better maintained.

Data recently released by  the  Department of  Commerce indicate that direct investment inflows and outflows rose to record levels in 1995 (lines 6  and 7). Large mergers and acquisitions added substantially to the flows in  both directions; examples include the takeover of  Marion Merrell Dow  by  Hoechst and the  merger of Pharmacia and Upjohn. The latter deal, because of  the way  it  was structured (a  stock swap with the new  merged firm incorporated in Delaware), increased U.S. direct investment abroad, but this increase was balanced by  an  increase in  foreign holdings of  U.S. stock and an  increase in  foreign direct investment in the United States. In addition, privatizations abroad attracted large investments by  U.S. firms. In contrast to U.S. portfolio investment, direct investment outflows to Latin America continued to grow in 1995, as did U.S. direct investment flows to developing countries in  Asia.

Foreign Exchange Markets

Since the FOMC meeting on January 31, the exchange value of the dollar depreciated 1/4 percent against the yen, 3/4 percent against the  mark, and 1-3/4 percent against sterling. On a weighted-average basis, the dollar declined 1-1/4 percent.

In the first half of  the intermeeting period the dollar declined amid changing market expectations about the future course of  German and Japanese monetary policies. In  Germany, stronger-thanexpected growth in  the M3 money supply and in industrial production may have led some market participants to conclude that the Bundesbank's easing cycle had ended. This perception was reinforced by the  Bundesbank's announcement on February 1  that it would conduct repurchase operations at a  fixed rate of 3.30 percent at the tenders on  February 7 and 14. (The  Bundesbank announced on  March 14 that the repo rate will remain fixed at 3.30 percent through March 27.) In  Japan, data releases that generally were stronger than expected suggested that monetary tightening by the Bank of Japan may soon be at  hand. This perception was reinforced by ill-timed official comments that pensioners were suffering from low interest rates.

However, in late February, the dollar rebounded due  to  a number of factors. First, incoming data suggested that economic prospects in  Germany and Japan were not as rosy as earlier data had indicated, while economic data in the United States generally were stronger than expected. In Germany, business confidence dipped in January, and the strong growth in  industrial production that was registered in December was revised sharply downward. Although the Japanese Tankan survey continued to climb from lows recorded in late 1993, the rise in  February was not as strong as the market had expected. Second, accommodative money market operations by the Bank of Japan have signalled that monetary tightening is not imminent.

Third, the dollar may  have been supported by  very heavy intervention purchases by  the Bank of  Japan.

Except in  France, the United Kingdom, and Sweden, short-term interest rates are little changed on net since the last FOMC meeting as  monetary policy has remained on  hold in  most G-10 countries. The Bank of  France reduced its intervention rate, the effective floor for short-term market interest rates, by  a  cumulative amount of 40  basis points as the French franc strengthened somewhat against the mark. Citing subdued inflation pressure and  below-trend growth, the Bank of England reduced official rates by  1/4 percentage point on  March 8. In  Sweden, the  Riksbank lowered its repo rate by 85 basis points cumulatively as downward pressure on the krona, which followed market concerns that the government was wavering in its commitment to fiscal austerity, has subsided, and incoming inflation data was quite favorable. On  March 21, the Riksbank reduced its official interest rates by 3/4 percentage point, and the Bank of  Canada lowered its target range for the overnight rate by 1/4 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5-1/4 percent.

Long-term interest rates in  most G-10 countries rose over the intermeeting period. Although the increase in  U.S. long-term rates is consistent with stronger-than-expected data, the  backup in  longterm rates in some other G-10 countries, particularly in  most European countries where recent data releases generally have been weaker than expected, is  more difficult to explain. The rise in long-term rates in  most European countries may reflect market perceptions that monetary easing in Germany, and by  extension in most other European countries, has, or  will soon, come to an  end as faster growth in the United States and Canada may  herald strength in other countries. Higher European long-term rates may also reflect market concerns that relaxation of  the Maastricht fiscal convergence criteria, in order to begin EMU as scheduled in 1999, may lead to

higher long-run  debt positions  and,  perhaps,  inflation in  those countries. In  Japan,  long-term interest  rates  rose earlier  in the intermeeting period, but  declined after  the release  of the weakerthan-expected Tankan survey on March 1, and  are about unchanged  on balance.

In Mexican financial markets,  the peso declined 1-1/2  percent against the dollar over the  intermeeting period. The Mexican stock market declined by as much  as 7 percent  as  interest  rates  on  pesodenominated cetes  obligations  rose  early in  the intermeeting period due to heightened  inflationary concerns. However,  in  recent days, interest rates have reversed  direction, and the  stock market has rallied. On balance, one-month interest rates  are up  2 percentage points,  but  1-year  interest rates  are  down  1/2  percentage point, since the last  FOMC meeting.  The Mexican stock market is 1 percent lower  on balance  since January 31.

The Desk did  not intervene in foreign exchange markets over the  intermeeting period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial  Countries

Economic activity remained sluggish late  last year on balance, as  real GDP contracted or  registered little growth in many major foreign industrial  countries. An exception was  Japan, where growth picked up significantly, and a moderate recovery appears underway. Indicators  for  the current  quarter  are limited, but  point to continued moderate growth  in Japan, and  incoming data suggest  that activity has  picked up  in  Canada. In  contrast, activity still appears to be weak in Germany and France, while indicators for  the United Kingdom and Italy have been mixed.

Inflationary pressures  remain subdued. Prices have fallen further in  Japan, and recent  consumer price inflation has averaged

2  percent or less in Germany, France, and Canada. Italian inflation remains high but has slowed considerably in the past couple of months. U.K. consumer price inflation has been moderate, while producer price inflation has trended downward.

Individual country notes. In  Japan, recently released fourthquarter data and revised third-quarter data show sustained moderate output growth. This growth has been led by  large increases in public and private investment and moderate increases in private consumption. In the fourth quarter, government investment accounted for half of the increase in total fixed investment. Net exports have been a  significant drag on growth, reflecting the lagged effect of  yen appreciation in early 1995.

In  the Bank of Japan's February survey (Tankan), the index of business sentiment of  major manufacturing firms (the percentage having a  favorable view of  business conditions minus the percentage with an  unfavorable outlook) registered -12, slightly less negative than the previous survey taken in  November.

The current account surplus has continued to  decline, registering about $110 billion for the year 1995, down about $19 billion from the previous year. The current account surplus declined again in January, and trade data for February show a further decline in  the  merchandise trade surplus.

For nearly three weeks, the opposition New  Frontier Party has blockaded the entrance to the Budget Committee room and prevented the Diet from considering the FY1996 budget. This blockade is in protest to the budget's allocation of ¥685 billion ($6.4 billion) of public funds to  help resolve the problem of  insolvent housing loan companies (jusen). The government plans to introduce a  provisional budget for the first few  weeks of  the fiscal year that does not

include money for the jusen while it tries to negotiate with the opposition parties on the regular budget.

In Germany, real GDP contracted 1.6 percent (SAAR) during the final quarter of 1995. The softening of the economy in  1995 reflects a  slowdown in domestic demand, despite a  pickup in private consumption spending (to rates slightly below those typical of an expansion). Growth in  investment declined in 1995, as construction dropped sharply with the expiration of assorted tax incentives at the end of 1994 that had accelerated building plans and, more recently, from the  very cold winter, while spending on machinery and equipment was little changed. Data for the fourth quarter indicate a  sizable inventory correction, which could bode well for current quarter production. However, since inventories are not measured independently in the  German statistics but are the residual in  the national accounts, inferences from the fourth quarter inventory drawdown could be  misleading.

<!-- missing-text -->

Data for the first quarter are generally consistent with continued weakness. Unemployment has increased further, rising by 107,000 persons (seasonally adjusted) in February to bring the total number of  unemployment to nearly 4  million. Rising uncertainty about job prospects may  be  causing consumers to save the courtmandated tax cuts that went into effect on January 1  and were widely expected to generate a  pickup in private consumption. A survey of current and expected conditions in  the construction sector showed further declines. However, industrial output was up sharply in January, and export expectations of  manufacturing firms rose strongly.

Price pressures remain modest. Over the 12 months ending in February, consumer prices in the western states rose 1.4 percent. Producer and import prices continue to evidence no sign of inflationary pressures, with the most recent monthly data showing declines on a  12-month basis.

<!-- missing-text -->

As of  March 15, the Finance Ministry began requiring special approval for large federal expenditures, in  hopes of reducing the 1996 deficit overrun now estimated to  be  in the range of  DM 15-20 billion. A similar measure was instituted last October when it became clear that tax revenues were likely to fall short of expectations. This emergency measure does not rule out a supplementary budget later this year or  the possible institution of additional tax measures in  order to meet the federal deficit target of DM 60 billion.

In France, real GDP contracted 1.3 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter. This contraction was in line with expectations, and was attributed in  part to  the public sector strikes in late November and December. During the fourth quarter, private consumption declined and inventories fell sharply while investment, government spending, and net exports contributed positively to growth.

<!-- missing-text -->

Monthly indicators suggest that economic activity will remain subdued in  the current quarter, after factoring in some bounceback

in production following the strike. Although business surveys suggest that confidence has stabilized early this year, output is expected to remain weak through the first quarter. The surveys also suggest that inventories remain above normal, pointing to a continued inventory correction in the near-term, and the unemployment rate rose further in January to 11.8 percent. Real consumption of  manufactured products rose sharply in January from its fourth-quarter average, but at least part of  this pickup stems from a  strike-rebound effect. Consumer confidence in January and February improved modestly from December but remains far below last summer's levels. Consumer price inflation remained moderate through February.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  the United Kingdom, real GDP rose 2.1 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter of 1995, mainly the result of robust growth in consumption and a  modest pickup in investment. At  the same time, inventory accumulation slowed noticeably compared to the two previous quarters.

<!-- missing-text -->

Available data for  the current quarter are mixed. While manufacturing output increased 0.3 percent in January, overall industrial production contracted, reflecting weather-related weakness in  the utility sector. In  February, manufacturing employment declined somewhat. However, retail sales rebounded in February, and the February Confederation of  British Industry survey showed the balance of firms expecting to increase output versus those expecting to decrease output rose to  +20 from the December low of  +2.

Targeted inflation, measured as  the year-on-year change in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, has been little changed through February from the fourth quarter average of 2.9 percent. A  declining trend in  price pressures has been more visible in  producer price indexes. Growth in average earnings continues to be  modest despite a  gradually falling unemployment rate. Surveys on pay settlements show that most were settled in the 3  to 4  percent

range in  the fourth quarter, slightly higher than in the first half of 1995.

In  Italy, the advance GDP release stated that real economic activity declined 4  percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter, following an 8  percent gain in  the third quarter. Large swings in inventory investment have been primarily responsible for quarter-to-quarter movements in GDP this year. The preliminary Q4 release implies that for 1995 as a  whole, real GDP expanded 2.4 percent on a  Q4/Q4 basis, largely the result of strong export growth. Forward-looking indicators are limited. Business sentiment picked up considerably in  December and January, but consumer confidence edged down in February and remains below levels registered in  mid-1995.

Inflation has continued to  decline. In  February, the consumer price index was 5 percent above its year-earlier level, down from a peak of 6.1 percent in  December. Wholesale price inflation has also slowed somewhat.

On February 16, President Scalfaro dissolved the parliament and called for elections on  April 21, three years ahead of  schedule. On February 27, Prime Minister Dini announced that his fledgling

political party will support the center-left coalition in  the upcoming elections. Current opinion polls suggest that neither the center-left nor the center-right has sufficient support for a  strong majority. If  the election does not produce a  strong majority, prospects for further fiscal reform could be jeopardized.

Economic activity in Canada remained weak in  the fourth quarter of 1995, as real GDP expanded 0.8 percent (SAAR). Machinery and equipment investment picked up sharply, reversing a  drop in the third quarter, but this increase was partially offset by  further declines in residential and non-residential construction. Net exports contributed positively to  growth, despite the  weak pace of activity in the United States. A  drop in consumption expenditures, a  reduced pace of  inventory investment, and lower government spending also contributed to the quarter's sluggish pace.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent indicators are limited but suggest a pickup in  economic activity. In January, retail sales rose and manufacturing shipments edged up, while new  factory orders through January have posted three consecutive monthly increases. Conditions in the labor market have also improved recently. Between November 1995 and February 1996, employment has grown 1 percent, more than three times the increase over the previous twelve months. However, the unemployment rate remained high at 9.6 percent in  February, as recent job growth has led to  increased labor force participation.

After rising to  near the  top of  the Bank of  Canada's 1-3 percent target band in  the first half of  last year, consumer price inflation has been subdued recently, reflecting the excess supply in the economy, stabilization of the Canadian dollar, and moderation in industrial product price inflation.

5 The Chretien government's new budget, released on  March 6, calls for continued significant reductions in government spending to reduce the deficit from 4  percent of GDP for  the fiscal year ending March 31, to 3  percent of  GDP in 1996-97 and to 2  percent of  GDP in

1997-98. A  sizable operating surplus will continue to be  offset by rising debt service costs. The federal government net debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to peak at  nearly 75 percent of GDP this year.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

In  Latin America, real GDP growth rebounded moderately in  the fourth quarter of  1995 from generally sharp declines earlier in the year, while inflation continued to move lower, except in  Venezuela. Asian real GDP growth slowed a  bit to  more sustainable rates. Trade performance continued to  be stronger in  Latin America compared with a  year earlier. In  contrast, the Chinese trade balance moved toward a  deficit.

Individual country notes. In Mexico, recent data suggest that the recession bottomed out in  mid-1995. Fourth-quarter real GDP declined 6.6 percent from its year-earlier level, bringing GDP for all of 1995 to 6.9 percent below its 1994 level, the steepest decline in  the post-war period. However, on  a  seasonally adjusted basis, GDP is estimated to  have increased about 3.7 percent (not at an annual rate) in  the fourth quarter after rising 1.3 percent in the third quarter. The fourth-quarter increase was considerably greater than expected and, in  contrast to  previous quarters, reflected a  rebound in domestic demand while net exports weakened. However, much of  the increase in  domestic demand was attributable to a  reduced pace of  inventory decumulation rather than a  rebound in final demand. The rebound in  GDP was mirrored in a  strengthening of industrial production in  November and December, as well as in  the steady decline in the unemployment rate. On  a  seasonally adjusted basis, the unemployment rate is estimated to have declined further in  January and February, suggesting that economic activity may  have continued to  expand early this year.

Seasonal factors help to  explain the rise in  December and January inflation rates. The reduction in  the inflation rate to 2.3 percent in  February, as  well as the recent stabilization of the peso and an  easing of seasonal price pressures, suggest that inflation will decline on  balance in  the coming months.

Largely as a  result of  an improved trade performance, the current account deficit declined to only about $650 million in 1995 compared with a  $29 billion deficit in 1994. More recently, the merchandise trade surplus rose sharply in  January, in part reversing monthly declines registered in the fourth quarter of last year.

Partly as a  result of  the intensification of financial market pressures late last year, past-due loans as a  share of  total loans rose from 9 percent at end-1994 to about 18 percent in  December. In February, it was announced that the Bank of  Montreal would be purchasing a  significant ownership share in  Bancomer, Mexico's second largest bank, while the Bank of  Nova Scotia would be acquiring a  majority stake in Inverlat. The recapitalization of these banks will be  supported by  government purchases of their loan portfolios.

In  Brazil, real GDP in  the fourth quarter of 1995 rebounded partially from its steep decline in  the second and third quarters, bringing growth for  the year as  a whole to 4.2 percent (largely reflecting very strong growth in  the fourth quarter of 1994 and the first quarter of 1995). Indications are that economic activity

continued its recovery in  the first quarter of 1996. By  Brazilian standards, inflation remains relatively low.

Despite the pickup in  economic activity, Brazil recorded balanced trade in January and February 1996, as it did in  the fourth quarter of 1995. Strong net capital inflows prompted the central bank in early February to tighten capital controls. The inflows occurred as domestic interest rates remained high relative to the rate of depreciation allowed by  the central bank under the crawling peg. In  January 1996, international reserves were an estimated $54 billion (liquidity definition), up considerably from a  low of $32 billion in  early 1995.

Top central bank and government officials have come under fire from Congress over revelations that a  large private bank, which ran into financial trouble in late 1995 and was rescued by  the central bank at a heavy cost, had hidden its losses by  engaging in fraudulent banking practices for a  decade. Some observers have expressed concerns that a  Senate inquiry into the matter could reveal more evidence of  banking irregularities and further weaken confidence in the banking system.

In  Argentina, real GDP contracted by  an  estimated 3.5 percent in 1995, while inflation remained low. Consumer prices rose

0.4 percent in February from a  year earlier. In 1995, exports rose by  31 percent over a  year earlier, while imports declined almost 9  percent. However, the trade surplus peaked in June. Gross international reserves have increased somewhat in the last month and stood at $19 billion at end-February. Of  the $19 billion, $2.6 billion are in  dollar-denominated Bonex bonds and $3.4 billion are in  net repurchase agreements. The monetary base was $12 billion, leaving $7  billion in excess reserves.

Argentina's current Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF expires on  March 30, 1996. In  mid-February, Argentina reached a preliminary agreement on a  new 21-month stand-by arrangement with the IMF, with the amount due to  be fixed in the first half of  April, although it is likely to  be for about $1  billion. The package of  laws intended to give President Menem power for one year to raise taxes and cut some spending without Congressional approval was passed, slightly amended, by  the Senate on  February 29. The "Reform of  the State II" law, as it is called, is expected to  be passed shortly by  the lower house of  Congress.

In  Venezuela, real GDP grew an estimated 2  percent in 1995, due to the strong performance of  the oil sector, which grew

6 percent. Economic activity in  the  non-oil sector continued to decline, contributing to rising unemployment, which was above 10 percent at the end of 1995. Consumer price inflation picked up in December due to the devaluation of  the bolivar that month and has reached 8 percent a  month in  both January and February. Venezuela registered a  merchandise (non-oil) trade deficit of $5.6 billion for the first eleven months of 1995, versus a  deficit of $3.6 billion during the same period in 1994, reflecting a 37 percent increase in imports and a 16 percent increase in exports.

In China, strong import growth and negative export growth have shifted the trade balance towards deficit in recent months. China's trade deficit of $0.5 billion in  the January-February period compares with a  surplus of  $4.5 billion in the same period of 1995. The dollar value of exports fell 2  percent from a  year earlier, while imports rose 34 percent. Inflation continues to  moderate.

In  February 1996, China announced plans to liberalize access to the interbank foreign exchange market. The new regulations, effective April 1, 1996, eliminate the existing segmented markets for Chinese and foreign enterprises. Chinese officials suggest that full current-account convertibility will be achieved by  the year 2000. China has no plans, however, to ease restrictions on  capitalaccount transactions.

In  Taiwan, real GDP growth slowed to 4.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1995 from the year-earlier period, in part reflecting sluggish consumption growth. For 1995 overall, real GDP grew at its lowest rate since 1990 and its second lowest rate since 1984. M2 rose 8  percent in the twelve-months ending in  January 1996, the lowest annual growth rate since Taiwan began recording monetary statistics. The slow growth in  monetary aggregates in  part reflects capital outflows, as foreign exchange reserves fell to $90 billion at the end of  1995 from its high of $100 billion in  June 1995, reflecting increased tensions with China. Reserves fell further in early 1996, to an estimated $85 billion in  early March.

The approach of  Taiwan's first direct presidential election on March 23 has led to rising tension with mainland China, which in turn has been reflected in  financial markets. Taiwan's stock market fell 28 percent in 1995 and has fallen 5  percent so far this year. In  an attempt to support the stock market, Taiwan in  February

announced a  new $7 billion stock-market stabilization fund, using contributions from banks, insurance companies, postal funds, and pension funds. In addition, Taiwan announced that it was opening the stock market to foreign individual investors; previously, only foreign institutional investors were permitted.

In  Korea, activity appears to have slowed somewhat in recent months, compared with the nearly double-digit growth experienced in the first three quarters of  1995. However, it is difficult to gauge the magnitude of the slowdown. An  abrupt deceleration in  capital goods imports since the  middle of last year suggests that investment demand has slowed markedly. On  the other hand, industrial production increased sharply in January (on  a  year-over-year basis), after decelerating significantly in the fourth quarter of 1995. Consumer price inflation was 5.1 percent in  February 1996 (on a year-over-year basis).

Korea recently announced that it  will raise the ceiling on foreign participation in  its stock market from its present limit of 15 percent of  market capitalization to 20 percent by  the second half of this year. It also announced measures that will allow increased foreign competition in  the provision of financial services, including allowing foreign securities firms to conduct brokerage operations on outbound portfolio investment. These steps were

announced to enhance Korea's prospects of  gaining admission to  the OECD. Korea's application will be  reviewed formally in April.

In Russia, monthly inflation fell to a  post-reform low of 2.8 percent in  February, down from 4.1 percent in  January. The ruble has continued to depreciate slowly against the dollar, remaining comfortably within its 4550-5150 rubles per dollar band. During February, real GDP was down 3  percent from a  year earlier, and industrial production declined by  4  percent. Russia's trade surplus increased to $17.9 billion in 1995, as exports increased by 13 percent and imports grew by  10 percent.

In late February, the IMF and the  Russian government reached agreement on a  three-year $10.2 billion equivalent Extended Fund Facility (EFF), as a  successor to  the stand-by arrangement that Russia successfully completed in  early February. The conditions of the EFF focus on increased fiscal discipline, including a  pledge to reduce the budget deficit from 5  percent of  GDP in  1995 to 4  percent of  GDP in 1996 and 2 percent of GDP in 1998. The structural reforms outlined in the agreement include tax reform (particularly improved revenue collection), trade liberalization, further privatization, and intensified efforts to strengthen bank supervision and regulation.
