Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers

The early March reading for the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment held steady at its low level.  This month's preliminary sentiment reading showed some improvement in households' outlook for the economy likely related to recent government policies; however, concerns about income and job prospects continued to erode households' appraisal of their personal financial situation and buying conditions for household durables.  Among items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in the unemployment rate over the next twelve months improved slightly, but nearly two-thirds of households still expect rising unemployment. Households were broadly more pessimistic about buying conditions, including cars and homes, primarily because of uncertainty about income.  The median of expected inflation over the next 12 months moved up 0.3 percentage point, to 2.2 percent, and the median of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years moved down to 2.8 percent, about the same as its average over the past five years.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $36 billion in January from $39.9 billion in December, as a steep fall in imports more than offset a fall in exports.

The value of exports of goods and services fell 5.7 percent in January, following as similarly sized decline in December.  All major categories of exports decreased. A substantial portion of the overall fall in exports was due to a decline in exports of capital goods, particularly in exports of machinery, and automotive products.  Exports of industrial supplies, consumer goods, and services also moved down.

The value of imports of goods and services fell 6.7 percent in January, with all major categories recording declines.  The overall fall in imports was primarily due to declines in imports of oil, automotive products, and capital goods.  The decline in the value of oil imports mainly reflected a lower price as volumes were little changed.  Imports of automotive products declined as automakers made significant production cutbacks throughout North America.  Imports of industrial supplies, consumer goods, and services also came in lower.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. Following January's 0.8 percent decline, the prices of core imports fell a further 0.4 percent in February.  For both months, the drop was due to falling prices for material-intensive goods.  The prices of foods, feeds, and beverages fell 3.2 percent in February, and those for non-fuel industrial supplies fell 0.7 percent.  Declining prices for chemicals contributed the most to the fall in the price of industrial supplies, but all other categories saw their prices fall as well.  Prices for finished goods were little changed, as declines in the prices of capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors offset price increases in automotive products.

The average level of core import prices in January and February was 10 percent at an annual rate below the 2008 fourth quarter average, as prices in most sub-categories posted declines. The main contributors to the overall price decline were foods and nonfuel industrial supplies, whose prices fell at annual rates of 6½ percent and 33½ percent, respectively.  The average price of imported finished goods declined at an annual rate of just ¼ percent.

Oil. The BLS price index for imported oil increase 3.9 percent in February, marking the first increase in the index in last six months.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil averaged $39 per barrel in February, but has since moved higher to close most recently at $46.25 on March 13.

Exports. Following a 0.8 percent increase in January, the prices of exported core goods fell 0.2 percent in February.  Prices of agricultural products increased 6.2 percent in January but fell back 1.7 percent in February.  Prices of exported finished goods were flat in February following a 0.7 percent rise in January.

The average level of core export prices in January and February was 9¼ percent at an annual rate below the fourth quarter average, as prices for material-intensive goods fell 22 percent.  In contrast, prices of exported finished goods rose 2½ percent.
