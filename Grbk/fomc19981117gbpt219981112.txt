However, the s a pr w unexpected  October  15 intermeeting tion owering he  funds  rate nother ac l t a 1/4  percentage  oint nd  cutting  he  discount  ate   like  mount gave  the arkets he p a t r a a m t sense  that  he  System  was  taking   more aggressive  pproach  and  would act o  prevent t a a t an  economic  downturn  or  contain  dditional nancial mage.  Accordingly,  ight a fi da r after  he  easing,  raders  ushed  the ield  n three-month  reasury ills  own to  a  low t t p y o T b d of  3.56  percent, f 0  basis  oints  rom  the evel  ust  efore he  September  FOMC of 8 p f l j b t meeting; he  thirty-year  nd  yield  lipped  elow  5 percent, wn  20  basis  oints  rom t bo s b do p f just  efore he  last  OMC b t F meeting.

Developments  in Foreign Industrial Countries

Incoming data suggest that the pace of economic activity in the major foreign industrial countries  has slowed in the second half of the year.  In Japan, third quarter real GDP is likely to register its fourth consecutive quarterly decline, with virtually all indicators  of private demand showing further deterioration from already low  secondquarter levels. Available data for the European economies are mixed but on balance suggest that output growth is slowing, especially in Germany.  Although official data for the United Kingdom show that real GDP continued to expand at a moderate pace in the third quarter, survey data point to considerable  weakness  in the near term, and indicators suggest that the Canadian economy  is slowing more than previously expected.

Low or falling producer and import prices are helping to keep consumer price inflation subdued.  On a twelve-month basis, consumer price inflation is close to zero in Japan, below one percent in Germany, France, and Canada, and below two percent in Italy.  In the United Kingdom, retail price inflation is  somewhat higher but has declined in the past two months to meet the 2  1/2 percent target.

Softer domestic  demand and a weaker outlook for the global economy have led to policy rate reductions  of 75 basis points in the United Kingdom and 50 basis points in Canada.  In line with the process  of  EMU convergence,  official rates have also been reduced in several continental  European countries,  including a 100-basis point reduction in Italy.

Individual country notes. In Japan, evidence suggests  that the economy registered  its fourth consecutive quarterly  decline  during the third quarter.

Unemployment  remained at an all-time high of 4.3 percent in September, and the offers-to-applicants  ratio declined to a record low of 0.49. Industrial production  during the third quarter was at its  lowest level in over  four years,  down 0.3 percent from the already  weak  second-quarter average.  Household expenditure, housing  starts, and
