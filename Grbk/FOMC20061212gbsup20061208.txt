Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Private payroll employment increased 114,000 in November from a level in October that was 20,000 higher than previously estimated.  Over the three months ending in November, private employment rose 104,000 jobs per month on average, slightly less than the pace of 130,000 per month of the preceding three months.  Once again in November, hiring at nonbusiness services establishments accounted for much of the overall gain, with employment in the education and health services industry up 41,000 and jobs in the leisure and hospitality industry up 31,000.  Retail trade employers stepped up their hiring noticeably last month (20,000) after having shed nearly 100,000 jobs thus far this year.  However, weakness persisted in manufacturing (-15,000) and construction (-29,000).  In contrast to recent months, the weakness in construction employment was not confined to residential construction; rather, all the major subcategories, within both residential and nonresidential, posted losses.  Finally, government employment continued to expand (18,000), again led by hiring in education.

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls held steady at 33.9 hours in November, but were up from the third quarter.  The level of aggregate hours of these workers was 0.4 percent (not an annual rate) above the third-quarter average.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.2 percent in November.  For the twelve months ending in November, average hourly earnings rose 4.1 percent, up from an increase of 3.0 percent over the preceding twelve months.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked up 0.1 percentage point to 4.5 percent in November, reversing part of its decline the previous month.  In contrast, the labor force participation rate edged up to 66.3 percent in November-the highest level that the participation rate has reached since 2003. 1

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment dipped in early December to 90.2 after having edged down in November.  The recent decrease reflected a weakening in the 'expected conditions' component that more than offset a modest strengthening in the 'current conditions' component of the overall index.

Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened a bit.  In addition, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars weakened.  However, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for homes improved.  Meanwhile, the median of expected inflation over the next twelve months remained unchanged, and the median over the next five to ten years ticked up to 3.1 percent in early December.
