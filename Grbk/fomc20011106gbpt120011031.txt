International Developments

Foreign  economic  activity appears  to be contracting during  the second half of this  year,  as the  ongoing  slowdown in the global economy has been  exacerbated by uncertainty  following the events of September 11. Although we still have little  hard information  on  foreign real  output after August, anecdotal  reports  and confidence  indicators  suggest some  negative effect on both employment  and sentiment. In addition, the  anticipated  contraction in U.S.  activity  in the  second half of this year is expected  to depress foreign  exports. However, foreign equity markets have rebounded to levels close to those before September  11,  relieving concerns  about  a substantial  additional  negative  wealth effect.

We expect that some support from both monetary  and fiscal policy as well  as the lower level of oil prices  will lead to a small positive rate of growth  in foreign activity by early 2002.  Growth is then expected  to improve gradually to rates close to potential  later in the year as  the U.S.  economy revives.  Nevertheless, in most parts  of the world, sizable  negative  output gaps  are expected  to persist through 2003,  and  inflation should remain muted.  This forecast is somewhat weaker than our previous projection.

Summary of Staff Projections

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE. Changes  for years  are measured  as Q4/Q4; for half-years,  Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2.

We continue to expect oil  prices to edge down over the next two years,  in line with  futures quotes,  although  the  projection's endpoint  is a bit higher than in the September Greenbook.  We are projecting the dollar to change little over the forecast  period, in contrast to the  small  decline  assumed  in the previous forecast. We expect the arithmetic  contribution  of the external sector to U.S.  GDP growth to be a little more  negative in both 2002  and 2003  than it was in  the previous forecast. After declining  sharply this year, both exports  and imports should  pick up next year  and show further expansion in 2003.

International financial markets. Foreign  short-term interest rates in the major industrial countries  generally declined during  the intermeeting  period, most

notably in Canada and  the United  Kingdom in response to their reductions  in policy  interest rates.  Although the European  Central Bank left its policy rates unchanged  during the period, euro  short-term market rates  dropped  nearly  15 basis  points, reflecting  expectations  for  an easing by year end.  The Bank of Japan  continued  to leave an elevated amount  of reserves in the banking  system, keeping its current  account positions  above Y6  trillion and short-term interest rates near zero.

Stock markets in foreign  industrial countries  generally rose on balance over the intermeeting  period, likely reflecting  a reversal  of the sharp  increase  in risk aversion immediately  following the terrorist  attacks as well  as prospects for easier monetary policy.  Equity prices in many emerging-market countries  also rose;  sovereign bond yield spreads  generally narrowed,  including those of Mexico and Brazil.  In contrast,  in Argentina, where concerns over public sector indebtedness remain  high, equity prices fell more than 5 percent, and bond yield spreads widened 400 basis points.

Theheightened uncertainty  about the U.S. economic outlook has not resulted in significant  downward  pressure  on the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  The broad nominal  index is up slightly  since the previous FOMC  meeting, with small net gains  against all of the major industrial  country currencies and  against most emerging-market  currencies  as well.  In particular, the Brazilian real appeared  to suffer from concerns  about  prospects  in Argentina.  The only major exception to this  general pattern was the Mexican  peso, which rose nearly  3 percent  against the dollar.

The continued strength of the dollar may reflect a view that long-term prospects for the United States  are  still more favorable than those  abroad. Over the intermeeting period, foreign long-term bond yields have  fallen  somewhat more than comparable U.S.  rates.  The relative  decline has been ascribed to both disappointing recent foreign economic  data and concerns that the policy response to the  slowdown  abroad will be  less vigorous than that in the United States. We continue to believe that the large  and  growing U.S.  external  debt will  at some point begin to outpace  growth in demand for U.S.  assets, thus exerting downward pressure  on  the dollar.  However, the current countervailing trend  suggests  that a turnaround  may not be imminent.  We have thus assumed for this forecast  that  the dollar will be little changed,  on net, over the projection period  in both nominal  and real  terms  against the currencies  of our major trading partners.

The Desk did not intervene during  the period for the accounts of the System  or the Treasury.
