RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

_

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Fueled by hefty gains in  household and  business expenditures, the economy turned in  a  solid growth performance in  the first quarter. Progress in  clearing up inventory overhangs--most notably in the auto industry--appears to  have set the stage for further expansion of  aggregate output in  the current quarter. Although tight labor market conditions have aroused concerns about possible pay acceleration, incoming data have not revealed much  movement to date; producer and consumer prices have registered larger increases in the past couple of  months, but that development has mainly reflected a  jump in  crude oil prices that has already been largely reversed.

GDP Update

On  May 2, the BEA issued its advance estimate of first-quarter GDP growth: 2.8 percent at an  annual rate. Source data that have become available since that time have been somewhat weaker on balance than assumed--but the shortfall is the result of  lower inventory investment, which might be interpreted as  a  plus for subsequent growth. Further changes to the estimate of  first-quarter growth may  still be  forthcoming, of  course, as additional source data trickle in over coming weeks. A potentially important item  is the March report on  international trade, which will be released on May 17.

quarter; payroll employment held steady, and aggregate hours of production and nonsupervisory workers declined. However, part of the slackening last month represented a  reversal of  special factors that had helped boost employment in  the first quarter, and other indicators, most notably claims for  unemployment compensation, do not suggest any recent softening in the growth of  labor demand. For these reasons, we  are inclined to  think that the April reading understates the current trend of  employment growth--just as  the earlier reports seem to  have overstated it  to a  considerable degree.

Increased hiring in  the service-producing industries has more than accounted for the gains in  payrolls this year. Employment in retail trade has moved up 30,000 a  month for the year to date, while net job gains in  service industries have averaged almost 100,000. In  the goods-producing sector, construction employment fell sharply in  April, reversing 40 percent of its first-quarter gain; the monthto-month variations in payrolls this year evidently have reflected the disruption of normal seasonal patterns by unusual weather. On average, employment in construction has risen 20,000 per  month in 1996. In  contrast, manufacturers have continued to shed jobs this year. After accounting for the return of GM workers from the strike in  Dayton, Ohio and from strike-related furloughs, manufacturing employment dropped about 50,000 in  April. Since the beginning of the year, it  has fallen 120,000--a faster contraction than occurred in 1995. Nondurable goods industries have accounted for nearly 75 percent of  this year's decline, with the textile and apparel industries being notably weak.

Aggregate hours of  production or  nonsupervisory workers in private industry fell 0.5 percent in  April but have grown 0.8 percent--or about 2-1/2 percent at an  annual rate--thus far in 1996. The official series on aggregate hours shows April's level about 1/2 percentage point above the average for the first quarter (not at  an  annual rate). However, the first-quarter average was depressed by the low  reading on  hours during the January reference week, which was the week of  the blizzard and therefore not representative of  the  month as a  whole. Making some reasonable guesses about what aggregate hours in  January might really have been, we  estimate that hours in  April actually were a  shade lower than the average for the first quarter.

In  the household survey, the unemployment rate fell 0.2 percentage point in  April to 5.4 percent, touching once more the

lower end of  the range in  which it  has fluctuated since October 1994. The labor force participation rate, which has shown significant volatility recently, dropped 0.3 percentage point to 66.6 percent, its average level in  both 1994 and 1995.1

Other labor market indicators seem to  be  holding on  paths that are consistent with moderate economic expansion. Initial claims for unemployment insurance under state programs averaged 353.000 in  the most recent four weeks, a  level in  the lower part of  the range of the past year. The Conference Board Help Wanted Index showed a small uptick in  March after falling in  both January and February. In  the Conference Board consumer confidence survey for  April, respondents reported greater optimism about job availability; compared with the results of the March survey, fewer respondents perceived that jobs are hard to get, and more believed job opportunities to  be  plentiful.

Industrial Production

Monthly changes in  industrial production were exceptionally volatile over the first several months of  1996, with the blizzard inducing sharp monthly swings in  the data for January and February and the strike in  the auto sector and its subsequent settlement causing a  second swing in  March and April. On  balance, these monthly swings resulted in a  rise in  production of  1.4 percent from December to April--a net change that was elevated by  a  few  tenths because of strike effects.

Most of  the 0.9 percent increase in  industrial production in April reflected the rebound in  motor vehicle assemblies. The  April level of  assemblies--12.2 million units at an  annual rate--was 0.5 million units above planned output at  the beginning of  the month; the upward adjustment occurred at  GM  as the firm tried to make up  for some of  the output that was lost during the strike. Effects of  the strike, coupled with stronger-than-expected sales, helped reduce the days' supply of  automobiles from the high levels prevailing during most of 1995 to  levels a bit below those the industry normally considers comfortable. As  a  result, the industry's plans for second-quarter assemblies of  automobiles were recently revised up; even so, production capacity limits are

Current and prospective indicators of  industrial activity more broadly have been mixed; on  the whole, however, they appear to  point to sustained expansion of  production. New  orders for durable goods, adjusted for inflation and excluding orders that are not closely related to  near-term activity, fell 0.9 percent in  March, but this decline reversed only about half of the sizable rise reported over the two previous months. The orders and production components of the National Purchasing Managers' indexes firmed in  April, though they were at levels suggesting only slow expansion of  the manufacturing sector in  the near term. An  increasingly positive element in  the outlook is that aircraft production is swinging back in  a  positive direction. Schedules for Boeing, which produces the vast majority of  domestic commercial jet aircraft, suggest that total commercial jet aircraft production will increase about 40 percent over this year and the next, after posting large declines in 1994-95.

The 1995 estimates of  capacity growth in  manufacturing have been revised downward slightly and those for 1996 revised upward in response to new  information from the Investment Plans Survey and more detailed, revised utilization rates from the Census Survey of Plant Capacity for 1993 and 1994. The revised estimates still show sizable gains in  factory productive potential in 1995-96--on the order of  4  percent; increases have been particularly large in  the computer and semiconductor industries. Utilization rates for the total industrial sector have been fluctuating with the monthly ups and downs in  production; the rate in  April, 83.0 percent, was

slightly to the high side of  the long-run average. The rate in primary processing industries has continued to look stronger than that in  the advanced processing industries.

Personal Income and Consumption

After a  sluggish fourth quarter, consumer demand has displayed renewed vitality. Real expenditures rose briskly in  the first quarter, income growth has been well-maintained, and sentiment is positive. Although loan delinquencies have become more numerous, households have remained willing and able to borrow--and many  have enjoyed hefty gains in their stock portfolios.

The strong advance in  real consumer expenditures in  the first quarter was toward the upper end of  the range of  outcomes anticipated by  various econometric models that the staff maintains, but this result follows a  period in  which actual spending tended, on average, to  fall short of  the  models' predictions. Increases in wealth that seemingly failed to  show through to consumption in 1995 are perhaps now  translating into spending to a  greater degree.

Sales of  light vehicles closed out the first quarter on a strong note and, all things considered, sales held up  well early in the second quarter. The reported figures for March and April show sales at  annual rates of  15.8 million units and 14.5 million units respectively. We  know, however, that Toyota, Honda, and Nissan kept their books open one or  two extra days for the March sales reports, shifting into that month's tally some of  the sales that occurred in April. As a  consequence, reported March sales were boosted about 1/4 million units, and April sales were cut by  the same amount. In addition, these firms had turned to  heavy advertising and generous incentives to  boost sales in  March, and some payback in  April was to be  expected. For the industry, average sales for March and April amounted to 15.1 million units at an  annual rate, the same as the average pace of  the previous six months.

Real expenditures on  durables other than motor vehicles were particularly strong in  the first quarter, with gains spread over a wide range of goods. Outlays for nondurables were boosted by increases for food and apparel. The relatively strong growth in  the durables category extended a  long-term uptrend in  their share of real PCE (see chart). Relative price movements have encouraged this movement. Indeed, on  a  nominal basis, the durables share has tended to edge down over time.

The advance report on  April retail sales suggests that real PCE for goods excluding cars and trucks was little changed from March but was well above the average for  the first quarter. Real spending for food and apparel likely continued to rise last month, offsetting declines in  real purchases of gasoline and home durable goods. In the services category of PCE, the return of  more normal seasonal temperatures probably led to a  drop in  purchases of  energy services last month; spending in  March had been boosted by colder-thanaverage temperatures.

Consumer sentiment remained upbeat in  April. Although the Michigan SRC index dipped a  bit, it remained in  the middle of  the favorable range that has prevailed since early 1994. Views on current conditions were quite positive. However, higher interest rates reportedly led to a  less favorable opinion of future business and personal financial conditions. Meanwhile, the Conference Board's index of  consumer confidence surged in  April, to the highest level in  this expansion. Views on  current and expected economic and employment conditions improved markedly. 2

Income growth remained strong in  the first quarter. The staff estimates that revised real disposable personal income grew 2.7 percent at  an  annual rate and that the revised personal saving rate averaged 4.6 percent--a bit less than in  the fourth quarter. The strike at General Motors in  March lowered first-quarter labor income a  touch, and "rental income" was held down by  transactions costs associated with a  pickup in  mortgage refinancings.

Housing Markets

Housing activity has shown little sign of succumbing yet to the run-up in  mortgage rates that began in  February. Indeed, singlefamily housing starts jumped 4  percent in  April, to 1.21 million units at an  annual rate--the highest number since 1994. The solid gains seen this year in  income and employment--and the associated bolstering of consumer confidence--may well have countered the early restraining effects of the rise in  rates.

Households evidently have noticed the rise in  interest rates: In  the April Michigan SRC survey, assessments of  homebuying conditions deteriorated, mainly in  response to  higher mortgage rates. Even so, through early May, home builders continued to

indicate that new  home sales were strong, and applications for home financing at  mortgage bankers remained fairly high.

In  the multifamily housing sector, starts ticked back up in April to just above the 300,000 mark once again. This series has been moving sideways for about a  year and a  half, at a  level that still is  fairly low  historically. Market conditions vary geographically, but the overall rental vacancy rate for multifamily housing seems to  have tilted back up--the rate exceeded year-earlier levels in  both the fourth quarter of  last year and  the first quarter of  this year. Also, the absorption rate for rental apartments edged back down in  1995 after several years of  increase.

Business Fixed Investment

After moderating in  the middle and latter part of 1995, growth in  real business fixed investment increased smartly in  the first quarter of  this year. The pickup was concentrated in spending for producers' durable equipment, which jumped 14-1/2 percent at  an annual rate.

At  least some of  the fundamentals for investment would not lead one to expect such strength. The change in  the rate of  output growth (the "accelerator") and the growth in cash flow have been shifting down for some time. Econometric models that incorporate these variables generally were not surprised by  the slowing in equipment outlays last year but failed to anticipate the firstquarter rebound. In contrast, a  third determinant, the user cost of capital for equipment, fell substantially last year. Much of  this decline was traceable to another sharp drop in  the relative price of computing equipment, but the 1995 rallies in  bond and stock markets also were a  factor. A  neoclassical investment model, in which the cost of  capital is featured prominently, shows a mean lag from the cost of capital to investment of  about three quarters. Owing in large part to a  run-up in corporate borrowing rates in 1994, this model was not surprised by  the slowdown in  PDE growth last year. Over the first half of  this year, the model is predicting a noticeable acceleration in  PDE that reflects the lagged effects of last year's decline in  the cost of  capital. However, the recent backup in  corporate borrowing rates has reduced the rate of decline in  the cost of  capital, and the model expects that this will exert a drag on equipment spending in  the latter part of this year.

Turning to  monthly indicators, new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft fell in  March, but this drop came

on  the heels of a  strong February gain. These orders, which flattened out in the second and third quarters of  last year, have since been rising. Orders for computing equipment, although quite erratic in recent months, have strengthened after a  lull in  mid1995. Business spending for computers continued to advance at  a robust pace in  the first quarter, suggesting that anecdotal reports of  weak demand from businesses were off the mark.

Business purchases of  computing equipment are being spurred by at least a  couple of factors. First, in  all segments of the market--mainframes, servers, workstations, and PCs--intense competitive pressures continue to drive prices lower. The big players (such as IBM, Compaq, and Hewlett Packard) are pushing hard to  boost market share and have shown a willingness to  absorb some shrinkage in  margins to  accomplish this. Indeed, Compaq recently announced price cuts in  the range of  25 percent for a  number of  its Pentium and Pentium Pro desktop machines. It also cut the prices on many of  its servers an average of about 10 percent. In  part, computer manufacturers are passing along to customers lower costs of components, most notably DRAM and microprocessors. A  second factor that is  boosting business demand is  an  apparent acceleration in the migration of  computing systems at  businesses to local area networks that run on software such as  Windows NT. This software only runs smoothly on  state-of-the art PCs; however, according to Intel, 80 percent of the installed base of PCs at  U.S. corporations run on processors from the older 486 generation or one of its predecessors.

Among other capital goods (excluding aircraft), new  orders flattened out, on  net, during the first half of  last year  but have trended up since then. In  the first quarter, these orders recorded a  3.7 percent gain, and backlogs rose substantially; as a consequence, shipments are likely to rise further in  the current quarter.

Spending for nonresidential structures continued to advance in the first quarter, reflecting another huge increase in  construction of  hotels and  motels. The "other commercial" sector, which has recorded strong gains during the past few  years, slowed in  the first quarter, and contracts--a forward-looking indicator of construction--have shown considerable weakness in  recent months. Office construction, which had been trending up since early 1994, fell late last year and early this year; the contracts data signal continuing weakness down the road in  this sector. Elsewhere,

outlays for industrial structures have decelerated during the past year or so, and weakness in  contracts suggests further slowing in the coming months.

Inventories

After a  one-month blip in  January--possibly reflecting disruptions related to  the blizzard--inventory accumulation in manufacturing and trade proceeded at a  slower pace in February, and stocks declined in  March as auto inventories continued to contract. While stocks remained on  the high side in  a  few areas in  March, inventory-sales ratios for  most types of  firms apparently were in the acceptable range.

In  manufacturing, inventories were little changed in  March after a  sharp run-up in January and a moderate increase in February. The slowing pace of  accumulation over the first quarter apparently reflected manufacturers' ongoing inventory correction efforts. In  a number of industries in  which inventories were thought to  be somewhat excessive earlier this year--for example, household durables, textiles, and printing and publishing--production adjustments and increased shipments helped to trim stocks in  March, pushing down inventory-sales ratios considerably. In  contrast, stocks at several materials-producing industries rose further in March, while shipments either declined or remained unchanged; further inventory adjustments at  these industries appeared to be necessary, and this process seems to have been reflected in  the April production patterns. For nondefense capital goods as a  group, inventories declined in  March after a  period of  accumulation during the past year. Unlike other industries, however, the March decline in stocks held at capital goods industries likely reflected only a momentary pause, as orders of  producers' durable equipment have, in general, remained firm in  recent months.

In  wholesale and retail trade, inventories were trimmed further in  March. Motor vehicle stocks were reduced sharply, and stocks at other wholesale and retail establishments showed only small net increases in  the aggregate. Over the first quarter, wholesale inventories excluding motor vehicles expanded at a  modest $3.6 billion annual rate, well below the pace observed over the preceding year and a  half. The stocks of  non-auto retailers rose moderately in  the first quarter, reversing the decline that had taken place in  the final quarter of 1995. The first-quarter accumulations left most wholesalers and retailers with relatively

<!-- missing-text -->

comfortable inventory positions. With only a  few exceptions, inventory-sales ratios at the end of  March were well below their most recent peaks.

Federal Sector

On  a  unified budget basis, the  Monthly Treasury Statement reported that the deficit for the first six months of the fiscal year, October through March, totaled $128 billion. When adjusted for deposit insurance, spectrum auction proceeds, and shifts in  the timing of  payments, the deficit was $140 billion, a  drop of $18 billion from the comparable period a year ago.

On  this adjusted basis, outlays in  the first six  months of  the fiscal year were only 1.7 percent above the level of  a  year earlier. Outlays have been restrained in  part by  this year's cuts in discretionary appropriations and the ongoing scaling back of defense spending. Growth of outlays for Medicaid also has slowed. Although trends in  this category can be  difficult to discern, some payoff may be emerging from states' efforts to gain better control of  their Medicaid outlays through introduction of  managed care.

Unified budget receipts have grown at a  healthy pace this fiscal year. According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, receipts from individual and social insurance taxes were 5  percent higher in the first six  months of  fiscal year 1996 than in  the comparable year-earlier period, roughly in line with the growth of  personal income. Corporate tax receipts in the first half of the current fiscal year were up 13 percent from a  year earlier, boosted by  gains in corporate profits over that period.

More recent Treasury data indicate a  substantial gain in net final settlements on 1995 tax  liabilities, as payments of nonwithheld and self-employment taxes rose sharply while refunds to individuals increased only modestly. Federal receipts of individual nonwithheld and self-employment taxes totaled $106 billion from April 1 through May 14, about $20 billion above last year's level, based on  Daily Treasury Statement data. The robust year-to-year gain in  individual nonwithheld and self-employment tax payments so far this tax season is substantially larger than the growth in income from 1994 to 1995. The strength in  these payments may  be explained in  part by  strong performance in  the capital markets last year that likely has boosted capital gains realizations. Indeed, capital gains distributions by  mutual funds surged to $55 billion in 1995 from $30 billion in 1994. Daily Treasury Statement data show

CBO BUDGET AND  ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS

Note. The projections assume that revenues and outlays for  major benefit programs evolve according to laws in effect at  the time the  projections are  made. Discretionary spending is  adjusted for inflation up  to  the statutory caps that are in effect through 1998. General purpose discretionary spending is assumed to equal the cap in  1998 and to grow from that level at  the rate of  inflation in later years. The projections include social security and the Postal Service. which are off-budget.

refund payments totaling $86 billion through the current week, a rise of $9  billion from last year. 3 This figure, however, may overstate the gains for the tax season as a whole because last year's payment pattern was distorted by  an  IRS anti-fraud initiative that resulted in a  surge of  payments during the last week of  May.

On  April 17, CBO released revised budget estimates that show a fiscal 1996 baseline deficit totaling $144 billion, an  estimate similar to  the projection released by  OMB in  March. The CBO estimate includes appropriations bills enacted through mid-April and assumes that spending levels for the remainder of  the fiscal year will be  very close to those contained in  the recently passed appropriations bill, discussed below; however, the estimate does not take account of the surprising strength of revenues in  April and early May. CBO's longer-term outlook is for deficits to rise to $171 billion in fiscal 1997 and by  about $25 billion in  each fiscal year thereafter.

Meanwhile, the President has signed an  appropriations bill that completed fiscal 1996 funding for discretionary programs whose regular appropriations had not yet been enacted. He also has signed a  farm bill, a  debt-ceiling bill, and a  bill providing for a  limited Presidential line-item veto. The farm bill sets payments to farmers that would no longer be  tightly linked to farmers' production decisions or to  market prices. It  is expected to increase outlays about $3  billion this year but schedules a  decline in  payments over the next several years that is expected to save $2  billion in total.

The debt-ceiling bill increases the statutory debt ceiling to $5.5 trillion, a  limit that is expected to allow the Treasury to fund its deficits through the end of  fiscal 1997. In addition, the bill eased the social security earnings test; the budgetary impact of  this change was offset by  tightening eligibility rules for disability benefits and dependents' benefits.

State and Local Government Sector

Real outlays for state and local consumption and gross investment are estimated to  have fallen 1.0 percent in  the first quarter. Virtually all of  the reduction reflects an  adjustment BEA made to compensation to take account of  days of  work missed by

government employees because of the severe winter weather. Notably, this is  the first time BEA  decided to make this type of  adjustment to state and local spending, although the agency has routinely made weather-related, or  furlough-related, adjustments to federal compensation. BEA assumed that education and noneducation employees affected by  the blizzard were out two to three days during the quarter and that the teachers and support staff will be  making up the days in  the second quarter. The days for other government workers are assumed to be  lost permanently. Overall, real state and local consumption spending fell 1.1 percent in  the first quarter. Meanwhile, real gross investment also declined a  little as construction spending edged down, the first decline in two years.

Despite the reduction in government consumption in  the first quarter, the state and local surplus, excluding social insurance funds, appears to have fallen a  little. A  downward trend in  this measure has been evident during the past few quarters, as growth in aggregate government expenditures has exceeded gains in revenues. Prices

Incoming price data since the last Greenbook have been dominated by  developments in  energy and agriculture. A  surge in energy prices in  April accounted for more than half of  the 0.4 percent rise in  the total CPI. In  agriculture, grain prices have climbed further in  recent weeks, and although retail food prices have grown only moderately this year, recent developments seem to point to  a  greater risk of  large food price increases down the road. Prices outside of  food and energy rose just slightly in April, and core CPI inflation remained well below 3  percent on a twelve-month basis.

In the energy sector, spot prices of  crude oil and some petroleum products have recently dropped back from earlier highs. The price of  West Texas intermediate, for example, has averaged a little above $21 per barrel in  May  after peaking at  more than $25 dollars per  barrel in  early April. In  addition, survey data suggest that, on  a  seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of gasoline should rise much less rapidly this month. Stocks remain tight for both crude oil and the  major petroleum products, but futures prices continue to point to some further easing of  oil and product prices over the remainder of  the year.

In agricultural markets, the futures price of  wheat for  May delivery (Kansas City basis) has moved up about 40 percent since the

March Greenbook, and futures prices of  corn for May delivery have advanced about 30 percent. This past year, both domestic users and foreign buyers have shown limited elasticity in  their demand, with popular analyses noting the higher fixed costs of current American meat production technologies and rapidly growing food consumption in emerging economies. Inventories of both corn and  wheat are extremely tight, and the prospects for rebuilding wheat stocks have been dimmed by  drought in  the central and southern plains. The corn crop is  still being planted, and the critical growing months lie ahead. As of  mid-May, futures prices for corn were considerably lower than spot prices, a  reflection of  traders' expectations of  a somewhat better supply-demand balance following this year's harvest. In other farm  markets, soybean prices have recently been pushed higher by spillover from the grain markets. Livestock prices have been mixed: The  prices of  hogs and poultry have been firming and are  well above year-earlier levels, but cattle prices have been weak.

Price increases for food at the consumer level have been quite moderate in  the face of surging grain prices. The CPI for food was up 0.3 percent in  April and, on  balance, rose only moderately over the first four months of  the year; the twelve-month change was 2.6 percent. The index for fruit and vegetable prices rose 1.0 percent in  April, capping the much larger increase of  the previous month. However, increases in  cereals prices remained small, and the price index for  meats, poultry, fish, and eggs edged down. Clearer evidence of  the pass-through of grain prices to the retail level probably will emerge in  many of these categories over the course of  the summer.

The consumer price index excluding food and energy increased 0.1 percent in  April after three months of  somewhat larger increases. Prices for goods turned down in  April after jumping 0.4 percent in  March. The swing was shaped largely by  monthly ups and downs in  the prices of apparel, tobacco, and used cars. New  car prices increased 0.1 percent in  both March and  April. Prices for non-energy services posted a  0.3 percent gain last month after a 0.2 percent rise in  March. Auto finance charges--which had dropped sharply earlier in  the year in response to automaker incentives-edged up in  both March and  April.

showed little net change over the first four months of 1996 but is up 1.8 percent from a  year earlier. The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy continued to  edge down in  April, with few  signs that indirect effects of  the rise in  energy prices might be affecting price setting for other products. Price indexes for industrial commodities have been mixed since the March Greenbook, with the Journal of  Commerce index little changed and the KR-CRB spot price index for industrial products moving up somewhat.

Recent survey data on consumers' expectations of  year-ahead inflation have been mixed. Mean expected inflation over the next twelve months jumped to 4.5 percent in  April's Michigan Survey of consumers, 1/4 percentage point above the March level and 1/2 percentage point above the level at  the beginning of  the year. This series is quite volatile and has tended to  be  higher than actual inflation over the last five years--a period when inflation has been low  and stable. Median expected inflation--which is influenced less by  outliers in  the sample and, thus, is less volatile--rose less in  the April sample; the April reading of 3.0 percent was about where it has been over the past year. Labor Costs

The trend in growth of  hourly compensation appears to  have held fairly steady through the first part of 1996. As  measured by  the employment cost index (ECI), hourly compensation of private industry workers increased at  an  annual rate of  2.9 percent in  the first quarter, essentially the same rate of  increase as  over the previous twelve months. ECI compensation growth was held down by  a  small decline in  benefit costs. In contrast, wages and salaries shot up at a  4.6 percent annual rate, up from  a  2.8 percent rise in 1995 and the largest increase in five years. Wage growth in  the first quarter was particularly rapid for white collar workers and employees in  the retail trade and services industries. Sales workers, who account for approximately 11 percent of  the ECI sample, had the sharpest acceleration in  wages and salaries.

The reported decline in  benefit costs in  the first quarter seems to confirm our earlier suspicion that the fourth-quarter jump in  benefits was caused, at  least in  part, by  late collection of  the data that resulted from the government shutdown. In completing their survey forms, companies are asked to  indicate if  any unscheduled changes have been made in  benefits since the last quarterly survey, and some changes that normally would have been

reported for  the first quarter may have been  misallocated to the fourth quarter of  last year. The average rate of  change in benefits over the two quarters was about 1-1/2 percent at an  annual rate, suggesting that businesses are continuing to  meet with considerable success in  their efforts to gain control of  this part of  their labor costs.

In  previous Greenbooks, we  have also called attention to the possibility that with labor markets tight, workers might eventually start to gain back through faster increases in  hourly wages some of the shortfall of  compensation growth that has come about as a  result of  the restraint on  benefit costs. Although the first-quarter jump in  wages certainly is consistent with such an  outcome, some caution in  interpreting the data is also in order. The earnings of  sales workers, which were an  important element in  the first-quarter stepup of  wage growth, are quite volatile and perhaps should be discounted in assessing underlying trends. Moreover, separate data on  average hourly earnings suggest that, at  most, the pickup in  wage growth is occurring quite gradually. For the twelve months ended in April, average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on  nonfarm payrolls moved up 3.1 percent, no faster than the rise during the previous twelve-month period.

Productivity in  the nonfarm business sector increased sharply in the first quarter. The 2.6 percent rate of increase offset the surprising 1.0 percent decline in  the fourth quarter and put the four-quarter change at 1.6 percent. BLS adjusted the growth of hours upward 3/4 percentage point from  what a  literal reading of the blizzard-affected numbers would have said, so  the estimated productivity change is probably a  reasonable approximation of reality--assuming, of  course, that revisions to  output growth are no larger than we  currently are anticipating.

The decision to leave short-term rates unchanged at  the March FOMC meeting was widely anticipated and had little immediate market impact. Judging by  quotes on  federal funds futures at  that time, market participants still expected that the next System policy move would be  an  easing. However, sentiment shifted with the accumulation of  evidence showing the economy to  have considerable forward momentum. At  present, market expectations tilt in  the direction of  a  modest tightening later this year.

The shift in  outlook has pushed up intermediateand long-term Treasury rates 25 to  40  basis points. The thirty-year Treasury yield crossed 7  percent for the first time in a  year, before easing back in  recent days. Most private-sector rates have moved up  with Treasuries, although rates on  lower-rated corporate bonds have risen less. Major stock price indexes, apart from  the  Dow, increased over the intermeeting period; the NYSE composite was up 2  percent, and the NASDAQ composite jumped about 13 percent, an  increase reflecting renewed enthusiasm for technology stocks.

Total nonfederal debt growth appears to  have remained moderate in recent months. In  the household sector, consumer credit growth slowed a  bit in  the first quarter, while net mortgage borrowing probably continued near the pace of  last year. Responding to  higher long-term rates, gross bond issuance by  nonfinancial corporations has fallen off recently, but this drop-off has been offset partly by greater short-term borrowing. Gross issuance of  long-term debt by state and local governments also has edged off from late last year.

Federal borrowing, after a  first-quarter pickup, has dropped back sharply in  the current quarter and  might have been weaker still had  the Treasury anticipated the full dimension of  recent tax receipts.

Money and  Bank Credit

M2  and M3 growth slowed sharply in  April after an  unusually strong increase in  March (table). Both aggregates expanded at  more than a  10 percent annual rate in  March and  then decelerated to a  2 percent rate in  April. With the recent slowing, both aggregates have moved to around the upper bounds of  their respective annual ranges.

The deceleration of  the broad monetary aggregates in  April may reflect the rise in  market interest rates in  recent months, which has increased the opportunity cost of  holding deposits. Moreover, variability in  the size and timing of  tax  payments is always a potential source of  erratic M2  behavior in  the spring. This year the weekly pattern of  M2 suggests that growth may have been damped in  April by  unusually large personal tax  payments, though in past years large payments have usually boosted M2 growth as  deposits built up in  advance of  payments.

Ml continues to  be  pulled down by sweep activity. In addition, initial demand for the redesigned hundred dollar bill, introduced at the end of  March, has proved to  be  less than expected, and currency growth has been sluggish.

After contracting in  March, bank credit increased at a  6 percent rate in  April on  the strength of  bank lending and a  leveling off of securities holdings (table). The March decline--the first since July 1991--was due in  part to  the backup in interest rates, which reduced the market value of  bank securities portfolios and off-balance-sheet positions in  derivatives. Adjusted for this effect, bank credit was flat in  March and rose at a 7-1/2 percent annual rate in  April.

The  April pickup in  lending was paced by a turnaround in business loans, an  increase that may have reflected a  shift to short-term financing in  response to the rise in long-term rates. On balance, however, business loans in  the past two months have been somewhat weak even as lenders remain accommodative. According to the  May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, underwriting standards for business loans were unchanged from January, while lenders, on net, continued to ease terms a  bit.

Real estate loan growth remained sluggish in  April, likely because of  the continued high fixed-rate share of  new  home mortgages, which banks tend to  securitize. The tendency to sell off fixed-rate loans may  well mask healthy underlying demand for mortgage loans to purchase homes; indeed, the  May loan officer survey indicates that demand for such loans has been  higher in  the past three months than in  the previous three months. In  contrast, the  demand for commercial real estate loans was little changed, on net, according to the survey.

While consumer lending appeared strong in  April, much of  the increase was due to a  sizable acquisition of  credit card receivables

by  one bank. Taking out this acquisition, consumer lending (adjusted for securitization) grew  at  an  annual rate of  only about 5 percent last month, down significantly from  March. For  the year to date, consumer lending at  banks, with the  adjustment for the  April acquisition and securitizations, expanded at  a  12 percent annual rate, down from  the 16-1/2 percent advance recorded last year.

While we  doubt that it  was the  major factor in  the  recent slowing in  consumer loan growth, tighter lending standards may  have played some role. On  net, about 20  percent of  the respondents to the May  loan officer survey reported having tightened standards for approving credit card applications, and about 10 percent reported having tightened standards for other consumer installment loans.

Mutual Funds

Long-term mutual funds posted the largest quarterly inflow on record in  the first quarter, with stock funds accounting for more than 80  percent of  the total (table). Preliminary data for  April suggest that heavy flows into stock funds continued, while flows into bond funds slowed markedly. Flows into bond funds have been primarily to the income and junk bond categories, funds for  which returns are most closely linked to those on equities. Industry participants report that the strong mutual fund inflows this year have been mostly related to retirement accounts.

Although dollar inflows to stock funds are at record levels, net sales as  a  percentage of  fund assets show more moderate growth (chart, middle panel). Moreover, mutual fund inflows may overstate household demand for equities. Flow of  funds data indicate that, in 1995, sales by  households of  direct holdings of  corporate equity exceeded purchases of  mutual funds by $50 billion. Preliminary data for the first quarter indicate that households continue to be  net sellers of  equity. A  good share of  the liquidation in  direct holdings may  have been driven by  corporate repurchase and  merger activity.

Holdings of  cash and short-term securities in  stock funds fell to 7 percent by  the  end of  March from nearly 8  percent at the end of 1995 (chart, bottom panel). The lower liquidity ratio may reflect competitive pressures to be fully invested, as cash holdings have proved an  impediment to  performance in  the ongoing bull market.

Business Finance

The increase in long-term rates has continued to  damp bond issuance by  nonfinancial corporations (table and chart). Gross public issuance in  April and early May was about a  third below the first-quarter pace, with the most pronounced falloff at  investmentgrade firms; lower-rated firms eased back their issuance in  April but still found the  market a  fairly attractive source of  funding. With the  backup in  rates, short-term financing has gained some favor, and  the volume of  nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding has moved up  briskly--bolstered by  merger financing.

Boosted by  a  spike in  initial public offerings, equity issuance by  nonfinancial corporations jumped in  April to a  record level (table). Rising stock prices and strong investor demand has increased the pace of  gross equity offerings (chart). Issuance in May  should remain healthy, judging from  the steady flow  of registrations of  new offerings with the SEC.

On  net, however, nonfinancial corporations have continued to retire equity. Announced stock buybacks by  nonfinancial firms in the first quarter jumped to $28 billion, the highest quarterly pace since the late 1980s. Unlike the  buybacks at  that time, current activity is  concentrated at profitable companies with excess cash on their balance sheets and is not  being financed by  borrowing. Based on the announcements, completed repurchases in  the first quarter, at an annual rate, are estimated to  have been about a  third above the high volume for the year 1995.

The ongoing merger wave also resulted in  substantial share retirements in  the first quarter. In addition, several blockbuster deals were announced over the intermeeting period, the two largest involving the consolidation of  some "Baby Bell" telephone companies permitted by  the recently approved telecommunication bill. However, virtually all of  the recently announced megamergers are structured as stock swaps and thus will not result in equity retirements.

Since the last FOMC meeting, the NASDAQ composite index has risen more than 13 percent, as  investor enthusiasm for  technology and small-cap stocks resurfaced (chart). Other broad equity indexes have risen by  much less--about 2  percent, but still have significantly outperformed bonds. Stock prices received some support from  the strong first-quarter earnings reports which pointed to a  small uptick in  the four-quarter growth rate (chart, middle left panel). However, analysts do  not expect particularly robust

earnings growth in  the near term, and the ratio of  current price to expected year-ahead S&amp;P 500 earnings remains high. Looking out further, analysts have been raising their estimates of longer-term profit growth, likely buoying stock prices (chart, middle right panel).

With earnings continuing to  be strong, various indicators show that the credit quality of  nonfinancial firms has remained solid, except for some slippage in  the retail sector. In  the first quarter, Moody's downgraded somewhat more nonfinancial debt than it upgraded, but K  Mart and WalMart accounted for  most of  the net downgrade; at quarter-end, nonfinancial debt on review at  Moody's for a  possible downgrade about equalled that on review for an upgrade. In  addition, first-quarter data indicate that the default rate of  junk bonds fell below one percent, less than  half the rate in 1995. The small losses seemed to reassure investors, as spreads on  high-yield debt over Treasuries have now  retraced the entire rise posted last year (chart); spreads on investment-grade bonds have edged lower since the last FOMC meeting. Business failures, a broader measure of  stress that also covers firms with no public debt outstanding, fell about a  third in  the first quarter after a  fourthquarter spike, and are only slightly above levels in  1994 and 1995.

Household Sector Finance

Home mortgage rates have increased substantially over the intermeeting period. In  line with the overall movement of  the yield curve, the average contract rates on thirty-year, fixed rate mortgages rose more than 40  basis points, to  8-1/4 percent, and ARMs indexed to  the one-year Treasury constant maturity rose 20 basis points (chart, upper panel). Thus, the FRM-ARM initial rate spread moved up  to  244 basis points, the widest spread since the end of 1994. Nevertheless, data through March indicate borrowers continue to favor fixed-rate financing (chart, middle panel).

Despite the rise in rates, mortgage purchase applications for home purchases remained relatively elevated. The refinancing index, however, declined further, on  net, over the period and is  now less than half the peak level reached in  mid-February (chart, lower panel).

Consumer installment credit grew  at  an annual rate of 7-1/4 percent in  March, about half the rate of  increase in February (table). For the first quarter as a  whole, consumer installment credit advanced at  an 11-1/2 percent annual rate, off about

1  percentage point from  the fourth-quarter pace and 2  percentage points from  the rise for all of  1995. The slowing of  growth last quarter was concentrated in  the auto credit component; growth of revolving credit picked up  to  a  16 percent rate in  the first quarter but remained below the average pace last year. As  noted, commercial bank data for April point to subdued consumer credit growth last month.

Only limited information about consumer loan quality has become available since the last Greenbook. Delinquencies on  auto loans at captive finance companies in the first quarter moved down slightly-the first decline in  two years--from historically high levels. The Moody's monthly index of  delinquencies on  credit card loans in securitized pools increased in  both January and February, reaching a two-year high, although it is still well below the peak in  the early 1990s. In  the May loan officer survey, more than a  quarter of  the banks, on  net, noted that consumer loan delinquency rates in  the past six  months were higher than they had expected. On  balance, respondents to the survey expect a  further rise in delinquencies over the coming year.

Despite some concern about rising household debt levels, issuance of  credit-card-backed securities remained quite strong this year. Concerns in  the asset-backed market have centered on  the credit card programs of  a  few, relatively small private-label retailers, which account for a  minuscule proportion of  the $150 billion market. Bank issuers continue to obtain the  highest ratings. Even with the  vastly increased supply of  credit-cardbacked paper in  1995 and 1996, spreads against comparable maturity Treasuries have remained at or  near historic lows.

Treasury and Agency Financing

The  debt ceiling impasse came to an  end in  March after Congress raised the national debt limit by  $600 billion to $5.5 trillion. This increase is expected to sustain normal deficit financing and trust fund issues through at least the third quarter of  1997, perhaps a  few  months more. The six-month impasse resulted in  some disruptions to  the  timing and size of  auctions but, on  balance, probably did not add substantially to  issuance costs as  market participants apparently discounted the possibility of  debt default.

During the current quarter, the stronger-than-expected inflow of  federal tax receipts is projected to  result in  a  budget surplus of  $52 billion (table). The surplus likely will generate the

first quarterly paydown of  marketable Treasury debt since 1981, and at the same time, will enable the  Treasury to  replenish its cash balance.

At  its midquarter refunding, the Treasury announced a  new auction schedule to  better align its longer-term borrowing with its greater seasonal borrowing requirements in  the second half of  the year. The  new schedule includes two extra auctions of  the ten-year note and one extra auction of  the  thirty-year bond. Because the Treasury intends to  decrease the size of  the  ten-year and thirtyyear securities auctions somewhat, it does not expect the average maturity of  the outstanding debt to  increase. There appeared to  be little market reaction to  the announcement.

The Treasury also announced that it  intends to  issue inflationindexed bonds in  a multiyear experiment that could reduce Treasury financing costs. Precise terms of  the new  bonds have not yet been set, and the  Treasury is seeking comments from potential investors. These bonds will be  issued in  small denominations and are expected to  be  purchased largely for retirement accounts by  buyers who want to  hedge against inflation.

Agency financing slowed considerably in  the first quarter, and preliminary indications are that net borrowing remained light over the intermeeting period (table). Higher rates have reduced new issues and virtually halted refinancing as agencies have less incentive to call outstanding debt. Spreads on  primary debt and in secondary markets remained stable.

Municipal Bonds

Long-term municipal debt offerings in  April about matched the first-quarter pace but  were off from  the fourth-quarter rate when issuers took advantage of  nearly two-year lows in  long-term rates (table). With retirements continuing to  outpace new  offerings, the volume of  tax-exempt debt has remained on a  downward path. The forward calendar of  new  issues looks weak, which may  help explain why  yields on long-term municipal bonds have risen less than proportionately to  those on  comparable Treasuries since the beginning of  April (chart, middle panel).

Quality spreads on  long-term municipal bonds have changed little on  net since 1994, though the spreads remain a  bit wider than over the preceding few  years (chart, bottom panel). Greater demand for the  highest-quality debt--as evidenced in  the rising portion of

APPENDIX

THE  MAY SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON  BANK LENDING PRACTICES

The  May 1996 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices posed questions about changes in  bank lending standards and terms, changes in  loan demand by  businesses and  households, and delinquency rates on  consumer loans.

The survey results show that bank lending standards were generally unchanged to  a  bit tighter compared with three months ago. Lending standards for business loans to customers of  all sizes were about unchanged, on  net. Standards for residential mortgages were also little changed, while those for commercial real estate loans were tightened by  a modest number of respondents. Standards for credit card accounts and other consumer installment loans were tightened on net, although banks reported no  change in  their willingness to make consumer loans.

On  the whole, banks were less stringent with respect to loan terms than lending standards. The respondents continued to ease business loan terms, on  net, while terms on  consumer loans were little changed.

Demand for bank loans by  households and firms was generally reported to  be stronger than it  had been three months earlier. Demand for business loans was stronger for customers of  all sizes, although more banks noted an increase in  demand by  small and  mediumsized firms than by  large firms. Demand for commercial real estate loans changed little, on  net. Household credit demands increased, with a  significant share of  banks reporting stronger demand for residential mortgages and a  smaller fraction noting a  pickup in demand for consumer installment loans.

Responses to special questions on  consumer loan delinquencies suggest that a  significant number of  banks have been surprised by the size of  the recent run-up in  consumer loan delinquencies. A large share of  the respondents expect a  further rise in delinquencies over the coming year.

Commercial and Industrial Loans

The May  survey found that standards for approving commercial and industrial loans other than those for  mergers and acquisitions were about unchanged over the previous three months for borrowers of all sizes. Lending standards had tightened, on  net, in  the January survey, the first net tightening in  three years.

Despite the stability in  lending standards, both the domestic and foreign respondents reported some net easing of  business loan terms. The largest number of  banks reported having cut spreads of loan rates over base rates. Other terms, including maximum credit line sizes, credit line costs, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements, were also eased by  some banks. A  bigger fraction of the domestic respondents generally reported having eased loan terms for large corporate customers than reported doing so for small and middle-market firms.

The institutions that reported having eased standards or  terms attributed the easing to increased competition from other banks and,

to a  lesser extent, from  nonbank lenders. The domestic respondents that had tightened either standards or  terms attributed the move primarily to  a  reduction in  their banks' tolerance for risk. In addition, both the domestic and foreign respondents that tightened standards or  terms pointed to a  less favorable economic outlook and a  worsening of  industry-specific problems.

A  significant number of  domestic respondents, on  net, reported stronger demand for  business loans by  small and middle-market businesses, while a  considerably smaller net number reported stronger demand by  large corporate firms. Branches and agencies of foreign banks reported little net change in  demand. Changes in demand were generally attributed to  fluctuations in  customers' investment in  inventories and in  plant and equipment or, in  the case of  larger firms, to fluctuations in  merger and acquisition funding needs. In addition, a number of  banks noted that demand weakened as customers shifted funding to  other sources.

Commercial Real Estate

Several domestic banks, on  net, reported having tightened standards for commercial real estate lending, while the foreign respondents reported no changes in such standards. The domestic responses indicated little net change in  the  demand for commercial real estate loans, although a  few  more of  the foreign respondents reported a  pickup than reported a  decline.

Lending to  Households

Standards for approving residential mortgage applications were little changed, on  net, in  the May survey. Demand for such loans had increased at a  significant share of  respondents, however, likely reflecting the strength in  the housing market.

On  balance, about 20 percent of  the respondents indicated that they had  tightened standards for approving new  credit card applications. A  smaller share, about 10 percent, had tightened standards for non-credit-card installment loans. These shares are a little smaller than  those reported in  the  January survey. As in January, however, consumer loan terms were little changed, on balance. In  the May survey a few  banks reported having tightened credit limits on credit card accounts and  maximum maturities on  noncredit-card installment loans, but a  few  also cut spreads over market rates on  non-credit-card loans. On  net, the banks' willingness to make consumer installment loans was unchanged in  the latest survey, the  first time since 1991 that the respondents did not report a  net increase in  willingness to  make such loans. Nonetheless, following several years of  efforts to  boost consumer lending, banks' consumer lending policies likely remain accommodative.

The respondents reported a  small net increase in  demand for consumer installment loans in  the last three months relative to  the previous three months. This increase follows a  small net decline in the January survey.

The tightening of  lending standards for consumer loans may reflect, in  part, a  response to  the rise in  delinquency rates on such loans in recent quarters. The responses to  special questions on  the May survey dealing with consumer loan delinquencies indicate that more than a  quarter of  the respondents, on  net, were surprised

by the size of  the increase in  delinquency rates. By contrast, last November, when a  similar question was included in  the survey, only about 10 percent of  the respondents, on  net, indicated that the  rise in  delinquency rates had been worse than expected. About half of the respondents on  the  May survey expected a  further increase in delinquencies over the coming year, while only a  sixth expected a decrease. The banks attributed their concern about future delinquency rates to  increased household debt burdens and a  greater willingness of  households to declare bankruptcy.

A final special question asked for  the reasons for the recent increase in  the  pace of  consumer loan securitizations. The respondents attributed the rise to a  higher level of  demand for consumer loans than  their bank  was willing to hold on its books and to their bank's improved ability to do securitizations. To a  lesser degree, the  banks also attributed the rise to the capital markets becoming more receptive to  securities backed by consumer loans and to the increased cost of  funding consumer loans on  their bank's balance sheet.

The level of exports of  goods and services in  January-February was about the same as in  the fourth quarter of  1995. Sizeable increases in  exports of  services, computers, agricultural products (mostly grains), and automotive products (other than to  Mexico) were about offset by  declines in exports of  industrial supplies and machinery.

In  January-February, imports grew by  more than 2  percent, after declining 1  percent in  the previous quarter. Imports of automotive products and consumer goods rebounded in  the first two months of  the year from depressed levels in  the second half of last year. Imports of  non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods (other than computers and semiconductors) posted modest gains in January-February after slumping last year.

Oil Imports

The quantity of  imported oil in  the first quarter is estimated to have been about the same as the fourth-quarter level, as a  strong increase in  oil consumption was offset by  a  larger-than-normal seasonal drawdown in  oil inventories. Preliminary Department of

Energy statistics indicate that April imports are likely to  have increased due to  a  buildup in  oil inventories.

The price of  imported oil increased substantially in  the first quarter, owing mostly to  a hefty jump in  the  March import price--the largest monthly increase since May 1994. Spot WTI rose more than $2.00 per barrel in  April, averaging $23.57 per barrel. Prices have fallen back somewhat and are  trading near $21.00 per barrel. Prices have been kept firm this year because of  unusually cold weather in North America and Japan, weather-related production disruptions in the  North Sea and Australia, and several disruptions in  refinery production. Prices have also been unusually volatile because inventories are reportedly at very low levels--on April 15, the spot WTI jumped to  more than $25 per barrel in intraday trading. Refiners have been reluctant to  build inventories because of concerns that future oil prices could decline sharply if  negotiations between Iraq and the United Nations for a  limited oil sale result in  an additional 700.000 barrels per day of  oil on  world markets.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports decreased 1 percent in  the first quarter of 1996, following a  similar decline in  the fourth quarter of 1995. The largest declines were in  the prices of imported computers, while food prices also posted sharp declines, owing mostly to  a  drop in  beverage prices.

Prices of  exports increased modestly in  the first quarter, with sharp increases in  agricultural export prices (primarily grain prices) more than accounting for the increase; agricultural export prices have risen substantially since early 1995 in  response to robust world demand, disappointing harvests abroad last year, and poor prospects for U.S. harvests in  1996. Prices of  nonagricultural exports continued to  fall, reflecting continued declines in  prices of  industrial supplies and computers. U.S. International Financial Transactions

At  almost $52 billion, the  first-quarter accumulation of foreign official reserve assets in  the  United States was almost half of  the record total in  1995. (See line 1  of  the Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table.) The large increase was divided almost equally between the  G-10 and other, non-OPEC countries, with

most of  the G-10 change associated with exchange market intervention. Countries outside the G-10 showing significant increases in  the first quarter were Spain, Brazil, Singapore and Thailand. Information on  foreign official holdings at the FRBNY suggest that changes in  April were small for the G-10 countries, but continued to  be sizable for Spain.

Foreign net purchases of  U.S. securities (line 4)  and U.S. net purchases of  foreign securities (line 5)  continued in  the first quarter at or above 1995's high rates. Although private net purchases of  U.S. Treasury securities were small (line 4a), there were large increases in  the holdings of  U.S. agency bonds ($14 billion, included in line 4b). New  Eurobond issues continued to  be an  important component of  line 4b in  the first quarter, with approximately a  third of  these issues denominated in  foreign currencies. In  April, new  Eurobond issues declined somewhat from the  very strong first quarter pace and the foreign currency percentage rose to 45 percent of  the  total volume.

U.S. net purchases of  both foreign stocks and bonds were strong in  the first quarter, with purchases of  foreign stocks especially heavy (lines 5a  and 5b). Almost $12 billion of  net stock purchases were from Asian residents, with $8  billion from Japan. Aside from $1  billion of  net bond purchases from Mexico, there were only minimal changes in  U.S. holdings in  Latin America (outside the Caribbean).

Banks showed substantial net capital outflows in the first quarter on  an  end-of-month basis (line 3). Monthly average data, however, showed little change in  the net claims of  U.S. banks on their own foreign offices and IBFs in  the first quarter, and a modest net outflow in  April (line 1  of  the International Banking Data table).

Foreign Exchange Markets

The  weighted-average value of  the dollar in terms of  the other G-10 currencies has risen 2  percent since the  March 26 FOMC  meeting. The dollar strengthened 4  percent against the mark, and by  lesser amounts against most other European currencies. Against the yen, the dollar appreciated 1/4 percent on  balance.

The dollar strengthened against the mark amid signs of  renewed economic strength in  the United States that may  have been seen by some market participants as increasing the likelihood of  tighter U.S. monetary policy in  the  near term. In  contrast, continued weak growth in  Germany heightened market expectations of  further German monetary easing. The  Bundesbank reinforced these expectations by reducing its official rates by  1/2 percentage point on  April 18. However, it  refrained from reducing its repo rate which remained fixed at  3.30 percent, the rate that has  prevailed since February 7. In addition, statements in April by  various Bundesbank officials, who said that they would not be  displeased if  the  mark weakened further, were seen as supporting the dollar against the  mark.

The dollar declined against the yen in  April against the backdrop of  strengthening economic activity in  Japan and  market commentary that Japanese monetary authorities would tighten monetary policy in  the near-term. However, the dollar rebounded against the yen  in  mid-May following statements by  Japanese officials that Japanese monetary policy would need to remain accommodative to insure that the fledgling economic recovery in  Japan becomes selfsustaining.

In  most G-10 countries, 3-month interest rates declined or changed little over the intermeeting period. In  Italy, short-term interest rates fell significantly as lira strength, which followed in  the  wake of  the  center-left victory in  the general elections on April 21, allowed the Bank of  Italy to  guide short-term market rates lower. Short-term interest rates declined in  Canada, France, the Netherlands, and Sweden following reductions in  policy rates in those countries. In  Japan, 3-month interest rates were essentially unchanged as Japanese monetary authorities remained accommodative in their money market operations. The  Japanese call-money rate

continued to  trade at  1/2 percent, the rate that has prevailed since September when the Bank of Japan reduced its discount rate to 1/2 percent.

Long-term interest rates were little changed in most European countries, where economic  growth remained anemic. The yield on the 10-year  government bellwether bond  in Italy dropped 1 percentage point due largely to diminished political uncertainty following the general  elections. Long-term Canadian interest rates  rose, though by less than U.S. long-term rates, as  economic  prospects in  Canada appeared to have brightened.

Since the March 26 FOMC meeting, the Mexican peso has appreciated 1-1/2  percent against the dollar as  inflationary fears in Mexico have receded. On May 1, Mexican authorities placed $1.75 billion of a 30-year global bond that was exchanged  for a face value of  $2.4 billion of Brady bonds that would have expired  in 23 years. At the time of  issue, the yield spread of the global bond over the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was 5-1/2  percentage points. (On a stripped basis, the Brady bonds yielded  6 percentage points more than comparable U.S. Treasury securities.) By retiring the Brady bonds,  the Mexican government obtained access to collateral  valued at more than $500 million.

The Desk did  not intervene  in the foreign exchange market over the intermeeting period.

Developments in Foreign Industrial  Countries

The pace of economic  activity in continental Europe remains generally weak, with Germany sluggish after probably having contracted further in the first quarter,  Italy stagnant,  and France showing signs  of only modest  recovery from a fourth-quarter decline. The United Kingdom and Canada appear to be  extending modest  rates of expansion, and recent data for Japan suggest a continuation of growth somewhat  in excess of the potential rate.

Inflationary pressures  remain subdued. Recent consumer price inflation has averaged close to 2 percent or less in Germany, France, and Canada, and just under 3 percent in the United Kingdom. Italian inflation is higher but has slowed  considerably since January. In Japan, prices  rose slightly after falling for more than a year.

Individual country notes. Available indicators in Japan for the first quarter, including industrial production, machinery orders, and housing starts, point to  further economic recovery. After reaching a  postwar high of  3.4 percent in  January, the unemployment rate declined to  3.1 percent in  March.

Following more than a year of  deflation, both wholesale prices and the CPI for the  Tokyo area moved up  in  April from their levels 12 months earlier. This increase was entirely due to  the effect of yen depreciation on  import prices, as  wholesale prices of domestically produced goods fell 1.0 percent in  the 12  months through April. The  Japan Real Estate Institute announced that land prices in  six  major urban areas declined a  further 5.4 percent in the six  months through March. This was the ninth consecutive sixmonth decline in  land prices. Land prices have fallen about 50 percent since their peak in  1991.

<!-- missing-text -->

- 3.  Percent change from  previous year.

The  merchandise trade surplus declined to  a  five-year low  of $66 billion (SAAR) in  the first quarter, down from $90 billion in the previous quarter and $107 billion for 1995 as a  whole. The current account surplus was $62 billion (SAAR) in  the first quarter, down from $94 billion in  the previous quarter and $111 billion for 1995 as a  whole.

On  May 10, the Diet formally approved the  budget for the fiscal year that began on  April 1. Central government expenditures are  projected to  be  nearly 8  percent lower than the final outcome for FY1995. (Published reports have focused on  a  measure of  spending that includes redemptions of  national bonds, which implies expenditures that are only 4  percent lower than the final total for FY1995.)

It appears likely that real activity in  Germany contracted in the  first quarter. The unemployment rate (SA) rose sharply to average 10.3 percent, and remained at that level in  April. Although industrial production experienced a  modest rise in  March, it  was still below its level in  January and at any  time in 1995. The six German research institutes and the Council of  Economic Experts (the "Five Wise Men") lowered earlier projections for real growth this year to a  range of  1/2 to 3/4 percent, about in  line with the government's revised official assessment. Despite the  downward revisions, forecasts continue to  project a  pick-up in  real economic activity in  the near term. A  jump in  output is  expected in the second quarter, as construction and other weather-sensitive sectors experience a  rebound after the  unseasonably cold winter.

On  April 26, Chancellor Kohl presented a  package of  budget measures designed to reduce spending in  1997 by  DM  70  billion ($47 billion), divided about equally among cuts at the federal level, at the state and local level, and in  the social security system. The budget's proposed two-year wage freeze for public sector workers and reduction in  paid sick leave has prompted the union of  public sector workers to  threaten strike action and  warning strikes have erupted. The  announcement of  the  program also has provoked strong opposition from the Social Democrats, who still hold a  majority of  the seats in the  upper house of  the federal parliament and must ratify any measures that affect the states.

The outcome of  state parliamentary elections on  March 24  in three German states was generally favorable to  Chancellor Kohl's ruling coalition and unfavorable to  the opposition Social Democrats

(SPD). A strengthening in  support for  the Free Democratic Party was coupled with a  loss of support for the SPD, weakening the SPD majority in  the upper house of  federal parliament.

In  France, monthly indicators suggest that economic activity grew  only moderately in  the first quarter after factoring in  some bounceback in  production following the public sector strikes late last year. Industrial production rose in  January and February, but not enough to  keep the unemployment rate from rising further in  the

first quarter. First-quarter business confidence surveys suggest that output was weak amid continued inventory correction, although confidence about future output has begun to  strengthen. Real consumption of  manufactured products in  February and March fell back from the sharp rise of  January that in  part reflected a  strikerebound effect. Consumer confidence dipped in  April after remaining unchanged throughout the  first quarter at a  very low level. Consumer price inflation accelerated slightly in  March and April largely due to  higher food and energy prices and a  pick-up in  the prices of  manufactured products.

In the  United Kingdom, preliminary data show that real GDP rose 1.6 percent (SAAR) in  the first quarter. Available data on activity to date in 1996 are mixed. Industrial output picked up  in February and March, reversing January's decline. However, according to  the  April Purchasing Managers' Survey, indexes for manufacturing output and new  orders continued to decline. Interest-sensitive sectors are showing more positive signs. The same April survey showed robust growth in the consumer durable manufacturing sector. The  housing market also appears to  be  strengthening as  mortgage approvals in  the first quarter were the  highest since early 1991.

<!-- missing-text -->

Targeted inflation, measured as  the change from a  year earlier in  retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments, has  been little changed through April from the fourth-quarter average of 2.9 percent. April producer input prices edged up  due to  a  rise in  oil and food prices.

Newly revised and rebased GDP data for Italy show that business fixed investment expanded 7.7 percent last year and contributed more to  GDP growth than had  been indicated in  earlier statistics. The  new  data also show  that GDP growth for the  year as a  whole was about 2.3 percent (Q4/Q4), but GDP declined 3.6 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter largely due to  a  sharp drop in  exports and reduced government expenditure. The slow performance at the  end of  last year appears to  have continued into the first quarter. Following a  sharp drop in  January, industrial production declined again in  February.

On  balance, news on  Italian inflation has been encouraging. The 12-month CPI inflation rate declined in  three successive months before plateauing in  April. Inflation in  both wholesale prices and producer prices slowed in  February, and the 12-month rate of increase of  wages in  January declined to  4  percent, down about 1/2 percentage point from the increase recorded in  December.

The  victory of  the center-left "Olive Tree" coalition in general elections on  April 21 put the left in  power for the  first time in  fifty years. Because the election resulted in  only a plurality (albeit a  strong one) in  both parliamentary houses, the coalition is likely to  need support from the  hard-core Communist Refoundation party, with which it  had an  election alliance. Romano Prodi, a  Bologna economics professor, is expected to  be  confirmed as prime minister-designate by  the end of  May. Following the election, Prodi declared that one of  his first priorities is  to  put the Italian lira back into the ERM. Prodi also  has indicated that  he has  plans for  more rigorous budget cuts.

In Canada, economic activity appears to  have expanded at a moderate pace in  the first quarter. Most indicators increased in January to  levels above their fourth-quarter average, but then declined in February. In  March, manufacturing shipments declined further, in part reflecting the closure of  Canadian motor vehicle plants affected by  the GM  strike. Employment growth through April has been robust, although the unemployment rate has been little changed as  increased labor force participation has accompanied job gains. Consumer and business confidence picked up in  the first

quarter, but both indices remain at levels well below their recent peaks. Consumer price inflation continues to  be  subdued and industrial product price inflation has slowed further.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

Real GDP growth stagnated in the first quarter of  1996 in several major Latin American developing countries, except in  Mexico. Inflation in  these countries edged upward in  April. Asian real GDP growth slowed a bit  to  more sustainable rates, and inflation remained relatively flat. In Russia, real GDP fell further, and inflation continued to  decline. Trade performance continued to  be stronger in  Latin America compared with a  year earlier. In contrast, the Chinese trade balance moved toward a  deficit.

Individual country notes. In Mexico, recent data suggest that economic activity continued to recover briskly in  early 1996 following the estimated seasonally adjusted 3.7 percent jump (not  at an  annual rate) in  real GDP in  the fourth quarter of  1995. The average level of  industrial production in  January and February was roughly 2  percent above its year-earlier level, compared with a  7.4 percent decline for the fourth quarter. While the improvement in year-over-year growth rates in  part reflected the decline in activity in  early 1995, the average seasonally adjusted level of industrial output in  January and February was about 6  percent above its average level in  the fourth quarter of  1995. The  unemployment rate remained essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 1995 to the  first quarter of  1996, but this took place in  spite of  strong seasonal factors working to  increase the  unemployment rate. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is  estimated to  have dropped from about 6.7 percent to  6.1 percent. Finally, imports continued to  advance in  early 1996, also pointing to  a  recovery of  domestic demand. Because increased imports were matched by  continued export growth, the trade balance remained essentially unchanged in  the first quarter of  1996 compared with the fourth quarter of  1995.

The  CPI inflation rate rose to  2.8 percent in  April, in  large part reflecting a  scheduled 12 percent rise in  the minimum wage and a  roughly 7  percent increase in  some public sector prices. Inflation is expected to decline in  the coming months as  the effects of  these increases on  the economy wane and as downward seasonal pressures come into play.

In  Brazil, indications are that economic activity contracted in the first quarter of 1996, as industrial production fell. Inflation has remained low  by  Brazilian standards. The CPI inflation rate rose in  April from  March, reflecting in large part an increase in  some public sector prices.

<!-- missing-text -->

Owing to depressed aggregate demand, Brazil recorded only a small trade deficit in  the  first quarter of  1996. This compares with the sizeable trade deficit recorded at  the height of  a consumption boom a  year ago. Net capital inflows have slowed considerably since early February, possibly due to  the tightening of capital controls, but also to  disappointing news concerning the economy and prospects for the government's economic reform program. International reserves at the end of  March 1996 totalled $56 billion (liquidity concept), up  considerably from a  low of  $32 billion a year ago.

In  Argentina, real GDP contracted by  4.4 percent in 1995, and industrial production fell further in  the first quarter. Consumer prices fell in  the first quarter, the first time since W.W.II. The trade balance turned to  a  surplus in  February and March, due to  a  30 percent increase in  exports and a  7.6 percent fall in imports from a year earlier. International reserves less gold and securities have recovered from last year's drain and were $13.8 billion at endApril, compared with $14.3 at  the end of  1994. Of  the $18 billion in  gross reserves, $2.7 billion are in  dollar-denominated Bonex bonds. The  monetary base was $12 billion, leaving $6  billion in excess reserves.

Argentina's Extended Fund Facility arrangement with the IMF expired on  March 30, 1996. In  early April, the IMF approved a  new 21-month stand-by arrangement for $1.04 billion equivalent. Argentina met its first-quarter fiscal target with the IMF by  a small margin, which calls for a  $2.5 billion budget deficit without privatizations in  1996. On  April 16, Argentina resumed auctioning 91-day Treasury instruments renamed LETES. The first in  a  series of planned auctions for the year was for $271 million at 6.9 percent and was  almost 8 times oversubscribed. The government plans to issue net $2  billion in  LETES in  1996, $750 million of  which will be auctioned in  the first half of  the  year. The initial tenor of  3 months will gradually be lengthened during the course of  the year to include 6-  and 12-month maturities.

In  Venezuela, consumer price inflation picked up  in  April due to  the liberalization of  exchange controls and the depreciation of

the bolivar. Venezuela registered a merchandise (non-oil) trade deficit of  $6  billion in 1995, reflecting a  34  percent increase in imports and an  8  percent increase in  exports. However, the overall trade balance, including oil exports, showed a  $7.8 billion surplus.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  April, Venezuela introduced a  new  macroeconomic stabilization program put together with the IMF. The reforms included a  comprehensive liberalization of  exchange, price, and interest rate controls as  well as an  increase in gasoline prices by an  average of  467 percent and an  increase in  the  wholesale tax  from 12.5 to  16.5 percent. The bolivar was allowed to  float on  April 22 and immediately went from  a  fixed rate of  290 per dollar to  about 500 per dollar. Over the  next few  days, as the Central Bank intervened in  the money market, the currency appreciated slightly, and as of  May 16, was about 475 per dollar. Interest rates have also increased significantly from the  previous floor of  23 percent for deposits and ceiling of  47  percent for loans to around 50-55 percent for deposits and 75-85 percent for loans.

On  the same day  that the reforms were announced, the IMF declared that it  had reached an  agreement on all the  main policies with Venezuela for a  $1.4 billion equivalent 12-month stand-by arrangement. A  letter of  intent has  been completed. The IMF loan will be  part of  an  estimated $3.3 billion multilateral support package for Venezuela, with contributions from  the  World Bank ($900 million) and the IDB (about $1  billion).

In  China, real GDP growth remained strong in  the first quarter, while inflation was relatively flat at  nearly 10 percent. Strong import growth and negative export growth have shifted the trade balance into a  deficit in  recent months. China's trade

deficit of  $0.7 billion in  the January-April period compares with a surplus of  $8.8 billion in  the same period of  1995. The dollar value of  exports fell 8  percent from a  year earlier, while imports rose 18 percent.

In  early April, China began open market operations. However, given the limited quantity of  tradeable treasury bills on  the  market as well as the continuing system of  credit quotas and mandated interest rates, these open  market operations are likely to remain small and largely experimental for some time to come.

In  Taiwan, political events have substantially affected economic and financial market developments. Chinese missile tests near Taiwan in  February and March led to substantial capital outflows; foreign exchange reserves, which fell $8  billion in  March 1996 alone, stood at $85 billion at  the end of  April, down from a high of  $100 billion in  June 1995. Industrial production stagnated and inflation declined somewhat in  the first quarter.

Following Taiwan's presidential election March 23, tensions with China have lessened, and downward pressure on  the currency has abated. Taiwan's stock market, which fell 10  percent from the

beginning of  1996 to  its low  point in  early March, has surged. As of  May 16, the stock market was up 18 percent for the year.

In  Korea, there is  clear evidence that economic growth is slowing. Industrial production has decelerated markedly since the third quarter of  last year. Slow growth in  capital goods imports-which increased by  only 4  percent on  a year-over-year basis in March--suggests a  particularly sharp deceleration in investment demand. Given that inflation has remained moderate by  historical standards, the Bank of  Korea has eased monetary policy progressively since the  middle of  last year. Short-term interest rates have fallen by  around 500 basis points since the end of  June, with about one  third of  the  decline occurring in  the past two  months.

An  initial review of  Korea's OECD application by  the Committees on  Capital Movements and Invisibles Transactions (CMIT) and on  International Investment and  Multinational Enterprises (CIME)--the committees responsible for assessing Korea's adherence to OECD standards with regard to  capital account openness and trade in services--was held on  April 11-12. These committees indicated that Korea must commit to significantly more financial liberalization before they can recommend that Korea be  admitted to the OECD. The CMIT/CIME review noted that Korea continues to maintain substantial barriers to foreign direct investment, to foreign competition in  the provision of  financial services, and  to capital inflows.

In Russia, monthly inflation continued to  decline. The ruble depreciated against the dollar by  2  percent during April, similar to its performance in  recent months, remaining comfortably within its 4550-5150 rubles per  dollar band. In  mid-May, the government

announced that, effective July 1, the current band will be  replaced by  a  crawling band. Both the ceiling and the floor of  the  new  band will depreciate by  about 1.5 percent a month. During the first four months of 1996, real GDP and industrial production were both down 3 percent from their year-earlier levels. Russian officials have linked the continued decline in  economic activity to "under investment," reflecting concerns about the June 16  presidential election.

Russia successfully completed its first monthly review under its IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), satisfying all the quantitative indicative targets for end-March. In  particular, the fiscal deficit during the first quarter was 5  percent of  GDP, just under the  program ceiling, despite unexpectedly poor revenue performance and pressures to  increase expenditures as the election approaches. Delays in  implementing some of  the  program's prior actions were resolved to  the Fund's satisfaction by  end-April.

In late April, the Russian government signed an  agreement with the Paris Club of  official creditors restructuring $40 billion of the roughly $45 billion in  official debt that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union. The implementation of  the rescheduling agreement is explicitly contingent on  Russia satisfying the conditions of  the EFF.
