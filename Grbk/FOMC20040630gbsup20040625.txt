Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Gross Domestic Product

According to the BEA's final estimate, real GDP increased at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the first quarter after a rise of 4.1 percent in the fourth quarter of last year.  The final estimate was 1/2 percentage point lower than the estimate published in last month's preliminary release.  Much of the revision was the result of the incorporation of new and revised data on trade in goods and services that now show a larger drag from net exports than had been reported last month.  PCE services also were revised down somewhat reflecting the BEA's inclusion of new source data on explicit banking services.

Real final sales rose at an annual rate of 3.2 percent last quarter after having increased 3.4 percent in the preceding quarter.  Among the components of final demand, real PCE moved up at an annual rate of 3.8 percent, as a decline in motor vehicles spending was more than offset by a pickup in spending on other durables, nondurables, and services.  Real business fixed investment rose at a rate of 5.3 percent, and residential investment increased at a pace of 4.6 percent; each marked a stepdown from its fourth-quarter pace.  Total government consumption and investment rose at an annual rate of 3 percent because of a surge in national defense spending.  Net exports shaved about 3/4 percentage point from the change in real GDP last quarter after having been a smaller drag in the fourth quarter.  Real private inventories accumulated at an annual rate of $25.5 billion, following a $9 billion accrual in the fourth quarter, and boosted the change in real GDP by nearly 3/4 percentage point.

The chain-weighted price index for GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the first quarter.  Core PCE prices rose at a rate of 2 percent, 1/4 percentage point more than in the preliminary release.  The upward revision reflected incoming data on prices for which market-based source data are not available-mostly the price of imputed banking services.  The four-quarter change in core PCE prices was 1.3 percent, compared with a 1.6 percent increase over the year-earlier period.

On the income side of the accounts, real disposable personal income rose 4.9 percent in the first quarter, and the saving rate moved up to 2.2 percent, the same figure as in the preliminary release.  The staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 4.7 percent last quarter.  Finally, economic profits (corporate profits with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments) increased $20.9 billion last quarter, far short of the $81.4-billion jump in the fourth quarter, but quite close to our expectations.  As a share of GNP, profits (excluding Federal Reserve banks) held steady at 10.5 percent.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the final report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment jumped in June to 95.6, more than reversing its decline in the previous month.  The implicit level in the second half of the month was 96.2, a moderate increase over the first half reading of 95.2.

For the month as a whole, both the "current conditions" component and the "expected conditions" component of the overall index strengthened.  Within the "current conditions" component, assessments of buying conditions for large household appliances improved despite recent increases in interest rates.  In contrast, consumers' assessments of their current personal financial situation fell a touch relative to last month.  Within the "expected conditions" component, consumers' assessments of their expected financial condition in the next twelve months moved up, and assessments of business conditions over both the next twelve months and five years rebounded sharply from their May lows.

Among those items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved considerably in June.  Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars and houses were roughly unchanged.

Compared with May, the June reading on median expected inflation over the next twelve months was unchanged at 3.3 percent while the median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years edged up a bit to 2.9 percent.  Both figures are a shade below those in the preliminary report for the first half of June.

Home Sales

Homebuying remained robust in May, with sales of both new and existing homes reaching new records.  New home sales jumped 14.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.37 million units.   In addition, sales in the previous three months were 1 revised up 5-1/2 percent. The stock of new homes for sale edged down to 372,000 units last month; at the elevated May sales pace, this stock amounted to a record low 3.3 months' supply.  Sales of existing homes increased 2.6 percent in May to an annual rate of 6.8 million units.  The inventory of homes for sale

edged up to 2.37 million units in May, but still represented a low 4.2 months' supply.

The average price of new homes sold in May was 5.3 percent higher than a year earlier; this increase is in the middle of the range of price increases seen in recent years.  The median price of new homes sold in May was 1.5 percent higher than a year earlier; this price increase is toward the lower end of the range of recent median price increases.  The most recent reading for the constant-quality price index for new homes, which adjusts for changes in geographic composition and in home size and other amenities, was an increase of 5.8 percent for the year ending in the first quarter of 2004.

The average price of existing homes was 10.6 percent higher in May than a year earlier, and the median price was 10.3 percent higher.  Both of these increases are near the upper end of their respective ranges since early 2002.  These price series do not adjust for compositional changes in the structural characteristics and amenities of homes sold.  The most recent data for the repeat-sales price index for existing homes-which holds constant some of the compositional shifts that can affect the median and average prices-was 8.5 percent higher in the first quarter than a year earlier, the same rate of increase as that recorded in the fourth quarter of last year.  These increases are the most rapid since early 1980. 2

Orders and Shipments of Capital Goods

New orders for durable goods dropped back for a second month in May.  The staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-moved down 1.6 percent in May after having fallen 3.7 percent in April.  These declines followed several months of sizable increases, and the trend in real adjusted durable goods orders, as measured by the three-month moving average, continued to edge higher in May.

New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined 3 percent in May following a decrease of 2 percent in April.  In the high-tech sector, bookings of computers and peripherals dropped back 3.6 percent, and communications orders tumbled 12.9 percent.  In both cases, the declines reversed part of the larger gains recorded in April.  Outside of the high-tech sector, orders weakened 1.2 percent as bookings for construction machinery and metalworking machinery retraced some of the outsized gains experienced over the past six months.  Nonetheless, the overall level of new orders for nondefense

capital goods excluding aircraft remained above the level of shipments in May for the fourth consecutive month.

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft also turned down in May.  In the high-tech sector, shipments of computers and peripheral equipment slumped 10.7 percent, and shipments of communications equipment contracted 1.3 percent.  Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments declined 1.4 percent in May with broad-based declines occurring in the machinery category.

The book value of inventories held by durable goods manufacturers increased at an annual rate of $13.5 billion in May, led by stockbuilding at machinery manufacturers.  Shipments of total durable goods slipped 0.7 percent in May, and the inventory-shipments ratio ticked up to 1.38 months.
