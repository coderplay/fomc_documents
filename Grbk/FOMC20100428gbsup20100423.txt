Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales of New and Existing Homes

Home sales strengthened noticeably in March.  Sales of new single-family homes jumped 27 percent last month, and the stock of unsold new houses edged down to its lowest level since 1971.  Consequently, the months' supply of new homes moved sharply lower, though it remained elevated.  Meanwhile, sales of single-family existing homes rose more than 7 percent in March to an annual rate of 4.7 million units.  Both of these sales figures were likely boosted, at least in part, by the anticipated expiry of the homebuyer tax credit, which is only available for home-sale agreements signed through April.

Orders and Shipments of Nondefense Capital Goods

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose again in March, posting a 2.2 percent increase on the heels of a 1.5 percent gain in February.  New orders jumped 4 percent, following February's rise of 2.1 percent.  These gains leave the level of new orders narrowly above that of shipments.

Shipments of high-tech equipment posted particularly robust gains, with shipments of computers and communications equipment rising at 3.7 and 6.2 percent, respectively. New orders for computers surged 12.9 percent, although this series has been quite volatile lately.  Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments posted a solid increase of 1.7 percent. New orders rose more rapidly and now stand a little above shipments.

The three-month moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders rose 0.7 percent in March.  This series-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-is one of the staff's indicators of near-term industrial production.
