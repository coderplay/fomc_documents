The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Producer Prices

Following October's sharp increase, the producer price index for finished goods rose 0.5 percent in November, led by another sizable increase in energy prices.  Over the twelve months ending in November, prices of finished goods rose 5 percent.  Excluding food and energy, the PPI rose 0.2 percent in November, following increases of 0.3 percent in each of the preceding three months.  Core finished goods prices rose 1.9 percent between November 2003 and November 2004, compared with a 0.5 percent increase over the preceding twelve-month period.

The PPI for energy rose 1.8 percent in November, on the heels of October's jump of 6.8 percent.  The increase last month was the result of sharp increases in the prices for residential natural gas and electricity; prices of refined products fell slightly following October's surge.  The twelve-month change in the PPI for energy was nearly 20 percent, double the increase of the previous year.  However, the collapse in crude oil prices in early December has been matched by large declines in wholesale prices of gasoline and heating oil-pointing to large declines in the PPI and CPI for finished energy in December.

Food prices increased 0.4 percent in November.  Vegetable prices climbed higher, but the index for fresh fruits fell 17 percent after the sharp increases of September and October; the decline came as California's orange crop replaced the hurricane-related losses to the Florida citrus fruit harvest.  Producer food prices increased nearly 3 percent for the year ending in November, a large deceleration from the previous twelve-month period.

Core consumer goods prices rose 0.2 percent in November, as did the price index for capital goods.  The increase in core goods prices was led by a rise of 0.6 percent in the price of autos, but light truck prices fell by a similar amount.  Over the period from November 2003 to November 2004, prices of both capital goods and core consumer goods have risen about 2 percent, a noticeable pickup from the previous twelve-month period.

At earlier stages of processing, the index for core intermediate materials rose 0.4 percent in November, following October's 0.3 percent increase.  Over the twelve months ending in November, the price index for core intermediate materials rose 8 percent, reflecting sizable increases in the prices of a wide variety of products, especially metals and

industrial chemicals.  Core crude materials prices rose 2.5 percent in November, on the heels of October's even larger increase, with iron and steel scrap prices once again the main culprit.

Consumer Sentiment

According to the preliminary report, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment rose nearly 3 points in December to 95.7, about equal to its average since the beginning of the year.

December's increase resulted from stronger readings for both components of the index. Within the 'current conditions' component, consumers' assessments of buying conditions for large household appliances improved, while assessments of their current personal financial situation were unchanged.  Within the 'expected conditions' component, consumers' assessments of expected personal financial conditions ticked up, and the index for expected business conditions moved higher.

Among the items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months were about unchanged. Consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for houses improved to their highest level in eight months, and consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars retraced most of last month's sharp drop.

The mean and median of expected inflation over the next twelve months increased to 3.5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.  The mean of expected inflation over the next five to ten years edged down to 3 percent, while the median edged up to 2.8 percent.

Business Inventories

The book value of wholesale inventories increased at an annual rate of $43 billion in October following a $22 billion accumulation in September.  Sales at non-auto wholesalers increased 1.6 percent in October, and the inventory-sales ratio was unchanged at 1.13 months.

Stocks held by wholesalers of durable goods rose at an annual rate of $41 billion in October.  The rise was led by a large accumulation of $16 billion in the metals and minerals sector; wholesalers of lumber and building materials also posted a relatively large increase.  Wholesalers of nondurable goods added to stocks at an annual rate of

Production of Motor Vehicles

The final estimate of motor vehicle production for November showed assemblies at an annual rate of 11.9 million units, slightly below the October rate.  On balance, dealer inventories of light vehicles ended the month unchanged from the high level that prevailed at the end of the third quarter.

The International Economy

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-Oil Imports. In November, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods rose 0.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively, the largest monthly increases since January. Although every major category saw a price increase, the main contribution came from industrial supplies, whose prices rose 2.8 percent, mostly because of higher natural gas prices.  For both capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and foods, feeds and beverages, prices increased 0.3 percent.  After a 0.4 percent increase in October, prices for automotive products rose another 0.2 percent.  Prices for imported consumer goods, which had not increased since February 2004, ticked up 0.1 percent. Import prices of computers continued to decline, whereas prices for semiconductors edged up.

The average level of imported core goods prices in October and November was 2½ percent at an annual rate above the third-quarter level.  The main contributions to the increase were from foods and non-oil industrial supplies.  Both automotive products and, to a lesser extent, capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) also experienced price gains.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil fell 2.6 percent in November.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a light, low-sulfur crude oil, fell 8.8 percent in November, to average about $48.50 per barrel.  Since October, the spot price of WTI has fallen sharply, due in part to rising oil inventories and the return of some oil production in the Gulf of Mexico.  The spot price of WTI closed at $42.54 per barrel on December 9.  The prices of more sulfurous grades of crude oil, which had not increased as rapidly as WTI in October, have not fallen as much recently.  The price of imported oil tends to be more closely aligned with the prices of higher sulfur crude oils than with WTI.

Exports. In November, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods increased 0.3 and 0.4 percent, respectively.  Much of November's rise was due to a 1 percent increase in industrial supplies, reflecting higher prices for chemicals and metals.  After declining 1.3 percent in October, prices of agricultural exports edged down another 0.1 percent.  Export prices of capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) increased 0.3 percent, and prices for consumer goods edged up

0.1 percent.  Export prices of computers continued to decline, but prices for semiconductors were unchanged.

The average level of exported core goods prices in October and November was 4 percent at an annual rate above the third-quarter level.  A large increase in prices for industrial supplies more than offset a large decline in the prices for exported agricultural products. Additional positive contributions came from both capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and automotive products.
