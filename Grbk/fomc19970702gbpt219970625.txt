RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

After surging in the first quarter, real GDP appears to be headed toward only a  moderate increase in the second quarter-primarily because of  a  slackening in consumer spending. In contrast, industrial production, which has been less volatile recently, will likely post a  third consecutive 4  percent to 5  percent (annual rate) gain this quarter. Growth of  payroll employment subsided a  bit recently, but the unemployment rate moved down further. Meanwhile, inflation remained modest despite high rates of resource utilization, with the core CPI rising 2.5 percent over the year ending in  May.

Real GDP

According to BEA's preliminary estimate, real GDP grew 5.8 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter of 1997. As shown in  the table, we expect data revisions, on  net, to leave this figure unchanged. Among the components of GDP, the largest expected change is to net exports, where annual revisions to the merchandise trade data point to  a  smaller first-quarter rise in  imports. However, revised book-value data suggest that the pace of inventory accumulation was slightly slower than BEA estimated at the time of the preliminary release.

Labor Market Developments

Growth of payroll employment moderated just a  bit from the fast pace in the first quarter, although after incorporating the annual revisions to the establishment survey, it now appears that the second quarter began with greater strength in  hiring than initially reported. In  May, the unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 1973, and the labor force participation rate, though down from its historical high in  March, was just under the previous cyclical peak reached in January 1990.

Nonfarm payrolls increased 138,000 in  May, and employment growth in  April was revised up from 142,000 to 323,000. Part of  the upward revision for April was a  technical adjustment made as part of the annual revisions.2 But even netting out the effects of special factors, employment growth averaged a  little under 200,000 over the first two months of  the second quarter--not far from the first-quarter pace.

The bulk of employment growth over the past two months has been in services, particularly health, hotel, and amusement services. One surprisingly weak industry has been help-supply, where employment has fallen 55,000 over the past two months. This weakness may reflect a lack of available workers, rather than a slowdown in  demand: Help-supply firms report no  drop-off in  new orders but have had problems filling them. In the goods-producing sector, the pace of employment growth has slowed from the first quarter. As expected, construction employment bounced back in  May from the  weather-depressed levels in March and April. However, averaging through the fluctuations, employment growth in construction has dropped back from the pace at the end of  last year.

In addition, on a  strike-adjusted basis, manufacturing employment has changed little since March, compared with average monthly growth of about 15,000 in  the first quarter.

The average workweek of production or  nonsupervisory workers held steady at 34.5 hours in May, after averaging 34.7 hours in  the first quarter. As a  result, the average level of aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers in  April and May  was only 0.2 percent above the level in  the first quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down to 4.8 percent in  May, from 4.9 percent in  April. Declines were particularly noticeable for adult men, while the rates for women and teenagers rose slightly. The tight labor market continued to keep labor force participation at relatively high levels. The participation rate in  May inched down to 67.1 percent after reaching a  record 67.3 percent in  March. But cutting through the monthly wiggles, the participation rates of  virtually all major demographic groups have trended up  over the past year.

Most other labor market indicators provide evidence of  a  strong labor market. According to the BNA survey, the share of employers reporting some difficulty filling jobs rose further in  the second quarter for all three occupational categories included in the survey. The Manpower, Inc. survey of hiring intentions for the next quarter showed a  further strengthening of labor demand, with hiring intentions now  at the highest level since 1988. (Although the Manpower survey reports hiring intentions for the next quarter, statistical evidence suggests that the reading is more closely correlated with hiring strength in the current quarter). Households' views of  current job availability, as measured by the Conference Board survey, moved to very positive levels in  June. The one sign pointing toward moderation is the level of initial claims for unemployment insurance. Since the last Greenbook, the four-week moving average of claims has risen slightly, to 335,000, after dipping in early June. Unlike the rise in  mid-April, the recent increase in  claims does not appear to have been caused by  special weatheror strike-related factors.

Industrial Production

Industrial output continued to grow briskly in  the spring, rising 0.4 percent in  May after registering similar gains in the preceding two months. Manufacturing output posted a  sizable 0.5 percent increase in  May and mining was up 2.0 percent, while utility production fell because of cooler-than-average temperatures. On  balance, the recent growth of factory output has been about in line with the growth in capacity. As a  result, manufacturing capacity utilization has held steady at slightly above 82-1/2 percent over the past four months.

The motor vehicle and parts industry has been quite volatile in recent months, owing mainly to strikes. Production of  motor vehicles and parts bounced back 1.2 percent in  May after falling 2.7 percent in  April, when strikes curtailed assemblies at Chrysler and General Motors. However, with inventories still ample at the end of  May, only a  part of the strike-related losses in production, most of  which were light trucks, is likely to be  made up. At the end of  May, the days' supply of  light trucks was just above 70 days, a  little on  the high side, while the days' supply of autos was running about 60 days. Assemblies appear to  be increasing a  little more rapidly in  June than in  May, rising just above 12 million units (annual rate); only one strike at  a  truck assembly plant has affected June output. Total assemblies for the second quarter are expected to be 11.6 million units at an annual rate, compared with 12.3 million in  the first quarter.

Outside of  motor vehicles, the production of consumer goods edged down in  May, as a  decline in consumer nondurables offset a

rise in consumer durables. After dropping in  April, the production of  construction supplies rose again in May  and is still a  bit above the high level attained late last summer. Business equipment posted another healthy gain in  May, consistent with the ongoing strength in the demand for producers' durable equipment. The production of information processing equipment registered another strong advance, and the output of civilian aircraft grew rapidly, boosted by Boeing's increased production of 737s and 777s. The company's announced production schedules suggest that the output of civilian aircraft will continue to grow at an  extraordinary pace throughout the year before leveling off in 1998. Consistent with the strong pickup in orders registered earlier this year, the output of industrial equipment jumped 2.1 percent in  April and held that higher level in  May. Until the recent surge in production, output in this sector had changed little since mid-1995.

Materials production (excluding energy) also continued to grow rapidly in  May. The output of semiconductors posted another hefty gain, and the production of basic metals, mainly steel, picked up further. The output of nondurable materials was about unchanged.

Indicators of  future production continue to be  upbeat. The indexes of new orders from the National Association of Purchasing Managers and the  American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS) rose to  high levels in  May. The comparable index from Dun and Bradstreet retreated in  May  but remained at  a  level suggesting that new  orders are increasing. Real adjusted durable goods orders, the most volatile of  the production indicators, continued to rise sharply in  April and May, following a  large increase in the first quarter.

Consumption and Personal Income

Consumer spending flattened out this spring after the large run-up in the preceding two quarters. However, the fundamental determinants of consumer demand point to an early resumption of spending growth: Job gains are generating income, consumers are extraordinarily optimistic, and household net worth has increased enormously over the past few  years.

Total nominal retail sales fell 0.1 percent in  May. At stores in the "retail control" category, which excludes automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, nominal spending also edged down in  May. However, the data for the preceding two months were revised down to show declines of 0.5 percent in  April and 0.1 percent in March. We estimate that real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) for goods other than motor vehicles edged down 0.1 percent in  May after declining 0.5 percent in  April.

Unusually mild weather likely contributed to  the first-quarter surge in retail sales, and some slowdown in  the second quarter was to be  expected as temperatures returned to "normal." But, in the event, April and May  were cooler than average, reportedly depressing sales of  such items as seasonal apparel, air conditioners, and recreational equipment. Data on chain store sales and anecdotal reports suggest some bounceback in overall sales in June.

Spending on services was up strongly in  April--the last month for which we  have data. Cool weather boosted real outlays for energy services in  that month nearly 5 percent (not at an annual rate). In contrast, spending on energy services probably fell somewhat in  May, as continued cool temperatures likely delayed the usual onset of  air conditioning use. Real expenditures on nonenergy services rose 0.2 percent in  April, with spending up  across most major categories.

Real disposable personal income was essentially unchanged in April after three months of strong growth. Both the aggregate hours and the average hourly earnings of production workers rose in  May, suggesting another solid increase in income for the month. The saving rate moved back up to 5.1 percent in March and held at  that level in  April.

Recent indicators suggest that household balance sheets remain in good shape overall. Although the ratio of net worth to disposable income edged down in  the first quarter, the renewed surge in  the stock market has likely pushed the ratio to a  new high. The ratio of total debt service payments to disposable personal income held at 17.1 percent in the first quarter and has changed little over the past year.

Consumer sentiment has been a  real standout in recent months, suggesting that the recent lull in spending is likely to prove temporary. In  June, both the Michigan SRC and Conference Board measures of consumer sentiment were at levels not seen since the 1960s. Part of the recent strength in the Conference Board index reflected respondents' upbeat assessments of current and expected job availability--not too surprising, given the strong growth in  employment over the past year and favorable press reports on the labor market. Although it is not included in  the overall sentiment index, the Michigan series on  expected unemployment also has trended down since early last year.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of  motor vehicles fell off in  April and May after surging in the first quarter. Nonetheless, smoothing through the effects of strikes and shifts in reporting periods, the underlying pace of sales has remained around 15 million units (annual rate)--the same pace that has prevailed since the second half of 1995. Adjusting for changes in reporting periods, vehicle sales increased about 200,000 units in  May, to 14.7 million units. However, sales were held down last month--as much as 250,000 units--by the recent strikes at  General Motors and Chrysler. GM's fleet sales bore the brunt of its supply problems, contributing to a  decline in total fleet sales in  May. 6

To counteract the erosion of their market share by  foreign firms, the Big Three automakers have continued to provide generous incentives. Indeed, incentives were sweetened during the second

quarter, and initial industry plans for the third quarter suggest that they will remain relatively generous.

Other indicators also suggest that, barring any other major strikes, sales should remain solid in the near term. According to preliminary data from the Michigan survey, consumers' attitudes toward car-buying conditions improved further in June, reflecting more favorable views of the economy, falling motor vehicle prices, and lower finance rates.

Housing Markets

Although single-family housing starts have fallen recently, the underlying pace of  housing activity has been well maintained overall this year. In  May, single-family starts declined 2.5 percent, to 1.09 million units. The decline was partly an  aftereffect of the unusually mild weather in  February, which shifted starts forward from the spring. Permits for single-family units, which are typically less volatile than housing starts, hardly changed in  May-holding at  a  level well above the average of  the past few quarters. Indeed, based on an  average ratio of starts to permits, the number of permits issued in  May would imply a  level of starts closer to the average of  the March and April readings.

Existing home sales rose 4.4 percent in  May to  the highest level since May 1996 and the fourth highest on record. New home sales dropped 7.7 percent in  April but remained at a  high level. The Census Bureau has been modifying its procedures for collecting data on  new home sales, making it  especially difficult to interpret monthly movements.

Readings for a  number of  indicators from early June show continued firm demand for single-family housing. The builders' rating of  new  home sales has strengthened in recent months to the highest level since last August. According to the Michigan Survey, consumers' attitudes toward homebuying improved further in  June, reaching the most favorable level in three years. Also, applications for mortgages to purchase homes have remained high.

Multifamily housing starts dropped 12 percent in  May from an extremely high level in  March and April. Nonetheless, the underlying pace of  multifamily starts remained healthy, with the April-May average noticeably above the 1996 level. Meanwhile. permit issuance in this sector continued to trend up.

Business Fixed Investment

Real business fixed investment appears to have increased further during the second quarter, as evidenced by the high levels of orders and shipments. Moreover, the fundamental determinants of investment are consistent with vigorous growth: Cash flow continues to surge, and business output has accelerated. Although the user cost of capital for many types of equipment has changed little, the falling user cost for office and computing equipment continues to provide a  substantial boost to  high-tech investment.

Shipments of  nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts--one of the building blocks for BEA's estimates of real PDE--edged higher in  May after substantial increases in earlier months. 7 Nominal shipments of office and computing equipment jumped 2.6 percent in  May, more than reversing April's decline. Shipments of  communications equipment rose 2.9 percent last month, while shipments of  other equipment fell 0.6 percent, the first decline after three months of robust gains.

Plummeting prices for computers will help to sustain investment in  the near term. The computer component of  the PPI declined 4.6 percent in May, bringing the year-to-date drop to 28 percent at  an annual rate. Furthermore, price cutting is likely to remain noteworthy in coming months. Intel recently announced that sharp reductions in  the prices of  Pentium processors will take effect at  the end of  July. In  addition, several manufacturers of switches and routers--essential equipment for building computer networks--have cut prices 10 percent to 33 percent. Also, IBM's newest generation of  mainframes, which provides substantially higher performance at lower cost than previous lines, was introduced in June.

Orders data suggest that the growth of expenditures on equipment will remain brisk in coming months. Orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts increased 0.6 percent in May after a 1.5 percent decline in  April and a  5-1/2 percent gain in the first quarter. Orders for communications equipment rose 6.4 percent, while bookings for computers jumped 5.5 percent in nominal terms; given the large computer price declines last month,

the latter increase likely was substantial in real terms. Orders for equipment excluding aircraft, communications equipment, and computers dropped 2.5 percent in  May  but still remained at an elevated level.

Business spending on  motor vehicles edged up last month. Sales of light trucks rose in  May from the low level in  April but remained below the first-quarter level. Sales of  medium and heavy trucks were little changed in  May, remaining at a  relatively high level. Sales of cars dipped, as General Motors directed vehicles in short supply toward retail customers and away from fleet sales.

Domestic spending on aircraft is climbing. Shipments of commercial aircraft to domestic airlines jumped 40.7 percent in March and rose 5.5 percent further in  April. Boeing is stepping up production to meet heavy demand, which continues to  mount. In  the latest addition to its bulging order book, Boeing recently received a  commitment from Continental Airlines to purchase thirty-five new wide-body aircraft, with an estimated value of more than $3  billion. Delivery is set to begin in September 1998.

Expenditures on  nonresidential structures have inched down in recent months, with construction put-in-place slipping in  March and April from the lofty levels of earlier this year. A  drop in spending on office and other commercial properties accounted for most of  the decline. Still, the outlook for nonresidential building is bright: Contracts for private nonresidential buildings rose sharply in  April, with all major categories posting gains. In addition, vacancy rates for office space have declined steadily, and prices for commercial real estate have been edging up.

Business Inventories

Business inventory investment resumed a  vigorous pace in  April. On a  book-value basis, inventories in  manufacturing and trade excluding motor vehicles rose at a  $36.7 billion annual rate, after a  brief slowing in  March. The April inventory buildup occurred against a  backdrop of rather uneven sales across major sectors: While factory shipments were quite firm (up 1.4 percent in  April), nonvehicle sales in the trade sector were generally lackluster. Nonetheless, inventory-sales ratios for most types of business establishments remained low by  historical standards.

SELECTED INVENTORY-SALES RATIOS

(Months' supply, based on  Census book-value data, seasonally adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

Much of  the April upswing in inventory investment occurred in the manufacturing sector, especially in durable goods industries where production has been strong. As in  the preceding several months, a  significant part of the accumulation was in stocks of capital goods. Inventories of aircraft and parts expanded further, continuing a  trend that has been apparent for more than a  year; stocks of industrial machinery and office equipment also rose briskly. Indeed, as shown in the table below, the April buildup of stocks of "other" nondefense capital goods far exceeded the pace observed in recent months and, given the uptrend in  orders and shipments in recent months, likely was intended. Elsewhere in manufacturing, inventories in a  few other durable goods industries also expanded in  April, while stocks held by  nondurable goods producers were little changed on net.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  the trade sector, inventory developments in  April appear to have been influenced by  the slowing of consumer demand. In wholesale trade, distributors carrying many types of consumeroriented merchandise--apparel, furniture, lumber and homeimprovement supplies, and hardware and plumbing--reported some inventory backups in April. Similar backups in stocks were reported in the retail trade sector--notably apparel and general merchandise. For most types of  retail establishments, inventory-sales ratios rose considerably in April, in contrast to the general downtrend in recent months. However, retail sales in  the GAF category were up again in  May, and inventory-sales ratios for this grouping have likely fallen back. In  a  longer-term perspective, nonvehicle trade inventories remained low relative to sales.

Federal Sector

1997--in line with the 3  percent annual trend rate of  decline over the past four years.

For the first eight months of fiscal year 1997, the unified federal deficit, adjusted for shifts in the timing of payments and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was $39.4 billion (34 percent) below the level for the same period in fiscal 1996. Receipts were almost 8-1/2 percent higher than the year-earlier level, while adjusted outlays were up 3-3/4 percent. Spending growth was subdued across most categories. Outlays for income security programs were up only 2-1/4 percent, partly as  a result of  the continued strong economy. Spending on  Medicare was 8-1/2 percent higher than in  the first eight months of the last fiscal year, and spending on  Medicaid was only 4  percent above the same period last year--both somewhat below their recent average rates of  growth. Defense spending was almost 1  percent above its year-earlier level, a  reversal from its average downtrend of  almost 3  percent per year over the past four years.

Congress recently passed the fiscal 1998 budget resolution, which records its interpretation of the tax and spending changes agreed upon  with the Administration. Although Congress plans to balance the budget by 2002, spending over the near term is expected to be somewhat higher than previously anticipated. In particular, Congress and the Administration agreed to raise the 1998 discretionary spending caps that had been enacted in OBRA93, allowing discretionary spending in fiscal 1998 to run roughly $8  billion above the OBRA93 caps (as estimated by  CBO).

The policy details underlying the budget resolution will be implemented in separate reconciliation bills for taxes and mandatory spending programs. These bills have now  been passed by  the relevant committees, and there are plans for them to be considered by  the full House and Senate before the July 4  recess. In general, the tax and spending bills follow the budget resolution closely, although differences in policies between the House and Senate bills will need to be reconciled.

State and Local Governments

33,000 in April but retraced half that gain in  May. Real construction spending by  these governments slipped more than 2  percent in  April, after advancing strongly in each of  the two preceding months.

According to a  recent survey by  the National Association of State Budget Officers, states' year-end balances (current surplus plus accumulated surpluses from past years) have been remarkably strong in recent years. Indeed, since 1994, balances for state governments as a  group have topped 5  percent of expenditures--a benchmark favorably regarded by  bond market analysts. For fiscal 1997. which ends June 30 for most states, the balance is projected at 6.2 percent of expenditures, down a  little from 6.8 percent in 1996, which was the highest reading since 1980. With strong underlying economic activity in recent years, revenue growth has been robust despite widespread, though mostly small, tax cuts. In this environment, many governments have worked to rebuild reserves partly by  holding the line on spending programs. Indeed, expenditure plans have been conservative, with the public's desire for a  smaller public sector and concern about further cuts in federal aid among the reasons cited.

Prices and Labor Costs

The incoming data on prices have continued to be very favorable. In  May, the CPI edged up 0.1 percent for the third consecutive month: over the past twelve months, the CPI has risen only 2-1/4 percent--down from a  3-1/4 percent pace at the end of 1996. The deceleration reflects favorable developments in  food and energy prices, while the twelve-month change in the core CPI has held at a  2-1/2 percent rate.

The CPI for energy in  May continued to reflect declines earlier this year in crude oil prices; retail energy prices fell 2.4 percent, led by  a  4  percent drop in gasoline prices. In spot markets for crude oil, prices climbed in May  because of tensions in the Middle East but have fallen back in June. The spot price of West Texas intermediate, for example, has averaged about $19 per barrel in  June after peaking at more than $22 per barrel in  mid-May. In  addition, private survey data suggest that, on a  seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of gasoline is continuing to decline in June, albeit at a  slower pace than in  April and May.

Consumer food prices advanced 0.4 percent in  May. Coffee prices surged for the third consecutive month, and prices of fruits

Daily  Spot  and Posted Prices  of  West Texas Intermediate

<!-- missing-text -->

Monthly  Average  Prices  of  West Texas Intermediate

<!-- missing-text -->

and vegetables turned back up after a  considerable drop in April. Nonetheless, retail food prices have increased only slightly since the start of  the year, and pressures are not very evident at earlier stages of  processing. The PPI for crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs edged down in  May after increasing substantially in the preceding two months, and spot commodity prices for foodstuffs have declined further in  June.

Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.2 percent in May and were up 2.5 percent over the past twelve months. The index for commodities other than food and energy edged up 0.1 percent in May  and rose 1.1 percent from a  year earlier. Goods prices have been held down this year by falling prices for new  motor vehicles and used cars. Facing intense competition from foreign producers. U.S. automakers are attempting to  maintain market share through generous incentive programs. The declines in used car prices may reflect these same pressures as well as a  growing supply of vehicles coming off leases.

The index for services excluding energy, which advanced 0.3 percent in  May, was up  3.2 percent over the past twelve months-the same pace as in  the year earlier. The prices of  shelter and "other" services have accelerated a  bit so far this year. In contrast, the index for medical services has continued to decelerate. In  January 1997, the BLS introduced a  new measure of prices of hospital services, which account for roughly one-third of the CPI for medical services. As  with PCE prices, which are based on  the PPI, this new  measure attempts to price treatment paths rather than inputs and has moved toward collecting transactions prices rather than list prices for hospital services. Since the end of last year, CPI hospital services prices have increased 1.3 percent, compared with 0.4 percent for PPI hospital services prices. While differences are to  be expected between these series, the divergence in  these measures this year reportedly reflects data collection problems in  the first few months of this year that have now been resolved. 1 0

The deceleration in the growth of consumer prices since the end of last year has been associated with a  somewhat smaller decline in

short-term and longer-term measures of  inflation expectations. The median expected price increase over the next twelve months, as measured in the Michigan SRC survey, is about 1/4 percentage point lower than the average rate expected at the end of 1996. The Conference Board's measure of inflation expectations over the next twelve months and the Philadelphia Fed survey's reading on inflation expectations over the next ten years also have ticked down since last year.

Prices at earlier stages of processing remain subdued, with no sign of  a  buildup in "pipeline" pressures that is likely to show through in substantial finished-goods inflation in  the near term. The PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy has remained nearly flat over the past twelve months, and while the PPI for core crude materials advanced 1.2 percent in  May, the index remains below its year-earlier level. Since mid-May, the Journal of  Commerce and KR-CRB spot industrial price indexes have been little changed, on balance, as have metal prices.

We  have received little new  information on labor costs since the last Greenbook. Responding to  tight labor market conditions, average hourly earnings rose 3.8 percent in the twelve months ending in  May, up from 3.3 percent in  the previous year. Over the year, gains have been particularly strong in the trade and services industries and have been more moderate in  manufacturing and construction.

With recent data indicating a  marked slowing of  GDP growth this quarter and  a  continuation of low inflation, most interest rates have declined considerably since May  20; on  net, nominal yields on Treasury coupon issues are down 20 to 30  basis points. In  contrast, the  yield on  the Treasury's indexed bond was about flat, implying a decline in inflation premia. Some concerns remained after the FOMC's May  inaction that the System might take another tightening step or  two this year in  a  preemptive strike against inflation. But the events of the intermeeting period have erased such fears (chart).

Yields on  private money-market instruments are down about 5  to 15 basis points since the  May FOMC meeting. However, Treasury bill rates are off 20 to  30 basis points as this sector continues to benefit from reduced auction supplies. The  yield on  the three-month Treasury bill is  now  more than 1/2 percentage point below the intended federal funds rate, compared with a  historical average of 1/4 percentage point.

Equity markets have continued to rally in  recent weeks, albeit experiencing wide swings day  to  day. The  shares of some companies that announced their near-term earnings would be  disappointing were hammered, at least temporarily, but the decline in interest rates has  buoyed valuations more broadly. Following a  sizable one-day drop in  late June, in the  wake of  remarks by  Japan's prime minister, stocks staged a  rapid comeback, and, on  net, the  major indexes have gained about 7 percent to 8 percent since the  May  meeting.

Borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses has remained strong in  the second quarter. Growth of  business loans at  banks has eased slightly from the first-quarter pace, but issuance of corporate bonds has picked up  appreciably. Offerings of speculative-grade bonds have been at record levels, and  offerings of investment-grade bonds have strengthened. In  the household sector, fragmentary data suggest that the growth of  mortgage debt has continued around the relatively brisk first-quarter pace, while the growth of consumer credit has slowed on  balance. In  the  wake of  April's surprisingly large tax receipts, the Treasury built up  its cash  position and  paid down debt. Meanwhile, gross debt issuance by  state and local governments has been nearly matched by  retirements. The  monetary

aggregates were depressed in  May  by  the drawdown of  private deposits that occurred as federal tax  payments cleared, but growth has turned up  in  June.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of  nonfinancial corporate bonds increased in  May for  both investment-grade and speculative-grade securities (table). Investment-grade offerings were almost entirely merger related, including Norfolk Southern's $4-1/4 billion issue to  buy  part of Conrail. The  Norfolk offering was the largest single investmentgrade issue ever. Speculative-grade offerings returned to  the record level of  March, driven by  efforts of  telecommunications firms to finance the creation of infrastructure for  new  wireless and cable networks. Over the first five months of this year, junk bonds accounted for about 45 percent of total nonfinancial bond issuance, the highest share on  record (chart, lower left). The recent strength in  junk bond financings reflects both firms' needs to support ongoing capital spending and  an  apparent increased willingness of investors to assume the associated credit risk. Indeed, spreads of interest rates on  these securities over those on comparable Treasuries have narrowed a bit further in  recent months.

Merger-related issuance also boosted the volume of  nonfinancial commercial paper in  May and  the  early weeks of June, reversing some of the  April decline in  outstandings (chart, lower right). Several announced mergers and acquisitions are expected to lead to additional commercial paper issuance over the  near term.

Equity issuance by  nonfinancial firms picked up  somewhat in May, but average issuance for  April and  May  was about 30  percent less than the first-quarter rate and  more than 50 percent below last year's rapid pace. Initial public offerings (IPOs) remained sluggish in  May  but have strengthened in  June. Moreover, initial offer prices and  first-day returns have firmed somewhat this month, suggesting stronger investor demand than had  been evident earlier this year. Although some pickup in  equity offerings may  be  under way,  net issuance of  nonfinancial equity has remained negative. Announcements of  planned equity repurchases continued apace in  April and  May,  reflecting the cash-rich positions of large firms, and ongoing merger activity.

Recent information on  corporate credit quality has been mixed. In  April and  May, Moody's downgraded $24 billion more nonfinancial debt than it  upgraded. Most of the net downgrade is attributable to

merger-related transactions, with $22 billion reflecting downgrades of  CSX and  Norfolk Southern in  response to their accumulation of debt for the buyout of  Conrail. Business failures in  the nonfinancial sector also picked up in the first four months of  1997 (chart, top left). However, more positive signals continue to come from Moody's Watchlist, which shows possible upgrades slightly exceeding downgrades in  both number and  dollar value, and  from the continued low  default rate on  speculative-grade bonds (chart, top right).

According to initial NIPA estimates, the growth of  book  profits after-tax, the closest analogue to  the earnings measure in  financial reports, slowed in  the first quarter (chart, middle left panel). This estimate of  profits growth, however, looks low  compared with the gains implied by  first-quarter financial reports (chart, middle left panel), which are a  more important source of earnings information to  stock market analysts. Only a  handful of  companies-those whose fiscal quarters end  in  May--have reported second-quarter earnings thus far, and  market attention has been drawn to  preannouncements by  firms expecting to  report poorer-than-anticipated earnings. Thus, equity price indexes dipped when a  few technology companies warned recently about slower earnings growth.

Indeed, the recent dramatic rise in  stock prices has  been accompanied by  considerable volatility, as evidenced when concerns about Japanese investors precipitated a  190-point drop in  the Dow  on June 22 that was largely reversed the next day. On  balance, however, the market has continued its uptrend. Since the beginning of the year, the Dow  and  S&amp;P 500 have jumped roughly 20 percent, on net, while the  NASDAQ Composite and  the  Russell 2000 are up  about 10 percent. One important factor behind the current high level of stock prices appears to  be  the market's expectation of robust earnings growth over the  next three to five years. These expectations currently are at  a  level not seen since the early 1980s, at  the trough of  a  steep recession when earnings levels were extremely low (chart, middle right).

With the recent rise in  share prices, market valuations have become even richer relative to  bonds. The yield on  the thirty-year Treasury bond currently exceeds the S&amp;P 500 ratio of expected twelve-month-ahead earnings to  price by  an  amount last reached in mid-1991 (chart, bottom panel). At  the time, the earnings-price (E/P) ratio was depressed by  the low level of  earnings as  the

economy emerged from recession; no such explanation can  be  offered for the low  E/P ratio today.

Household Sector

Growth of  consumer credit increased in  April from the sluggish March pace. However, smoothing through the  monthly gyrations, the general pattern of  gradual moderation evident since early last year appears intact as growing repayments of seasoned loans constrain the growth of  debt outstanding (chart). Revolving credit--primarily credit card debt--advanced at less than  a  5 percent rate in  both March and  April. The  volatility of this component makes any twomonth period a  tenuous indicator of trend; however, the slowing of revolving credit growth over the  past year may  reflect, in  part, some firming of credit standards, as has been reported by  banks in surveys of lending.

Information on  the  growth of  home mortgage debt for the current quarter is  still sparse. The  rate of  mortgage purchases and securitizations at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in  April and  May slowed appreciably from the first-quarter pace. However, the  growth of total real estate loans at  commercial banks picked up  a bit in these months, partly reflecting continued strength in  home equity lending. Market reports also indicate that securitization of  home equity loans is  at  record levels and  now  exceeds that of auto loans and  credit card receivables.

Credit quality measures in  the household sector continue to send  mixed signals. Delinquency rates for bank credit card accounts and for car loans at captive auto finance companies hovered near or at record levels in  the first quarter--reflecting past liberalization of credit standards. However, delinquency rates for other categories of consumer lending have shown only  moderate increases, and  home  mortgage delinquencies are still fluctuating near twenty-year lows (chart).

According to the Call Report, credit card delinquencies at banks flattened out in  the first quarter, providing some hint that the steps taken by  card issuers in  recent months to  tighten credit availability may  be  slowing the erosion of credit quality. The credit card delinquency rate estimated by  the  American Bankers Association, which had set  new  records in  three of four quarters last year, fell in  the first quarter. Meanwhile, the charge-off

rate for credit cards at banks rose further in  the first quarter, indicating that weak accounts were still being purged from portfolios.

Personal bankruptcy filings recorded another sharp increase in the first quarter, rising at a 27  percent annual rate from the level of filings in  the fourth quarter. Bankruptcies exceeded 1 million last year for the first time and  are  on  pace to  reach 1.3 million this year. Still, the annual total represents only about 1 percent of all households, and  the  accompanying financial disruption has left no  clear imprint on  household spending. Carried to an  extreme, widespread use of  bankruptcy could  prompt severe curtailment of credit supply, but there is little evidence that such a  point is  at hand. For instance, while the  profitability of  credit card programs at banks has declined recently, net returns on  this line of  business as of the latest Call Report still exceeded the average net return for all business activities of  banks.

The marked deterioration in some measures of  consumer credit quality, together with  warnings from credit rating firms about emerging credit problems, has tempered investor enthusiasm in some sectors of  the asset-backed securities market. In  addition, concerns about the impact of  poor credit performance on  future earnings have depressed equity prices of a  number of  participants in the  subprime sector of this market. The rate of issuance of securities backed by  auto loans and credit card receivables has slowed sharply from last year's pace. Analysts report that one factor contributing to  the overall higher delinquency rate for securities backed by  auto loans is the increasing proportion of used-car loans in  securitized pools. While the issuance of securities backed by  credit card receivables and auto loans has slowed, the home equity loan sector of the asset-backed securities market continues to  experience near-record growth. In the first quarter, four out of every five loans backing home equity loan securitizations were classified as subprime.

Federal Government Finance

The  Treasury has  used the stronger-than-expected inflow of federal tax receipts and  higher surplus during the current quarter both to  make larger paydowns of  bills and  to  build up  its cash balance even  more than it had  anticipated. Even though the Treasury has slashed its weekly auctions of  bills to  under $15 billion, its cash balance at  the end of  June is still expected to  be  about

$47 billion, roughly $12 billion above the intended level announced in  late April. Bills outstanding have fallen substantially and  have been associated with some downward pressures on  the short end  of the yield curve, presumably reflecting a  scarcity premium. To  lessen those pressures and  to align its financing strategy with a  smaller expected deficit for the year, the Treasury recently announced that it  would remove the ten-year note from its  auction calendar for July and  October, in  effect reversing the debt-management changes instituted last year. The Treasury's decision makes room for a higher volume of  bill issuance in  coming quarters and  also gives it more scope to sell inflation-protected securities (TIPS). The  next offering of indexed debt, in  mid-July, will be  at  the five-year maturity, but the Treasury also announced plans to  add a  thirty-year maturity to its menu in  1998. The  Chicago Board of  Trade will inaugurate futures and options on  the five-year TIPS, coincident with the start of  when-issued trading in  the five-year indexed note early next month.

After slowing in  the first quarter when interest rates were rising, gross bond issuance by  federal agencies appears to  have rebounded in  April (table). Borrowing by  the Federal Home Loan Banks increased, in  part to fund the strong demand for advances by member institutions. Fannie Mae  and  Freddie Mac also reported increased borrowing to fund growth in  their mortgage holdings. Both agencies have continued to tap  global bond  markets, with recent offerings totaling a  combined $820 million.

State and  Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt eased some in  May, in  part as  borrowing to finance new  capital dropped back from its strong pace in  April (table). Long-term bond issuance thus far this year is  running about 2  percent behind the average pace set in  the first half of 1996. Meanwhile, retirements through May  were off 12 percent on  a  year-over-year basis, owing largely to  smaller paydowns of  advance-refunded debt. With fewer retirements, net long-term issuance has totaled about $13 billion so far this year, up from  about $4  billion over the same period in  1996.

Tax-exempt bond yields declined, on  balance, relative to comparable Treasury yields in the first five months of 1997 as a result of strong demand for  municipal bonds. The  decline in  recent weeks partly reflects the  market's anticipation of the seasonal

reduction of  net supply resulting from the heavy bond redemptions ($40 billion) scheduled for June and  July.

Financial Intermediaries and  Monetary Aggregates

Net  sales of long-term mutual funds increased in  May,  posting the largest net inflow since January (table). Net sales of equity funds accounted for  most of the rise, boosted last month by  stronger inflows to  aggressive growth funds and  growth funds. Sales of growth and  income funds--which invest in  large, well-known companies--remained robust and continued to  account for a  relatively large share of inflows to domestic stock funds. Inflows to  bond funds also increased in  May,  with  high-yield and  balanced bond  funds (which  have some equity exposure) accounting for  nearly the entire net inflow. Preliminary data suggest that sales of long-term mutual funds continued strong in  early June and  remained tilted toward relatively conservative stock funds and  high-yield bond funds.

Growth of the  monetary aggregates was weak in  May  but appears to  have rebounded in  June (table). M2  edged lower last month, a result of the clearing of  checks associated with the April 15 tax date, which prompted a  runoff of  household liquid deposits. Smoothing through the fluctuations caused by  tax  payments, M2 growth appears to  be  running at  about a  4-1/4 percent annual rate this quarter. The slowdown of  M2  growth in  May  showed through to  M3, which grew at only  a  1-1/4 percent rate. M3 growth in  May  also was held down by  weakness in  large time deposits, but the falloff in

this component appears to  have been reversed in  June. On  balance, M3 appears to  be running at about a  6-1/4 percent growth rate this quarter, keeping the level of M3 above its annual growth cone of 2 percent to 6 percent.

Growth of credit provided by  commercial banks slowed to a 5 percent annual rate in  May, less than half the pace in  April (table). Much of the slowing last month is attributable to  a  runoff in securities holdings. In  response to large deposit inflows in April--most likely tax-related--banks increased their investment in U.S. government obligations. These purchases were mostly reversed in  May as deposits fell when  payments cleared. Even so, averaging across the two  months, the annual growth rate of  adjusted securities holdings, about 10 percent, was still well above the first-quarter rate, and  data for early June suggest that growth of securities holdings remains fairly strong.

Loan growth picked up  in  May  as  business and real estate lending remained strong and consumer loan growth rebounded. The recent bounceback in  measured growth of  consumer loans likely better reflects the actual underlying rate of expansion, as growth of consumer loans in  March and  April was damped by  asset sales and  onetime accounting rule changes for which no  adjustments have been  made in the series. Partial data for June point to  a  continuation of fairly brisk loan growth, about in line with the  pace of the  past several months.

Anecdotal reports suggest that banks continue to offer favorable terms on  commercial real estate and  business loans. According to the Survey of  Terms of  Business Lending conducted in the first week of  May, the four-quarter moving average of  the spread of commercial and industrial loan rates over the intended federal funds rate remained near its low for the  decade (chart).

Exports of goods and services expanded 9  percent (SAAR) in 1997-Ql, led by  a  sharp rise in  exports of  capital goods and automotive products to  Canada (from strike-reduced levels in  the fourth quarter). Exports rose further in  April, with most of the increase in exports of  machinery and aircraft.

Imports of goods and services grew 14 percent (SAAR) in  the first quarter. Almost half of  the increase was in automotive imports (largely a  rebound from strike-reduced levels in  the fourth quarter). The remaining increase was spread though other major categories except oil, which declined in  the first quarter from a significantly upward-revised fourth-quarter level. Imports in  April also rose strongly; increases were recorded in  most major trade categories (consumer goods, industrial supplies, capital goods, and services). As in  the first quarter, the value of imported petroleum products declined.

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  oil imported declined 2-1/2 percent in 1997-Q1 from substantially upward-revised 1996-Q4 rates, but rose sharply in April. April imports were driven by  a  higher-than-normal seasonal inventory buildup that offset the slight decline in  oil consumption. Preliminary Department of Energy statistics indicate that oil imports remained strong in  May due to a continuation of a strong build-up in  oil inventories.

Deliveries of  oil from Iraq and mild weather put downward pressure on  prices during the first quarter; prices of imported oil declined substantially, partly reversing the very large increase recorded in  the fourth quarter of 1996. In  May, however, concerns about the renewal of  the Iraq oil-for-food arrangement put a  floor under those prices: Spot WTI rose $1.11 per barrel in  May, averaging $20.83 per barrel. Spot prices have been trading near the $19 per barrel level since the U.N. announced the extension of Iraq's limited oil shipments.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports dropped slightly in  May, continuing a  downward trend that began in  late 1995. The declines were in automotive products, computers, semiconductors, and other capital goods. Increases were recorded in  other categories. For April-May combined, non-oil import prices declined at  a  moderate rate, about the same as in the first quarter, with decreases in  all categories except foods.

Prices of  exports decreased slightly in  May following a slightly larger decline in  April. The decline in  May was attributable to lower prices for agricultural products, and, to a lesser degree, decreases in  prices of  computers, semiconductors, and automotive products. For April-May combined, export prices decreased moderately, whereas prices of  agricultural products declined sharply. Prices of nonagricultural exports were little changed in  April-May (as  in the previous two quarters) with moderate increases spread among major trade categories with the exception of computers and semiconductors.

U.S. Current Account

The U.S. current account deficit increased $16.4 billion (SAAR) in  the first quarter of 1997. An  increase in  the deficit on trade in  goods and services and a  shift to a  deficit in  net investment income more than offset a  decrease in  unilateral transfers. The shift in net investment income was primarily due to larger payments on  foreign assets in  the United States, while income on U.S. assets abroad was virtually unchanged. The reduction in net unilateral transfers in the first quarter reflected lower U.S. government grant disbursements, which were boosted in  the fourth quarter by the annual payment of  grants to Israel.

As is customary each June, estimates of U.S. international transactions were revised to incorporate updated source data and improved methodologies. These revisions lowered the deficit $15 to $19 billion in 1994 through 1996 and had much smaller effects on  the deficit in 1986 through 1993. For 1996, more than half of the $17 billion downward revision to the current account deficit was accounted for by substantial increases in  net investment income, mostly owing to higher estimated U.S. holdings of  foreign securities (discussed further in the next section) and, hence, larger receipts on those holdings. There were also significant increases in exports of services and decreases in  unilateral transfers.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Massive foreign private net purchases of U.S. securities continued in  April. (See line 4  of  the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) Demand for U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a) was strong, particularly from the Far East. Demand for U.S. government agency bonds also was strong in  April; agency bonds accounted for  more than half of private foreign net purchases of U.S. corporate and other bonds (line 4b). Private foreigners also continued to add to their holdings of U.S. corporate stocks in  April (line 4c), with purchases in  the first four months of 1997 exceeding the  total for all of 1996.

In contrast, U.S. residents were net sellers of foreign securities (line 5) in April. Net purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a), which were modest in  the first quarter of 1997, turned to substantial net sales in  April, largely to the United Kingdom. U.S.

net purchases of foreign stocks (line 5b) continued at a  substantial pace in  April: Japan and the United Kingdom accounted for more than half the total.

Foreign official holdings in the  United States (line 1) declined modestly in  April. in  contrast to generally large increases during the previous two years. The decline was more than accounted for by  countries outside the G-10 or  OPEC (line Ic), particularly Singapore and Argentina. Preliminary data from  ERBNY suggest only modest changes in  official holdings in  May as  well.

Banks in  the United States reported net capital inflows in April (line 3)  on  a  month-end basis. On  a  monthly-average basis, banks reported an  increase in  net liabilities to their own foreign offices and IBFs in  May. (See line 1 of  the International Banking Data table.) Both domestic and foreign-chartered banks shared in the  May net inflows.

Data recently released by  BEA indicate that both foreign direct investment in the United States and U.S. direct investment abroad were very strong in  the first quarter. (See lines 6 and 7 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) Mergers and acquisitions across international borders continue to  contribute to the strength of  these flows.

BEA revised up substantially its estimate of  the increase in U.S. nonbanks' deposits at  banks outside the United States in 1996. The outflow for 1996 now  amounts to  more than $60 billion. (See line 5 of the International Banking Data table.) Partial information suggests that outflows have continued in 1997. (See lines 3a  and b for more up  to date Federal Reserve data.)

BEA also has introduced a  number of improvements and revisions in  the data on U.S. international transactions. They incorporated the results of the Treasury Department's Benchmark Survey of U.S. Ownership of Foreign Long-Term Securities as of  March 31, 1994 in their estimates of  the international investment position of the United States (scheduled to  be released June 30) and, as discussed above, in  their estimates of income on portfolio investments and the current account. However, they have not revised the historical data on U.S. net purchases of foreign securities because they have no firm basis to establish the extent to  which their underestimates of U.S. holdings were the result of unreported capital outflows or underestimated capital gains.

BEA also has included an  estimate of changes in foreign holdings of U.S. currency in  the U.S. international accounts (line 8 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table). As a result of  the recording of these previously unrecorded capital inflows, the statistical discrepancy in  the accounts has been revised down substantially in  recent years. It was negative $46.9 billion in 1996.

Foreign Exchange Markets

The  weighted-average value of the dollar in  terms of  the other G-10 currencies has risen 1/4 percent since the day before the May 20 FOMC meeting. The dollar strengthened 3/4 percent against the  mark and  most other European currencies, and 1-1/2 percent against the Canadian dollar. However, the dollar depreciated 1-3/4 percent against sterling and 2  percent against the yen.

is  in  percentage points. P Preliminary.

The dollar was supported against the mark and other European currencies by growing perceptions that Italy, Spain, and Portugal will be included in the charter group of EMU members in 1999. These three countries are seen as having more tolerance for inflation than Germany, and thus their inclusion in  monetary union raises market concerns that the euro initially will be a  weak currency. Perceptions that EMU will be launched with a  softer currency were reinforced by the confluence of the leftist victory in  the French parliamentary elections and the aborted attempt by the German government to  transfer the capital gains from revaluation of the Bundesbank's gold reserves this year. The platform of the French Socialist party called for the inclusion of Italy, Spain, and Portugal in  first-round EMU membership. The  ill-fated gold revaluation plan followed news of  a  shortfall in German tax revenues and was seen as signalling German willingness to employ fiscal gimmicks as a  means of  meeting the EMU convergence criteria, a development that would make it more difficult to deny others admission to EMU. Further German budget proposals are expected in July.

The dollar weakened against the yen as  economic indicators in the United States generally suggested a  slowdown in U.S. economic activity in  the second quarter. The yen  was supported on June 25 by the stronger-than-expected Tankan report. In  addition, market concerns over prospects of  a  ballooning Japanese current account surplus reportedly contributed to the yen's stronger tone. Since the last FOMC meeting, the yen has appreciated 3 percent against the mark and 2-1/2 percent on a  multilateral trade-weighted basis.

During the intermeeting period short-term interest rates were little changed in  foreign G-10 countries except in  the  United Kingdom and Switzerland. The nearly 40 basis point rise in U.K. short-term rates reflects the 25 basis point increase in official rates by the Bank of  England on  June 6, and expectations of  further near-term tightening by the Bank. Monetary authorities in Switzerland guided Swiss short-term rates about 30 basis points lower following the appreciation of the Swiss franc, brought on by EMU jitters, in late May.

Favorable inflation data in  Italy and Spain, as well as the increased likelihood that those countries will be  included in EMU

in  1999,  contributed  to the  1/4  percentage  point  decline  in  Italian and  Spanish  long-term interest  rates  over the  intermeeting period. Despite more  favorable odds  of broad-based EMU,  long-term rates  were little changed  in Germany  and  other  "core"  European countries. Japanese long-term rates declined early in the period  as  softerthan-expected data on  industrial  production, machinery orders,  and employment  led market  participants to conclude that  the pace of Japanese economic activity in  the second  quarter  slumped more than initially expected, albeit  following stronger-than-expected  growth in  the first quarter. However, Japanese  long-term rates backed up following the release  of the  stronger-than-expected Tankan report, and  ended  the period  little changed on  balance. Canadian long-term interest  rates declined  1/2  percentage point due  largely to the victory by  the Liberal  Party in the federal  election on June 2 and the  subsequent  reappointment  of Finance Minister Martin, which reinforced market  perceptions that  fiscal  consolidation will continue in that country.

The Desk did not intervene  in the foreign exchange market over  the intermeeting period. Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Indicators for the  second quarter suggest that,  on average, economic activity has continued  at a healthy pace in  the major foreign  industrial  countries. Expansions  remain robust in  the United Kingdom and  Canada following strong first-quarter performances. Improving growth in Germany, France, and  Italy appears  to have offset a temporary slowing in Japan that was associated with the  increase in the consumption tax in April.

Inflationary pressures  generally remain subdued in the foreign industrial countries. CPI  inflation is  under  2 percent  in Germany, France,  Italy, and Canada. In Japan, the  increase in the consumption tax was  responsible for a rise in the  twelve-month change in the CPI to about  1-1/2  percent. In  the United Kingdom, CPI  inflation has  eased,  largely reflecting  a decline in food  and energy prices and  recent  sterling appreciation.

On June  1, a coalition of Socialist,  Communist, and  other leftist-parties won control  of the French National Assembly, ushering in  a period of  "cohabitation" with Conservative President

Chirac. The leftist-government remains committed to  EMU. but with broad membership and a  more flexible interpretation of  the Maastricht criteria. In Canada's June 2  federal election, the Liberal-Party government was returned to power by a  slim majority; the new government continues to emphasize fiscal deficit reduction.

Individual country notes. In  Japan, GDP surged during the first quarter, led by  strong consumption growth. The rise in consumption was the largest in  over 30 years as  households frontloaded expenditures in anticipation of the April 1  increase in  the consumption tax from 3  percent to 5  percent. Aggregate investment, by  contrast, fell sharply. Increased machinery and equipment investment was more than offset by  the sharp decline in residential investment and a 40  percent drop in  public investment. Net exports continued to  make a  positive contribution to GDP; the growth rates of imports and exports, however, were below those registered in  the fourth quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

Economic activity during the second quarter has slowed as consumers have curbed expenditures following the first-quarter surge. In  April, industrial production continued to decline, unemployment rose slightly, and new  car registrations plummeted. The  current account surplus increased to $8.1 billion, from $3.9 billion in March, and the trade surplus widened in  April and May. Import volumes declined from year-earlier levels, reflecting sluggish domestic demand in the aftermath of  the consumption tax

increase, and export volumes rose sharply. As expected, however, indications suggest that the current weakness in  economic activity is temporary. Private machinery orders, a  key leading indicator, increased strongly in April, led by export orders. New car registrations in  May regained about half of  April's decline. The Bank of Japan's June survey (Tankan) showed an  improving outlook for large manufacturing firms, with the diffusion index rising to 7. The diffusion indices for other classes of firms remained negative, but were generally stronger than anticipated in  the previous survey. Underlying inflationary pressures appear to remain subdued, despite a  jump in the price level after the consumption tax increase.

In recent weeks, progress has been made in  implementing Prime Minister Hashimoto's "Big Bang" financial reform program and related legal reforms. In  mid-June, the Diet gave final approval to  the Bank of  Japan Reform Law  enhancing the independence of  the Central Bank and increasing the transparency of its policymaking process. Legislation transferring much of the  Ministry of  Finance's responsibility for supervising financial institutions to a  new, independent regulatory authority was also approved in  mid-June. Finally, on June 13, three government advisory panels proposed a timetable for further financial sector reforms, including

liberalizing the activities of banks, brokerages and insurers by 2001, and lifting the prohibition on financial holding companies.

Economic activity in Germany expanded at an  annual rate of 1.8 percent in  the first quarter, a  bounce-back from the tepid 0.3 percent growth registered in  the fourth quarter of last year. The sources of growth in domestic demand were government spending, investment in machinery and equipment, and inventories (a  pure residual in  the German national accounts and highly subject to revision); strength in  these components offset the significant decline in  construction that resulted from the harsh winter weather. Although exports continued to rise at a  healthy pace, the rise in imports was nearly as rapid, and the external sector contributed little on  balance to growth.

<!-- missing-text -->

Economic indicators available for the second quarter suggest that the expansion is continuing at a  healthy pace. Industrial production rose again in April and real manufacturing orders surged, boosted by  orders from both domestic and foreign firms. The IFO business climate survey, an  indicator of  current and expected conditions in  industry, continued to improve in  April, with the index firmly in  the positive range for the first time in  two years. However, the labor market worsened again in  May, as  total unemployment edged above the 4.3 million (SA) level and the allGerman unemployment rate rose to 11.4 percent. Consumer price

inflation in  Germany remains subdued, with inflation registering 1.6 percent over the year to  May.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent fiscal developments suggest that the government must close a  budgetary gap on the order of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point of GDP in order to reduce the general government deficit to the Maastricht reference level of 3  percent of  GDP this year. Now  that the revaluation of  the Bundesbank's gold and foreign exchange reserves has been ruled out as a  possible means of  reducing the deficit in 1997, it is not clear what initiatives will be  pursued. The government continues to reiterate its commitment to satisfying strictly the Maastricht deficit criterion. The Finance Ministry could close a  small budgetary gap  with minor measures, such as a freeze on  federal expenditures and the shifting of  payments to  the EU  from the fourth quarter to the first quarter of  next year. If the  budgetary gap is on the  high side, other more substantial measures will be  more difficult to implement without causing a further rift in the government's ruling coalition.

In  France, first-quarter real GDP increased 0.8 percent (SAAR) after having expanded at the same pace in  the fourth quarter. Strength from net exports more than offset a  decline in  total domestic demand. Consumption retraced some of the fourth-quarter decline associated with the expiration of  a  government car-buying

incentive program. Fixed investment by  firms and households declined, and inventories contributed negatively.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent indicators point to  a  pick-up in economic activity this quarter, coupled with favorable calendar effects that are expected to  boost measured second-quarter GDP growth. Business surveys suggest that manufacturing output strengthened further in  April and May, mostly on robust foreign orders, and inventory levels have dipped below their long-run average. Industrial production increased sharply in  April on continued strength in  manufacturing output and a  strong bounce in energy production, which had damped the overall index during the previous two months. Consumer spending in  April also expanded at a  robust pace. In  recent months, the unemployment rate has held steady at a  high level, and consumerprice inflation through May remained subdued.

In an apparent expression of  discontent with fiscal austerity and high unemployment, the French electorate ousted the previous center-right majority in the  National Assembly on  June 1. Conservative President Chirac must now "cohabitate" with a  leftistcoalition government. Socialist Prime Minister Jospin has formed a cabinet that includes ministers from the Socialist, Communist, and Green parties. In  his first address to  the National Assembly on

<!-- missing-text -->

June 19, Jospin broadly outlined the new government's policy; the government will respect the Maastricht Treaty timetable, present a corrective mini-budget for 1997 this autumn, and organize a  jobs conference among unions and employers to  address labor market conditions. The mini-budget will be  based on  the findings of an audit of  the public sector finances to  be  completed in July; this budget will likely overshoot the Maastricht 3-percent reference value.

Real GDP In the United Kingdom grew 3.8 percent (SAAR) in  the first quarter. As  was widely expected, the composition of expenditure confirmed that domestic demand expanded at a  robust pace, while net exports subtracted from growth.

More recent indicators suggest that growth continues at  a robust pace. Industrial production rebounded in  April, with manufacturing output rising 0.6 percent, as strong domestic demand appeared to  be  offsetting sterling-related weakness in exports. However, business confidence has fallen in recent months, largely on expectations of  weak export demand. Consumer demand remains strong. For April and May  on  average, retail sales were up 1.3 percent from their average level in the first quarter. Consumer confidence rose sharply in  May and somewhat further in June. The unemployment rate in  May fell to its lowest level since September 1990.

The twelve-month rate of  increase in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments remained 2.5 percent in  May, meeting the

As  part  of  the  reform  of the  Bank  of England, Chancellor  of the  Exchequer Gordon  Brown  appointed  Professor harles  Goodhart, C

Dr. DeAnne Julius, Sir Alan Budd, and Professor Willem Buiter as the outside members of the Bank's new independent Monetary Policy Committee. At the first meeting of the new  Committee on  June 6, official interest rates were raised another 25 basis points. Chancellor Brown also announced that supervision of  Britain's banking sector would be  transferred from the Bank of  England to a newly strengthened Securities and Investments Board, which will be chaired by  current Bank Deputy Governor Howard Davies. On June 12, Brown announced that the government's inflation target would be 21/2 for underlying inflation, altering slightly the previous target of  under 2-1/2 percent. However, if inflation diverges from the target by  more than one percentage point in  either direction, a public letter should be written by  the Governor of the Bank of England explaining the reasons why  inflation has deviated from the target, the policy actions being undertaken, and the period within which inflation is expected to return to the target.

In Italy, real GDP declined a  provisional 1.2 percent (SAAR) in  the first quarter. (Details will not be  available until July 4 when ISTAT will release final data.) This was the second quarter in a  row in  which a  decline was registered. Economic activity in the first quarter was more sluggish than monthly indicators had indicated. Industrial production and business sentiment rose during the quarter, and consumer confidence recovered somewhat in January-February. Given the pick-up in  industrial production, consumer spending and the improvements in  the trade surplus, it is likely that part of the first-quarter decline resulted from inventory decumulation. Unfavorable calendar effects also contributed.

In  the second quarter, monthly indicators, which are scarce at this stage, point to a  pick-up in activity. Industrial production rose in  April to its highest level since 1995. Business sentiment, which had risen significantly in the first quarter, remained relatively high in  April. Consumer confidence, after having improved significantly in  the first quarter, remained little changed in the second quarter. Moreover, positive calendar effects in the second quarter will provide a  modest impetus to  measured GDP, which is not adjusted for this factor.

<!-- missing-text -->

Inflation continues to decline. In  June, the twelve-month rise in consumer prices --of  1.5 percent --was the lowest since the late 1960s. Inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued given continued moderation in  producer prices, a  sizeable output gap, and lagged effects of  lira appreciation.

On May 30, the Italian cabinet approved its three-year financial and economic planning document. If  the stated objectives are realized, the budget deficit as a  share of GDP  will fall from 6.8 percent in 1996 to 2.8 percent in 1998 and to 1.8 percent in 2000. The document also contains details of  deficit-cutting

measures worth $15 billion equivalent (approximately 1-1/2 percent of GDP) that will be  implemented next year in order to reach the 2.8 percent deficit/GDP target. Two-thirds of the $15 billion package will come from spending cuts, and the remaining one-third from revenue-raising measures.

Real GDP in  Canada rose 3.4 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, following growth of 2.9 percent in  the fourth quarter of 1996. Final domestic demand rose 6.6 percent, driven by  strong gains in  business investment in  machinery and equipment, consumption expenditures, and housing investment. A  decline in  the pace of inventory accumulation subtracted from growth, as did net exports. Exports, which dropped in the fourth quarter owing mainly to the GM strike, rebounded sharply as activity in  the automobile industry returned to normal. However, imports also increased sharply, in part due to a  sharp pick-up in imports of automobile parts, but also due to  a  surge in imports of computers and other machinery and equipment.

<!-- missing-text -->

Preliminary indicators for the second quarter point to continued expansion. Retail sales in  April advanced strongly. Employment edged up again in  April and May, but the unemployment rate remained elevated owing to an  increase in labor force participation. Housing starts, however, fell on average in  April and May to a  level about 4  percent below their first-quarter average. The rate of consumer price inflation continued to moderate in  May.

In the federal election on  June 2,  Liberal Prime Minister Jean Chrétien's government was re-elected with a  slim majority. The Liberals won 155 of the 301 seats in  Parliament, just four more seats than needed for a  majority, and far short of the 177 seats won in  the 1993 federal election. On  June 11, Chrétien announced his new cabinet. Most notably, Paul Martin was reappointed as Finance Minister, indicating that fiscal policy would continue to focus on deficit reduction.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

Growth in recent months has been generally healthy in  most major Latin American and Asian countries. In  Argentina and Mexico, growth remains strong, though it has slowed somewhat in Mexico, and Venezuela shows signs of  a  recovery; growth has been uneven in Brazil. Industrial production has picked up recently in  China, Taiwan, and Korea. In  Russia, indications continue that the economy is on the verge of a  turnaround, as GDP and industrial production appear to  have leveled off in recent months. Inflation performance has been good in  most cases other than in Venezuela and has been at historic lows in Brazil.

Strong growth in imports led to  a  decline in  the trade balances of  Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, Venezuela, and Taiwan. By contrast, strong exports led to  an improvement in  the trade balances of  China and Korea. In Thailand, the government imposed capital controls to counter the downward pressure on the currency.

Individual country notes. In Mexico, we  estimate that real GDP grew at  a  6  percent annual rate in  the first quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis (and adjusted for fewer working days due to  Easter week falling in  March), about half the torrid pace in  the second half of last year but still a  bit stronger than had been expected. The industrial sector continued to lead the recovery while the services sector lagged. Industrial production rose 9.7 percent in  the March-April period from the same period a  year earlier. That is slower than the 12.8 percent growth rate in  the fourth quarter.

Further evidence for strength in  domestic demand was provided by  a  recent pickup in imports and consequent narrowing of the trade surplus to $50 million in  April and $88 million in  May, compared with $565 million in  March. Consumer price inflation moved below a 1  percent monthly rate in  May  for the first time since the December 1994 devaluation. The stability of the peso has contributed to  the moderation in inflation, but also to the  narrowing of  the trade surplus and to  tensions in Mexico over exchange rate policy.

On  June 3,  the Mexican government announced a  medium-term program that outlined government objectives for key economic variables through the year 2000. The government's target for real GDP growth rises steadily from 4.5 percent in  1997 to 5.6 percent in

2000. The GDP expansion is to  be fueled primarily by  investment and exports, with consumption recovering gradually. Investment as a percent of GDP is targeted to increase from 20.9 percent in 1996 to 25.4 percent in 2000. Part of  that will be  financed by  domestic savings, which are targeted to grow from 20.4 percent of GDP in 1996 to 22.2 percent in 2000, while the current account deficit is expected to increase from 0.9 percent of  GDP in 1996 to  3.2 percent in 2000. The government expects foreign direct investment to  be sufficient to finance the current account deficit. Fiscal policy is to remain tight, with the overall government budget deficit below 1 percent of  GDP through 2000, and  monetary policy is  to  be consistent with a  steady decline in  the inflation rate target from 15 percent in 1997 to 7.5 percent in 2000. This medium-term plan is expected to be the basis for a  new Extended Fund Facility agreement with the IMF.

The Mexican government announced on  June 17 that it will prepay in  August all $6  billion of  the five-year floating rate notes that it issued in  August 1996. Those notes, like the  U.S. Treasury loans that they refinanced, are backed by  the proceeds of Mexican oil exports. The funds for the  prepayment will come from proceeds of  previous bond sales, new debt sales, and a  commercial bank loan. It is a  significant indication of improved investor sentiment toward Mexico over the past year that it can replace collateralized debt with uncollateralized debt at lower cost and longer maturity.

In  Argentina, economic activity continues to grow at a  healthy pace. Real GDP grew 8.1 percent in  the first quarter of 1997 from

the same period a  year ago, and has just now recovered to its level reached in late 1994, before the recession induced in  part by the Mexican crisis. Industrial production in  May was up 5.3 percent over a  year earlier. The recent growth in  activity was led by investment, which grew almost 30 percent in the first quarter over a year ago. Despite strong growth, inflation remains subdued. Consumer prices fell for the third consecutive month in  May, bringing the twelve-month inflation rate down to 0.6 percent. Unemployment remains a  problem, as evidenced by several recent protests in different parts of the country against poverty and joblessness. and it could hurt the government in the autumn congressional elections.

<!-- missing-text -->

The pace of growth of exports has slowed somewhat but imports continue to expand at a  rapid rate. As a  result, the trade balance moved from near zero in  the fourth quarter of 1996 to  a  deficit of $0.2 billion in  the first quarter of 1997. In  April, there was a surplus of $0.1 billion. International reserves also continue to recover and  were about $18 billion (excluding gold) at  the end of May, roughly 30  percent higher than a  year ago.

In  other developments, the process of  foreign buy-outs continues in  the banking industry, with two purchases of Argentine banks by  Spanish financial institutions in  May.

In Brazil, inflation has remained at an  historical low and growth has been uneven, as declines in  GDP and industrial production in  the first quarter were followed by  a  surge in  industrial

production in  April. Real GDP fell by 2.2 percent in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.), after three quarters of  very strong growth. Strong growth in  the service sector offset to some extent declines in output in  other sectors. The seasonal adjustment for firstquarter growth may not have completely accounted for the smaller number of  working days in  March this year because of  the Easter holiday period. This may  explain in part the strong growth in industrial output in  April, when production grew 3.5 percent (s.a. not at an annual rate). Strong growth in  both sales and output in April were also boosted by  purchases made in  anticipation of  new taxes on  credit and imports, which the government imposed in late April and early May. The taxes were aimed at reducing the demand for autos and other durable goods, the two  major sources of upward pressures on  imports.

The taxes contributed to an improvement in the trade balance in  May. However, the current account deficit for the year through May  was nearly $13 billion, more than double the level reached over the same period in 1996. International reserves stood at $59.3 billion at  the end of  May, up  by  nearly $3 billion from April. Reserves were boosted by  capital inflows, which prompted the central bank to  purchase foreign exchange to mitigate upward pressures on the real.

On  June 4, Brazil issued about $2.8 billion (market value) of a  30-year dollar-denominated bond at  395 basis points over U.S. Treasury securities. The government sold about one-quarter of the bonds for cash, and the rest were swapped for three types of  Brady

bonds, with about $2.7 billion (face value) of  Bradys consequently retired. These transactions were aimed at reducing Brazil's debtservicing costs. Before this issue, the Brazilian government's longest uncollateralized bond outstanding had been a  five-year bond.

In early June, Congress approved an  amendment to  the Constitution that allows an incumbent president to run for reelection, which paves the way for President Cardoso to  run for a second term. Cardoso has been highly popular because of  the fall in inflation under the anti-inflation plan, the Plano Real. Thus, the prospect that Cardoso will be reelected has boosted the perception that the economic reform process will continue in Brazil.

In Venezuela, one year after the announcement of an IMF-backed package of free-market oriented reforms, there are signs that economic activity is picking up. While there is a  lack of timely data on  output, indicators of aggregate demand point to a  pickup; automobile sales and imports are rising at  a  rapid pace and bank lending grew by  9.7 percent in  May over April. Inflation is rising, as expected, in  the wake of recently authorized increases in public and private sector wages, including a  44 percent rise in  the minimum wage. Consumer prices rose 3.1 percent in  May and have risen by about 13 percent since the start of the year. Several increases in government-controlled prices are pending, which will put further pressure on inflation for the rest of the year.

The government continues to follow a  strong bolivar policy to try to curb inflation, despite its negative impact on  non-oil exports. This factor, together with strong import growth of  nearly 40 percent in the first quarter, led to a  non-oil trade deficit of $1.4 billion in  the first quarter of 1997, compared with a  deficit

of  $0.8 billion in  the same period last year. International reserves (excluding gold) at the end of  May were $12.6 billion, compared with $6.4 billion a  year previously.

In  mid-June, the Venezuelan Congress gave its final approval to  a  Labor Law  reform bill that will increase labor market flexibility in  the long run, but increase government spending in  the short run because of the cost of  liquidating the old severance pay system. Also in June, Venezuela launched a  $315 million 10-year Eurobond, which was priced at about 270 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasury securities. At about the same time, Standard and Poor's raised its rating of  Venezuela's long-term foreign currency debt to  B+ from B.

In China, inflation continued to moderate, and the trade surplus continued to grow. Twelve-month consumer price inflation of 2.8 percent in  April was the lowest level since 1991. In  the first five months of 1997, the trade surplus was $13.9 billion, compared with a  deficit of $0.5 billion in  the year-earlier period. The dollar value of exports rose 26 percent, while the value of  imports fell by 1 percent. Chinese reports continue to stress the importance of  base-year effects in explaining the export surge and import fall: the first half of 1996 had the reverse pattern of falling exports and surging imports, when China cut the  VAT rebate rate on exports. International reserves were $117 billion in  April, up $10 billion from the beginning of  the year.

In  May and June, in response to rapid equity price increases in 1996 and early 1997, China put in  place various policies to  try to restrain the stock market. First, it announced an increase in the quota of  new share issues for 1997. Second, it banned state enterprises and listed firms from short-term "speculative" stock

trading. Third, it began to tighten restrictions on  bank involvement in stock trading. In  the second half of  May, all of the share indices fell more than 10 percent from their mid-May peak before leveling off. As of  June 24, however, domestic shares were still up by  40 percent from the beginning of  the year.

In Taiwan, strong growth continued in  the first five months of 1997, while prices remained flat. In  the first quarter, real GDP rose 6.8 percent from the year-earlier period, continuing the economic recovery that was evident in  the second half of 1996. Industrial production growth continued robustly in  April and May. Consumer prices in  April and May  were less than 1  percent higher than their year-earlier level. Strong import growth contributed to a  narrowing of  Taiwan's trade surplus to $3.2 billion in the first five months of 1997, compared with a  surplus of $5.3 billion in  the year-earlier period. Exports rose 4  percent, while imports rose 10 percent. Foreign-exchange reserves stood at $89 billion in  April, up less than $1  billion from the beginning of 1997.

On  June 16, Korea's Finance Minister released the final draft of  the government's proposals for financial sector reforms. Under the proposals, three existing supervisory agencies for the banking, securities, and insurance sectors will be  integrated into a  unified agency under the Prime Minister. Other proposals increase the central bank's independence by stipulating that the Bank of Korea's governor replace the finance minister as head of  the Monetary Board, the top  monetary policymaking body, and by  banning government officials from sitting on the Board. The central bank governor would be  asked to  set annual targets for inflation and would be  held

responsible for meeting those targets. The proposals have to be approved by  Parliament, and their prospects remain uncertain.

The current account deficit on  a  non-seasonally adjusted basis has been on a  downward trend since the beginning of the  year ($1.7 billion in  April versus $3.1 billion in  January); customs-cleared trade numbers for May  indicate a  continuation of the trend. Industrial production in  April grew at a  robust rate of  nearly 11 percent (year-over-year), with strong growth registered in  key industries such as computer chips and automobiles. Inflation remained moderate at  about 4  percent (year-over-year) in  May.

Thailand's deputy prime minister and finance minister, Mr. Amnuay Viravan, resigned on  June 19 after the cabinet reversed his decision to raise excise taxes to reduce the country's budget deficit. Following news of  the resignation, the stock market declined by  about 4  percent, and the baht depreciated by  about 10 percent. The minister was part of  a  five-member "dream team" of skilled technocrats appointed after the elections last November to remedy Thailand's economic problems. The economy has been in disarray since mid-1996, with exports showing no growth, finance companies and banks in  trouble over imprudent lending to  the property sector, and the  baht under attack. The new  Finance minister, Thanong Bidaya, has pledged to  pursue the fiscal and monetary policies of  his predecessor, saying they were mostly on the right track in  tackling Thai economic problems. Bidaya is Thailand's sixth finance minister since 1995.

In  mid-May, the government resorted to capital controls to counter an attack on the baht. By  forcing Thai banks to stop lending baht to foreigners without "genuine underlying business,"

the Bank of  Thailand segmented the onshore and offshore markets for the  baht. However, these steps have undermined the government's plan to lower interest rates; overnight interest rates have remained in  the range of 13 to 14 percent, compared with an average of  about 8  percent in  the month preceding the recent crisis. Spillover effects of  the baht crisis on other countries appear to  be receding. In  Malaysia and the Philippines, overnight interest rates had shot up  to about 20 percent around the time of  the crisis, but they have since started to fall. In  Malaysia, overnight interest rates are back to their pre-crisis levels, but are substantially above precrisis levels in  the Philippines.

In Russia, recent data present a  relatively favorable picture of the economy. After years of declines, output and industrial production have been flat this year, while inflation has fallen steadily and the ruble has remained stable. During the first five months of this year, year-on-year GDP growth rates hovered around zero, while industrial production growth was positive, though less than 1 percent. Consumer prices rose only 0.9 percent in  May from April, and were 15 percent higher than a  year earlier. Also, the ruble-dollar exchange rate continues to remain well within the corridor set by  the Central Bank.

Russia  continues o  have fiscal oblems, especially    the t pr on revenue side. Tax  revenues  are  significantly  ow target less bel ( than 70 percent of  the target for the first quarter) and arrears continue to accumulate. There has been some progress in recent weeks, however, as a  result of  increased government pressure on enterprises.  azprom,  one of Russia's  iggest ebtors,  reportedly G b d

paid off all of its federal tax arrears, some $2.6 billion, in  midJune (they still owe money to other federal bodies such as the pension fund) and arrangements are being negotiated with other firms. Two measures aimed at restoring fiscal balance are now under consideration by  the Communist-dominated Duma. The first is a  plan to cut one-fifth (equivalent to $18.8 billion) of  budgeted expenditures, and the second is a  new tax code that already forms the basis for the government's 1998 budget.

The IMF resumed lending to  Russia in  mid-May with the disbursement of  almost $700 million equivalent. In early June, the World Bank approved nearly $820 million in loans for Russia, the largest of  which is a  $600 million Structural Adjustment Loan that will support wide-ranging reforms.
