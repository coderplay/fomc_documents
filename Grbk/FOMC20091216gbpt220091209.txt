Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The recovery in economic activity appears to be gaining momentum.  Consumer spending posted a robust gain in October, and sales of  light vehicles climbed again in November.  Sales of both new and existing homes also registered solid increases in October, and inventories of unsold new homes fell further.  Although spending on nonresidential structures continued to contract sharply in October, shipments of capital goods have leveled off, on balance, in recent months.  At the same time, industrial production has continued to rebound from the low level reached earlier in the year. Moreover, the decline in private payroll employment in November was the smallest since the start of the recession, and the unemployment rate ticked down.  Nonetheless, the jobless rate and other estimates of slack in resource utilization remained substantial in recent months, and consumer sentiment indexes were still at low levels.  Meanwhile, a sharp rise in energy prices pushed top-line inflation higher, even as the rise in core consumer prices remained subdued.

Labor Market Developments

The pace of job loss has slowed considerably in recent months relative to the steep drops that occurred in the first half of the year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment declined an estimated 18,000 in November after three months in which declines averaged about 140,000 per month.  Moreover, the recent improvement in the employment situation was widespread across most industries.  Of particular note, the temporary help services industry-often considered a bellwether of developments in the labor market-added nearly 40,000 jobs per month during the past three months.  Employers also appear to have begun lengthening workweeks, which can be a precursor to a pickup in hiring.  The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers rose 0.2 hour to 33.2 hours in November, and aggregate hours worked for this group increased 0.6 percent, the first significant increase since the recession began.

As with the payroll data, key measures of labor market slack from the household survey have continued to weaken over the past several months, on balance, but more gradually than earlier in the year.  Between June and November, the unemployment rate moved up ½ percentage point to 10 percent after having risen more than 2 percentage points in the first half of the year.   Likewise, the fraction of workers working part time for economic reasons has increased only slightly in the second half of the year.  However, the labor force participation rate, which held steady earlier in the recession, has moved down steeply since the spring.

The slower rise in the unemployment rate since midyear primarily reflects a moderation in layoffs rather than an improvement in hiring.  Both initial claims for unemployment insurance and the number of new job losers have fallen over the past several months. The rate of layoffs and discharges from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey has also moved down from its highs last winter, but its progress has been more erratic.

In contrast, hiring conditions remain weak.  Measures of job openings have been basically unchanged since April, and indicators of both actual and planned hiring are still near the depressed levels seen at the start of the year.  As a result, the average length of ongoing unemployment spells has risen steeply, and joblessness has become increasingly concentrated among those out of work for more than 26 weeks.  Rising unemployment duration is also reflected in the increasing share of total claimants for unemployment insurance who are receiving extended or emergency benefits.  Indeed, even as the number of persons receiving unemployment insurance benefits through regular state programs has been declining for some time, the total number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance-including extended and emergency benefits-only recently appears to have leveled off.

Other indicators of the labor market have continued to deteriorate, including the number of firms reporting hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey and individuals' perceptions of current job availability from the Conference Board Survey.  However, households' expectations of future labor market conditions have changed little, on net, in recent months and remain well above the low point reached earlier this year.

The staff estimates that output per hour of all persons in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 7.3 percent in the third quarter-as hours declined sharply and output expanded-following a similarly large increase in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of this year, labor productivity is estimated to have increased 3.8 percent.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) edged up in October after increasing at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the third quarter.  In November, data on production worker hours as well as the available data on physical output suggest that IP rose solidly.  Since the June trough in IP, production gains have been widespread; indeed, in well over half of the individual series that make up the index, the level of production in October was higher than three months earlier.  Recent production gains have reflected a surge in output for motor vehicles and parts (and the resulting demand for intermediate materials), a slowing pace of inventory liquidation elsewhere, and rising export demand.

Despite the gains in production, the degree of manufacturing slack remains considerable. Although the factory operating rate in October, at 67.6 percent, was 2½ percentage points above its all-time low in June, it nevertheless remained 1 percentage point below its previous low (reached in December 1982).

After having moved up in September, the production of light motor vehicles fell back to an annual rate of 6.8 million units in October and appears to have edged up in November. Although stocks of domestic light vehicles expanded in both October and November, the recent increases in the pace of sales reduced days' supply at the end of November to 55 days, a level that is significantly below the industry target of about 65 days. Production schedules call for output to climb to an annual rate of 7.4 million units in December and then to remain at that level in the first quarter of 2010.

Industrial production in the high-tech sector edged up, on balance, over the three months through October as solid increases in semiconductor output outweighed the weakness in production of computers and communication equipment.  However, recently released data on shipments of PCs and servers, which have not yet been incorporated in published IP, suggest that the production of mobile computers and servers jumped in the third quarter and that computer production is likely to be revised up.  In contrast, production in the communications equipment segment of the industry has been weak, partly reflecting a

decline in the production of wireless infrastructure equipment, which had surged earlier in the year.  Upstream, the solid gains in the production of semiconductors reflect some restocking after the enormous production declines early in the year as well as a bounceback in global chip demand.

Looking ahead, comments from high-tech consultancies and manufacturers suggest that global high-tech demand for computers has continued to improve this quarter.    In 1 addition, orders and shipments of circuit boards-which are used in a wide variety of electronic products-have continued to move up, on balance.  Some semiconductor producers could find a further brisk pickup in demand difficult to meet because utilization rates at some leading-edge facilities have already rebounded to elevated levels and days' supply has fallen substantially.  In fact, shortages of certain types of memory chips have been reported recently.

The output of energy rose again in October.  Moreover, available data for November suggest that drilling activity moved up for a fourth consecutive month, and oil extraction rose for a fifth consecutive month.  The boost to both drilling and extraction activity was likely spurred by the rise in oil prices this year.

Outside of energy, transportation, and high-tech industries, output was flat in October after increasing 4¼ percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Production of consumer goods moved up in October, as gains in nondurables more than offset decreases in durables.  In addition, materials output edged up.  By contrast, the output of construction supplies, business supplies, and business equipment each declined for a second consecutive month.

The available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity, on net, suggest that factory output will expand further in the coming months.  The monthly diffusion index of new orders from the national ISM survey remained in a range that suggests solid increases in production, while the orders indexes from the regional surveys were broadly consistent with moderate gains in manufacturing output.  By contrast, the staff series on real adjusted durable goods orders declined in October relative to three months earlier.

In the recent ISM Semiannual Economic Forecast, the diffusion index of capital spending plans jumped to a moderate level from its record low in the spring.  This reading is consistent with little change in capital spending in the manufacturing sector next year and with another sizable contraction in factory capacity.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending has continued to recover.  Real PCE climbed 0.4 percent in October following a solid increase in the third quarter.  Moreover, the gains in October were broad based:  Outlays for motor vehicles bounced back almost 9 percent after a sharp decline in September, spending on other goods rose 0.1 percent, and spending on services advanced 0.3 percent, the largest monthly increase in more than a year.   More recently, sales of new light vehicles rose an additional 500,000 units in November to an annual rate of 10.9 million units despite less generous cash rebates and finance incentives this quarter.  Other indicators of spending in November, including data on chain store sales and credit card transaction volumes, were mixed, but generally pointed to another increase in outlays.

While spending has rebounded, the fundamentals of household demand have remained soft.  Although household net worth moved up in the third quarter, households have lost wealth equivalent to more than 1½ years of income over the past two years and are likely still adjusting their spending to that loss.  In addition, real labor compensation, which plunged in the first quarter, declined modestly, on net, over the second and third quarters, largely reflecting decreases in aggregate hours worked.   In the current quarter, the 2 available data suggest that a jump in energy prices has erased the modest gains in nominal labor income.  Nevertheless, disposable income has been supported for most of the year by lower taxes and higher transfers.  With spending on the rise, the personal saving rate dropped back down to 4.4 percent in October but is still well above the average rate observed before the recession.  Meanwhile, credit conditions remain tight, and measures of consumer sentiment still suggest overall weakness.

10 percent in October following a similar increase in September.  These huge increases probably reflect, in part, a greater supply of low-priced homes given the large number of transactions involving bank-owned and distressed properties.   Regarding the market for 3 new homes, sales agreements rose a solid 6 percent in October following two months of little change.

.

The modest recovery in housing demand likely reflects improvements in the underlying fundamentals, particularly greater affordability and the perception that house prices have bottomed out.  Interest rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, which have been very low by historical standards throughout 2009, moved back below 5 percent in recent weeks.  House prices also have shown signs of firming.  Although the repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance edged down in September and October, the level in October stood 4 percent above its trough in March.  In addition, in the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers, the number of respondents who expect house prices to increase over the next 12 months continued to exceed the number of respondents who expect prices to decrease.

Although the pace of sales is still modest, it has been ample enough, given the slow pace of construction, to reduce the overhang of unsold new single-family houses.  The stock of unsold new homes dropped further in October and is now less than half of its peak in mid-2006; measured relative to the October pace of sales, the months' supply of new homes has come down to 6¾ months, the lowest level in almost three years.  More broadly, the vacancy rate for homes intended for owner occupancy (which includes both existing and completed new homes for sale) has come down from its peak in 2008, although it is still high relative to pre-2006 levels.

Despite further improvements in sales and inventories, construction activity has held steady in recent months.  Single-family housing starts were essentially flat from June to October at an annual rate of around 500,000 units.  Adjusted permit issuance has also been roughly constant since June and was a bit below the rate of starts in October.

However, the low level of inventories relative to sales suggests that increases in singlefamily construction are likely to resume in the near term.  In the much smaller multifamily sector-where tight credit conditions have persisted and vacancies have remained elevated-starts plunged 35 percent in October to their lowest level since the series began in 1959.

Equipment and Software

Real spending on equipment and software (E&amp;S) is estimated to have edged up in the third quarter after falling sharply for more than a year.  The available indicators of spending on transportation equipment suggest that outlays in this category have continued to rise.  However, outside of transportation, E&amp;S spending appears to have merely leveled off.  Indeed, orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft were about unchanged, on balance, in September and October.

Business purchases of motor vehicles have increased thus far in the fourth quarter.  Sales of light vehicles to fleet customers moved up, on balance, in October and November, and sales of medium and heavy trucks increased in October.  Moreover, new orders for medium and heavy trucks jumped sharply in October:  With new environmental regulations on diesel engines taking effect in January 2010, some customers likely accelerated their orders for new trucks, a move that may pull forward some sales to November and December from early next year.

Real spending on high-tech E&amp;S rose moderately in the third quarter and appears to be increasing at a subdued pace early in the fourth quarter.  Although shipments of communications equipment in October retraced some of the declines seen in the prior two months, orders fell further.  In addition, nominal orders and shipments of computers and peripherals declined again in October.   Nonetheless, major producers of high-tech 4 equipment, such as Cisco and Dell, have since reported signs of improvement in demand this quarter.

Business investment in equipment other than transportation and high tech fell a bit further in the third quarter after having dropped steeply during the preceding three quarters.  In October, shipments of these capital goods, which account for half of total E&amp;S outlays, edged down, while new orders dropped markedly, erasing the prior month's gain in the

stock of unfilled orders.  The drop in orders was fairly broad based, with noteworthy declines in bookings for construction, industrial, and service machinery, as well as for electro-medical, measuring, and controlling devices.

The fundamental determinants of investment in E&amp;S have improved somewhat recently, but, on balance, are consistent with only sluggish gains in business outlays in the coming months.  On the positive side, the measure of the user cost of capital that we follow fell again in the third quarter and has now retraced the run-up that occurred late last year. Likewise, spreads of corporate bonds over Treasury securities have decreased considerably from their extremely high levels at the end of last year, likely reflecting less uncertainty and better assessments of future profitability.  Meanwhile, monthly surveys of business conditions, sentiment, and capital spending plans have recovered somewhat, but thus far only to levels suggestive of a moderate rise in business spending.  And, as noted earlier, the diffusion index of capital spending plans in the recent ISM semiannual report jumped to a moderate level from the historically low reading recorded in the spring.  However, business output remained 4 percent below its year-earlier level, despite turning up in the third quarter.  In addition, the net share of small businesses reporting increased difficulty in obtaining credit was unchanged in the November NFIB survey and remained at a historically high level.

Nonresidential Construction

Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remain bleak.  Real outlays on structures outside of the drilling and mining sector plunged at an annual rate of 22 percent in the third quarter, and recent data on nominal expenditures point to further deterioration in October.  The weakness has been widespread across categories and likely reflects the drag from rising vacancy rates, plunging property prices, and difficult financing conditions for new projects.  Moreover, the nonresidential construction industry continued to shed workers in November, and the most recent reading from the architectural billings index remained at levels consistent with further declines in spending.

Following steep declines in the first half of the year, real spending on drilling and mining structures increased at an annual rate of nearly 9 percent in the third quarter.  Apparently, the rebound in oil prices this year has led to an upturn in oil drilling in the past several months.  Indeed, the number of drilling rigs in operation in early December was a good bit above the level at the end of the third quarter.

Business Inventories

After large liquidations in the first half of the year, real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have fallen again in the third quarter-at an annual rate of about $130 billion.  In October, however, the book value of manufacturing and wholesale trade inventories (other than motor vehicles) increased for the first time in more than a year, suggesting that some slowing in the pace of real inventory liquidation may be under way.  The measure of months' supply implied by the book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sector (which includes retail inventories and is only available through September) remained somewhat elevated, but has fallen significantly since the middle of the year.

The staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventories outside motor vehicles continued to decline through October, though at a slower pace than in the middle of the year.  After falling sharply in the three months ending in August, months' supply excluding motor vehicles is estimated to have been little changed in September and October.  According to this measure, inventory-sales ratios remain above trend for most market groups; one exception is consumer goods, where inventories in October were relatively well aligned with sales.

In contrast, in the November ISM, the number of supply managers who described their customers' inventories as too low continued to exceed those who described inventories as too high by a very wide margin.  This reading suggests that managers in manufacturing expect their customers to do some restocking in the coming months. 5

Federal Government Sector

Total real purchases by the federal government rose at an annual rate of 8¼ percent in the third quarter, led by a strong increase in real defense expenditures.  Based on the Monthly Treasury Statement for October and the daily data for November, real defense spending appears to have dipped so far in the fourth quarter.

The unified federal budget deficit continued to widen in October-the first month of fiscal 2010.   Receipts were 18 percent lower in October than in the same month last year, 6 mostly reflecting the ongoing weakness in taxable income and the tax cuts in the 2009 stimulus package.  Meanwhile, outlays declined 3 percent in October relative to the same month a year ago, primarily because of a drop in spending on the TARP from $33 billion last October to almost zero this year.   Excluding the TARP payments, federal spending 7 increased in October relative to a year earlier, boosted by both the effects of the weak labor market on low-income support programs and the spending from the stimulus package.  In all, about $240 billion in stimulus funds (about 30 percent of the total $787 billion stimulus package) had been distributed in the form of spending increases and tax cuts by the end of November.

State and Local Government Sector

Incoming data point to some firming in real purchases by state and local governments. According to the latest labor market report, state and local employment rose 6,000 in November, and the data for October were revised up to show an increase of 29,000; the increases over the past two months were concentrated in the education sector, where payrolls had fallen especially sharply between May and September.  Meanwhile, after smoothing through the volatility in the monthly numbers, real construction expenditures appear to be holding up after rising appreciably in the second and third quarters.  Real construction spending continues to be bolstered by the availability of federal stimulus funds, supportive conditions in the municipal bond market, and the moderation in construction costs this year.

Although the grants provided under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act have helped cushion the effects of the recession on state and local governments, the sector's operating budgets remain under pressure.  Based on information from 44 states, the Rockefeller Institute of Government estimates that nominal state tax collections fell nearly 11 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of this year.   The 8 ongoing weakness in revenues spans all major categories of taxes and is forcing states to

make adjustments to their enacted budgets for fiscal year 2010 (which began on July 1 in most states).  Indeed, according to a tabulation released by the National Conference of State Legislatures in mid-November, new budget gaps have emerged in at least 31 states since the start of the current fiscal year.  In response, several states have implemented across-the-board cuts in spending to close budget gaps, while others have trimmed outlays for specific programs and laid off or furloughed workers.

Prices

After slowing considerably over the past year, consumer price inflation has moved up in recent months, while core inflation has remained subdued.   Over the 12 months ending in October, the headline PCE price index increased just ¼ percent, down from a 3¼ percent increase in the year-earlier period.  The sharp deceleration in the 12-month change partly reflected the plunge in energy prices at the end of 2008 and the decline in food prices over the past year.  However, PCE prices have posted considerably larger increases in recent months as energy prices have surged.  In contrast, core PCE prices have continued to increase moderately of late, abstracting from a jump in the nonmarket component of prices in October.  Over the 12 months ending in October, core PCE prices increased 1½ percent, well below the increase of 2¼ percent registered over the yearearlier 12-month period.  Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have been mixed with a small increase in the Reuters/University of Michigan survey and small decreases in the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF).

Consumer energy prices climbed 1.6 percent in October after increasing 0.8 percent in September.  The surge in consumer energy prices in recent months reflects this year's rebound in the price of crude oil and an unusually quick pass-through of the run-up in spot prices for natural gas that occurred in October.  Indeed, consumer prices for natural gas jumped 1.9 percent in October, boosted by fuel adjustment surcharges in several metropolitan areas that had unusually cold October weather.  Based on recent survey data, we expect consumer gasoline prices to move up sharply in November.  In contrast, natural gas spot prices moved down significantly in November in response to ample inventories, but they have more than retraced that decline in early December, likely because of a cold snap in several parts of the country.

Although the sizable declines in food prices that were evident earlier in the year seem mostly to have ended, consumer food prices remain 1½ percent below their level 12 months earlier.  This 12-month decrease in consumer food prices stands in stark contrast to the 7 percent increase over the year-earlier period.  More recently, consumer

food prices edged up 0.1 percent in October, while spot prices for grain and livestock have risen briskly in recent weeks.

PCE prices excluding food and energy moved up 0.2 percent in October as prices in the volatile nonmarket category jumped 0.8 percent.  Market-based core prices remained subdued in October, edging up 0.1 percent for the sixth consecutive month.  Over the past 12 months, the deceleration in core PCE prices has been relatively widespread.  Apart from the tax-induced increases in tobacco prices and a rebound in motor vehicles prices, prices for core goods decelerated considerably over the year ending in October.  Core services prices also decelerated significantly over the past 12 months, reflecting notably smaller increases in housing services and several other services categories.

Measures of inflation expectations have been mixed recently.  In the Reuters/University of Michigan survey for November, median year-ahead inflation expectations moved down 0.2 percentage point from their October reading to 2.7 percent.  Median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years edged up 0.1 percentage point from their October reading to 3.0 percent but remain in the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years.  In contrast, median long-run inflation expectations as measured by the SPF moved down in the fourth quarter from earlier readings, with expectations for the CPI moving down 0.2 percentage point to 2.3 percent, and expectations for the PCE index edging down 0.1 percentage point to 2.1 percent.

At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index (PPI) for core intermediate materials declined 0.2 percent in October, breaking a string of four consecutive months of increases.  Despite the recent four-month increase, the PPI for core intermediates remains well below its elevated level a year ago.  In contrast, commodity prices stand a good bit above their year-earlier levels.  Since the October Greenbook, both the Commodity Research Bureau (CRB) spot index of industrial materials and the Journal of Commerce (JOC) index of industrial materials have continued to move up, rising 7.5 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.

*The data on the costs of individual benefits should be interpreted with care because, with the exception of health insurance, they do not meet BLS's standard publication criteria.

Nonetheless, after smoothing through the quarterly swings, measures of labor costs have decelerated modestly over the past year.  P&amp;C compensation per hour is reported to have risen 2.5 percent over the four quarters ending in the third quarter of this year, down from a 3.1 percent increase over the four quarters ending a year earlier.  Labor compensation as measured by the ECI decelerated more sharply over the past year, moving up only 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September after increasing 2.8 percent in the year-earlier period.

Turning to the current quarter, average hourly earnings of production and nonsupervisory workers increased 0.3 percent in October and 0.1 percent in November.  Average hourly earnings have also decelerated over the past year.  Over the 12 months ending in November, this wage measure increased 2.2 percent, 1.7 percentage points less than over the preceding year.

Domestic Financial Developments

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate shifted down over the intermeeting period, and yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities decreased as well. Stock prices moved higher, while yield spreads on corporate bonds edged down.  In short-term funding markets, year-end pressures have been muted thus far, although strong demand for Treasury bills that mature early next year has helped push their yields close to zero.  Net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses remained light in recent weeks, as C&amp;I loans outstanding contracted further but net bond issuance remained fairly strong. The first newly issued CMBS since June 2008 came to market over the intermeeting period, but conditions in the commercial mortgage market continued to be tight overall. In the household sector, the latest data showed a further slight contraction of mortgage debt and consumer credit and delinquency rates that have remained very high.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

Implied rates on federal funds and Eurodollar futures decreased, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Although the FOMC's decision to keep the target range for the federal funds rate unchanged at the November meeting and the retention of the 'extended period' language in the accompanying statement were largely anticipated, market participants took note of the Committee's explicit enumeration of some of the factors that are expected to continue to warrant this policy, and Eurodollar futures rates decreased slightly on the release.  Investors' perceptions that the federal funds rate will likely remain near its current level for some time appeared to be reinforced by subsequent Federal Reserve communications, most notably Chairman Bernanke's speech on November 16.  Incoming economic data were, on balance, somewhat better than expected, but their net impact on interest rate expectations appeared to be small.  Based on the staff's usual assumption of a term premium of 1 basis point per month, futures quotes currently indicate that the federal funds rate is expected to rise above 25 basis points for the first time during the third quarter of 2010 and to reach about 1¾ percent by the end of 2011.  In the December survey of primary dealers, around two-thirds of respondents reported expecting the first policy rate increase to occur by the end of 2010, a slightly larger fraction than in the October survey.

Consistent with the decline in the expected path of the federal funds rate over the intermeeting period yields on nominal Treasury securities declined 22 basis points and 12 basis points at the 2- and 10-year maturities, respectively.  TIPS yields fell slightly more than nominal yields, implying a small net increase in inflation compensation.

Expected Year-End Premiums in Libor

<!-- missing-text -->

Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets

Investor sentiment toward the financial sector has changed little, on balance, since the November FOMC meeting.  Equity prices at large and small banks increased a bit less than broader market indexes, in part as investors continued to express concerns about the future profitability of the banking industry; CDS spreads for banking institutions edged down.  Market commentary suggested that some large financial firms and hedge funds may have pared their holdings of riskier assets ahead of year-end in order to lock in capital market gains posted over the course of the year.  Their increased demand for safe assets reportedly contributed to the scarcity and near-zero yields of Treasury bills maturing just after year-end.

Conditions in short-term funding markets changed little over the intermeeting period. One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads remained very low, while six-month spreads continued to edge down.  Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP also remained at the low end of each of their ranges since the fall of 2007.  Thus far, year-end pressures appear to be much lighter than in the past two years.  The forward premiums priced into one- and two-month Libor rates as they crossed year-end were only 20 basis points and 3 basis points, respectively-significantly less than those of last year and the year before.  Meanwhile, the term structure of commercial paper rates has stayed relatively flat through the early part of 2010.

Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities

Total Federal Reserve holdings of agency debt and MBS under the large-scale asset purchase programs reached $156 billion and about $1.1 trillion, respectively, during the intermeeting period.  Reports suggest that the tapering of Federal Reserve purchases of agency MBS has, to date, placed only modest upward pressure on MBS yields.  Some market participants reportedly interpreted the relatively low shares of accepted bids in the agency debt operations as indicating a wind-down in that program as well.  The announcement in the FOMC statement that the Federal Reserve would purchase only about $175 billion of agency securities had not been generally anticipated by market participants, and spreads on those securities increased a few basis points on the release.

Usage of the Federal Reserve's credit facilities generally declined further over the intermeeting period.  TAF auctions-including those that provided funding over yearend-continued to be substantially undersubscribed.  Commercial paper held by the CPFF declined to around $9 billion, and TALF credit edged up slightly to around $44 billion.  On November 17, the TALF subscription for CMBS resulted in loans totaling about $1.4 billion, including about $72 million in loans backed by the first newly issued CMBS since June 2008.  On December 3, the ABS TALF subscription supported

six deals, with a total of about $3 billion in loan requests that will settle later this week. Thus far, there are no indications in interbank, repurchase agreement (repo), or commercial paper markets to suggest that market participants expect conditions to deteriorate around February 1, 2010, when some facilities (the AMLF, CPFF, PDCF, TSLF, and foreign currency swap lines) are scheduled to expire.

On November 17, the Board announced a reduction in the maximum maturity of primary credit loans at the discount window for depository institutions to 28 days from 90 days, effective January 14, 2010.  In early December, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began conducting a series of small-scale, real-value reverse repo transactions with primary dealers as a test of the systems needed to use such transactions as a reservedraining tool.  Financial markets were unaffected by these developments.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Over the intermeeting period, broad stock price indexes rose about 5 percent, reflecting, in part, stronger-than-expected earnings reports from a number of firms in the first half of November.  The staff's estimate of the real return on equity expected over the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms continued to hover at about its average levels during the recession of the early 1990s.  As a result, the gap between the expected return and the real 10-year Treasury yield-a gauge of the equity risk premium-remained at a level that would appear broadly consistent with continued investor uncertainty about the pace of economic recovery.  However, option-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index fell, and it now stands at roughly its lowest level since early September 2008.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds decreased a little more than those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities, leaving the risk spreads a touch narrower.  Estimates of bid-asked spreads for investmentand speculative-grade corporate bonds-indicators of liquidity in the secondary corporate bond market-remained steady at moderate levels.  Conditions in the leveraged loan market were also little changed, with both average bid prices and bid-asked spreads about flat for the period.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With the latest quarterly earnings season now almost complete, earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 firms are estimated to have logged another solid gain in the third quarter.  In addition, during the month ending in mid-November, analysts significantly revised up their expectations for year-ahead earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms.

On balance, indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved somewhat in recent months.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations fell in the third quarter, while liquid assets as a share of total assets climbed further.  The pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by Moody's remained moderate through November, while the pace of upgrades was strong, in large part reflecting the upgrade of Ford Motor Company last month.  Although the delinquency rate on C&amp;I loans continued to increase in the third quarter, the six-month trailing bond default rate for all U.S. firms inched down further in October and has retraced about three-quarters of the spike that occurred in late 2008 and early this year.  The year-ahead expected default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody's KMV remained close to 2 percent, less than half its level in March.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations jumped in November following a lull in October, and speculative-grade bond issuance maintained a solid pace.  By contrast, both nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding and C&amp;I loans contracted, on net, in November, although the decrease in commercial paper was not widespread across issuers.  Overall, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses is estimated to have been negligible this quarter after having been negative in the third quarter.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained solid in November, including a spate of initial public offerings that were generally well received by the market.  In the third quarter, overall private and public equity issuance continued to outpace retirements, as both estimated share repurchases and retirements from cashfinanced mergers remained muted.  So far in the fourth quarter, announcements of share repurchase programs have continued to be sparse, but the volume of announced mergers and acquisitions has rebounded.

Public equity issuance by financial firms remained moderate in November.  However, on December 3, Bank of America completed a large secondary equity offering of just over $19 billion in common-equivalent shares as part of the firm's plan to repay TARP funds; this offering was very well received.  Gross bond issuance by financial firms slowed

Commercial Real Estate Finance

Financing conditions for commercial real estate remained strained.  Outstanding commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have decreased at an annual rate of about 4 percent in the third quarter, and recent data suggest another decline this quarter.  The dollar value of commercial real estate sales stayed very low in November, and around half of transacted properties were sold at a nominal loss.  Commercial property prices decreased about 3 percent in September, leaving the index about 40 percent below its peak in mid-2007, at roughly its mid-2003 level.  In October, delinquency rates on loans in CMBS pools increased to 4¾ percent, about the same as the delinquency rate on CRE loans for existing properties held by commercial banks in the third quarter.  Delinquency rates on banks' construction and land development loans for residential and commercial projects climbed above levels that were already exceptionally high.  CDS index prices covering a range of investment-grade CMBS increased, on net, as investors appear to have been encouraged by the first issuance of CMBS since the spring of 2008; moreover, reports suggest that two more CMBS deals will be offered in coming weeks.

Household Finance

Over the intermeeting period, the average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages decreased to less than 5 percent, and the spread between this mortgage rate and the 10-year Treasury yield was little changed.  Despite the low level of the conforming mortgage rate, refinancing activity does not seem to have picked up in recent weeks.  Agency MBS yields decreased, on net, in recent weeks, while issuance of these securities moderated through October.

Following several monthly increases, the repeat-sales house-price index from LoanPerformance (LP) inched down in September and October, leaving the index about 8 percent below its year-earlier level.  Delinquency rates for fixed- and variable-rate prime mortgages continued to climb in October, as did the delinquency rate for FHA-backed loans.

Consumer credit contracted for the ninth consecutive month in October, as a sizable decline in revolving credit more than offset a slight increase in nonrevolving credit. Consumer ABS issuance increased in November, boosted by an increase in auto-loan securitizations.  Credit card ABS issuance, which was very low in the past two months, is anticipated to pick up substantially in December as a result of interim guidance clarifying how the FDIC would handle these securitizations for a sponsoring bank in receivership.

The latest readings on consumer interest rates have been mixed:  Interest rates offered on credit cards increased in October, while rates on new and used auto loans dropped in November.  Delinquency rates on consumer loans have remained high in recent months, although they have not continued to climb.

Long-term mutual funds received sizable net inflows in November, though not quite as large as had been seen during the summer.  Net flows into bond funds last month again more than offset net redemptions from equity funds.  Money market mutual funds continued to experience net outflows in November, as yields paid by these funds remained extremely low.

Treasury Finance

To date, the Treasury has auctioned about $240 billion of nominal coupon securities across the term structure during the intermeeting period.  The auctions were very well received, with bid-to-cover ratios mostly at the upper end of their recent ranges.  Indirect participation continued to trend upward, indicating resilient foreign demand.  Treasury trading volumes remained within their recent ranges, and indicators of liquidity in the nominal coupon market-yield curve fitting errors, on-the-run premiums, and fails-todeliver in the repo market-were roughly stable.  In the TIPS market, there were indications that liquidity improved, on balance, in recent weeks.

In its quarterly refunding statement, the Treasury announced the discontinuation of the 20-year TIPS and the re-introduction of the 30-year TIPS, actions that were broadly in line with market expectations.  Separately, the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee recommended that total TIPS issuance for 2010 increase to between $70 billion and $80 billion, up from $58 billion in 2009.  This amount, which would not be sufficient to replace the stock of TIPS maturing next year, was significantly below traders' expectations and may have put some downward pressure on TIPS yields over the period. Absent legislative action, Treasury debt subject to limit is projected to breach the current statutory ceiling in coming weeks.  As in the past, the Treasury will likely use its available accounting tools to continue normal funding operations until the Congress raises the limit.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained robust in November, mostly driven by the strength of new capital issuance.  The pace of short-term issuance was again subdued in November, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.  Newly acquired ratings data from Moody's show that credit quality in the municipal sector has steadily deteriorated over the first three quarters of 2009.  This trend had been obscured in the

ratings data we obtained from Standard &amp; Poor's because of that firm's gradual increase in municipal debt ratings as they moved to align their ratings criteria for corporate and municipal debt.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds edged slightly lower over the intermeeting period, leaving their ratios to comparable-maturity Treasury yields little changed.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 increased at an annual rate of 4½ percent in November, in line with its rate of growth in September and October.  Liquid deposits continued to expand rapidly, while small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds contracted further, albeit at a slightly slower pace than in prior months.  Currency ran off at an annual rate of 5 percent in November, as demand from abroad continued to moderate.  The monetary base expanded at an annual rate of almost 50 percent, as purchases of long-term assets more than offset a decrease in the usage of liquidity and credit facilities.

Commercial bank credit is estimated to have fallen further in November, although the rate of decline slowed from that in previous months.  Banks' holdings of securities decreased at about a 2 percent pace in November, and their total loans contracted about 5 percent at an annual rate.  Core loans (the sum of C&amp;I, real estate, and consumer loans) decreased at an estimated annual rate of 7¼ percent in November, a pace that was about half as rapid as in recent months.  On the business side, C&amp;I loans fell at a nearly 16 percent rate, as paydowns, maturing loans, and loan sales reportedly contributed to the decline.   Commercial real estate loans shrank at about a 10 percent pace, consistent with weak fundamentals in that sector.  On the household side, a slowdown in banks' sales of loans to the GSEs during the intermeeting period arrested the contraction in on-balancesheet holdings of closed-end residential mortgages registered in each of the previous seven months; however, home equity loans continued to run off.  Consumer loans declined considerably as credit card loan originations dropped.  Call Report data for the third quarter show that unused commitments to fund loans contracted for the seventh consecutive quarter, but that the rate of decline slowed, particularly for commitments to lend to businesses.

Industry-wide measures of returns on assets and equity were bolstered by substantial profits at a few large banks that resulted, in part, from reduced loan loss provisioning at those institutions.  However, delinquency and charge-off rates continued to rise for most loan categories, and losses remained widespread among regional and smaller banks.  In the aggregate, regulatory capital ratios increased further in the third quarter, as commercial banks received equity infusions from their parent holding companies and reduced their asset holdings.

Loan price data from the November Survey of Terms of Business Lending indicated that C&amp;I loan rate spreads over comparable-maturity market instruments rose noticeably for the fifth consecutive survey.  The increase was apparent across most types of loans, including small loans and loans at small banks, which may indicate that credit conditions for small and medium-sized firms tightened further.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $36.5 billion in September, from $30.8 billion in August, as a surge in imports outpaced an increase in exports.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports of goods and services moved up 2.9 percent in September after remaining about flat in August.  The September increase was relatively broadbased with most major categories of exports moving higher.  Capital goods recorded a particularly robust gain, as aircraft recovered following a weak August and exports of machinery climbed sharply, more than offsetting a slight decline in high-tech goods.  Industrial supplies also grew strongly, supported by higher exports of petroleum products and chemicals.  In contrast, exports of agricultural products fell, largely on account of lower prices.

In the third quarter, nominal exports jumped a robust 24 percent at an annual rate, but only retraced a small portion of the declines recorded late last year and through the first half of this year.  The third-quarter increase was most pronounced in industrial supplies, helped by higher prices as well as an increase in volumes.  Exports of automotive products also recorded a large increase following especially steep declines in earlier

quarters.  Most other major categories of exports also increased with the exception of agricultural products, which recorded a small decline.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of imports of goods and services jumped 5.8 percent in September, after declining slightly in August.  Imports of oil accounted for roughly one half of the September increase, reflecting both greater volumes and higher prices.  In addition to oil, most other categories of imports also recorded gains in September, with imports of automotive products exhibiting a particularly large increase.

For the third quarter as a whole, nominal imports surged nearly 37 percent at an annual rate, but, as with exports, only managed to retrace a small amount of the steep decline that occurred over the previous three quarters.  The third-quarter increase was broadbased across major categories of imports, with automotive products and oil showing particularly large gains.  The increase in oil imports was wholly reflected in higher prices as volumes declined slightly.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. Prices for imported core goods rose 0.6 percent in October, slightly less than in September, when they registered their largest increase since July 2008.  The increase reflected higher prices for both material-intensive goods, as in previous months, and finished goods, whose prices previously had remained rather flat.  Within finished goods, prices for all major subcategories showed moderate growth.

Oil. The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil has been roughly flat for the past two months, falling 1 percent in September and then rising nearly 1 percent in October.  In contrast, the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil moved higher during October, rising about 9 percent to an average of $76 per barrel for the month as a whole, and then continued to move higher during November, rising to an average of $78.  In early-December, however, spot WTI retreated, closing most recently on December 8 at $72.62 per barrel.

Exports. Core export prices rose 0.3 percent in October, in contrast to a 0.3 percent decline the previous month.  October prices were boosted by an increase in the prices of materially-intensive exports, as higher prices for industrial supplies more than offset lower prices of agricultural products.  Prices for finished goods increased only slightly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received additional Treasury data on international financial transactions in the third quarter and partial data for October.  On balance, private foreigners have continued to sell U.S. Treasury securities and purchase U.S. equities, while foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasuries have remained strong.

Foreign official inflows dipped in September but resumed quite strongly in October (see line 1 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions'; see also the figure 'Foreign Official Financial Inflows through October 2009').  Official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities continued at a strong pace in both months,

.

Net official financial inflows in October also received a boost from a further $25 billion decline in outstanding drawings by foreign central banks on the Federal Reserve swap lines, reflecting continued normalization of funding markets.  The swap lines are recorded as a U.S. claim on foreigners and therefore generate inflows as they are repaid.

Banks located in the United States borrowed funds from affiliated foreign offices, contributing to large net banking inflows in September (line 3).  These flows could reflect a recycling of funds that went abroad through other channels.  In particular, we received additional partial data for the third quarter that show U.S. institutional investors purchased $130 billion in U.S. dollar-denominated negotiable CDs and short-term debt abroad-most issued by foreign financial institutions. (These data, not shown, will be included in line 10 upon the release of the third-quarter balance of payments accounts.) Although dollar interest rates remain higher in Europe than in the United States, the spreads have narrowed during 2009, suggesting that the large third-quarter outflows may reflect improved sentiment toward foreign financial institutions.

Private foreigners intensified their net sales of Treasuries in October to $45 billion (line 4a), continuing the reversal of flight-to-safety flows.  Net sales of Treasuries by foreigners were concentrated in bills, likely in part reflecting the decline in the stock outstanding.  Private foreign investors continued to show interest in U.S. equities in both September and October (line 4d), with September's purchases ranking among the highest since early 2008.

However, private foreign interest in U.S. agency and corporate debt remains weak. Private foreigners bought about $7 billion in agency bonds in September but sold $5 billion on net in October (line 4b).  U.S. corporate bonds continue to be sold, on net, by foreigners (line 4c).

U.S. investors continued their strong net purchases of foreign securities in September and October, buying primarily foreign bonds (line 5a).  International bond issuance has been high in recent months, and the portion of such bonds denominated in U.S. dollars remains elevated, which may be attracting U.S. investors.

Foreign Financial Markets

Since the October Greenbook, the dollar has depreciated, on net, against most major currencies, falling about 1 percent on a trade-weighted basis against both the major foreign currencies and the currencies of our other important trading partners.  This decline appears to have been driven in part by a continued normalization of risk attitudes. Much of the dollar's depreciation occurred early in the period, and the dollar fell broadly after the meeting of the G-20 ministers over the weekend of November 7-8, with market participants noting that the meeting's communiqué failed to mention concern over the dollar's recent depreciation.  Notably, the dollar depreciated 3 percent, on balance, against the yen.  Japanese officials have voiced concerns about the yen's strength, although in real effective terms, the yen has just returned to its level in 2005, a time when the Japanese did not intervene in the foreign exchange market.  The depreciation of the dollar led several emerging economies, including Brazil and Korea, to intervene to stem the appreciation of their currencies, while others are reportedly contemplating tightening capital controls.

Consistent with a normalization in risk attitudes, global mutual fund flows show that investors continue to pull money out of money-market funds in favor of equity and bond funds.  Foreign stock markets have generally risen, and foreign sovereign yields have declined on net.  Equity indexes in Europe and Japan rose 2¾ and 1 percent respectively, while stock markets in Brazil and Mexico registered double-digit gains, amid rising commodity prices and a better-than-expected Mexican GDP report.  China's stock market rose nearly 9 percent, in part due to strong trade data.  Yields on German and Japanese sovereign benchmark bonds declined about 10 basis points.  However, U.K. yields rose by 9 basis points on net, in part because yields increased after the Bank of England surprised markets by raising the size of its Asset Purchase Facility by only £25 billion to £200 billion at the beginning of November.

News that the Dubai government had requested a standstill on debts owed by Dubai World's temporarily roiled financial markets.  Global equity markets and sovereign bond yields fell, while the dollar rose roughly 1 percent as investors pulled back from riskier investments.  These movements have largely been reversed as investors became increasingly confident that this was an isolated event that was unlikely to spillover to other markets.  Sentiment was buttressed by the announcement that Dubai World was seeking to restructure only $26 billion of its debt.  U.K. banks appear to have the largest exposure to Dubai World, with reports in the financial press suggesting that their overall exposure is about $5 billion.  The Dubai World event raised concerns that other sovereign

nations with large outstanding debt levels, such as Greece, Hungary, and Ireland, may have trouble refinancing, and CDS spreads rose accordingly.  Although most spreads have since fallen back, the Greek spread has risen further this week after Fitch lowered Greece's sovereign debt rating.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

The advanced foreign economies are gradually emerging from their deep recessions. Japan, the euro area, and Canada posted positive real GDP growth in the third quarter.  In the United Kingdom, GDP continued to decline, but domestic demand stabilized and the pace of contraction moderated substantially.  Indicators for the current quarter are consistent with positive growth in all the major foreign economies.  In particular, improvements in PMIs and confidence indicators suggest continued positive momentum. In addition, incoming data show that trade volumes improved further from their earlyyear lows, accompanied by increases in production.

Headline inflation has generally moved up since the October Greenbook, primarly reflecting higher commodity prices.  A notable exception is Japan, where 12-month rates of both headline and core (excluding food and energy) inflation fell to record lows in October.  All major foreign central banks have kept their policy rates unchanged. Recently, the BOJ announced a new lending facility offering three-month funds and the BOE increased, though modestly, the size of its asset purchase program.  The ECB, in contrast, has announced some unwinding of liquidity support measures.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The Japanese economy grew 1.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, substantially below the 4.8 percent pace reported in the first release.  Although private consumption rose at a solid pace, likely supported by government stimulus, private investment continued to fall sharply.  Net exports remained a source of growth, but to a lesser extent than in the previous quarter as imports began to rebound.

<!-- missing-text -->

Indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued moderate  expansion.  Industrial production rose for the eighth consecutive month in October, but at a considerably slower pace, as autos and electronics production fell back somewhat after surging earlier.  In addition, consumer confidence was nearly unchanged in October, and the Shoko-Chukin business confidence survey posted only modest gains in the fourth quarter; previously, both indexes had grown at a more robust pace.  Although the appreciating yen is raising concerns about the near-term outlook, in October, Japanese real exports rose 3.4 percent on a monthly basis.  The unemployment rate declined to 5.1 percent in October, down from a peak of 5.7 percent in July.  However, the more reliable job opening-toapplication ratio suggests a much more limited improvement in labor market conditions.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

In October, the 12-month inflation rate reached a new all-time low of negative 2.5 percent.  The decline in prices was not limited to commodities; core inflation (excluding all food and energy) also reached a record low.  Incoming data suggest that deflationary pressures might have eased a bit in November; in the Tokyo area, headline prices rose on a monthly basis for the first time since February 2009.

The BOJ left its policy rate unchanged and repeated its commitment to maintain the zerointerest-rate policy for an extended period.  On December 1, at an emergency meeting, the BOJ announced a new lending program, which in part replaces existing facilities, to provide 10 trillion yen (about $110 billion) worth of funds for three months at a rate of 0.1 percent against a wide range of collateral.  Previously, Japan's central bank had unveiled plans to withdraw some unconventional policy measures, beginning with commercial paper and corporate debt purchase programs at the end of 2009.  As for fiscal policy, the new Hatoyama government recently announced that it intends to take 'policy action in view of the strengthening yen and problems surrounding stock prices' and plans to spend 7.2 trillion yen (1½ percent of GDP) over 2010 and 2011.  It appears, however, that about one-third of the resources for the additional package, which calls for government guarantees for new lending as well as grants to local governments, will come from reshuffling existing budget priorities.

Euro-area real GDP increased 1.5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the third quarter, marking a return to positive growth after five quarters of contraction.  The rise reflects positive contributions from inventories and net exports; final domestic demand continued to decline, although at a moderating pace.  Private consumption fell almost 1 percent, as the effects of government incentives for car purchases waned.  Investment decreased 1.4 percent, the slowest pace of decline in six quarters.  Changes in inventories provided a contribution of 1.4 percentage points to growth.  As world trade rebounded, both exports and imports surged at double-digit rates, and net exports contributed 0.6 percentage point to third-quarter growth.

Recent indicators suggest further improvement in economic conditions in the current quarter.  In November, several measures of economic sentiment reached their highest levels since August 2008, and PMIs rose further, consistently indicating expansion in both manufacturing and services.  There are also some signs that household spending might be bottoming out; real retail sales were flat in October after falling in the third quarter.  In addition, the unemployment rate, after having risen 2½ percentage points since early 2008, held at 9.8 percent in October.

<!-- missing-text -->

In November, 12-month inflation rose to 0.6 percent from negative 0.1 percent in October, according to the flash estimate.  Excluding all food and energy, October inflation was 1.2 percent.

The ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent at its December 3 meeting.  The ECB also announced that the one-year refinancing operation scheduled for December 16 will be the last liquidity operation with such a long maturity and that the average refinancing rate will be indexed to the minimum bid rate over the life of the operation.  In addition, the ECB indicated that its last six-month refinancing operation will be conducted on March 31, 2010, and that its main refinancing operations will be at a fixed rate with full allotment at least through April 13.  The ECB has continued to implement plans to buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds, and by early December had purchased about €26 billion in such bonds.

Euro-area credit conditions have shown signs of improvement in recent months. Household credit growth turned positive in the second quarter and edged up further in the third, although corporate credit growth has continued to fall.  Bank lending surveys showed less tightening in credit standards in the third quarter.  The surveys also indicate that while demand for credit from corporations is still contracting, that from households has begun to increase.  Tight lending has induced firms to issue new debt in financial markets.  In the first three quarters of 2009, nonfinancial corporations have issued €80 billion worth of debt, making up for much of the contraction in bank loans.

Amid rising fiscal deficits, the EC recently announced deadlines for countries to return within the 3 percent rule required by the Stability and Growth Pact.  Most countries, including France and Germany, are expected to reach the reference value in 2013. However, in the case of Greece, the Commission has yet to change the original deadline set to 2010, which appears quite unrealistic given the projected budget deficit is about 12 percent of GDP for 2009.  On December 8, Fitch downgraded Greek debt to BBB+ with a negative outlook, citing concerns over the medium-term outlook for public finances.

In the United Kingdom , GDP growth in the third quarter was revised up ½ percentage point to negative 1.2 percent (s.a.a.r.).  Final domestic demand stabilized, as small declines in private consumption and investment were partly offset by higher government spending.  Net exports made their first negative contribution to GDP growth since 2007. Imports rose 5.2 percent, while exports increased a more modest 2.0 percent.

Data received since last Greenbook are consistent with output expanding moderately in the fourth quarter.  The volume of retail sales rose 0.4 percent in October, and analysts project further increases late in the quarter as households bring forward consumption expenditures ahead of the expiration of the temporary value-added tax cut on December 31.  The manufacturing and services PMIs edged down in November but continue to point to a moderate expansion of those sectors.  According to the Labor Force Survey, the total number of unemployed (measured as a three-month centered average) declined modestly in July and August.  However, the number of people claiming unemployment benefits continued to rise through October.

Price pressure has increased in recent months, although it remains subdued overall. Headline inflation jumped to 1.5 percent in October on a 12-month basis, in part as record declines in fuel prices in September 2008 dropped out of the calculation. Excluding all food and energy, inflation edged up 0.2 percentage point to 1.8 percent. Producer input and output prices rose further in October.  Both series now stand close to their pre-recession peaks.  Reading through the monthly volatility, measures of earnings growth were well below their recent trends in September.

At its November meeting, the BOE announced the acquisition of an extra £25 billion in assets through the creation of reserves, bringing total purchases to £200 billion.  The additional purchases are to be completed by the end of January; the BOE is effectively halving the pace of asset purchases.  As of November 26, the BOE had acquired £183.4 billion in assets through the creation of bank reserves, almost the entirety of which were gilts.

On December 9, the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivered the 2009 Pre-Budget Report which confirmed the sharp deterioration in U.K. public finances.  The fiscal deficit is projected to be about 12 percent of GDP in the current and next fiscal years (fiscal years run from April to March).  As a consequence, public sector debt is expected to jump, from under 40 percent of GDP prior to the recession to peak of almost 80 percent in fiscal year 2014-2015.  The Treasury's economic forecast calls for output to grow a meager 1¼ percent in 2010 on the back of a further small contraction in investment and stagnant consumption.  GDP is then forecast to rise 3½ percent in 2011 and 2012.

Canadian GDP rose 0.4 percent in the third quarter (s.a.a.r.), following a 3 percent contraction in the previous quarter.  Final domestic demand expanded rapidly, moving up almost 5 percent, as private consumption increased at the fastest pace since the fourth quarter of 2007.  Much of the strength in consumption was in durable goods purchases, particularly motor vehicles and furniture.  Fixed investment increased, rising almost 9 percent, as outlays on motor vehicles and industrial machinery surged.  Government consumption and investment were strong as well in the third quarter, contributing nearly 2 percentage points to growth.  Residential investment rose 8.1 percent.

The strength in domestic demand was almost fully offset by a large negative contribution from net exports, as imports grew at about twice the pace of exports.  Both imports and exports were boosted by a surge in automotive trade.  Exports outside of energy and autos remained muted, while import gains were widespread.

As yet, we have little data beyond the end of September.  The contour of growth heading into the current quarter, however, points to further expansion.  September monthly GDP rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent, suggesting momentum built up toward the end of the third quarter.  Likewise, retail sales and manufacturing orders ended the third quarter with strong performance.  In addition, the Canadian housing market continued to rebound forcefully.  After rising more than 15 percent in the third quarter, housing starts were up 5.4 percent in October, neither number at an annual rate.

Canadian labor market conditions improved in November.  Total employment rose 0.5 percent.  A record-setting increase in public employment and a solid gain in private employment drove November's gains.  Excluding the public sector, private-sector employment rose a solid 0.2 percent.  Tempering the good news, aggregate hours worked declined in November, as part-time employment rose and full-time hours dropped.  The unemployment rate fell 0.1 percentage point to 8.5 percent.

Consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in the year ending in October, the first 12-month increase since May 2009.  Excluding all food and energy, inflation was 1.2 percent in October, up sharply from 0.7 percent in September.  The 12-month change in average hourly wages fell a full percentage point to 2.3 percent in November.

At its December 8 meeting, the BOC maintained its policy rate at 0.25 percent and reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until at least the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Economic activity in the emerging market economies continued to surprise on the upside in the third quarter despite a moderation in the pace of recovery in emerging Asia. Mexico's economy grew at an unexpectedly brisk pace in the third quarter, reflecting in part a large payback from an H1N1 virus-related contraction in the second quarter.  In India, GDP also came in well above expectations in the third quarter, reflecting a surprisingly effective fiscal stimulus.  Industrial production and trade data point to a slight dip in October in several Asian economies, suggesting a relatively slow start to the fourth quarter.  In emerging Asia, headline inflation continued to rise (albeit generally from low levels), in several cases led by rising food prices.  Meanwhile, inflation continued to fall in Latin American countries, likely owing in part to recent appreciation of their currencies and still-weak domestic demand.

In China , economic activity continues to expand robustly, although a few indicators dipped in October.  Real retail sales growth, on a 12-month basis, remained around 17 percent in October, and fixed-asset investment growth stayed above 30 percent.  In November, the purchasing managers index was 55, the same level as in October, which was the highest since April of last year.  However, industrial production moved down in October from its September level, as did trade, with the value of imports falling more than exports.

Chinese authorities have continued to trim economic stimulus at the margin.  In October, the level of outstanding bank loans expanded at the slowest pace this year, and concerns about overcapacity led authorities to instruct financial institutions to limit lending to six industries, including steel and cement.  Nonetheless, credit growth remains accommodative, and outstanding loans are 34 percent higher than a year earlier.  In November, authorities raised the price of electricity for nonresidential use.  This likely will put upward pressure on the producer price index, which has fallen nearly 6 percent over the past year.  Consumer prices have moved higher recently, led by food and housing, but the consumer price index remains slightly below its year-earlier level.

In India , GDP surged 15 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, underpinned by robust manufacturing activity and an especially sharp rebound in social services, reflecting very accommodative fiscal policy.  The strong growth of domestic demand during the third quarter caused the merchandise trade deficit to widen, as imports grew faster than exports.  Available data point to a slight retrenchment of economic activity in the beginning of the fourth quarter:  The purchasing managers index for manufacturing crept down in October and November, reaching 53, its lowest level since March.

Consumer price inflation continued to hover above 10 percent on a 12-month basis through October.  Wholesale price inflation pushed further into positive territory after several months of deflation during the summer, primarily reflecting rising food prices following one of the driest rainy seasons in decades.

In the newly industrialized economies ( NIEs), 1 most indicators point to robust, though moderating, growth in recent months.  In line with Korea and Singapore, which released strong third-quarter GDP reports prior to the last Greenbook, Taiwan's real GDP expanded at an 8.3 percent annual rate in the third quarter.  Exports, consumption, and investment all contributed to growth, pointing to a broad-based recovery.  Meanwhile, Hong Kong's growth slowed sharply to 1.5 percent in the third quarter, as weak consumption and exports offset a boost from inventory accumulation.  Several monthly indicators show a slight dip in the level of economic activity in the region going into the fourth quarter, particularly in Korea, where industrial production, imports, and the purchasing managers index retreated in October.  Trade balances, which moved sharply up at the onset of the crisis as imports fell even more sharply than exports, have since started to give up these increases.

Inflation has risen from very low levels across the NIEs.  In Korea and Hong Kong, prices have risen a bit more than 2 percent during the past year, while in Singapore and Taiwan prices remain below their year-earlier levels.  With inflation still contained, central banks have kept policy rates on hold.

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received third-quarter GDP for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4) . 2 Malaysia and Indonesia led the group, growing at 10 and 8 percent, respectively, spurred by government spending and a pickup in private domestic demand.  Growth in Thailand came in a bit lower, as the recovery stalled in the first two months of the quarter before picking up sharply in September.  In the Philippines, growth decelerated because of weak domestic demand and flat remittances.  With the exception of the Philippines, trade balances have deteriorated relative to the second quarter as strengthening domestic demand caused import growth to outpace that of exports.

Consumer prices continued to accelerate in the region with the exception of Indonesia, where inflation remained roughly flat because of subdued food prices and the strengthening rupiah.  In Thailand, 12-month inflation turned positive in October for the first time this year and increased further in November.  Central banks left policy rates unchanged.

In Mexico , real GDP rebounded sharply in the third quarter, with strength in both manufacturing and services.  The service sector rebound reflected a strong payback from the H1N1 virus-related contraction in the second quarter.  The manufacturing sector benefited from higher auto production following the reopening of Chrysler and GM plants.  Both exports and imports rose in the third quarter, and exports rose further in October.  But consumer demand remained weak going into the fourth quarter despite a modest improvement in the unemployment rate.  Weak domestic demand and an appreciating peso helped lower 12-month headline inflation to 4.5 percent in October.

In early November, the Mexican congress approved a watered-down version of the government's fiscal reform.  Although the final package includes various tax hikes, a rise in fuel prices, and some spending cuts, it left out a centerpiece of the original proposal: a new general sales tax that would have paved the way for broadening the tax base.  As such, the reform is not generally viewed as a significant step toward addressing structural weaknesses in Mexico's fiscal framework, although it will help the government's finances in 2010.  As expected, Fitch downgraded Mexican sovereign debt to BBB following the bill's passage.  However, the fact that Fitch gave Mexico a stable outlook was regarded as positive news that led to a rally in the peso and stock markets.  President

Calderón has nominated Agustín Carstens as the new Governor of the Bank of Mexico and Ernesto Cordero as the new Minister of Finance.

In Brazil , monthly indicators suggest that robust economic growth in the third quarter has extended into the fourth quarter.  (Third-quarter GDP will not be released until December 10.)  Industrial production continued to climb rapidly through October to a level that was only 5 percent below its September 2008 peak.  The purchasing managers index for manufacturing shot up to 55 in November, its highest level in two years.  The recovery has been supported by rapid growth of government-directed credit and strong domestic demand, particularly for autos and appliances, which have benefited particularly from government tax breaks.  Export growth has been comparatively tepid, causing the trade surplus to narrow since the second quarter.

Despite the rapid pace of recovery, inflation has continued to creep down.  Headline inflation fell to 4.2 percent in October on a 12-month basis, just below the midpoint of the central bank's target range.  The real 's strong appreciation this year has likely played some part in the fall in inflation.  However, given the weak export recovery, the government moved again to limit upward pressure on the currency by closing a loophole that allowed foreign investors to circumvent the 2 percent tax on portfolio capital inflows imposed in late October.  Brazilian companies' issuance of American Depository Receipts, which foreign investors had been using to gain exposure to the Brazilian stock market without paying the tax, is now subject to a 1.5 percent tax.

In Russia , real GDP expanded at a 10.5 percent annual rate in the third quarter following three quarters of decline.  The rebound reflected rapid growth of the manufacturing and transport sectors on the production side, and strong investment growth and inventory accumulation on the expenditure side.  Retail sales were flat in the third quarter but posted two consecutive months of growth in September and October, while the unemployment rate crept below 8 percent in October.  Consumer prices were flat in October, bringing headline consumer price inflation down to 9.7 percent on a 12-month basis, the lowest level in two years.  The central bank of Russia lowered its refinancing rate 50 basis points in late November to stem capital inflows and slow the appreciation of the ruble, which has also been supported by higher oil prices.
