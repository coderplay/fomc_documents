Overview

The period  since he  last  OMC t F meeting  has  been  an  eventful  ne in  many  respects, o and  we have  responded o  developments y making some small,  ut  notable,  hanges t b b c in  our  economic  projection.  hat  said,  owever, e would emphasize  the  constancy T h w of  the asic essage  between  the  last  reenbook  and  this  dition: eal  GDP  growth b m G e R slowed  markedly  in  the  second  quarter, d  at  current  onetary  policy  ettings,  tput an m s ou expansion ver  the  next ear  and  a half  s ikely  o  remain  subpar n average; ven o y i l t o e so,  inflation  ll reep  upward. wi c

We  are  currently  uessing hat DP  grew in  the  second  quarter  t  close o  the g t G a t 1.4  percent annual ate)  stimated  y the  BEA ( r e b in  its  dvance  release--somewhat ort a sh of  the  June  Greenbook  prediction. mestic  final  ales  xceeded  our  expectations, Do s e but  the  difference s more than ffset  y sharper  eclines  n  net  exports  nd wa o b d i a inventory  nvestment  han  we had  forecast. i t

The marked drop-back n  inventory  ccumulation s robably  plus,  n i a i p a o balance,  or uture conomic activity.   previously  ad seen  a  significant  rther f f e We h fu downshift n  stocking  s  an  appreciable  rag  on  output rowth  over  the  second  half  f i a d g o this  ear.  This  is o longer he ase: lthough  inventory  ccumulation hould y n t c A a s diminish urther  utside  he  auto ector, e  efforts  f  General  Motors to  restock  ts f o t s th o i dealers  ill rovide n  offsetting  crease  n  investment. n  contrast,  wever,  the w p a in i I ho recent isappointing rformance f  net  exports ppears o  reflect  deeper  slump  in d pe o a t a the  Asian  economies  than  we had  anticipated,  we do  not  see  a quick urnaround; and t indeed, e have  trimmed  our  forecast  f  growth  in  that art f  the  world  further, w o p o especially   the  near  term.  This  situation,  combination ith  the dditional cent in in w a re appreciation   the  dollar, ells   weaker  outlook or et xports. n  net, owever, of sp a f n e O h we are  now  looking or eal DP  to  expand  at n  annual  rate f  a  little  er f r G a o ov 2-1/4  percent n  this  alf-year,  out  half    point ore than  in  the  last  reenbook. i h ab a m G That  upward revision  s hen  reversed  uring  1999,  owing to  the  less  avorable i t d f outlook or .S.  trade,   greater  all-off    motor  vehicle  ssemblies  rom what f U a f in a f promises  to  be  a  very  high  level  his  utumn,  and some caution  n omputer  purchases t a i c as  the ear  2000 draws  near.  Real  GDP  growth  in  1999 is rojected  t ust y p a j 1-3/4 ercent. p

To achieve his ort f  sustained  eceleration    activity,  mestic inal t s o d in do f demand will ave  to aper ff ubstantially.    expect hat n  the  near  term  the h t o s We t i lagged  multiplier-accelerator  cts  f  the  inventory  djustment nd  of he  slide  n  net effe o a a t i

But  a key factor  n  our  forecast   demand continues  o e the  stock arket,  hich  we believe i of t b m w has  played  a major  role n  the  household pending oom.  Although, iven  our  track i s b g record,  e hesitate   this  oint o  count ur  chickens,  he  recent  correction"   share w at p t o t " in prices  as  at east  ade more credible   scenario  n  which  disappointing rporate h l m a i co earnings  ead  to  an abatement f  stock  arket  gains nd  the elated  ealth ffects. l o m a r w e

With the  weaker  output orecast,    expect hat  esource  tilization l f we t r u wil decline ore appreciably  y  the  end  of  1999. The unemployment rate  s rojected  o m b i p t inch  above  4-1/2 ercent y  the  end  of his  ear  and above  the  5 percent ark in  the p b t y m latter rt f  next  year.  With lower  rates f  resource  tilization   greater  oftness pa o o u and s in  non-oil mport rices,  e are  presenting    more optimistic ew  of  the  trajectory i p w a vi of core  inflation d  nominal  compensation ates  ver  the  next  six uarters.  iven the an r o q G upcoming technical  hanges  in  the  index, verall  PI inflation   rojected  o  be  just c o C isp t 2 percent ver  that  eriod,  early /4  percentage  oint ess han  last  orecast. o p n 1 p l t f

Key  Background Factors

Once again,  e are  assuming  that he  federal  unds  rate ill emain  around w t f w r 5-1/2  percent hrough ext  year.  Intermediate- d  long-term ields  re  projected  o t n an y a t move back  up a  bit  rom the urrent  evel s  the est f  the  world  begins o ook ore f c l a r o t l m solid  nd  safe-haven  emands for reasuries  nd  other iquid  ollar  ssets  iminish; a d T a l d a d however,  we expect  that,  n  the rojected  conomic environment,  oncerns bout  Fed i p e c a tightening ll  be  largely  bsent,  nd  the  yield  urve  will  emain  quite lat. wi a a c r f

Up to  now, any  restraint   aggregate emand that  ight  have  been  implied on d m by a  fairly  igh  and  rising  eal hort-term  nterest  te as  been  overridden  y the h r s i ra h b stunning dvance  of  share rices. ur last  orecast  nticipated  moderate  setback or a p O f a a f the  market  in  the ear  term.  Early n he  intermeeting riod,  he arket  seemed to n i t pe t m be defying ur  analysis  or he  umpteenth  time, ut  worries  bout  deteriorating o f t b a corporate  arnings  rends  id  eventually  ite. e  expect hat  ontinued  ressure  n e t d b W t c p o profit  argins  will revent he arkets  from  sustaining  renewed  advance  over  the m p t m a projection riod.  If nything,  aluations  till em rich,  nd  the arket  thus pe a v s se a m vulnerable.  owever,  in  the  absence  of  monetary  tightening   any other ajor  new H a or m shock, e have  hesitated   include   significant  rther  ecline  n  equity rices  n  our w to a fu d i p i baseline  orecast.  hat  risk  s ddressed  n  the  alternative  mulations   a  later f T i a i si in section.

Our fiscal  olicy ssumptions ave  not  changed. There  doubtless  ill e some p a h w b election-year  uabbling  bout  the  details  ppropriations  lls,  t  we do  not sq a ofa bi bu

anticipate  y significant  lays n  the  passage  of ills  r  breaches f iscretionary an de i b o o d spending  caps.  Nor do we foresee  ny  tax  cuts hat  re  not  "paid or" ith ffsets a t a f w o elsewhere n  the  budget.  On those ssumptions,  e expect he  budget  surplus  or i a w t f fiscal  ear  1998 to  be $67 billion;  e  surplus  hould e about  $62 billion   fiscal y th s b in 1999. Notwithstanding  he  considerable  agnitude  of hese urpluses,  gauge  that t m t s we changes  in  discretionary  scal licy ill e  exerting  o  more than  a modest  drag  on fi po w b n the  growth  of  aggregate emand. d

We  have  marked down our  projection   foreign  conomic growth of e 1/2  percentage  oint n  both  1998 and 1999. We  now expect eal DP  in he  rest  f p i r G t o the  world, n an  export-weighted sis,  o  increase  /4  percent annual ate)  n  the o ba t 3 ( r i latter lf f  1998 and 2 percent ext  year, s  economies  in  Asia  and  Latin merica ha o n a A begin  to  recover. hile we believe  hat  his  orecast  alances  he  risks  verall, W t t f b t o uncertainty  bout  Japan  and  the ontinuing  ifficulties   number of  other a c d in  a countries--including  sia  and  Brazil--suggest  at  hose isks re  considerable. Rus th t r a

The dollar  as  moved higher ecently--with  pecially rge  ncreases  gainst h r es la i a the  yen  and  the  Canadian  dollar.  n  a  nominal  basis,  he rade-weighted llar  s p O t t o i u about  2 percent gainst  he  major  foreign  urrencies nce he  last  OMC a t c i t F meeting, ut b we continue o  expect  some depreciation er  the  forecast riod.  Compared with  the t ov pe earlier ojection,  e  level f  the  dollar  s early  -1/2  percent  igher n  the  near pr th o i n 2 h i term  and  about  1-1/4 ercent igher n  late 999. In  terms f  the  broad  exchange-rate p h i 1 o index  adjusted  or elative flation,   anticipate at he  dollar  ill ecline  bout f r in we th t w d a 2-3/4  percent y the  end  of ext  year,    bit ore than  in  the  June  Greenbook. b n a m

In  response o  continued eakness  in rices,  PEC t w p O agreed  to  an  additional round  of  production  uts ust  fter  e closed he  June  Greenbook. Although  recent c j a w t press eports  ave  raised  uestions  bout he  effectiveness    the  cuts o  date,  t akes r h q a t of t i t a  bit f  time  to educe  production  n  an orderly  anner,  and we believe  hat  ome o r i m t s analysts  ave  been  too  quick o  dismiss he  significance  he  agreement.  Although h t t oft there re  risks  o  this  orecast, o, e expect  the upply-demand  balance ltimately a t f to w s u to shift  ore in  favor f  producers. onsequently,  e expect TI  spot rices--currently m o C w W p just  nder  $13  per  barrel--to  se  o  $17 per  barrel  y early  1999,  about  $1  higher han u ri t b t in  the ast  rojection.  n  the ery  near erm, owever,  prices  re  expected o  remain l p I v t h a t on the  low side,  estrained  the  vast mounts  of  oil loshing  round  in  world r by a s a markets.

Recent Developments  and the  Outlook  for  the  Current  Quarter

We  have  raised  ur  prediction   third-quarter l DP  growth  from  2 percent  o o of rea G t 2-1/4 ercent,  espite  he  prolongation  f he  GM p d t o t strike.  mportantly, st  eek's I la w employment report  ointed o ontinued nderlying  trength  n  labor emand.  Were it p t c u s i d not  for he  strike,  e  rise n ayrolls  ast  onth probably ould have  been  in  line t th i p l m w with  the  robust  irst-half  e.  Similarly, e  stable  nemployment rate n  July, f pac th u i despite  he trike,  ong  with  the  low level f  initial  aims or nemployment t s al o cl f u insurance  his  onth,  indicate  ustained  irmness f  labor emand. t m s f o d

On the  expenditure  ide,  he  data  for he  current  uarter  re uite hin,  ith s t t q a q t w just   few pieces vailable r he  month of  July.  Sales  of ew light  ehicles  lid ast a a fo t n v s l month after  he ermination  f  large ncentives   midyear  and  as  shrinking  nventories t t o i at i at  GM dealers  ecame a  constraint;  derlying  emand appears o  have  remained b un d t quite ubstantial, ever. And today's  etail les  eport ndicates at onsumer s how r sa r i th c spending  on other oods  continued o  trend pward on a  steep  rajectory  to he  early g t u t in t summer.  Owing  to  the  sizable  ecline n  auto ales  his  uarter, al CE  likely  ill d i s t q re P w decelerate  arkedly, ut  we are  projecting still nsiderable  -1/2 ercent ate f m b a co 3 p r o advance.  Likewise, esidential  vestment  hould ost  a less efty ncrease  his r in s p h i t quarter, ven  the  leveling  ut  of ousing tarts is  pring;  ew home sales ave gi o h s th s n h continued o  trend pward,  but  widespread eports  uggest hat  hortages  f killed t u r s t s o s construction rkers  have  inhibited fuller oduction  esponse n  the  short  un. wo a pr r i r

Our predictions r  other omponents  of DP  are  even  more inferential. fo c G As regards usiness  nvestment,  rders eceived  hrough  June  by b i o r t U.S. equipment manufacturers  re  consistent th  further  trong ains n  shipments,  ut  real utlays a wi s g i b o for roducers'  urables re  likely  o  be  held  down this  uarter  y a  drop-back n  the p d a t q b i share f  commercial  aircraft  liveries ing  to  domestic irlines d  by a decline  n o de go a an i sales f  light  otor  vehicles  o  businesses  both leet  ales  nd  consumer  leases).  e o m t ( f s a W also  expect hat  nvestment  n  nonresidential  ructures  ll ncrease  nly  slightly, t i i st wi i o with  strength  n  office  uilding  ffset  n art y  slipping  actory  onstruction. i b o i p b f c

As for  inventories,  e uildup f  stocks vidently  emained  fairly  izable th b o e r s outside  he uto  sector  n  the econd  quarter.  aken together, e  incoming  figures  n t a i s T th o manufacturing  nd wholesale nventories rough une  were considerably  elow a i th J b BEA's assumptions. owever, we have  largely  ffset  hat hortfall   assuming  that H o t s by the  accumulation  f  retail ocks  n  June  will e  greater  han he kimpy  figure o st i b t t s anticipated  BEA, thereby olding otal  onfarm  inventory  nvestment n  the  second by h t n i i

Given  the  likely  roblems  of amping  up  assemblies,  hough,  e p r t w expect  that  ome shortfall  ll ccur  at irst d  that  he  motor  vehicle  ector  ill s wi o f an t s w subtract  bout  1/4  percentage  oint rom  GDP  growth  this  uarter.  ut  with  vehicle a p f q B production  eaching    very  high  level n  the ourth  uarter,  are  looking or r a i f q we f a sizable  ositive  ontribution   that eriod--almost 1/2  percentage  oints--bringing p c in p 1p the  overall  DP  increase  o bout  2-1/2 ercent. till,   are xpecting  hat DP G t a p S we e t G growth  will e  held  back  by an  underlying  oftening  n  demand trends  hat hows b s i t s through  more clearly  n  1999. i

International Developments

Recent  Developments

International  financial  markets  again  turned  volatile  toward  the  end of the  intermeeting period  as  concerns  about developments  in  Asia, particularly  in Japan,  intensified  and exacerbated  problems  in  Russia and  other emerging-market  economies. Since  the June-July  FOMC  meeting,  the foreign  exchange  value of the  dollar in terms  of the other major currencies  has  increased  about  2 percent  on balance. The dollar has moved  up against  the yen,  the Canadian  dollar, and  sterling  but has  declined  slightly against  the  continental  European  currencies.

The  dollar's rise  against  the  yen, more  than 4 /4 percent, reflected  market 3 skepticism  that the  new  LDP-led  government is  likely to  resolve  Japan's chronic problems  soon. The additional  proposals  for  resolution  of the  troubled  banking  system and  the  announcement  of new fiscal  initiatives  failed  to  convince  market  participants that  the  economy  was  about  to recover. Data releases  during  the  period indicated  that a  further  sharp  decline  in  economic  activity  had  occurred  in  the  second  quarter.

The dollar  has  appreciated 3 percent  against  the Canadian  dollar  since  the FOMC meeting  as weakness  in global  commodity  prices  continued to  weigh  on the currency.

Signs  of weakening  activity  and the market's sense  that the  likelihood  of tightening  by the  Bank  of England  had decreased  contributed  to  the fall  in  the  pound against  the  dollar  during  the  period. In contrast,  the  dollar has  depreciated  about  1 percent  against  the  mark  and  other euro-area  currencies  as  economic  prospects  for those  countries  appear  favorable  for  the  rest  of the  year  and  the transition  to  Stage  III of European Economic  and  Monetary  Union seems  to be proceeding  smoothly.

Three-month  and ten-year  market interest  rates  moved  lower over  the period  in most of the  major foreign  industrial  countries. The  notable  exceptions  were  Canadian rates,  which  rose  on  expectations  that  the  weakening  of the  Canadian  dollar exchange rate  may  prompt a  tightening  of monetary  policy. The  lower  rates  in Japan  likely reflect  market  pessimism  about  economic  prospects. Declines  in  European  rates  in part  suggest  further  shifts  in market  preferences  away  from  assets  in  emerging  market economies  and toward  those perceived  to  be safer. In  addition,  some  rates  trended down  as convergence  proceeded  within  the  euro-area  ahead  of the shift on  January  1, 1999,  to  a  single  currency.  Prices  of  equities  in  most industrial  countries  moved lower

over the  period. Canadian  equities  fell  the  most,  more  than 11 percent, whereas German  equities  dropped  nearly  5 percent  and Japanese  equity  prices  changed  little  on balance.

In  terms  of  our broad  index  for the  dollar's value  against  29 currencies,  the dollar  moved  up  1 1/2  ercent  over  the  intermeeting  period. p Against  the  currencies  of other  Asian  and  Latin  American  countries  included in  the broad  index, the  dollar  rose more  than  1/2 ercent. p A sizable  decline  in  the  dollar  against  the  Indonesian  rupiah (11 percent)  and  a  smaller  decline  against  the  Korean  won  (2  1/2  ercent) were  offset  by p small  increases  against  other Asian  and  Latin  American  currencies. Enlargement  of Indonesia's international  financing  package  along  with  a rise  in short-term  interest rates  contributed  to  the  stronger  rupiah. Pressures  on  the  Hong  Kong  dollar  (which remained  pegged  to the U.S.  dollar) led to  higher  short-term  interest  rates  there  also. Stability  in exchange  rates  allowed  short-term  domestic  interest rates  to  move lower elsewhere  in  Asia, particularly  in Thailand  and  Korea. However,  spreads  on  most dollar-denominated  instruments  moved  up. Except in  Korea, equity  prices  in the region  moved  down, ranging  from  a 28  percent  drop in Malaysia  to a 2  1/2  percent decline  in Taiwan. Korean  equity  prices  moved  up nearly  2  percent. The  Mexican peso  moved  down  toward the  end  of the  period,  registering  a net decline  of  2 /2 1 percent  since  the  previous  FOMC meeting. Mexican  short-term  interest  rates  were  up about  2  percentage  points  from  mid-July  lows,  and equity  prices  fell  nearly  17  percent. In  Brazil,  short-term  interest rates  are  down  on  balance  in response  to  monetary easing,  but  spreads  on Brady  bonds  are  up.

Pressure  on  asset  prices  in  Russia intensified  again  late in  the period,  with  the ruble  falling  outside  its  daily  band. In response,  Russian  authorities  announced  on August  12  the  imposition  of foreign  exchange  restrictions  on  domestic banks. The announcement  led  to  a sharp  sell-off in government  debt;  rates  on  short-term  rubledenominated  government  bills increased  40  to  140  percentage  points. Over  the intermeeting  period, the  yield on Russian  dollar-denominated  debt rose  9  percentage points. Russian  equity  prices  tumbled  more  than  33  percent  over the period.

The  Desk did not  intervene.

Real  economic  activity  continued  to  expand  in the  second  quarter  in  most of the  major foreign  industrial  countries,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  during  the  first quarter. The notable  exception  was  Japan,  where  indicators  such  as industrial

Oil  prices.
