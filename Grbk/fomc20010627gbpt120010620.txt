International Developments

Overview

Once again, we have marked  down our estimate of foreign  economic  growth in the first half of this year,  as  recent data from Latin America, Japan,  and many Asian  developing countries have been  weaker than anticipated. Canada is the only major trading partner for which data have surprised  us on the upside, but Canadian  growth is still weaker than in the previous few years.

We have adjusted down our projections for growth in the second  half of 2001 nearly  everywhere, reflecting  our revised assessment  of the  implications of the high-tech  slowdown  for the United States  and the rest of the world.  With reduced high-tech investment  and with inflation  data coming in  a little higher than expected  in many countries,  we have  also lowered  our estimates  of the levels and growth  rates of foreign potential  output.

With the projected return  of U.S.  output growth  to its potential  rate  and some stimulus from macroeconomic  policy abroad, we expect foreign economic growth  to pick up in 2002 to roughly the  rate of potential growth.  Because foreign  activity should remain  a little below potential  over the rest of the forecast period, we do not  expect a generalized  acceleration  of foreign price pressures  in 2002.

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE. Changes for years  are measured as Q4/Q4; for half-years,  Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2; and  for quarters, from previous  quarter.

Oil  prices have held fairly  steady  in the past few weeks. In line with futures prices,  we continue  to project a gradual  decline  over the forecast period toward roughly the  same level  we projected  in the May Greenbook.  The  foreign exchange  value of the dollar has strengthened  slightly since our last projection. We are forecasting a  1  percent  depreciation  of the broad  real dollar index over the next six quarters, to  a level in 2002:Q4 that is  a bit higher than its projected value in the May  Greenbook.

Real  net exports  of goods and  services  are expected  to  make essentially  a zero arithmetic  contribution  to U.S.  GDP growth  this year as the  sharp slowdown  in U.S.  activity  has reduced  imports by enough to offset the effects  of slowing foreign growth  and a strong dollar on U.S. exports. In 2002,  we project that  net exports  will resume  making  a negative  arithmetic contribution  to growth. However, the projected 1/2 percentage  point negative  contribution is about  half of the  average magnitude of the net export contribution  in the last three years.

Recent Developments

International financial markets. The index of the exchange value of the dollar in terms  of the major currencies  has risen percent since the May FOMC meeting,  as  the dollar's appreciation  against  European  currencies  was only partially offset  by its depreciation  against the Canadian  dollar.  Market participants'  disappointment with weak  data releases  in the United States  seems to have been more than matched by their disappointment  with weak data in Europe.  In contrast, Canadian  data releases  were  more positive.

Early  in the intermeeting period, the Bank of Canada lowered its policy interest rate by 25  basis points,  citing reduced demand for exports  to the United  States. There were no other changes  in the policy interest rates  of the major foreign industrial countries  during this period.  Long-term rates  generally  declined  in these countries,  but by less than the  drop in  U.S. long  rates.  Broad equity indexes  in most major industrial  countries moved  lower over the period, especially  in Japan,  where share prices fell 8 1/2  percent as the market optimism that followed Prime Minister Koizumi's election began to fade.

The  dollar's exchange value against the  currencies  of our other important trading partners was  also up  slightly,  on balance,  over  the intermeeting period. Significant appreciation  of the dollar  against  the Brazilian real and  the Taiwan dollar outweighed  modest depreciation  against the Mexican peso.  The largerthan-expected  bond exchange  by the Argentine government  led to sharp declines in Argentine  short- and long-term interest  rates.  Subsequently,  rates reversed part  of this  decline  on market concerns  about the exchange-rate-linked  system of import  taxes and  export subsidies  that was  announced  on June  15. Movements of emerging-market  equity  indexes were mixed over the intermeeting  period.

. The Desk did not intervene  during  the period for the accounts  of the System or the Treasury.
