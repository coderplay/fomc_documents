Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Federal Government

The Monthly Treasury Statement reports that the federal government recorded an $81 billion deficit in May.  Adjusted for payment timing shifts, deposit insurance, spectrum auction proceeds, and sales of major assets, the deficit in May was $70 billion, $42 billion larger than the level recorded last year.  Lower receipts and higher outlays each accounted for about half of the deficit increase.

Receipts in May were 18 percent lower than the level recorded last year.  Much of the decline occurred in nonwithheld individual income and self-employment taxes (mostly final payments on 2001 tax liability), which were about 65 percent lower than last year, and income tax refunds (also on 2001 tax liability), which were about 34 percent higher.  Withheld and FICA taxes were just slightly below last year's level.

Outlays in May were 12 percent higher than last year.  Defense spending continued to increase rapidly, up almost 19 percent over last May.  Spending on income security in May was substantially above last year's level, reflecting higher unemployment insurance outlays and an increase in child tax credits (which are claimed on year-end tax returns and are deemed outlays to the extent they bring a taxpayer's liability below zero).  Net interest payments continue to fall.

Labor Market Developments

Initial claims for unemployment insurance under state programs inched down 2,000 to 393,000 for the week ended June 15, and the four-week moving average of initial claims moved down 7,000 to 395,000.  This is the first time the four-week moving average has fallen below 400,000 since March.  The effect of the federal temporary extended unemployment compensation program (TEUC) on initial claims continues to wane, as fewer individuals file state claims to establish eligibility for the program.  The number of individuals receiving federal TEUC benefits stood at 1.45 million in the week ended June 1, while an additional 2,200 individuals received other extended benefits that week. 1

Note. Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.

1. A shift in payment timing occurs when the first of the month falls on a weekend or holiday, or when the first three days of a month are nonworking days.  Outlays for defense, social security,

Medicare, income security, and "other" have been adjusted to account for these shifts.

The level of insured unemployment for the week ended June 8 rose 23,000 to 3.78 million, and the previous week's level was revised down 20,000 to 3.75 million.  The insured unemployment rate held steady at 2.9 percent in the week ended June 8.  The level of insured unemployment likely continues to be boosted by the TEUC program, as individuals nearing the exhaustion of their state benefits, but assured of additional benefits through TEUC, may have searched less intensively for jobs and thus remained on state benefit rolls longer than they otherwise would have.

Manufacturers' Shipments, Inventories, and Orders

Historical data on orders and shipments of capital goods were revised yesterday for the period January 1992 through April 2002.  The revisions mainly reflect the benchmarking to the 2000 Annual Survey of Manufactures. The revisions after 2000 incorporate late filers and updated seasonal adjustment factors.  Census has not yet released all of the detailed data.

The nominal value of shipments of nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, were revised down by about $2.3 billion on average from 2000 on. By far the largest single change was to computers and peripheral equipment, which was revised down by roughly $1.8 billion.  Instead of increasing on balance during 2000, computer shipments now show a steady decline; the growth rates of computer shipments after 2000 were little affected by the revision.  Shipments of communications equipment were revised up by $0.3 billion on average since the beginning of 2000.  Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments were revised down $0.9 billion, reflecting widespread and generally small changes.

The nominal value of orders for nondefense capital goods, excluding aircraft, were revised down by about $2.5 billion on average from 2000 on.  Bookings for communications equipment were revised up slightly; new orders for computers were revised down in line with the revision to shipments, as were bookings outside of the high-tech categories.

The BEA intends to incorporate the revised data on shipments in next week's final release on first-quarter GDP.  At the time of the annual revision in late July, the BEA will incorporate into the official NIPA figures the revisions to earlier quarters.  Based on our preliminary assessment of the data we have in hand, we do not yet have reason to believe that the BEA will substantially revise E&amp;S in the final GDP release for the first quarter.

The benchmark revision also contained information about the book value of manufacturers' inventories.  Stocks held by manufacturers were revised up from the start of 2000.  Taken together with the downward revision to shipments, the inventory-shipments ratio now peaks at a higher level in 2001. The revised stock-to-shipments ratio declines rapidly from the middle of last year to about the same level that prevailed at the beginning of 2000.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit in goods and services was reported to be $35.9 billion in April, about $3-1/2 billion larger than the March deficit, which was about $1 billion wider than previously reported.  For the first quarter on average, the trade deficit was $379 billion at an annual rate, $13 billion larger than previously reported, and $27 billion larger than the revised fourth-quarter deficit.  For last year as a whole, the deficit is now reported to have been $358 billion, about $20 billion larger than the earlier estimate.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exported goods and services rose about 2 percent in April.  All of the increase was in goods, as services fell slightly.  Increases were widespread among categories of goods, including significant gains in industrial supplies, capital goods, consumer goods, and autos.  The April level of total exports of goods and services was nearly 3 percent (quarterly rate) above the first-quarter average level.

Imports of goods and services rose 4-1/2 percent in April.  The value of oil imports rose sharply, reflecting an increase in the price, while non-oil imports were up 3-1/2 percent.  All of the increase was in goods, while service imports were down slightly.  Increases were broadly-based across categories of goods, with the exception of aircraft.  Imports of consumer goods, autos, and industrial supplies were each up about 5 percent, and imports of capital goods excluding aircraft rose nearly 3 percent.  The April level of total imports of goods and services was 6 percent (quarterly rate) above the first-quarter level.

U.S. Current Account through 2002:Q1

In 2002:Q1, the U.S. current account deficit edged up to almost $450 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate (s.a.a.r.).  The $69.6 billion larger deficit reflected increases in the deficits on goods and services, other income and transfers, and a shift in the balance on investment income from a surplus to a deficit.  The Commerce Department's estimates of the international transactions accounts have been revised to reflect improved estimating methods and the incorporation of new data, including results from the U.S. Treasury Department's Benchmark Survey of Foreign Portfolio Investment in the United States as of March 31, 2000.

For the first quarter, the deficit on goods increased $23 billion s.a.a.r. as the recovery in the United States took hold, increasing U.S. imports of goods, whereas goods exports declined $10.8 billion s.a.a.r. across a range of categories.  The surplus on services decreased $4.3 billion s.a.a.r in the first quarter, as an increase in the surplus on travel was more than offset by a decrease in the surplus on other private services.  The balance on investment income decreased $33 billion s.a.a.r., moving from a surplus in the fourth quarter of last year to a deficit in the first quarter of 2002.  The movement of the balance to a deficit was largely attributable to increased direct investment income payments.  The deficit on other income and transfers increased $9.3 billion s.a.a.r.

The June 20 release includes revisions to quarterly data from 1995:Q1 through 2001:Q4.  The revisions decreased the size of the current account deficit each quarter.  The largest yearly revisions were to 1999, 2000, and 2001, with the 1999 and 2000 revisions decreasing the deficits by more than $30 billion each year, and the revision to 2001 reducing the current account deficit by about $24 billion.  These revisions primarily reflect a reduction in estimated interest payments to foreigners based on the new portfolio benchmark survey.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Portfolio capital inflows were revised substantially to incorporate information from the new benchmark survey.  The magnitude of the revisions, in particular to foreign purchases of U.S. debt securities (lines 4a-c of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table), was unprecedented.  The benchmark survey produced amounts for foreign holdings of U.S. debt securities-Treasuries, agencies, and corporates-that were much smaller than accumulated capital flows would suggest.  In light of this, BEA revised downward inflows into U.S. debt securities from 1995:Q1 to 2000:Q1 to make accumulated capital flows consistent with the benchmark survey amounts (and extrapolated these adjustments forward).  In 2001, debt inflows were reduced from $386 billion to $280 billion.  Debt inflows for the first quarter of this year are now estimated to have totaled $40 billion, which is the $70 billion reported through the TIC system minus $30 billion in BEA adjustments.  The Summary Table now incorporates these adjustments.  (BEA did not substantially revise inflows into U.S. equities, as the benchmark survey amount for foreign holdings of U.S. equities was in line with the TIC data.)

The lower recorded capital inflows from 1995 forward resulted in lower income payments and therefore lower current account deficits.  There was, however, a larger effect on the statistical discrepancy (last line).  Prior to the revisions, the cumulated discrepancy over the 1995-2000 period totaled negative $203 billion, implying overrecorded capital inflows.  With the revised data, the cumulated discrepancy totaled positive $89 billion.  The statistical discrepancy was positive $13 billion in the first quarter, compared to negative $56 billion in the fourth quarter of last year.

Direct investment inflows (line 7) in the first quarter totaled $26 billion, slightly stronger than the tepid inflows of the second half of last year.  Direct investment outflows (line 6) totaled $23 billion in the first quarter, owing almost entirely to reinvested earnings.  Both outward and inward direct investment flows reflected the relatively low level of merger activity in the quarter.  Revisions to direct investment inflows and outflows in 2000 and 2001 were large but offsetting.

Net shipments of U.S. currency to foreigners (line 8) fell somewhat in the first quarter and the capital account balance was unchanged.
