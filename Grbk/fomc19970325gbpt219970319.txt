DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Domestic demand has remained robust, and the economy consequently has continued to register sizable gains in employment in early 1997. Although increasingly tight labor markets have been mirrored in an uptrend in average hourly earnings, other signs of inflationary pressure are still few and far between. CPI inflation has been modest in  the past two months, with increases in "core" prices running below even the reduced pace of 1996.

Labor Market Developments

Total nonfarm payroll employment grew briskly again in February, and aggregate hours of  production or nonsupervisory workers on nonagricultural payrolls soared, more than reversing the sharp weather-related decline in  January. In  the household survey, the civilian unemployment rate has continued to fluctuate narrowly, averaging 5.3 percent over January and February. The labor force participation rate jumped to  a  historical peak of 67.2 percent in January and then slipped back to 67.0 percent in February.

Three special factors buffeted the employment numbers for January and February. First, as a  result of seasonal adjustment problems associated with last year's January blizzard, employment gains in several industries--most notably help-supply services--were overstated this January and understated in  February by  approximately 80,000. Second, changes in  the monthly patterns of post-Christmas layoffs resulted in a  sharp drop in  jobs at general merchandise stores in  January and an offsetting bounceback in February. 1 Third, the BLS estimates that February's reported 109,000 jump in employment in  the construction industry likely overstated the true strength in this industry by around 85,000. Only a  small portion (perhaps 10,000) of this outsized gain represented a  bounceback from the poor weather in the Midwest and South, which held back construction activity in  January. More important, the unseasonably mild weather in  February throughout much of  'the  country led builders to begin their spring hiring earlier than usual. After netting out these factors, nonfarm payrolls still expanded very rapidly in

January and February, with job growth averaging more than 250,000 per month. 2

In  February, average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonagricultural payrolls soared 0.8 hour, to 35.0 hours, more than reversing a  dip in the preceding month. The February increase in the workweek was widespread across major industry divisions, with all but the manufacturing industry showing a  sharp jump in  weekly hours. But even in  manufacturing, the workweek increased 0.2 hour, to 41.9 hours--retracing much of its 0.3 hour January decline--and overtime hours turned up 0.1 hour to 4.7 hours per week. Largely because of  the February run-up in  the workweek, aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers in private industry were up 2.7 percent in February after falling 1.6 percent in  January. Smoothing through the monthly volatility, the workweek has averaged 34.6 hours thus far in  the first quarter, little changed from its fourth-quarter level. The January-February average of the aggregate index of production worker hours was up 0.5 percent (not at an  annual rate) from its fourthquarter average.

On a  quarterly average basis, the average workweek has lengthened considerably since the end of 1995 and has now climbed most of  the way back to its most recent peak in 1994.3 The lengthening workweek may be an indication that firms are constrained in their hiring by  a  lack of suitable workers.

Other indicators of labor demand also remain on the strong side. Initial claims for unemployment insurance averaged just over 310,000 during the past four weeks--the lowest sustained level since early 1989. In addition, the Conference Board's index of  help wanted advertising--a crude gauge of the number of unfilled positions--ticked up in  January to its highest level in  the past ten years. Meanwhile, respondents to the Conference Board and the Michigan Survey Research Center (SRC) consumer confidence surveys perceive strong current and future labor market conditions respectively.

the second quarter also paints an  upbeat picture of labor demand; experience suggests, however, that the reading may say more about the strength of  hiring in the current quarter than in  the spring.

The strong demand for labor has been pulling additional people into the labor market. Looking through the zigs and zags of the past two years, one can now discern something akin to a  cyclical 4 pickup in labor force participation. The labor force participation rate has averaged 67.1 percent through the first two months of the first quarter, up from 66.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, while the unemployment rate has held steady at 5.3 percent.

The flip side of  the strong employment and workweek gains in 1996 was disappointing productivity growth. The most recent published data show that labor productivity in  the nonfarm business sector grew 0.9 percent over the four quarters of 1996. This marked the largest annual increase since 1992: nonetheless, the 1996 reading still left average productivity growth during the current expansion below its long-run trend rate of expansion.

Industrial Production

Industrial production rebounded 1/2 percent in February after declining a  bit in  January. Increases were particularly sharp among producers of durable goods, whose output advanced 1-1/4 percent after changing little in January. The February increase in total industrial production was moderated by  a  plunge in the output of utilities, reflecting the unseasonably mild weather last month, and only a  small gain in the production of nondurable goods. The upsurge in production brings the factory utilization rate in February back to 82-1/2 percent, the upper end of  the 82 percent to 82-1/2 percent range that generally has prevailed for more than a year.

The output of  motor vehicles and parts rose further in February, to a  level more than 8  percent above the strike-related low  in October. Assemblies of  light vehicles, at 12.4 million units (annual rate), raised the days' supply at the end of the month (based on  February sales) only to a  still comfortable 64 days. Looking ahead, schedules call for production to  be well maintained over the remainder of  the first half at an  annual rate of slightly more than 12 million units.

Note. Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.

The output of  aircraft and parts, an  area of ongoing strength, rose further in  February, with a  sharp 3  percent gain in the production of  commercial aircraft. Underpinned by  the strength in orders, mainly from foreign airlines, Boeing's current schedule calls for raising the output of completed planes from twenty-six per month this quarter to forty planes a  month by the fourth quarter of this year--the company's highest ever monthly production rate. This planned increase would be consistent with growth of  total commercial aircraft output of  more than 50 percent this year.

By major market group (excluding energy items), the output of consumer goods advanced 1/2 percent in  February, boosted by  a snap-back in the production of goods for the home, mainly appliances and carpeting. The output of  business equipment rose 1.1 percent further in February, with all major categories posting gains. The output of construction supplies, which was weak around the turn of the year, rebounded in February and has, on  balance, remained at  the high level reached last summer. The output of durable materials rose sharply, a  result not only of a  2  percent advance in semiconductor output but also of a  rebound in the production of

basic metals. Output of basic metals stepped up in the second half of  last year, raising utilization in some industries--particularly raw steel and primary copper--to relatively high rates and likely contributing to the recent firming of the spot prices of some basic metals.

<!-- missing-text -->

Most of the indicators of  economic activity suggest a  moderate production pace in  the next few  months. The staff's series on adjusted orders for durable goods bounced back in January after two months of significant negative growth, and the National Association of Purchasing Managers' (NAPM) diffusion index for orders increased in February after having fallen in  January. With manufacturing capacity estimated to  be expanding at about a  4  percent annual rate, a  continuation of the recent pace of production, which to date has not resulted in a  deterioration of  vendor performance, is unlikely to put much upward pressure on  the overall factory operating rate.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light motor vehicles picked up to a  15-1/4 million unit pace on  average in January and February (annual rate). The increase reflects, in large part, a  recovery in the supply of vehicles, which had been disrupted last quarter by labor disputes at GM and by model changeover difficulties. On balance, sales in the past five months averaged 15 million units, the same pace that prevailed in  the second and third quarters of  last year.

<!-- missing-text -->

Confidential data indicate that a  step-up in  sales to consumers accounted for the strong performance in  February, with fleet sales having only partially recovered from November's strike-related plunge.

In  the near term, several factors are working to sustain the strength in consumer demand. The preliminary Michigan SRC survey for March reported that consumers' attitudes toward car-buying jumped back to the upper end of  the favorable range that has prevailed since early 1996. The Conference Board consumer survey for February also indicated that the proportion of  households planning to buy new  automobiles moved up. According to the Michigan survey, consumers are finding the prices of new cars quite attractive. Indeed, sales incentives remain sizable, and news reports suggest they will remain high or  perhaps increase in  the second quarter. The heavy incentives activity is being driven, at least in part, by the recent deterioration in GM, Ford, and Chrysler's market share of automobile sales. While the Big Three's market share has recovered from the strike-related fourth-quarter plunge, it remains at the low end of recent experience.

Personal Income and Consumption

After a  lackluster December, consumer spending picked up considerably in early 1997, supported by  continued solid growth of income and highly favorable consumer sentiment. According to the advance report, total nominal retail sales increased 0.8 percent in February and are now  estimated to  have increased 1-1/2 percent in January. Spending in the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 1.3 percent in January and 0.4 percent in  February. On the whole, average nominal spending in the retail control category during the first two months of this year was up 1.8 percent from its fourth-quarter level--9 percent, at an annual rate.

Spending on services rose strongly in January, the latest month for which estimates are available. Real expenditures on energy services jumped 3.6 percent (not at an annual rate) because of unseasonably cold weather in  January. However, energy spending probably fell back last month, when, according to national weather data, temperatures were milder than normal. Non-energy services rose 0.4 percent in  January, reflecting the gains in  brokerage services that accompanied the large volume of equity trading.

Official estimates are available only through January, but personal income growth is apparently continuing at a  fast pace this quarter. Real disposable personal income rose 0.5 percent in January after increasing the same amount in  December. The January gain was largely attributable to a  sizable increase in transfer payments, primarily the result of annual cost-of-living adjustments in  federal transfer programs (which are not seasonally adjusted), but also boosted by changes to the earned income credit program. Private-sector wage and salary disbursements actually declined in January when average weekly hours dropped. Nonetheless, the substantial increase in aggregate hours in  February suggests that the January decline was more than reversed last month.

Readings of  consumer sentiment have remained very upbeat. In January, the sentiment index from the Conference Board survey reached its highest level since the late 1980s. In February and in March's preliminary report, the Michigan SRC survey followed suit-reaching the highest level since 1965. Households reported increasingly favorable views of their current personal financial situation.

Although both sentiment indexes have registered solid gains in the past year, the increase has been more dramatic for the Conference Board index. A key factor explaining its rise has been a marked improvement in  households' views of current employment conditions: The percentage of respondents saying that jobs are plentiful rose from one-quarter in  June 1996 to almost one-third in February 1997. In  contrast, because the Michigan index does not include a  question about current employment conditions, it is not directly affected by perceptions of  the labor market. Nonetheless, the Michigan survey does ask a  question, not included in the composite index, about expectations for unemployment during the next twelve months. Here, also, households' views have improved considerably since last summer, with the fraction expecting higher unemployment dropping from 35 percent in  June 1996 to 24 percent in February and March. Thus, both surveys provide evidence of receding concerns about unemployment, enhancing the prospects for sustained strength in household spending in the near term. Further gains in stock market wealth of  course point in  the same direction. Housing Markets

activity, obscuring underlying trends. In December, adverse weather depressed single-family housing starts quite noticeably; in contrast, exceptionally mild weather boosted starts in  February. Putting greater weight on the permits figures, which ordinarily provide a  more reliable reading of the direction of activity than do the starts numbers, we  would judge that single-family construction has been on a  steady to slightly upward sloped course of late.

In addition to the potentially distorting effects of  unusual weather, a  statistical break in  the Census Bureau's series on sales of new homes has made discerning current market conditions more difficult than usual. While reporting that sales of  new homes jumped in  January to 870,000 units, the second-fastest pace on record, the Census Bureau noted that new computerized data collection methods that it began implementing last May seem to be imparting an upward bias to the estimates. The Census staff used ad hoc procedures to counteract the overstatement of the January estimate, but the accuracy of  the resulting adjustments is difficult to assess. Until the Census Bureau accumulates more experience with the new data collection methods, we  will likely face considerable uncertainty about the reliability of monthly estimates of new-home sales. Sales of existing homes also rose in  January, offsetting part of  the December decline.

Other indicators are somewhat ambiguous about the strength of demand for single-family homes. Builders' assessments of  new-home sales increased in early March but remain at a  moderate level, well below their recent high in the second quarter of 1996. In  the first half of  March, homebuying attitudes, as measured by preliminary readings from the Michigan SRC survey, dropped back to the lowest level since September. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes have continued the erratic pattern they have exhibited since late last year. Smoothing through the sharp ups and downs, in recent weeks the pace of applications is running at about the same average level as was observed during most of last year.

Multifamily housing starts rebounded in  February after plunging abruptly in  January. Although the demand for multifamily units has strengthened in  some areas, the imbalance of supply and demand for the sector as a  whole has not improved noticeably. The vacancy rate for multifamily rental units has edged up over the past two years, and residential rent remains at an eleven-year low in real terms (as measured in the CPI).

Business Fixed Investment

Available indicators suggest that real business fixed investment is continuing to grow at a  healthy pace in  the first quarter, led by another large gain in business purchases of computers and by  a further expansion of  nonresidential construction activity.

After large increases at the end of 1996, nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods fell 2.5 percent in  January. Outside of transportation and information technology, shipments fell 2.3 percent in  January, and bookings were little changed. Both shipments and orders for these goods have been fluctuating around a fairly stable level for the past year.

In the office and computing equipment component, nominal shipments held at their high December level; businesses have continued to seek efficiency gains through advances in  automation, and the reduced operating costs of  the latest generation of servers running Windows NT  has sparked a  new  wave of system upgrades. Given the steep price declines in this sector, the January reading points to another large increase in real spending on office and computing equipment.

Shipments of communications equipment fell substantially over the December-January period after posting large gains in 1996. Bookings tend to be lumpy for the diverse products grouped in  this category, but of late they have been even more volatile than usual. Nonetheless, underlying the month-to-month swings seems to  be an ongoing expansion of  investment in  communications equipment driven by technological change. For example, increased usage of the Internet is boosting capital spending on telecommunications equipment, as local phone lines in some regions have become overloaded and on-line providers struggle to meet rising demand-American Online being the most highly publicized case. In  addition, many states are proceeding with telecommunications deregulation in spite of the delays in implementation of  the Telecommunications Reform Act at the federal level. Perhaps as a  response to these developments. AT&amp;T has announced plans to almost double capital spending on its network this year--to $9 billion--in anticipation of its entry into local phone markets. In addition, a  series of multiyear, multiple-satellite orders in recent months suggests that the demand for satellites is strong.

Business purchases of  motor vehicles have changed little, on balance, in recent months. Fleet sales of  autos increased sharply in December and January, partially recovering from strike-depressed levels in  October and November. In contrast, sales of light trucks to businesses--which were less affected by the GM strike--fell back in December and January after outsized gains in the prior two months. After bottoming out in  November and December, sales of medium and heavy trucks turned up in January and were essentially unchanged in February.

Even after rising very rapidly in the fourth quarter, outlays for nonresidential structures appear to be increasing further this quarter. Construction put-in-place rose 2.8 percent in January, to a  level 1.7 percent above the fourth-quarter average. Following December declines, spending for office, other commercial, and lodging and miscellaneous buildings resumed upward trends. Other indicators of demand paint a  picture of continuing growth over the coming quarters. Contracts for construction remain at a  high level and point, in particular, to increased construction of office buildings. Vacancy rates for office buildings stand near their lowest levels since the mid-1980s, and the National Real Estate Index indicates that transactions prices for office buildings have been rising since early 1994. The FDIC real estate survey of senior examiners and asset managers also reports a  very upbeat assessment of the strength of  the commercial market.

Business Inventories

Modest inventory investment in  January, following stock drawdowns in November and December, left business inventories lean early in  the first quarter. For most manufacturing industries and trade groupings, inventory-sales ratios in January were near the low end of their recent ranges. On the whole, business establishments appear to  have some room for restocking in coming months.

Manufacturers' stocks were virtually unchanged in  January. Among industries producing capital goods, the sizable buildup in inventories of aircraft and parts that began more than a  year ago continued; stocks of several types of  industrial machinery also expanded. In  contrast, inventories of computing and office equipment declined further in January (in  book value terms), the ninth monthly decline during the past twelve months. Stocks of telecommunications equipment and construction machinery were little changed. In the consumer goods sector, producers of household

durables, nondurable home goods, and apparel all reported small stock accumulations in  January following little net change over the fourth quarter. However, inventories held by tobacco producers posted an  unusually large runoff in January, with the bulk of  the decline in  stocks of  materials and supplies. Given the brisk pace of shipments of finished tobacco in  December and January and the sizable decline in the inventory-shipments ratio for the industry, the January runoff did not appear to  have stemmed from a  serious overhang. On the whole, manufacturers' inventories were reasonably well balanced in January; the inventory-shipments ratio for all manufacturing was at its lowest point in  recent years.

In contrast to  manufacturing, wholesale inventories expanded substantially in  January--up at an annual rate of $32 billion in book-value terms--after generally moderate inventory buildups during the fourth quarter. While stocks of  motor vehicles and accessories accounted for about one-third of the January accumulation, nonvehicle stocks also showed widespread increases. In particular, inventories at wholesale apparel outlets expanded further in January after increasing substantially in December. In both months, however, the accumulations were accompanied by  very strong shipments, and the inventory-sales ratio for apparel distributors dropped to its lowest level in  the current expansion. Most types of wholesale establishments appear to have had no serious inventory imbalances.

Further downstream, non-auto retail inventories fell at a $10 billion annual rate in  January. Large drawdowns occurred at general merchandise stores, where sales surged in  January, and at outlets selling other durable goods. In  contrast, stores selling nondurables other than general merchandise, food, and apparel saw a second large monthly accumulation of inventories. Overall, the inventory-sales ratio for non-auto retailers dropped to the low  end of the range of  the preceding year. However, at general merchandisers, stocks fell to  a  twenty-year low relative to sales.

Given the continued strength in  sales at general merchandise stores in  February, some rebuilding of  stocks in coming months seems likely.

Federal Sector

Real federal expenditures on  consumption and gross investment, as measured in the national income and product accounts, rose about 1-1/2 percent from the fourth quarter of 1995 to  the fourth quarter of 1996. The rise was mostly an artifact of events in late 1995government shutdowns and restrictive continuing resolutions for programs covered by unpassed appropriations bills--that held real purchases to especially low levels. The underlying trend of federal consumption and investment expenditures probably is better represented by the 2-1/2 percent average annual rate of decline from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the final quarter of 1996. Reductions have occurred in  both real defense purchases and real nondefense purchases.

For the first four months of fiscal year 1997, the federal unified budget deficit, adjusted for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was $2 billion higher than last year--a 4-1/4 percent increase. Relative to last year, both receipts and adjusted outlays were up about 6 percent. One factor contributing to the rise in outlays was increased spending on  health programs, with Medicare spending 10 percent higher and Medicaid spending 11 percent higher than last year. While the growth in  Medicare is in  line with recent trends, Medicaid growth far exceeds the 3 percent rate observed last year. The rebound in  Medicaid growth appears to indicate that last year's slowdown in outlays for that program was only a  temporary phenomenon. Other increases in outlays included a  4  percent rise in adjusted defense spending and a 13 percent surge in outlays for nondefense items other than net interest and social insurance programs (social security, health, income security). In  the first

four months of 1996, spending out of many defense and nondefense accounts was depressed by restrictive continuing resolutions.

The President's budget for fiscal 1998, which was released in early February, incorporates proposals broadly similar to those he offered last year. According to  OMB scoring, the President's proposals would result in a  narrowing of the deficit over the next several years and would yield a  $17 billion surplus in  2002. The proposals would reduce net spending--particularly discretionary spending and Medicare--and step up the pace of spectrum auctions. The President's plan also includes a  set of tax provisions that on net lead to a  small revenue loss. Measured relative to the OMB's current-services baseline, the President's plan produces $254 billion in  aggregate deficit reduction (including associated lower debt-service payments) over six years, with about threequarters of the savings scheduled to occur in  fiscal 2001 and 2002.

According to CBO scoring, however, the deficit under the President's "basic" budget plan would be $69 billion in 2002, $86 billion more than estimated by  the OMB. Differences in economic assumptions underlying the baseline budget projections account for almost two-thirds of  the discrepancy between the OMB and CBO projections. The remaining one-third is due to differences in the scoring of the President's policies; the largest differences are for spectrum sales in 2002 and the President's Medicare proposals.

In  anticipation of  the CBO's less favorable assessment, the President proposed a  trigger mechanism that would be used if the budget seems unlikely to reach balance in fiscal 2002. The trigger would invoke a  set of "alternative policies," including maintaining the scheduled suspension of  the tax cuts after 2000 (raising an additional $24 billion in  2002) and imposing additional spending cuts in fiscal years 2001 and 2002 (reducing spending by $45 billion in 2002). In this scenario, essentially all of the aggregate 19982002 deficit reduction would occur in  the last two fiscal years.

The aviation excise taxes that had expired on  December 31, 1996, were reinstated on  March 7. These taxes, which were included in  the President's proposals, are expected to raise a  total of $2.7 billion through the remainder of  fiscal 1997.

State and Local Governments

State and local spending trends remained firm in early 1997. Employment has expanded at a  solid clip, rising 29,000 in January and 49.000 in  February; however, the BLS suspects that some of the

strength may  be related to seasonal adjustment difficulties. Construction outlays were up a  bit further in  January: during the fourth quarter, real spending on structures, on a  NIPA basis, rose at a  rapid 11.6 percent annual rate. In  January, a  large drop in construction of sewer systems was more than offset by  increases in school and highway building.

The fiscal position of  most states continues to look quite strong. More than half the states are reporting that revenues have been coming in ahead of expectations; few  are requesting supplemental appropriations to cover overruns, and about a  third are considering tax cuts. Nonetheless, the budgetary picture in  a  small number of states remains tight. In  particular, three states--Idaho, Hawaii, and Tennessee--report that revenues are below expectations so far this year. More generally, with Medicaid costs having picked up, many analysts caution that cost increases for health care may once again become a  budget problem for the states.

Prices and Labor Costs

Recent readings for core consumer prices extended the modest increases seen over the past year. For items other than food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in  February after increasing just 0.1 percent in  January. During the twelve months ended in February, the core CPI increased 2.5 percent, down from the 2.9 percent pace recorded in  the year-earlier period. Within the core, the deceleration was most noticeable in  the goods category, while prices of services rose only a  bit less than over the previous twelve months. Among goods, prices decelerated for motor vehicles, house furnishings, and a  range of  other items such as personal care goods. Because many of  these products are produced outside the United States, their prices can be heavily influenced by  non-oil import prices, which have decelerated considerably over the past several quarters as the dollar has strengthened. This constellation of developments suggests that the downswing in import prices helped restrain core consumer prices in  the past year.

Consumer energy prices rose 0.3 percent further last month, a pace considerably more moderate than in the previous several months. Crude-oil prices have largely reversed last year's run-up, relieving much of the pressure on gasoline and heating oil prices. With mild weather in  many parts of the country as the heating season draws to

a  close, heating oil prices dropped 1.9 percent further in  February. Although retail gasoline prices were unchanged in February, developments at earlier stages of processing suggest that the bad news on gasoline prices is now receding in the rear-view mirror. Similarly, although natural gas prices rose further in February, lower wellhead prices will likely ease pressure on prices paid by consumers. However, consumer electricity prices were up 0.5 percent in February after subsiding over the preceding four months.

After a  couple of  months of favorable news, consumer food prices turned up 0.3 percent in  February as the January freeze in Florida began to push up prices of fresh fruits and vegetables. Increases in the prices of other food items appear largely to  have returned to a  modest trend, with a  couple of exceptions. The price of raw coffee beans has surged about 50 percent since the end of December; inventories have been low for some time, and weather and other factors have caused delays in getting the harvest to  market. Even with futures prices pointing down sharply over the summer, substantial increases in  retail coffee prices appear to be in  train for the next few  months. In a  more favorable development, McDonald's recently announced that it will cut the price of  Big Macs to 55 cents beginning April 25 and will establish discounts on some breakfast items at the beginning of April. Because the company's domestic sales amounted to an estimated 6-1/2 percent of total food purchased in restaurants last year, these hefty price cuts could show through to the CPI for overall food.

For items other than food and energy, prices were up 0.2 percent in February. Airfares dropped further, likely a  result of the sale initiated by American Airlines after the pilots' strike was averted in  mid-February.10 This month, airfares may be boosted by the reinstatement of the ticket tax on  March 7. However, while these excise taxes will likely be passed on to consumers in the long run, the short-run effect on airfares may be  muted because prices for airline tickets are constantly changing in response to a host of other factors. Observers have noted that not all airline

ticket prices fell when the taxes expired at the end of last year; some airlines increased their fares when the tax cut expired. Similarly, many airlines are reported to have lowered their base (pre-tax) ticket prices following the tax reinstatement so as to reduce the impact on consumers. Outside of airfares, most items registered small price increases last month. 1 1

At the producer level, the recent news on finished goods prices has been quite favorable. The PPI for finished goods declined 0.4 percent in  February; the index for food continued a  string of monthly declines, and lower prices for crude oil fed through to a 1.2 percent decline in  the index for finished energy items. Prices of finished goods excluding food and energy ticked down 0.1 percent last month, with prices decreasing for both consumer and capital goods. Among consumer goods, price declines were widespread across a  range of durable and nondurable items. Within the capital goods component, computer prices posted an extraordinary plunge of 5.2 percent at a  monthly rate, the largest drop since the series was added to the PPI in 1991. Over the twelve months ended in  February, the core PPI rose only 0.5 percent, down from a  2.1 percent increase in  the prior twelve-month period. Although the producer price index covers only domestically produced goods, prices of  some of those items likely have been restrained in  the past year by competitively priced imports.

Although broad measures of prices remain relatively tame for the time being, some prices at earlier stages of  processing have moved up, perhaps reflecting scattered capacity pressures. On balance, metals prices have trended up since the end of last year, with the Journal of Commerce metals index rising an additional 2.7 percent since the last Greenbook. Price increases have been sharpest for steel scrap, although copper and aluminum prices have risen as well. Moreover, the purchasing managers' index of prices paid moved up in  February; more respondents reported paying higher prices for metals as well as some other items. Among other industrial materials, plywood prices have moved higher since the last Greenbook; lumber prices have eased recently but are still up significantly from their average last year.

materials prices over a  longer horizon, the PPI for crude materials other than food and energy has continued to accelerate; this index has increased 3.2 percent over the past six months, compared with a decline of 5.6 percent over the preceding half-year period.

Despite assorted factors that have buffeted consumer prices, inflation expectations have continued to show no signs of picking up. Indeed, the mean expected price increase over the next year, as measured by  the Michigan SRC survey, is now running lower than it was six months ago. On  the other hand, median inflation 12 expectations have been little changed. Similarly, other survey measures of inflation expectations--over both short and long horizons--have remained flat or have edged off in recent months.

Turning to labor markets, employers' hourly wage costs have continued their moderate acceleration despite only small increases in January and February. Over the twelve months ended in February, average hourly earnings of production or  nonsupervisory workers on nonagricultural payrolls increased 3.8 percent, up from 3.0 percent and 2.6 percent during the twelve-month periods ended in  February 1996 and 1995, respectively. Compensation per hour in  the nonfarm business sector--which includes estimates of  nonwage benefit costs as well as wages and salaries--was up 3.6 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter. On  a  fourth-quarter over fourth-quarter basis, hourly compensation increased 3.6 percent in 1996, about the same rate of  increase as in 1995.13

Interest rates have increased since the February FOMC meeting, responding to both economic news and the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. In the opening weeks of  the intermeeting period, market participants generally interpreted incoming data as implying subdued inflation and reduced odds of  Federal Reserve tightening (chart, top panel). However, rates rose markedly after the Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, in which the Federal Reserve was seen as  more concerned about potential inflation and more willing to take preemptive action to restrain it than markets had thought. Against this background, rates also increased after the  March 13 report on retail sales, which seemed to  provide some rationale for a  policy tightening, but then eased slightly on  the release of  favorable February data for producer prices. On  balance, Treasury bill rates have moved up 15 to 20 basis points, and longer-term yields 25 to 35 basis points. Current quotes on short-term interest rate futures suggest that, allowing for liquidity premiums, the  market places the odds of  a 25 basis point System tightening at about 50 percent in  March and roughly 70 percent by  May (bottom panel).

With interest rates rising, stock prices flattened out or turned down over the intermeeting period. The S&amp;P 500 index was essentially unchanged, and the NASDAQ and Russell 2000 indexes fell 7-1/2 percent and 3-1/2 percent respectively. Nevertheless, priceearnings ratios remain generally quite high.

Private debt growth appears to have stepped up a  bit in  the first quarter from its fourth-quarter pace. Borrowing by nonfinancial corporations, in  particular, seems to  have strengthened. Commercial paper issuance has turned positive on  net, C&amp;I bank loans have grown briskly, and bond offerings have remained close to the fourth-quarter average. Meanwhile, preliminary data suggest that household borrowing may have ticked up  in the first quarter. In contrast, government debt issuance weakened in  the early part of  the year, with federal debt growth slowing further and state and local government debt flattening out.

Business Finance

Business activity in  credit markets has been strong in  the first quarter. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations in January and February was close to  the fourth-quarter pace (table). The run-up in  interest rates since December apparently damped sales

of  investment-grade bonds, but offerings of  speculative-grade bonds have been brisk. Fully a  third of  the nonfinancial bonds issued in the first two months of  the year were rated B  or lower (lower left panel). Despite the heavy issuance of  junk bonds, spreads between their rates and Treasury yields have continued to narrow and are now at their lowest point since data collection began in  the mid-1980s. The market has been supported by sizable flows into junk-bond mutual funds, as investors appear to  have less concern about credit risk.

Among the new  investment-grade issues by  nonfinancial companies were a  few 100-year bonds. Although the  yields on "century" bonds are somewhat higher than other long-term yields, companies believe that these bonds can lower their overall borrowing costs by  raising their profile among investors. However, sales of  these bonds may soon come to a  halt because of  the President's proposal to eliminate the tax deductibility of  interest paid on  bonds of such long maturity. 1

The flattening of  the yield curve in late 1996 encouraged companies to pay down commercial paper by selling bonds, but the recent backup in long rates has stemmed this practice. As a consequence, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding has risen moderately this quarter after contracting sharply in  the fourth quarter of  last year (lower right panel). Quality spreads on commercial paper have been largely unaffected by  the default of Mercury Finance, a  subprime auto lender.

Corporate credit quality remains quite good overall. Moody's downgraded slightly more nonfinancial debt in January and February than it upgraded, but the largest downgrade (of  $6  billion of  JC Penney bonds) was related to a  merger that many analysts believe will prove to  be successful. Moreover, possible upgrades exceed downgrades on  Moody's Watchlist, both by  number and volume, and the default rate on speculative-grade debt so far this year has trailed last year's already low pace. In contrast, business failures appear to have picked up appreciably in  December and January, although the figures are preliminary and subject to possibly large revisions.

Moving beyond the securities markets, businesses have acquired substantial new funds through bank loans in  the first quarter. Commercial and industrial loans at banks increased about 11 percent on  average in  January and February, slightly below the fourthquarter increase but above the growth rate for 1996 as a  whole.

The pace of  new equity offerings in  January and February fell back from the fourth-quarter rate, with the decline attributable entirely to a  drop in  initial public offerings. Registrations of prospective IPOs have edged off as well. The IPO  market has cooled substantially, with new issues being priced below the intended range more often than above it and first-day trading returns down sharply from last year (top panel). Nonfinancial corporations have continued to retire equity on  net since year-end. Merger-related retirements alone in  January and February, at $10.5 billion, equaled gross issuance. Data on completed share repurchases are available only through the third quarter of  last year; however, announcements of  new repurchase programs have moved up from last year's already high level.

Stock prices have slipped a  little, on balance, since the last FOMC meeting, but valuations generally remain rich by historical standards. For the S&amp;P 500, the ratio of  expected twelve-monthahead earnings to price is low relative to  the thirty-year Treasury yield (middle panel). Stock prices have been buoyed by  expectations of long-term nominal earnings growth that are above their peak in the early 1990s and have been revised higher in recent months (bottom left panel). The run-up in  expected earnings growth is even more dramatic in real terms because long-term inflation expectations (for example, as measured in  the Philadelphia Fed survey) seem to have declined about half a  percentage point in  the past few  years. Part of  the explanation for this favorable outlook may be  the surge in  profits from overseas operations since late 1994: Analysts' earnings projections for S&amp;P 500 firms with significant foreign operations exceed expectations for other firms in the S&amp;P 500, and the gap has widened noticeably over the past two years (bottom right panel).

The markets for commercial real estate and commercial mortgages continue to  be strong. In  the January FDIC survey of federal examiners and asset managers, significantly more respondents reported increases in  demand for new office space than reported decreases, compared with three months earlier (top left panel).

There was also a  wider gap between the percentage of respondents reporting increases in  prices and the percentage reporting decreases (top right panel). Meanwhile, the Barron's/Levy February survey of primary commercial mortgage lenders indicated that interest rate spreads on  ten-year mortgages remained in  the relatively favorable range that has prevailed over the past few  years (bottom panel). In addition, spreads on commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBSs) have slipped to  historically narrow levels.

Over the past two years, outstanding commercial mortgage credit has grown very rapidly, with net lending increasing from close to zero in 1994 to $35 billion in 1995 and $61 billion in 1996. The surge of  lending activity reflects stronger nonresidential construction, a  greater willingness to lend, and reduced loan chargeoffs. Gross issuance of  CMBSs soared in 1996, raising the securitized share of  commercial mortgage originations to about 55 percent. These securities are being purchased by insurance companies and  mutual funds, among other investors.

Household Finance

The growth of  household debt appears to have edged above the fourth-quarter rate. Fragmentary data for home-mortgage borrowing-including the Mortgage Bankers Association index of  mortgage applications to purchase homes--indicate a  fairly steady expansion. Consumer credit growth picked up in January, although a  slowing in lending at banks (adjusted for securitization) in  February suggests some subsequent easing in  overall consumer credit growth.

The January rebound in  consumer credit was driven by  a  jump in revolving credit (table). However, swings in  this category are especially large during the holiday season, so seasonally adjusted growth rates are very sensitive to  small variations in  the pattern of  monthly charge volume or repayments. Averaging growth rates for November through January, revolving credit expanded about 12 percent at an  annual rate, approximately the same as for 1996 as a  whole.

Firms specializing in  subprime auto loans have encountered troubles of  late. Intense competition has led to some erosion of credit standards and smaller margins, which have reduced profits and resulted in  acute liquidity problems for some subprime specialists. The difficulties of  Mercury Finance and Jayhawk Acceptance have received the most publicity. After Mercury announced that "accounting irregularities" had inflated the firm's profits for the past few  years, rating agencies downgraded the company's debt,

leaving it unable to sell new commercial paper to repay maturing paper and forcing it to  default. Mercury recently won a  loan extension from Bank of  America through early June, which will allow it to continue operations and look for long-term financing. Jayhawk reported a  fourth-quarter loss related to substantially increased provisions for loan write-offs, which placed the company in violation of  bank loan covenants and prompted it to  file for bankruptcy.

The problems of subprime auto lenders have been concentrated in firms that focus on  the highest-risk category of subprime debt, which accounts for less than 10 percent of  all subprime auto debt and a  minuscule share of total auto loans. In consequence, these problems have had little impact on  the availability or terms of credit in the broader market for auto credit. Newand used-car loan rates at the three captive auto finance companies in January averaged well below their fourth-quarter values, while maturities and loan-to-value ratios were in line with recent experience. 2 The average new-car loan rate at banks in  early February was marginally below its level last fall.

Household loan delinquency rates deteriorated somewhat further in  the fourth quarter of  last year and the beginning of 1997 (chart). According to  the Call Report, delinquency rates at commercial banks increased in  the fourth quarter for residential real estate loans, credit cards, and other consumer loans. The American Bankers Association series for delinquencies on credit cards and other consumer loans also moved up. Moreover, the average delinquency rate on  loans at captive auto finance companies continued to  trend upward in  early 1997, reaching another new  high at 3.6 percent in  January (chart). Contacts at these companies have said that the recent uptrend in delinquencies had been anticipated and in  part reflected earlier efforts to stimulate sales by  making credit more broadly available. 3

The uptrend in  credit card delinquencies and chargeoffs has significantly affected some issuers' profitability and has also led

to  tighter lending standards at many banks. Advanta Corporation, a large "monoline" credit card issuer, announced this week that it anticipated a  substantial first-quarter loss. But industry contacts have suggested that Advanta was late in  addressing its more serious problem areas and has just begun to take steps that many card issuers had initiated as early as last spring. Consequently, these contacts expect other issuers to  report better earnings than Advanta's and to have less need for additional restrictive 4 measures. Indeed, the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey showed a  smaller share of  banks tightening credit card standards in  February than last November.

Treasury and Agency Finance

We  anticipate that the first-quarter federal budget deficit will be somewhat larger than in  the previous quarter. This increase will be financed by  a  larger drawdown of cash balances and some quirks in  the government's cash flow, leaving borrowing from  the public little changed at about $45 billion (table).5 However, the composition of  marketable borrowing will be substantially different from that in  the fourth quarter, with a  sharp decline in bills offsetting a  pickup in coupon issuance.

Since the February FOMC meeting, interest rates on  inflationindexed Treasury securities have generally moved with nominal rates, but they have been decidedly less volatile. The spread between the two rates has widened about 15 basis points over the period. This pattern is consistent with an  increase in expected inflation or greater uncertainty about future inflation, as well as some backup in  real rates, but the thinness of  the market--in terms of  both amount outstanding and trading volume as a  share of  that amount-argues for caution in interpreting the relative rate movements.

Federally sponsored agencies have been active borrowers of late. Fannie Mae, the Federal Home Loan Banks, and the Federal Home

Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) have recently issued socalled global bonds, which are sold simultaneously in  the United States, Europe, and Asia. These transactions can involve more than one currency: for example, Freddie Mac sold bonds for yen but will redeem them in  pounds sterling. Agencies have also launched their first issues of  inflation-indexed debt, with three-year to ten-year notes recently sold by  the Student Loan Marketing Association, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and others.

State and Local Government Finance

State and local governments' issuance of  long-term tax-exempt debt remained light in January and February, as most municipalities had tapped the market heavily in the fourth quarter to  take advantage of  relatively low interest rates (table). Meanwhile, short-term debt issuance rebounded in  February from a  weak January, as governments borrowed in  anticipation of  tax receipts and other seasonal revenue streams.

A  number of  state and local governments have announced plans to sell taxable debt and to use the proceeds to  reduce their unfunded pension obligations. These governments appear to believe that the pension funds can purchase assets whose return will over time exceed the yield on  the bonds being sold. In general, tax laws prohibit the issuance of  tax-exempt debt to purchase taxable assets. New Jersey recently announced that it will sell $2.9 billion in  taxable pension bonds in  March, the largest issuance of  taxable municipal debt on  record.

Commercial Banking Developments

With fourth-quarter data now  available, the Call Report shows that domestically chartered commercial banks had another good year in 1996 (top panels). Return on assets reached a  new  high just above 1.2 percent, and return on  equity stayed close to  the elevated levels of  the past several years. The share of  loans in  total assets continued to rise last year, helping to boost the net interest margin slightly, and net non-interest income also improved a  bit. Despite the industry's well-publicized problems with consumer loans, overall asset quality remains excellent, and provisioning last year again was on  the low side. Delinquencies and charge-offs on other types of  loans are near their lowest levels in a  decade, leaving the total loan portfolio in  very good shape (bottom panels).

With good asset quality and solid capital cushions, banks continued to bid aggressively for large-dollar loan business, as shown in  the latest data from  the Survey of  Terms of  Bank Lending, taken in  the first week of  February (chart). Even though the spread between the rates on loans over $1 million (those most likely to involve investment-grade borrowers) and the intended federal funds rate ticked up, it remained at the lower end of  the range of  the last decade. Spreads for smaller loans held steady at the lowest levels in  several years.

Favorable supply conditions combined with strong demand to produce another rapid expansion of  business loans in  February (table), with large increases at both domestic and foreign banks. The robust pace of  mergers and acquisitions likely contributed to the faster February loan growth. Real estate lending expanded at a 6  percent annual rate in  February, with the home equity component remaining below the elevated fourth-quarter pace. Reported consumer loans ran off in February because of  heavy securitizations, but even with the securitized amounts added back in, consumer loans showed only a  weak expansion.

In  the securities category, growth in  adjusted securities holdings picked up  in February despite a  drop in  U.S. government securities. The acceleration is partly attributable to  the acquisition by some banks of  other banks' CDs for trading purposes.

Monetary Aggregates

Growth in the  broad monetary aggregates has been relatively brisk in  recent months--especially M3. Banks have continued to issue substantial amounts of  large time deposits, partly to  finance credit expansion and partly to substitute for offshore borrowing. This shift in  funding patterns has been particularly strong at foreign banks, where it may be related to  an  expansion of funding operations in  the United States. M3 has also been boosted by rapid expansion of  institution-only money funds (table). The month-tomonth growth of  institutional money funds is  influenced heavily by fluctuations in  short-term market interest rates, but over the longer term, the growing share of  these funds in  M3 partly reflects their more widespread use by  nonfinancial corporations. Nonfinancial businesses now  hold about a  third of institutional money fund shares, up from a  sixth in 1989, and institutional money fund shares now  make up 14 percent of  the liquid assets of  such businesses, compared with 4  percent in 1989. These trends suggest that firms may  view money funds as a  cost-effective substitute for in-house cash management.

M2  expanded at about a  5  percent annual rate in  February, quite close to  the pace recorded in  the fourth quarter. Retail money funds again grew  more rapidly than deposits, as has regularly been the case for several years. M2 growth apparently has tracked the growth of  nominal GDP fairly closely, a "normal" velocity pattern in a  period of  minimal change in  opportunity costs.

Mutual Funds

Net sales of stock and bond mutual funds declined somewhat in February from January's torrid pace (table). The record January inflow to stock funds was attributable partly to  the seasonal peak in investments in  individual retirement accounts and 401(k) plans. Stock fund inflows have continued to shift away from the  more aggressive growth funds and toward the  more conservative growth and income funds, whose share of  total domestic net equity sales climbed to about 60 percent in  February from 42 percent last year. Preliminary data suggest that net sales of stock funds weakened somewhat in  the first two weeks of  March, with inflows again concentrated in  relatively conservative funds. The liquidity ratio of domestic stock funds was about unchanged in  January at 5.3 percent, holding at the lowest level since 1977 (chart).

The recent default of  Mercury Finance on its commercial paper obligations had a  very limited impact on  money market mutual funds, as most funds apparently had little credit exposure to  Mercury. One fund management company bought Mercury's paper from the funds it advises at par, thus maintaining the funds' share prices at $1 and not "breaking the buck."

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services

In  December, the U.S. deficit in  trade in  goods and services widened from levels recorded in  the previous two months. Exports declined, particularly categories such as machinery and agricultural products that had risen sharply in  October and November. Imports increased in  December, largely oil, consumer goods, and machinery. Trade data for January will be  released on  March 20, and will be described in the Greenbook supplement.

For 1996-Q4, the  trade deficit was significantly smaller than in  the third quarter, and was about the same as  the average for the first half of  the year. Exports of  goods and services were 5  percent higher in  the fourth quarter than in  the third quarter. The increase was spread among all major trade categories except automotive products (which  were held down by  the effects of strikes against GM). Exports of  aircraft and services rebounded from low third-quarter levels. Exports of  machinery and industrial supplies moved to  new record levels. Over the past year, the value of merchandise exports rose 6  percent (Q4/Q4). Most of  the rise went to  Mexico. Smaller increases went to Canada, South America, and Asia. Exports to  Western Europe were about the same in  1996-Q4 as a year earlier.

Imports of goods and services in  the fourth quarter were only slightly higher than in  the third quarter. Declines in  automotive imports from Canada (which were affected to a  larger extent than automotive exports by  strikes against GM) nearly offset increases in a  wide range of  other trade categories, especially imported consumer

goods, machinery (other than computers and semiconductors), and services. Over the past year imports rose 8-1/2 percent (Q4/Q4) with the increases spread over most major trade categories. Exceptions were imports of semiconductors, which declined sharply through most of  the  year and have only recently begun to  move back up, and automotive products from Canada.

Oil Imports

The value of  imported oil was slightly higher in  the fourth quarter than in  the third quarter, as a  drop in quantity was more than offset by  a  sharp increase in price.

The quantity of  oil imported fell 8-1/2 percent (0.833 mb/d) on  average during the fourth quarter after rising 2  percent during the third quarter. A larger than normal stock drawdown --particularly in the U.S. territories --  and an  increase in crude oil production offset higher consumption and led to  the lower rate of oil imports. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics for January and February indicate that oil imports into the fifty states remain at the fourth-quarter rate.

The average price of  imported oil in  the fourth quarter was 14 percent above its third-quarter level. The price of imported oil rose another 1-1/4 percent in January placing it 38  percent above its December 1995 level. Skirmishes in  the Kurdish region of Northern Iraq, strikes in France that interrupted refinery operations, and concern over the level of  heating oil stocks in the United States and  Europe because of  extremely cold weather in  Europe pushed prices up at  the end of last year. Spot WTI declined $0.22 per barrel in  January and plummeted $2.96 per barrel in  February. Deliveries of  oil from Iraq put downward pressure on prices during January, offsetting the effect of  the cold winter. Mild weather in February --  oil consumption was 0.7 mb/d below February 1996's rate --  accompanied by  the appearance of  Iraqi oil on  the spot market led to the sharp fall in  spot WTI. Spot WTI is currently trading in  the $20-22 per barrel range. The severe backwardation has disappeared from the WTI futures market; the December 1997 futures quote is currently just $0.80 below the current spot price.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of U.S. non-oil imports decreased slightly in  January after edging up in December. The largest declines were for imported capital goods, particularly computers and semiconductors. Partly offsetting these declines was an  increase, for the third consecutive month, in  prices of imported industrial supplies. For the fourth quarter, non-oil import prices declined only slightly, as increases in  prices of  industrial supplies and automotive products nearly offset declines in  other categories.

Prices of  exports rose slightly in  January. Prices of agricultural exports, which had declined in  the previous seven months, edged up in  January (primarily agricultural industrial supplies). Small price increases were recorded in  most other major trade categories. In  the fourth quarter, prices of  agricultural exports dropped about 30 percent at an  annual rate. Prices of nonagricultural exports changed only slightly in  the fourth quarter, with increases spread among all major trade categories except computers and semiconductors.

Price data for February will be  released on  March 21. U.S. Current Account through 1996-Q4

In  the fourth quarter of 1996, the U.S. current account deficit narrowed $26 billion SAAR. Smaller deficits for net goods and services and net investment income were partly offset by larger net unilateral transfers.

The deficit in goods and services narrowed $32 billion SAAR largely because of  the jump in exports. For net investment income, the increase in income receipts (primarily from U.S. direct investment abroad) was larger than the increase in  income payments to foreigners (on  foreign investment in  the United States). The rise in  unilateral transfers reflected U.S. Government grants to Israel that are usually made during the fourth quarter of  each year.

For the year 1996, the current account deficit was $165 billion, $17 billion larger than in 1995. About half of  the change was from goods and services and the other half from unilateral transfers. Transfers were larger than usual for the year because the Government shutdown at the end of 1995 pushed payment of some grants to Israel from the fourth quarter of 1995 into the first quarter of 1996.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities finished 1996 on  a  high note, with over $43 billion net in  December, and continued at  a  fast pace in January (line 4 of  the Summary of  U.S.

International Transactions table). For the year, records were set for private net purchases of  Treasury securities ($156 billion) and corporate and other bonds ($121 billion) (lines 4a  and 4b). Of  the record net purchases of  corporate and other bonds in  line 4b, about $45 billion were for U.S. agency bonds. Most of  the net private purchases of  U.S. bonds reported in  line 4  went to international financial centers in  the United Kingdom, the Caribbean, or  Hong Kong. Japanese residents purchased net $14 billion in  corporate and other bonds and $24 billion in  U.S. Treasury securities. After the first half of  the  year, foreigners showed virtually no interest on

net in U.S. stocks (although there seemed to be  some resurgence in January; see line 4c).

U.S. residents continued very strong purchases of  foreign stocks and bonds through December (line 5). In  January, however, stock purchases were low  and there was a  net selloff of $3.4 billion in  foreign bonds. For the year 1996, U.S. net purchases of  foreign securities rose to $104 billion, a  strong pace, but still below the peak reached in 1993. As  usual, most purchases were made in  the developed countries. Net stock purchases in Japan were over $10 billion in  the first half of  the year, but nothing thereafter; U.S. investors also sold foreign bonds net in  Japan in  the second half of the  year.

Foreign official reserve assets held in  the United States continued their robust growth in  December and January (line 1); partial information from the FRBNY for February indicates continued large increases. For the year 1996, as  was the case in 1995, only a moderate part of  this growth was associated with exchange market intervention by  G-10 countries; in  both years, G-10 countries accounted for only about 30 percent of  the increase in  foreign official holdings in  the United States.

Banks and securities dealers reported a  continuation of capital outflows in December and January (line 3). For the year, net outflows through banks mounted to $60 billion; given the slower growth in U.S. bank credit in 1996, banks relied more heavily on domestic rather than foreign sources of financing. Moreover, about $18 billion of  the outflow represented RP transactions of securities dealers with foreign purchasers of U.S. Treasury securities.

Recently released data on  direct investment capital flows show that both outflows (line 6) and inflows (line 7) were strong in 1996. Direct investment abroad was very strong in the fourth quarter and finished the year close to  the record total in 1995. Much of  the large increase in fourth-quarter outflow was the result of  a  buildup of  intercompany debt by finance affiliates in the United Kingdom. The direct investment inflow to the United States was almost as strong as the outflow, with much of  it  financing mergers and acquisitions.

The statistical discrepancy for the year mounted to a  negative $53 billion, indicating significant unrecorded capital outflows during 1996.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets

The weighted average value of  the dollar in  terms of  the other G-10 currencies has risen 2-1/4 percent since the day before the February FOMC meeting. The bulk of  the dollar's gains came in February, boosted in part by  the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony. Most recently, strong U.S. data releases for retail sales and employment have solidified the dollar's gains, with the dollar now  trading at levels last seen in  February 1994.

The dollar's gains came mainly at the expense of  the mark and other continental European currencies. Movements in the dollar against the mark appear to  be  related to changing views regarding economic performance in Germany. Reports that sluggish economic activity was increasing the chance that Germany would fail to  meet the  EMU criterion of  a  three percent government deficit to  GDP ratio dropped the value of  the mark more than one percent. Most of this decline was reversed on the release of  data showing strong growth in M3 and a  positive IFO survey. Expectations of  a large increase in German unemployment for February weighed on  the  mark in early March. Since the  middle of  March, prospects of  a delay in the start of EMU appear to  have boosted the mark. On  balance, the dollar has appreciated 2-1/2 percent against the  mark since early February. Other European currencies have lost value relative to the mark on talk of  an  EMU delay. Most notable are the declines in  the Swedish krona and Italian lira against the mark, amounting to 2-3/4 and 1-1/2 percent respectively.

Sterling depreciated vis-a-vis the dollar, largely in  March. The drop in sterling's value was prompted by  remarks from Chancellor Clarke who made it clear that there was little chance of a  rate increase prior to  the general election. Subsequently, Bank of England Deputy Governor Davies stated that the pound was overvalued against the  mark. Prime Minister Major's announcement that the general election would be  held on  May 1  also prompted sales of sterling. Over the period as a  whole, sterling declined 1  percent against the dollar.

With regard to  the  yen, the dollar appreciated only slightly over the past six  weeks. Almost all of  these gains came early in the period on  reports of  Japanese financial firm difficulties. Since the middle of  February, the yen  has appreciated 1  percent.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Note.  Change  is n  percentage points. i

P Preliminary.

The yen's largest gains came on  announcements in  mid-February and mid-March by  Japan's Finance Ministry that the government may purchase jusen-related land and that such land would be  eligible for securitization. Stock prices in Japan rose more than two percent on both announcements. The yen also strengthened on  data releases that showed strong retail sales and healthy increases in industrial output. A  larger than expected increase in the Japanese current account surplus for January, coupled with a  statement from Treasury Secretary Rubin that a  sustained increase in the Japanese current account surplus "was in nobody's interest," provided some further support for the yen.

Short-term interest rates in  the major industrial countries are little changed on average, with a  relatively large increase (47 basis points) in Belgium, where rates have risen with the unfolding of  a  political crisis involving bribery of  government officials. In the Netherlands, official rates were increased twice, the latest move coming on March 10, in  an  effort to  maintain stability in  the guilder/mark exchange rate. The repurchase rate in Spain was cut 25 basis points after the release of  favorable consumer price data. At the other end of  the  maturity spectrum, long-term rate changes were largest in  Sweden, Italy, and Spain (averaging 48  basis points) on prospects for a  delay in  EMU. Italian long-term rates, up 51 basis points, have also been pressured by  concerns over the passage of  a mini-budget. Ten-year interest rates in Switzerland fell roughly 20 basis points on  continued lackluster economic performance.

The  Mexican peso depreciated sharply in late February, following the rise in  U.S. interest rates and amid concerns over the U.S. re-certification of  Mexico as a  drug-fighting ally. Earlier in the month, Bank of  Mexico officials announced procedures to accelerate the accumulation of  foreign exchange reserves in the event of  a  peso appreciation and to reduce the volatility of  the floating exchange rate in  the event of  a  peso depreciation. The accumulation of  reserves will be accelerated by  a  second, mid-month sale of  dollar put options in the event that put options sold at  the beginning of  the month are fully exercised. Volatility of a depreciating peso will be reduced by  an  auction of $200 million on any day  when the peso depreciates by  more than two percent. Only one part of the new program came into play in  February, when a

second tranche of  $300 million put options  was  sold after the  first tranche was exercised. The February 27  decline in the peso  came too late in  the day to  trigger  an  auction by the Bank of Mexico, and  a partial  recovery of  the peso  prevented an  auction the following day.

Developments in Foreign Industrial  Countries

Recent information suggests that the pace of expansion continues to diverge across the major industrial  countries. Japan, Canada, and the United Kingdom posted  strong GDP  growth in  the fourth quarter,  and first-quarter  indicators  generally have been positive. In  contrast, GDP  growth was  sluggish in the fourth quarter  in  continental Europe, although confidence indicators have improved  in the past few months.

Inflationary pressures have generally remained subdued. In Japan, wholesale prices have  risen due to  the depreciation of the yen in recent months, but  consumer price inflation remains near zero. In Germany and France,  CPI inflation is  running under 2 percent, while in Canada it  is  slightly higher,  and in  Italy, it  is less  than 2-1/2 percent,  about half the rate  recorded a year ago. In the United Kingdom, in  contrast,  the underlying inflation  rate remained above 3 percent in January.

Individual  country notes. In Japan, real GDP  rose 3.9  percent (SAAR) in the fourth quarter after registering an upward-revised  1.3 percent  increase in the third quarter. Fourth-quarter growth was led by private consumption spending and  a strong expansion  of net exports. Total investment declined  as a significant increase in business capital formation was more than  offset by  a plunge in public  investment.

<!-- missing-text -->

Available indicators of  economic activity for the first quarter suggest continued economic expansion; industrial production and machinery orders rose in  January, and new car registrations picked up on average in January and February, reflecting brisk spending on  big-ticket items in advance of the April 1  increase of the consumption tax. The latest surge of spending on  consumer durables is also related to last year's strong housing cycle that recently seems to  have come to an  end. Housing starts in  January fell further to a  level almost 9  percent below the fourth-quarter average.

The unemployment rate of  3.3 percent in January is only slightly below its postwar high of  3.5 percent in  May and June 1996. The job offers/applicants ratio remained at 0.76 in January. However, these figures mask a  distinct improvement in  the labor market; in January employment rose strongly, the number of unemployed dropped for the third consecutive month, and job offers remained firm.

Japan's current account surplus rose sharply in January, to $81 billion (SAAR) compared with a  surplus of  $67 million for all of 1996 and $112 billion in 1995. The surge in  the current account

where noted. SA)

<!-- missing-text -->

surplus in January mainly reflected greater investment income and a rise in  the volume of  exports.

On  March 5, the lower house of  the Diet passed the budget for fiscal year 1997 (beginning April 1). The budget is in the upper house for consideration, and should pass before the beginning of  the fiscal year.

Real GDP in  Germany advanced at a  pace of  0.3 percent (SAAR) in the fourth quarter of 1996. Taking the year as a  whole, real GDP expanded 1.4 percent (or 2.2 percent on  a  Q4/Q4 basis). In the fourth quarter, domestic demand was up  modestly owing to a  revival of  investment on  machinery and equipment and inventory accumulation (a  residual in  German GDP statistics). Private consumption, government spending, and construction contracted in  the fourth quarter. While exports continued to grow rapidly (more than 20 percent at  an  annual rate in  the fourth quarter), a  surge in  imports more than offset the increase in  exports.

Only limited information is available for the first quarter. Although industrial production dropped in January, output excluding construction activity was up, and orders rebounded due to  a  surge in

<!-- missing-text -->

export demand. Unemployment rose by  a  total of  150,000 (s.a.) in January and February, bringing total unemployment to just over 4.3 million persons and the unemployment rate to 11.3 percent. However, these figures likely are overstated because of effects from unseasonably cold winter and a  change in  welfare registration procedures. Inflation on a  12-month basis ticked up in  January, primarily reflecting increases in energy prices.

According to official figures, the general government deficit as a  share of  GDP widened to 3.9 percent last year from 3.5 percent in 1995. The Finance Ministry has revised its deficit forecast for 1997 to 2.9 percent of  GDP (from 2.5 percent previously), owing to an  upward revision to the government's forecast for unemployment. Given the importance of  meeting the 3  percent deficit target proscribed in  the Maastricht Treaty, it is quite likely that the Finance Ministry will impose a  freeze on large federal expenditures, a  measure that has been implemented in each of the past two years in order to give the Kohl government more flexibility over spending.

In  mid-January, the government announced its proposal for reform of  the tax system that seeks to reduce marginal tax rates for individuals and  businesses and broaden the tax  base by  eliminating deductions and loopholes. Altogether, the reform would provide tax

<!-- missing-text -->

relief of  roughly DM30 billion (including effects from a  proposed one percentage point increase in the  value-added tax).

In  France, real GDP rose 0.6 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter following an  increase of 3.1 percent in the third quarter. For 1996 as a  whole, GDP increased 1.3 percent on  average. While strength in consumption underpinned overall activity last year, growth last quarter was restrained by a  decline in private consumption; this decline followed the  third-quarter surge associated with the expiration of  a  government car-buying incentive program. Negative calendar effects also restrained measured growth. While growth of  fixed investment slowed, owing to a  slight decline in  business investment, inventories made a  strong positive contribution. Export growth slowed sharply and net exports subtracted marginally from GDP growth.

Economic activity is expected to accelerate during the  first half of  this year. Producers' expectations of future manufacturing output improved further in  January and  February as foreign orders strengthened; inventories appear to  have returned to  a  more normal level following a  sizable decumulation last year. Consumption of manufactured products rose in January despite a  continued decline in

1

<!-- missing-text -->

car purchases; and consumer confidence has continued to improve, albeit at  a subdued pace. Twelve-month consumer-price inflation has remained low, averaging about 1-3/4 percent through February, and the unemployment rate was unchanged in  January.

<!-- missing-text -->

In the  United Kingdom, real GDP growth picked up  in  the fourth quarter with a  strong increase in  consumption and a  sizable contribution from net exports. However, fixed investment growth was

weak for a  second consecutive quarter following rapid growth earlier in  the year.

<!-- missing-text -->

More recent information suggests that domestic demand has continued to expand rapidly. Retail sales rebounded in January following a  drop in  December and continued to rise in February; for the  two months on  average, sales were 0.8 percent above the fourthquarter level. In addition, consumer confidence returned in  January and February to the high level recorded in  November. Industrial production was unchanged in  January at a  level about 1/2 percent above the fourth-quarter average, as  a  rise in  manufacturing output was offset by  a  drop in the utility sector due to  slightly warmer weather. Business sentiment improved in January and February following a  sharp fall in  December, but the index remains below the high levels recorded in the fall, reflecting reduced expectations for exports in response to  the recent sharp appreciation of sterling. The unemployment rate has continued to drop, reaching 6.2 percent in  February, its lowest level in  over six years. About half of  the one-percentage point decline since October has been attributed to a  tightening in  the rules for unemployment compensation and the rest to  new  job creation.

<!-- missing-text -->

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 3.1 percent in  January from a  year earlier, well above the government's target rate of  2-1/2 percent or less. Goods-price inflation has declined over the past year despite a  surge in petrol prices, while services prices have accelerated. This trend continued in  January. Growth in  average earnings has also picked up. The underlying rate of  increase of average earnings was revised up  to 4.8 percent in December and increased further to  5  percent in  January, although financial sector bonus payments may  have biased the recent figures upwards. However, producer input prices have dropped considerably below year-earlier levels, in  part a  result of sterling's appreciation over the past year.

Prime Minister Major announced March 17 that the next election wil  be  held on  May 1. The Labour Party is  widely expected to  win, as recent polls show it  having a  lead of over 20 points.

In  Italy, real GDP declined a  provisional 0.4 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter, and growth for 1996 as a  whole (year/year), amounted to only 0.8 percent. Complete details will not be available until mid-April. However, we  do  know that the quarter-on-quarter drop was due, in  part, to  two fewer working days than in  the third quarter and to  weaker exports.

Indicators for the first-quarter are very limited. Business sentiment that remained weak in the last three quarters of 1996,

strengthened in  January. Consumer confidence, which remains below its 1996 average, rose in  January but declined slightly in  February.

<!-- missing-text -->

After remaining stable at 2.6 percent for three consecutive months, the consumer price index rose, on  a  year-over-year basis. 2.4 percent in February, less than half the rate recorded twelve months ago. Inflation is very likely to remain stable in  light of continued moderation in  wholesale and producer price increases, reflecting both the appreciation of  the lira over the past year and a  half and productivity gains due to containment of  labor costs since 1993.

In  February, the government formally committed to  presenting a supplemental 1997 deficit reduction package by  the end of  March in order to reach the Maastricht criteria on  time. On  February 21, the official statistical agency of  the EU,  Eurostat, ruled permissible the Italian accounting of taxes on  wage funds and guaranteed enterprise debt. As a  result, Italy's 1996 budget deficit to GDP ratio declined to 6.8 percent from 7.2 percent.

Economic activity in Canada expanded 2.9 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter of  1996. Total domestic demand was very strong, reflecting a  rebound in  consumption expenditures and residential construction as well as continued strength in  machinery and equipment investment. Inventory accumulation also contributed to the

quarter's growth, while net exports subtracted from growth. Exports fell sharply, and in large part reflected the GM  strike early in  the quarter. The  increase in  imports was accounted for largely by computers and other machinery and equipment.

Indicators for the first quarter are limited but point to continued strong growth. Employment changed little in  January and February, and the unemployment rate remained 9.7 percent in  both months. Housing starts picked up in  January and February; for  the two months on average, starts were up 17.5 percent from the fourthquarter average. Manufacturing shipments recovered in  January and new orders increased sharply to a  level 5.7 percent over the fourthquarter average. Headline consumer price inflation has picked up  a little in  recent months but remains close to the midpoint of  the Bank of  Canada's target range of  1-3 percent.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

In  Latin America, the strong expansion in economic activity in Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil continues. In  Venezuela, prospects for a  near-term recovery remain uncertain. In  Asia, output growth, although high, has slowed somewhat in  China, but prospects look better for  Taiwan, which seems to  have recovered from a  mild slowdown in  1996. The situation in  Korea remains uncertain due in part to recent industrial unrest and also due to the political scandal after the second largest steel producer defaulted on  a  loan payment. In  Russia, the economy seems to  be on  the verge of  a turnaround.

Inflation for 1996 in the developing economies varied across countries, but generally the trend was lower. The decline in inflation rates for 1996 to single digits in Brazil and China is notable. In  Russia, inflation is  higher than target inflation, but considerably lower than last year's inflation. Prospects for a further reduction in inflation in  Venezuela disappeared after the government agreed to  public sector wage increases averaging 75 percent. External balances have worsened in  Mexico, Brazil, and Korea. For Mexico and Brazil, a  pick up  in  aggregate demand is the leading cause of  this decline. For Korea, the deterioration of  the current account in 1996 was further exacerbated in January by  the impact of  industrial unrest on exports. External balances have improved in  Argentina and Venezuela due to strong export growth in Argentina (led by  strong Brazilian export demand), and high oil prices in  Venezuela. In China, the trade surplus for 1996 was down relative to 1995, but recently there has been strong export growth.

Individual country notes. In  Mexico, the economy has recovered more rapidly than previously expected from the sharp downturn that followed the  December 1994 devaluation. In  the fourth quarter of  1996, real GDP was 7.6 percent higher than the yearearlier quarter. The increase was much higher than market expectations of  5  to  5-1/2 percent. The sharp increase over the previous four quarters more than offset the 7  percent decline (Q4/Q4) in 1995, putting the level of  GDP in  the fourth quarter of 1996 for the first time above its pre-crisis level. For 1996 as a whole, real GDP grew 5.1 percent from the previous year, following a 6.2 percent decline in  1995. The industrial sector led the way

during 1996, with a  10.4 percent increase in  production from 1995, while the service sector showed a  more moderate increase of  3.1 percent. On  a  seasonally adjusted basis, we  estimate GDP to have increased a  robust 3  percent (not  at an annual rate) in  the third and fourth quarters.

Recent data revealed a  moderate worsening in  the Mexican current account picture. The current account deficit widened in the fourth quarter of 1996 to bring the deficit for 1996 as a  whole to $1.8 billion, compared with a  revised deficit of  $1.6 billion for 1995 (previously reported to  be  only $0.7 billion). Monthly data on the trade balance showed some improvement in  December and January, largely due to  a  moderation in  imports, which had been growing rapidly in previous months.

Consumer price inflation slowed in  February to a  monthly rate of 1.7 percent, returning to  the pace it exhibited last fall. That is in contrast to  monthly inflation of 3.2 percent in  December and 2.6 percent in January, when the seasonal effects of greater spending and bonuses paid during the Christmas season were exacerbated by  increases in  the minimum wage and public sector prices.

On  February 19, Mexico announced a  pre-payment of $590 million to the International Monetary Fund, continuing the Mexican strategy of  pre-paying external debt in order to  diminish the concentration of  payments due in 1998 and 1999. The funds for the pre-payment represent half of  the approximately $1.18 billion that Mexico will

receive from two recent bond issues. The other half of  the bond proceeds will be  used to  build international reserves.

In  Argentina, the upturn in economic activity has gained further strength, but there are signs that inflation may be increasing a  little. Real GDP grew  by  a  strong 9.2 percent in  the fourth quarter of  1996 compared with the same period a  year ago, bringing the year-over-year rate of growth for 1996 to 4.4 percent. Industrial production was up 11.4 percent in  January over a  year ago. Monthly consumer price inflation was 0.5 and 0.4 percent in January and February, respectively. The January rise can be attributed to a  seasonal increase in  tourism-related prices with the onset of  the Southern summer. The February figure is partly due to a  telephone tax rate increase, but also reflects to  some extent the recent pick up in  domestic demand (monthly inflation in  February 1996 was -0.3 percent).

The recovery in  activity led to growth in imports of  about 11 percent in  1996, but exports, led by  strong demand from  Brazil, more than kept pace and grew by  14  percent last year, resulting in an increase in  the trade balance surplus from $3  billion in  1995 to $3.8 billion in  1996. However, exports have fallen in  January and, according to preliminary data, the January 1997 trade balance shows a  deficit of  $200 million, compared with a  deficit of  $70 million in January 1996.

International reserves (excluding gold) were $16.5 billion at the end of  February 1997, higher than the year-earlier level of $14 billion. Peso and dollar deposits have grown strongly recently and

reached $55 billion by  year-end 1996. This represents a  nearly 50 percent increase since June 1995, when deposits were at their lowest point following the Mexican peso crisis. The public sector deficit in 1996 was $5.8 billion (under 2  percent of  GDP) and in line with the revised IMF-agreed target of $6 billion. The January deficit was $400 million, also roughly in line with the IMF-agreed target of $1.04 billion for the first quarter of 1997.

In  Brazil, real GDP grew at a  revised 2.9 percent in 1996, but this masks very strong growth over the last three quarters that averaged 8  percent on  an  annualized basis. Growth was led by  strong performance in  the service sectors (especially communications), while industrial output grew by  only 2.3 percent. Inflation has continued to be  remarkably low by  Brazilian standards, despite the lack of  progress towards fiscal reform. The fiscal deficit on  an operational basis (which removes interest payments eroded in real terms by  inflation) was 4.5 percent of  GDP in 1996, slightly lower than in 1995, but the improvement owed to lower real interest payments on  public debt.

Strong aggregate demand has contributed to continued trade deficits. The deterioration in  the external balance in  recent months has put some downward pressure on the real/dollar exchange rate. So far, however, the real/dollar exchange rate has continued to depreciate slowly, and the government has maintained that there will be  no  large devaluation. (As  of  mid-March, the real/dollar exchange rate was 1.06 reais to the U.S. dollar.) International

reserves stood at $59.4 billion at the end of  February 1997, slightly down from a  peak of $60.5 billion in  November 1996.

In  Venezuela, developments in  the labor market have fueled further concerns about high inflation. In January, the government awarded a 164 percent pay rise to striking public sector doctors, which fanned other wage demands from the over 1  million public employees. The government relented in  late February and has agreed to  wage increases averaging 75 percent. The effects of  this wage settlement are expected to spill over to  the private sector as well. Thus, despite mildly encouraging consumer price inflation of 2.6 and 2.3 percent monthly for January and February, respectively, analysts believe the government will miss by  a  wide margin its current target of 25 percent annual inflation in  1997. The IMF is expected to negotiate a  new target inflation rate with Venezuela when it concludes its second review under a  $1.4 billion stand-by agreement expiring in  mid-July. The second review was underway in January 1997, but was suspended pending the outcome of  the wage negotiations and has not yet been renewed.

According to preliminary data, real GDP declined year-overyear by  1.6 percent in 1996, with the  oil sector expanding by  4.9 percent, but the non-oil sector contracting by  3.6 percent. The recession has led to a  narrowing of  the  non-oil trade deficit, which over the period Jan-Sep 1996 was $3.8 billion compared with $4.5 billion over the same period in 1995. However, oil exports increased markedly during 1996 and are estimated at $18 billion, compared with less than $14 billion in 1995. The oil revenues have also kept international reserves high, which at the end of  January

1997 stood at $12 billion (excluding gold), compared with $6.7 billion a  year ago.

In  China, the 12-month consumer price inflation rate fell to 6.8 percent in January, a  marked decline from the 25.5 percent recorded in 1994. Strong export growth led to a  trade surplus of $3.8 billion in  the first two months of  1997, compared with a deficit of $0.4 billion in  the  year-earlier period. The dollar value of  exports rose 21 percent, while imports fell 3  percent. The official budget deficit for 1996/97 equalled 1  percent of  GDP (note that this does not count the sizable subsidies to state-owned enterprises through the banking system); the government had forecast a  larger deficit, but  tax revenue grew faster than expected. China's foreign exchange reserves rose to $110 billion at the end of February, up from $75 billion at  the end of 1995.

The death in  mid-February of  China's supreme leader. Deng Xiaoping, will likely have little effect on  China's economy or the pace of  reform in  the near term. Officially, the new leadership has been in  place for years, and leaders have pledged to continue reforms. Over time, however, renewed leadership struggles may develop, and the outcome may  help, or  may hinder, economic developments. Financial markets reacted relatively little to  the news, which was  widely expected. For example, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index--which had fallen slightly the previous week amid rumors of Deng's ill health--rose 2  percent on the first day of  trading after the  news, and has remained relatively flat since.

In Taiwan, economic activity recovered strongly in  the fourth quarter of 1996 from a  mild slowdown earlier in  the year, with GDP rising 6.6 percent from the year-earlier period. The  unemployment rate was 2.7 percent in  January 1997 and has fallen fairly steadily

since reaching its ten-year high of  3.2 percent in  August 1996. Inflation remained low,  with consumer prices rising 2.0 percent in February. Taiwan's trade surplus in the first two months of 1997 was $1.2 billion, compared with a  surplus of  $1.7 billion in  the year-earlier period. The dollar value of exports fell 1  percent from a  year earlier, while the dollar value of imports rose 2 percent. Foreign exchange reserves were $88.3 billion at  the end of February, up from its recent low of  $83 billion in  March 1996, following Chinese missile tests near Taiwan.

In Korea, the Hanbo Steel Company, the country's secondlargest steel producer, defaulted on loan payments on January 23. So far, the investigation into the financial collapse has led to the arrests of  several prominent bankers and politicians on charges of bribery in connection with loans extended to  Hanbo Steel. On  March 5, President Kim appointed a  new Prime Minister and a  new Finance Minister as part of  a  sweeping cabinet reshuffle intended to deflect criticism of  his handling of  the Hanbo scandal.

Ruling and opposition parties struck a  deal on  March 10 on amendments to  controversial labor laws that had sparked widespread industrial unrest for a  month starting December 26. The compromise allows for the formation of  multiple umbrella labor groups, which is a  move aimed at legalizing the outlawed Korea Federation of  Trade Unions (KFTU) however, the formation of  more than two unions at one work site would not be  permitted until 2002. Employers' groups have accepted the amended bills, but the KFTU is threatening to  wage a general strike on  May 1.

The impact of  the labor unrest was reflected in the figures for January's industrial production and external balances.

Industrial production grew by  5.9 percent (year-on-year) compared with a  12.4 percent rise a  year earlier. Korea's trade and current account deficits showed a  sharp jump in January, in  part due to the adverse impact of  the strikes on  automobile exports.

In  Russia, both the economy and the health of  President Yeltsin seem to be  on the verge of  a  turnaround. January year-onyear GDP growth was 0.1 percent, which was low but  nonetheless the first positive reading since the beginning of  the reforms. Similarly, Yeltsin made a  strong showing at  his first substantive public appearance since his election nine months ago when he gave a half-hour speech on  the state of  the country on  March 6.

Yeltsin's return to full-time work may give a  needed jolt to economic reform, which had been stalled. Yeltsin signed a  1997 budget in late February, but also said that he considered the budget flawed and  not achievable. Moreover, on  March 7  he initiated a cabinet shakeup by  naming the effective, but unpopular Anatoly Chubais First Deputy Prime Minister. During the past week, Yeltsin made additional changes, shifting the cabinet composition toward reformers. Most notably, Chubais was also named Minister of Finance, and the Economy Ministry absorbed the Defense Industry Ministry and the  Industry Ministry. There now seems to be  hope that a  sorely needed tax  code may  be  passed sometime during 1997, although it  may not be implemented until 1999.

Inflation for the first two  months of  1997 came in at 3.8 percent, higher than  would be consistent with the targeted annual rate of  12 percent but still lower than last year's inflation for the same period (1996 inflation came in  at  22  percent for the year). The ruble-dollar exchange rate has continued to remain well within

the corridor set by the Central Bank. However, U.S. dollar shipments to Russia remain higher than ever, and official Russian statistics indicate that individuals spent one quarter of their incomes on  foreign currency purchases during the month of January, 1997.

Russia's three-year, $10 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility was held up  in October and November, but has been moving back on track, with a  double tranche released in  January and another double tranche expected soon. The IMF and Russia are working now  on  a  plan for 1997; the chief concerns are structural changes, including restructuring of  the energy monopolies, and revenue collection.
