Trade in Goods  and Services

The U.S.  trade deficit in goods  and  services  was $33.0  billion in December, about the  same as recorded in November.  For the fourth quarter, the deficit was $16  billion at an  annual  rate larger than in the third quarter.

In December, the value of exports  of goods and services declined for the fourth consecutive  month, with decreases primarily  in capital  goods and industrial supplies.  For the fourth  quarter, the value  of exports fell 5-1/4 percent  at an annual  rate from the prior quarter.  Notable  declines were recorded in exported computers,  semiconductors,  telecommunications  equipment, aircraft, automotive products,  consumer goods,  and agricultural  products. Exports of other machinery  grew only slightly following  strong increases  in the first three quarters  of the year.  By area, much  of the decline in the fourth quarter was in exports  to developing  economies in Asia (particularly Taiwan and Korea), Mexico, and Canada (especially  automotive parts).  Exports  to Western Europe rose for the fifth consecutive quarter.

The value of imports in December dropped for the third consecutive month, as sharp  declines  in  automotive vehicles,  consumer goods,  and computers were only partly offset by  a strong increase  in the value (mostly price)  of imported natural  gas.  The rise in the value of imported oil  in December  was entirely from higher quantity as  the average price  dropped.  For the  fourth quarter, the value of imports leveled off at the high level  recorded in the third quarter.  Declines  in imported automotive products,  computers,  semiconductors,  steel,  and chemicals were offset by increased imports of telecommunications  equipment, consumer goods, and  smaller increases  in other categories of trade.

Over the intermeeting  period, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee lowered  its key interest rate  25  basis points and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its main  policy rate a total of 75 basis points. Three-month rates  moved in line with the official target  rates.  Long-term  rates in the industrial  countries,  as measured  by the yield on ten-year  government  bonds, also  moved lower, as market expectations  for economic growth in the near term were revised  downward.

On February 9,  the Bank of Japan announced that it would soon  change the operation  of its discount window  to a Lombard facility.  In addition, the BOJ reduced  the rate  on this instrument  by  15  basis points.  On  February 28,  the BOJ cut the target of its  key overnight rate by 10 basis  points to  15  basis points and further lowered the discount/Lombard rate by  10 basis points, to 25 basis points. Three-month yen rates  have fallen  27 basis points over the intermeeting period, mainly in reaction  to the BOJ's two policy actions.  Weakness  in equity prices and renewed pessimism over near-term prospects for economic growth in Japan contributed to the 35 basis point tumble of the yield on the benchmark  ten-year Japanese government bond.  The last time ten-year  yields were  this low, in the second quarter of 1999, the Bank of Japan had recently pushed overnight rates almost to zero.  There has been considerable market speculation  that the Bank of Japan may reinstate the zero interest rate policy or take other measures  such as increasing its outright  purchases on ten-year government bonds  in a effort to reverse the reemerging  deflationary trend.

Over the intermeeting period, share prices  dropped sharply in all of the major industrial  countries. Canadian  equity prices had the sharpest  downturn, in part due  to earnings  warnings from  several optical  networking companies that comprise a large  share of the Toronto index.  In Japan, the Nikkei index fell to a level last seen  in early  1985; the broader  Topix index  still remains 20 percent above its  recent low reached in  October  1998. Share prices  in most emerging market economies  have also  declined since the January FOMC meeting, in line with movements  in the industrial country indexes.

The price of gold rose 1 percent,  on balance, over the intermeeting  period, with one-month lease rates  spiking to nearly  7 percent.  Market participants  have speculated  that less central bank gold is being made  available to the lease market, pushing up lease  rates and leading short sellers to cover their positions.
