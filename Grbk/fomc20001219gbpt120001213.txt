slowing U.S. growth.  The apparent  sensitivity of foreign exchange markets to relative  growth prospects has led us to forecast that the dollar will  depreciate in real terms  at a rate close to 3  percent in 2001  and 2002, slightly  more rapidly than projected in the November  Greenbook.

Stronger-than-expected  import demand  in September raised import growth in the third quarter, but we expect  that growth will slow sharply  in the fourth quarter, largely  reflecting the effects of the  slowdown in the U.S. economy. Going forward, we project import growth at a slightly lower rate than in the November  Greenbook, in line with the projected path for U.S. GDP.  We expect that export growth will show some near-term weakness but recover to a moderate pace,  largely because  of the projected  depreciation  of the dollar.  On balance, net exports  should make a negative arithmetic  contribution  to growth, and the current account deficit is expected to reach nearly  5 percent of GDP by the end of 2002.

At the end of this section, we  consider the implications for U.S. growth and inflation  of two alternative  simulations.  The first involves  considerably greater dollar depreciation  and higher  oil prices  than in  our baseline forecast. The second simulation  assesses the effects  of maintaining a flat broad real dollar index  through the forecast period, in contrast to the depreciation  assumed in the baseline.

Recent  Developments

International  financial markets. The dollar continued its upward path against the euro  early in the intermeeting period but then reversed  course, as market participants  reassessed the relative  growth prospects of the United States  and Europe.  On balance, the dollar depreciated  2.5 percent against the euro  over the intermeeting period.  In contrast, the dollar appreciated  3.7  percent  against the yen, reflecting continued sluggish growth and political uncertainty in Japan. In addition,  the dollar appreciated  significantly against the Korean  won and Taiwan dollar, as markets  reassessed prospects  for technology  exports from the region. The more negative outlook for high-tech industries  also contributed to equity price declines in that sector for most countries.  However, broad stock indexes  of most foreign industrial countries were little changed  on balance  over the period.

Major foreign central banks kept their policy rates unchanged  during the intermeeting period.  Short- and long-term  interest rates  have fallen for major currencies  since mid-November.
