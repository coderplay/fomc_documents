Recent Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The incoming data suggest that the economy remains very weak, though declines in activity seem to be lessening.  To be sure, employment is still falling, and manufacturers have cut production further in response to excess inventories and soft demand.  But the reductions in employment and industrial production have slowed somewhat, consumer spending appears to be holding reasonably steady after a steep drop in the second half of last year, and sales and construction of single-family homes seem to have flattened out. In addition, the recent declines in capital spending have been less precipitous than those recorded earlier in the year.  Apart from a tax-induced jump in tobacco prices, consumer price inflation has been fairly quiescent in recent months, although the upturn in energy prices is likely to boost headline inflation in June.

Labor Market Developments

Labor market demand weakened further in May, albeit less rapidly than earlier in the year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment fell 338,000 last month following average declines of nearly 700,000 per month from January to March and a drop of 600,000 in April.  May's decline in employment was the smallest since last September; with the notable exception of the manufacturing sector, most industries reported a slower pace of job loss, and employment in nonbusiness services moved up for the first time since last summer.

In addition to shedding jobs, firms have cut their labor input by shortening hours worked: Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private payrolls dropped steeply from September to March but have since flattened out near the low level of 33.1 hours.  Aggregate hours of production and nonsupervisory workers fell at an average pace of ½ percent per month in April and May after falling ¾ percent per month, on average, over the preceding seven months.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate climbed further in May, jumping another ½ percentage point, to 9.4 percent.  In addition, the fraction of workers who were working part time for economic reasons-although flat over the past couple of monthsremained at an extremely elevated level.  The labor force participation rate moved up in May for a second consecutive month and was close to where it was at the beginning of the recession.  The emergency unemployment insurance program that began last July has

likely contributed to the rise in the unemployment rate and the resiliency in labor force participation by encouraging unemployed individuals to stay in the labor force.   In 1 addition, the deterioration in household balance sheets may have caused some older workers to delay retirement and some secondary workers to enter the labor force.

Other indicators suggest continued weakness in labor demand.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has fallen back a little from its recent peak, but the number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance benefits has continued to increase.  Layoff rates-as gauged by the percentage of short-term job losers in the household survey and the layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey-stayed high in April and May, while measures of job vacancies remained low.  In addition, alternative measures of labor market slack-job availability as reported in the Conference Board Survey and hard-to-fill positions in the NFIB survey-remained at levels consistent with elevated slack.

Regarding the forward-looking indicators of labor market conditions, hiring plans in the NFIB and Manpower surveys have been about flat in recent months after two years of steep declines.  Households' expectations of future labor market conditions have shown a more marked improvement.

The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 1.9 percent in the first quarter after having fallen at a 0.6 percent rate in the fourth quarter of last year.  On the whole, labor productivity has held up surprisingly well during the recession as firms have responded to the contraction in aggregate demand by aggressively reducing labor input.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) decreased 0.9 percent per month, on average, in April and May after average declines of 1.6 percent per month in the first quarter.  Manufacturing output fell at an average rate of ¾ percent per month in April and May, and the factory operating rate dipped further to 65.0 percent in May, yet another low for a series that goes back to 1948.

The production of motor vehicles and parts fell nearly 8 percent in May and subtracted about 0.3 percentage point from the rate of change in total IP.  (The effect on production of the GM and Chrysler bankruptcies is discussed in the motor vehicle section.) Elsewhere in transportation equipment, the production of commercial aircraft moved up 1.1 percent in May.

. 2 The 787 Dreamliner, which is a few years behind schedule, is expected to make its first test flight late this month.

In the high-tech sector, computer output fell 1.6 percent per month in April and May, on average, after having fallen at a similar pace in the first quarter.  Business demand has been particularly weak; the paring of IT budgets is reflected both in sharp declines in server sales and a lengthening of the PC replacement cycle.   Output of communications 3 equipment fell 0.7 percent, on average, in April and May; this decline is consistent with the contraction in capital expenditures at major telecommunications service providers in the first quarter.

Further up the high-tech supply chain, near-term indicators of production have turned somewhat less negative, possibly reflecting a mild inventory restocking after months of drastic production cuts.  In April, orders for circuit boards rose sharply-albeit from a very low level-and outpaced shipments for the first time since early 2008.  Similarly,

global semiconductor sales climbed for the second consecutive month in April, and, over the three months ending in May, the real output of semiconductors averaged monthly gains of 1.2 percent.  The outlook for semiconductors over the next few quarters has also improved slightly.  Indeed, several industry groups have updated their forecasts and no longer anticipate further declines in the production of semiconductors in the second half of the year.

The production of energy has declined each month this year.  In particular, the index for drilling and related support activity has plunged more than 40 percent since December. The other major components of energy output-utilities, coal mining, and petroleum refining-are down so far this year, while oil and gas extraction has edged up.

Elsewhere in the industrial sector-that is, excluding motor vehicles and parts, aircraft and parts, high-tech equipment, and energy-production declined in both April and May, though, on balance, at a slower pace than over the preceding five months.  After having decreased about ½ percent in April, the output of consumer goods edged up ¼ percent in May with gains in the production of nondurable consumer goods.  The output of business equipment decreased about 1¾ percent, on average, in April and May after monthly declines that averaged roughly 2¾ percent in the first three months of the year.  The declines in construction supplies continued apace, although the primary source of the fall in production has shifted from supplies more closely related to residential construction to those more closely related to nonresidential construction activity.  Materials output contracted further in both April and May as pronounced declines in durable materials continued.

The available indicators of near-term manufacturing activity suggest a more moderate pace of production declines in coming months.  Although the overall months' supply of inventories remains elevated, sharp production cutbacks late last year and so far this year have allowed producers to stem the rise in stocks relative to sales.  Indeed, the diffusion index of three-month changes in months' supply in the staff's flow-of-goods system fell substantially over the past few months and now indicates that more industries have declining months' supply than have rising months' supply.

On the demand side, the ISM new orders diffusion index-a useful indicator of near-term factory activity-jumped 18 index points over the past three months and edged above 50 in May for the first time since November 2007.  In addition, the three-month moving average of the staff's estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders increased in April for the first time since mid-2008.  In contrast, despite their moving up from the cyclical lows

reached earlier in the year, the various regional new orders diffusion indexes have, on average, remained below 50.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light motor vehicles rose to an annual rate of 9.9 million units in May.  Most major automakers, including GM, which declared bankruptcy on June 1, reported higher sales.  Sales at Chrysler, which declared bankruptcy on April 30, moved sideways last month after plunging in April.  (For more information on the bankruptcies, see the box 'Recent Developments at Chrysler and General Motors' on II-12.)  Higher sales to retail customers more than accounted for the increase in industry-wide sales in May.

Consumers' assessments of car-buying conditions in the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers have improved markedly this year.  In general, the improvement has coincided with a large decrease in the percent of survey respondents reporting that credit is tight; this percentage has dropped sharply from the highs of last fall and is now back at typical historical levels.  In early June, respondents also mentioned lower prices and the availability of good deals as reasons for the favorable buying conditions. Correspondingly, the average value of light vehicle incentives rose sharply at the end of last year and remained at a high level through early June.  Both Chrysler and GM have boosted incentives in hopes of propping up sales during their stays in bankruptcy; Ford has also launched a generous incentive program in an attempt to snatch market share from its Detroit rivals.

Turning to light vehicle production, the latest industry schedules suggest that secondquarter assemblies are running at an annual rate of about 4½ million units-little changed from the historically low first-quarter rate-as the shutdowns at Chrysler and GM are being offset by modest increases in production at most other automakers.  The pullback in production this year has reduced dealers' stocks of domestic light vehicles to extremely low levels, and the days' supply fell from a peak of 101 days in February to just 73 days at the end of May, quite close to the automakers' preferred target of 65 days.

Looking ahead, initial industry schedules call for production to rise substantially in the third quarter to an annual rate of 7.1 million units.  More than one-half of this large jump in schedules reflects the planned resumption of production at GM and Chrysler. However, other companies -in particular, Ford and Toyota -are also planning significant production increases next quarter.  Whether automakers will be able to ramp up production this rapidly is uncertain.  Indeed, initial industry plans have tended to be overly optimistic in recent quarters.

Recent Developments at Chrysler and General Motors

On April 30, Chrysler filed for bankruptcy and immediately ceased production at all of its U.S. facilities.  On June 9, the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for Fiat, an Italian automaker, to take a 20 percent stake in a 'New Chrysler' composed of the company's viable assets.  The agreement with Fiat was signed on June 10.  The other stakeholders are the United Auto Workers retiree healthcare trust fund (55 percent) and the U.S. and Canadian governments.

shares will go to the Canadian government (12.5 percent), the UAW retiree healthcare trust fund (17.5 percent), and GM's bondholders (10 percent).  The latter two parties will also receive warrants.

Chrysler received permission to close roughly 800 of its approximately 3,200 dealerships and to cut its production capacity 25 percent.  Fiat will provide the production technology and engineering assistance needed to produce smaller, more fuel-efficient cars.

On June 1, GM filed for bankruptcy but did not shutter any of its production facilities. However, many of its plants were already scheduled to be closed through early July to trim bloated inventories.

GM plans to cut its domestic light vehicle production capacity from 3.2 million units to 2 million in 2010 and to 1.83 million in 2014. Thus far, 14 U.S. factories have been identified for closure by the end of 2010, including two assembly plants that will be shuttered and two that will be placed on 'standby' should vehicle demand increase.

GM's U.S. hourly employment will be reduced from about 61,000 in 2008 to 40,000 in 2010; salaried employment will also be reduced.  The company's dealer network will be cut to approximately 3,600 dealers by the end of 2010 from about 6,300 dealers today.

Under current plans, the U.S. government will convert about $40 billion of its anticipated $50 billion in total loans into a 60 percent stake in a 'New GM.'  Smaller

Finally, the number of GM's U.S. brands will be cut in half, with the restructured company composed of Chevy, GMC, Buick, and Cadillac.  GM plans to sell the Saturn, HUMMER, and Saab brands, but no deals have been finalized.  The Pontiac brand will be wound down by the end of 2010.

Consumer Spending

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) rose at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the first quarter after having fallen sharply in the second half of 2008, and spending has held reasonably steady so far in the second quarter.  On the basis of the latest retail sales data, we estimate that real expenditures on goods other than motor vehicles rose 0.3 percent in May and have changed little, on net, since the turn of the year.  Real outlays on services were reported to have risen 0.2 percent in April, a pickup from the average monthly gain seen over the first three months of the year.

The fundamental determinants of consumer demand appear to have improved a bit lately. Despite the ongoing decline in employment, real disposable personal income (DPI) rose at an annual rate of 6½ percent in the first quarter, and it posted another sizable gain in April as various provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) boosted transfer payments and reduced personal taxes.   In addition, equity 4 prices have recorded substantial gains in recent weeks, thus offsetting a small portion of the prior wealth declines.  Measures of consumer sentiment, while still at levels typically seen during recessions, have improved markedly from the historical lows recorded around the turn of the year.

Housing

On balance, the incoming data suggest that housing activity may have bottomed out. Single-family housing starts ticked up in May to an annual rate of 400,000 units after having moved roughly sideways at around 360,000 units between January and April. Moreover, adjusted permit issuance for single-family houses-a useful month-ahead indicator of starts-has been a little above the level of starts since January, which hints that further modest improvements in single-family activity may be in store for coming months.  In contrast, activity in the much smaller multifamily sector has fallen significantly further this year after turning down in the second half of 2008.  The contraction in multifamily construction over the past year has reflected a sharp deterioration in the fundamentals in that sector.  In particular, credit availability for multifamily construction projects has tightened appreciably, and prices of apartment buildings have fallen sharply after a sizable net run-up over the preceding three years.

The steep decline in the demand for new single-family houses also seems to have abated. Sales of these homes have fluctuated in a narrow range around 350,000 units at an annual

rate since January,

.  That said, the pace of new home sales is still very low, and the months' supply of new homes remains quite elevated relative to sales despite a decline in the stock of unsold new single-family homes to roughly one-half of its mid-2006 peak.

Sales of existing single-family homes have been fairly stable since late last year at a little more than 4 million units, and April's 6¾ percent jump in pending sales agreements signals that existing home sales may turn upward in the coming months.  The relative stability of the resale market over this period has coincided with a heightened proportion of transactions involving bank-owned and other distressed properties.  According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), sales of distressed properties, which tend to occur at lower prices than sales of otherwise-identical houses, have accounted for about 45 percent of existing home sales so far this year-roughly double their share of sales in early 2008. 5

According to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, foreclosure starts jumped to a record high of 1.3 percent of all mortgages in the first quarter of 2009.  The upturn in foreclosure activity this year likely reflects the expiration of some of the moratoriums that had held down the initiation of foreclosure proceedings in the second half of 2008. Despite the step-up in foreclosures, the NAR's measure of the stock of existing homes for sale has continued to trend down (both in absolute terms and relative to sales) after having peaked in mid-2008.  Even so, existing-home inventories remain very high relative to sales. 6

The apparent stabilization in housing demand seen in recent months likely is due, in part, to the improvement in housing affordability that has resulted from low mortgage rates and declining house prices.  Rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgagescurrently around 5.6 percent-have risen about 80 basis points since late April but remain below the levels seen over most of 2008.  Although the market for private-label nonprime mortgages remains closed, spreads between rates for jumbo and standard conforming loans have narrowed substantially in recent months (though they remain elevated relative

to pre-crisis norms).   Meanwhile, national house prices continue to head downward:  The 7 repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance fell 10¼ percent over the 12 months ending in April, roughly the same as the decrease over the preceding 12 months.  Although these ongoing price declines continue to enhance affordability, they are probably also deterring some potential buyers worried about purchasing in a falling market:  Evidence from the Reuters/Michigan survey and anecdotal reports suggest that many households still expect prices to fall in the coming year, though the share of such households appears to have shrunk in recent months.

Equipment and Software

Real investment in equipment and software (E&amp;S) is continuing to contract sharply; however, the decline in the second quarter appears likely to be smaller than in the fourth quarter of 2008 and first quarter of 2009.  Outlays on transportation equipment seem to be firming after an extended period of steep declines, and the incoming data point to some moderation in the rate of decrease in other major components of E&amp;S.

With regard to transportation equipment, sales of medium and heavy trucks fell further, on net, in April and May, and the low level of orders in recent months-which reportedly reflects the ongoing contractions in construction activity and industrial productionpoints to continued near-term weakness in sales.  However, declines in business outlays on light motor vehicles appear to have abated:  Deliveries to rental car companies have been fluctuating in a narrow range since February, and demand from other businesses has been moving sideways-albeit at a very low level. In addition, the April figures on shipments of complete aircraft and international trade, taken together, suggest an increase in domestic purchases of aircraft.

Businesses apparently are continuing to cut their real outlays on high-tech equipment and software, although the incoming information provides differing signals on the speed of the decline.  This is especially true in the computer sector:  IP has continued to drop in recent months even as shipments from domestic producers have held fairly steady and imports have firmed a bit after plunging in the second half of last year.  Shipments from producers of communications equipment fell in April to a level about 3 percent below their first-quarter average.  Communications orders also decreased in April although they remained well above the lows seen at the start of the year.

Real spending on equipment outside of high-tech and transportation plummeted at an annual rate of 35 percent in the first quarter, with spending still dropping-though probably less steeply-in the current quarter.  Shipments declined 2½ percent in April, and although new orders have changed little, on net, since January, they remained well below shipments for major subcategories such as construction equipment, industrial machinery, and metalworking machinery.  Shrinking backlogs of unfilled orders for these types of equipment imply further downward pressure on shipments in coming months.

On balance, the fundamental determinants of equipment and software investment remain weak.  Business output dropped sharply in the first quarter, and the user cost of capital is higher than it was a year ago.  In addition, credit remains tight; in the May NFIB survey, the share of small businesses reporting increased difficulty obtaining credit was the highest on record.  On a more positive note, corporate bond yields and spreads over Treasury securities-though still elevated-have eased considerably in recent weeks.  In addition, monthly surveys of business conditions and sentiment have generally been less downbeat recently than earlier in the year, although the May update of the ISM semiannual forecast for 2009 indicated that only 8 percent of manufacturing firms surveyed, and 15 percent of nonmanufacturing firms, plan to increase capital expenditures this year.

Nonresidential Construction

The recent data from the Census Bureau suggest a substantial-and surprising-increase in outlays for nonresidential construction in March and April.  This uptick was concentrated in energy-related sectors-namely, the petroleum refining subcomponent of manufacturing and all categories of power generation, transmission, and distribution. 8 These energy-related sectors accounted for about 40 percent of nominal outlays on nonresidential buildings in April, up substantially from about 22 percent in 2006.

Outside the energy-related sectors, conditions for nonresidential building remain dismal: Vacancy rates ascended further in the first quarter, the architectural billings index remains at a level consistent with steep spending declines for the rest of the year (despite having turned up of late), and the nonresidential construction sector continues to shed workers.  In addition, responses to the April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on

Bank Lending Practices and reports in the latest Beige Book suggest that financing for new projects is becoming even more difficult to obtain, and Call Report data show that banks are paring back their portfolios of nonresidential construction loans.

Real spending on drilling and mining structures plummeted at an annual rate of nearly 80 percent in the first quarter, and continued sharp declines in footage drilled and the number of drilling rigs in operation point to another substantial decline in spending in the current quarter.  Many factors appear to have discouraged exploration activity, including the steep slide in natural gas and crude oil prices through the end of last year and an apparent glut of new natural gas supplies from recently discovered fields in northern Louisiana and elsewhere.

Business Inventories

The sharp cuts in production so far this year are helping to reduce the level of inventories, though overhangs remain substantial.  Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles fell at an annual rate of about $30 billion in the first quarter, and the book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sector in April suggest that liquidation continued apace early in the second quarter.   Nonetheless, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales 9 (excluding motor vehicles) is still quite high.  And while the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system also suggests that inventories have receded, months' supply for most major market groups (excluding motor vehicles and parts) remained elevated in May.  On the bright side, fewer than one-half of the supply managers surveyed by the ISM in April and May viewed their customers' inventory positions as too high.

Federal Government Sector

The cumulative deficit in the federal unified budget has widened further in recent months as a result of the continued weak pace of economic activity and the budget costs associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). 10 The deficit for the 12 months ending in May totaled $1.13 trillion, $800 billion more than in the previous 12 months.

Total federal revenues in April and May decreased more than 27 percent relative to the same year-earlier period, reflecting weak gains in nominal personal income, a likely drop

in capital gains realizations in 2008, and declines in corporate profits.  In particular, final payments on individual tax liabilities for 2008-which are usually a large share of tax receipts in April and May-declined sharply relative to their level of a year earlier. Meanwhile, withheld tax payments in April and May were reduced approximately $5 billion per month by the 'Making Work Pay' tax credit provision in the ARRA. Finally, corporate tax payments in April, which mostly represent firms' first quarterly payments on expected 2009 tax liabilities, were substantially below payments in April 2008.

Federal outlays-excluding financial transactions such as those related to the TARPincreased 10 percent in April and May compared with the same year-earlier period. Spending associated with a number of provisions in the ARRA is estimated to have increased federal outlays about $38 billion in April and May relative to a year earlier. Continued weak economic conditions contributed to higher spending for low-income support programs, such as unemployment insurance benefits, while outlays for defense, federal health programs, and Social Security were also higher than a year earlier.  In contrast, net interest payments declined slightly compared with the same year-earlier period, as the reduction in Treasury interest rates more than offset the rise in Treasury debt.

A supplemental spending bill of $106 billion was passed by the House on June 16 and is awaiting final action by the Senate.  The bill provides funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, foreign aid, disaster relief, and other items.

State and Local Government Sector

Real spending by state and local governments has remained weak.  Employment in the sector rose only 7,000 per month, on average, in April and May after declining 6,000 per month, on average, in the first quarter of this year.  Based on data through April, construction spending appears to have rebounded somewhat after having fallen steeply in late 2008 and early 2009.  However, we are cautious about attaching too much significance to the improvement given the volatility of the data and the deteriorating fiscal condition of the sector. 11

New reports from the National Conference of State Legislators and the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO) point to a significant intensification of pressures on state and local budgets.  Importantly, for the first 10 months of fiscal year

2009 (which ends on June 30 in most states), 29 states reported that collections for all major tax sources came in below year-earlier levels, while 21 states indicated that personal tax collections had fallen more than 10 percent.  States have made some adjustments to spending to counter the shortfalls in revenue, but many are still dealing with significant gaps in their general fund budgets for fiscal 2009; they expect conditions to remain bleak in fiscal 2010 as well. 12 California, for example, faces a budget shortfall of $24 billion-equal to roughly 25 percent of its annual general fund revenues-through the end of fiscal 2010 despite the enactment of $40 billion of deficit-reducing measures last February.

Prices

Headline consumer prices turned back up early this year after having been pushed down by the plunge in energy prices in late 2008.  Core inflation also picked up in the first two months of this year following the unusually low readings seen in the last part of 2008; over the past three months, however, core prices have posted smaller increases outside of a tax-induced jump in tobacco prices that boosted the readings for March and April. Based on our translation of the consumer price index (CPI) and producer price index (PPI), we estimate that total and core PCE prices both edged up 0.1 percent in May. Taking a somewhat longer perspective, the 12-month change in total PCE prices was 0.1 percent in May, 3½ percentage points lower than a year ago, while core PCE inflation was 1.8 percent, down 0.4 percentage point from its year-earlier pace.  Meanwhile, survey measures of long-run inflation expectations have remained in the range that has prevailed over the past few years.

We estimate that consumer energy prices rose 0.3 percent in May after posting a 2.4 percent decline in the previous month.  Retail gasoline prices rose 3 percent in May, but this increase was partly offset by a 5¾ percent drop in natural gas prices.  Survey data point to a much larger jump in gasoline prices so far in June; nonetheless, the rise in retail gasoline prices has not kept pace with the upturn in crude oil prices over the past several months as gasoline margins have been squeezed.  Meanwhile, residential natural gas prices have tumbled as inventories have risen to unseasonably high levels.

Continued pass-through of last autumn's sharp drop in livestock and crop prices, combined with weakness in consumer demand for food, has contributed to a leveling out in retail food prices this year after a sizable increase in 2008.  In recent weeks, production uncertainty arising from unusually wet weather in major growing regions has made farm

prices quite volatile; on net, however, prices have risen only marginally since the April Greenbook and remain significantly below their 2008 peaks.

We estimate that PCE prices excluding food and energy rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent over the three months ending in May.  This rise in core prices was boosted significantly by back-to-back increases in prices of tobacco products in March and April. 13 Excluding the increases in prices of tobacco products, the three-month change in core PCE prices was 1.3 percent in May, and the 12-month change was 1.5 percent. 14

After jumping to 2.8 percent in April, median near-term inflation expectations in the Reuters/Michigan survey remained at that level in May and then rose to 3.1 percent in the preliminary June survey.  So far, measures of long-term inflation expectations have shown no sign of moving lower despite the considerable margin of labor- and productmarket slack present in the economy:  The median expectation for inflation over the next 5 to 10 years from the Reuters/Michigan survey in early June was 3.1 percent, about the same as its average over 2008.  In addition, median long-term expected inflation from the Survey of Professional Forecasters edged up 0.1 percentage point in the second quarter.

At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials continued to decline through May, albeit at a slower pace than that seen at the end of last year. Commodity prices, which had moved higher over the first four months of 2009, have risen more sharply since the April Greenbook:  Both the Journal of Commerce index of industrial material prices and the CRB index of spot industrial prices posted double-digit increases over this period.  Nevertheless, these prices remain much lower than their yearearlier levels.

Labor Costs

The incoming data on labor costs have been mixed.  Hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector as measured in the Productivity and Costs (P&amp;C) release rose at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the first quarter and posted an increase of 4 percent over the year ending in the first quarter, similar to the average pace seen over the preceding several

years. 15 Meanwhile, the employment cost index (ECI) for private-industry workers rose just 1.9 percent over the 12 months ending in March, 1¼ percentage points less than the rise over the preceding 12 months.  The deceleration in the ECI was about evenly spread across the wage and salary and benefits components.  Much of the slowdown in benefits costs was in nonproduction bonuses, which fell 7 percent after rising 6 percent over the preceding year; the increase in employer contributions for health insurance-at 4½ percent-was the same as over the preceding year.

Turning to the current quarter, average hourly earnings rose 0.1 percent in both April and May.  Over the 12 months ending in May, this wage measure rose 3.1 percent, ¾ percentage point less than over the preceding year.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Conditions and sentiment in financial markets continued to show signs of improvement over the intermeeting period.  The results of the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program (SCAP) were positively received by financial markets.  CDS spreads for banking organizations declined considerably, albeit to still-elevated levels, and the institutions involved in the SCAP subsequently were able to issue significant amounts of public equity and nonguaranteed debt.  The functioning of short-term funding markets improved, with Libor rates and Libor-OIS spreads declining over the period.  Broad stock price indexes increased, and spreads on corporate bonds continued to narrow. Meanwhile, nominal Treasury yields climbed steeply, apparently reflecting investors' perceptions of an improved economic outlook, a reversal of flight-to-quality flows, and technical factors related to the hedging of mortgage holdings.  TIPS data point to some increase in inflation risk premiums and inflation expectations as well.  Rates on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages increased about in line with the jump in long-term Treasury yields.

The volume of bond issuance and seasoned equity offerings by nonfinancial corporations was robust in May, but outstanding bank loans to households and nonfinancial businesses declined.  The available indicators suggest that household and business credit quality continued to deteriorate, with delinquency rates on credit cards and on commercial mortgages now at their highest levels in more than a decade.

Financial Institutions

Market sentiment toward the financial sector improved over the intermeeting period, reflecting, in part, the release of the SCAP results for the nation's 19 largest bank holding companies (BHCs) on May 7.  Nearly all the BHCs evaluated had enough Tier 1 capital (of which more than $200 billion was previously issued capital from the government) to absorb the higher losses envisioned under the more hypothetical adverse scenario; still, 10 institutions were required to enhance their capital structure to put greater emphasis on common equity.  Guidelines for repaying government capital provided to the BHCs under the TARP were also announced in early June.  CDS spreads for banking organizations declined considerably over the intermeeting period, although they remained well above historical norms.  Stock price indexes for the banking sector and the broader financial sectors jumped almost 15 percent.

Since the announcement of the SCAP results, the 19 evaluated institutions have raised or announced plans to raise around $70 billion in common equity through public offerings,

conversion of preferred stock, and asset sales.  These offerings accounted for most of the record-high total financial equity issuance in May.  The evaluated BHCs have also issued roughly $10 billion of debt under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program and more than $25 billion in other debt, with considerable variation across institutions in the rates paid on non-FDIC-guaranteed debt.   On June 9, the Treasury announced that 10 1 large financial institutions were eligible to repay the $68 billion in TARP capital that they had received.

Press reports during the intermeeting period indicated that the Treasury would grant access to TARP funds to a number of insurance companies.  Some of the named companies announced that they would not accept such funds, while one major insurance company announced that it had obtained approval to receive $3.4 billion in TARP funds. On the whole, stock price indexes of insurance companies rose over the intermeeting period.

Short-Term Funding Markets

Functioning in short-term funding markets generally improved over the intermeeting period.  Consistent with a reduction in concerns about the financial condition of large banking institutions, Libor rates declined noticeably.  The one-month Libor-OIS spread narrowed to just above pre-crisis levels, and the three-month Libor-OIS spread-while still elevated-declined to a level not seen since early 2008.  Longer-term Libor-OIS spreads also narrowed but continued to be elevated by historical standards.

In the repurchase agreement (repo) market, bid-asked spreads for most types of transactions ticked down while haircuts were little changed.  Reportedly, term repo volumes continued to be light but picked up slightly.  Since the April Greenbook, spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP were little changed, on net, remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past 18 months.

Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities

Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserve assets were about flat at a little more than $2 trillion, with an increase in securities held offset by a decline in credit supplied under credit and liquidity facilities.  The Federal Reserve added more than $250 billion to its portfolio of securities held outright.  Purchases of Treasury coupon securities accounted for about $90 billion of the increase; almost all of these purchases were

nominal securities, with the bulk having maturities between 2 and 10 years.  In addition, the Federal Reserve purchased about $20 billion of agency debt and more than $150 billion of agency MBS.

Consistent with the improvement in short-term funding markets, use of most Federal Reserve liquidity facilities declined.  Primary credit outstanding ebbed, and credit extended under the PDCF dwindled to zero.  TAF credit declined as bid amounts submitted at auctions generally trended lower, although the number of banks submitting bids was little changed.  Bidding at TSLF auctions continued to decline.  The CPFF saw the second major roll of commercial paper, with less than one-half of this maturing paper reissued to the CPFF, in part because issuers moved to longer-term sources of funds.

During the intermeeting period, there were two TALF operations, which resulted in $22 billion in new TALF loans.  Most loans were secured by credit card or auto loan ABS.  Also during the intermeeting period, the Federal Reserve announced a further expansion of the collateral eligible to be pledged under the TALF program to include newly issued and legacy CMBS, as well as insurance premium finance loans.  The Federal Reserve also authorized TALF loans with maturities of up to five years for loans to finance purchases of CMBS, ABS backed by student loans, and ABS backed by loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration.

Treasury Yields and Policy Expectations

Futures quotes-combined with our standard assumptions about the term premium-now imply that the expected federal funds rate rises above the current target range around the end of this year; however, readings from this market are likely somewhat distorted by widening term premiums.  No respondent to the primary dealer survey expects a rate increase this year.

Over the intermeeting period, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note increased about 60 basis points, while that on the 2-year note rose about 30 basis points, with the largest increases occurring in late May and early June.  These moves were attributable to several factors, including investors' perceptions of an improvement in the economic outlook, a reversal of flight-to-quality flows, a possible rise in inflation expectations, and a rise in term premiums.  Term premiums appear to have increased, in part, because investors sold long-duration assets as exposure to mortgage prepayment risk dropped with a rise in mortgage rates; consistent with such hedging activity, 10-year swap spreads jumped.  In addition, uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve would adjust its asset purchases in

response to the increase in yields contributed to an increase in interest rate volatility, which also likely pushed term premiums higher.

Measures of TIPS-based inflation compensation over the next 5 years and 5 to 10 years ahead increased about 80 and 8 basis points, respectively, and now stand close to the levels seen late last summer.  Special factors probably contributed to the widening in inflation compensation; in particular, the unwinding of safe-haven demands and increased mortgage-related hedging boosted nominal yields relative to TIPS yields.  But inflation risk premiums and inflation expectations likely increased as well.  Indeed, survey measures of expected inflation have ticked up lately, and the largest moves in inflation compensation occurred on days of noticeable increases in oil prices.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock price indexes have risen about 7 percent, on net, since the April FOMC meeting, reflecting generally better-than-expected economic news and further declines in risk premiums.  The spread between the staff's estimate of the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms and an estimate of the real 10-year Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-narrowed noticeably but remained high by historical standards.  Option-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index also declined but remained elevated.

Yields on BBB-rated corporate bonds declined about 90 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period, and those on speculative-grade corporate bonds declined about 70 basis points.  As a result, spreads of BBB-rated and speculative grade corporate bond yields over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities narrowed about 150 and 130 basis points, respectively.  Corporate bond spreads have now reversed roughly one-half of the jump from mid-2007 to the end of last year, but their current levels are still at or above the peak levels posted in 2002 following the previous recession. Estimates of bid-asked spreads in the secondary market for speculative-grade corporate bonds fell significantly to about their average levels in the few years before the summer of 2007, while those for investment-grade corporate bonds remained somewhat elevated.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Operating earnings per share in the first quarter for S&amp;P 500 firms as a whole were about 32 percent below year-earlier levels, as were profits for the nonfinancial portion of the index.  Analysts' current forecasts imply that the pace of profit declines will moderate only a bit in the second quarter.  An index of revisions to analysts' forecasts of year-

ahead earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms was negative in the month ending in mid-May, but substantially less so than in the prior few months, with the index level for nonfinancial firms just a touch below zero.

Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms continued to point to considerable stress.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations rose a bit further in the first quarter and is now at its highest level since 2001.  At the same time, nonfinancial corporations have boosted their holdings of liquid assets as a share of total assets, in part because some corporations held the proceeds of robust bond issuance in cash.  The pace at which Moody's downgraded nonfinancial corporate bonds slowed noticeably in April and May from its outsized level in the first quarter but remained substantial.  Meanwhile, ratings upgrades continued to be modest.  In May, the six-month trailing bond default rate remained close to its peak levels in 1991 and 2002, and the expected year-ahead default frequency from Moody's KMV remained extremely high by historical standards.  In addition, the delinquency rate on commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans moved up further in the first quarter to the middle of its historical range.

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations was robust in May.  Investment-grade issuance rebounded from a lull in April.  Speculative-grade issuance was the highest since June 2007, but issuance of lower-rated speculative-grade bonds remained minimal. With decreasing bond yields, firms reportedly issued bonds to pay down bank loans, contributing to a further contraction in C&amp;I loans.  Net issuance of commercial paper turned positive in May, but the outstanding amount of paper is still down by roughly one-third since the start of the year.  Overall, last month, these sources of net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations bounced back from their decline in April.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms from seasoned offerings surged in May to its highest level since October 2008, while initial public offerings remained muted.  In the first quarter, the pace of public and private equity issuance was moderate, while equity retirements from cash-financed mergers and estimated share repurchases declined.  As a result, net equity issuance by nonfinancial firms was positive for the first time since 2002.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate markets have remained under considerable strain.  Outstanding commercial mortgage debt was roughly flat in the first quarter, the weakest reading since 1995.  Sales of commercial real estate declined further in April and May, with the monthly volume now just a small fraction of that seen in 2007.  Commercial real estate prices dropped again in the first quarter, leaving the price indexes down about 25 percent from their peaks in 2007.  Delinquency rates on both securitized commercial mortgages and commercial mortgages on existing properties at commercial banks have risen to their highest levels in more than a decade.  Delinquency rates on construction loans at banks continued to escalate in the first quarter from already elevated levels.  The inclusion of CMBS in the TALF program resulted initially in a narrowing of commercial mortgage CDS spreads; however, spreads have since widened as rating agencies have issued conflicting opinions regarding the credit quality of senior CMBS tranches.

Household Finance

Interest rates on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages jumped about 80 basis points over the intermeeting period, about in line with the rise in the long-term Treasury yield. The increase left the conforming mortgage rate above 5½ percent.  Issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs has increased in recent months, as the GSEs continued to securitize mortgages that were refinanced early this year, and Fannie Mae securitized a portion of its portfolio of seasoned mortgages.  MBS issuance by Ginnie Mae increased modestly in March and April, while the private-label MBS market remained shuttered. After declining in the previous three quarters, outstanding residential mortgage debt was about flat in the first quarter.  Mortgage debt likely has continued to be restrained by weakness in housing activity, falling home prices, restrictive financing conditions for some types of borrowers, and elevated charge-offs of defaulted loans.

Home prices continued to decline in the first quarter: The Federal Housing Finance Agency home price index posted a decline of 7 percent over the year ending in March, while the LoanPerformance national index and the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index dropped 12 percent and 19 percent, respectively, over the same period.  The number of foreclosure starts increased sharply in the first quarter, in part owing to the expiration of various mortgage moratorium laws.  The increase in foreclosure starts was particularly striking for prime loans; 2.5 percent of all outstanding prime loans are now in foreclosure, the highest reading since the series began in 1979.

Conditions in the consumer ABS market improved noticeably.  Spreads on AAA-rated consumer ABS narrowed further over the intermeeting period and have now reversed a large fraction of the run-up from mid-2007 to their peaks at year-end 2008.  Issuance of consumer ABS continued to ramp up, led by TALF-financed issues.  Interest rates on new and used auto loans were little changed over the intermeeting period at levels well below those seen early this year, and interest rates on credit cards were also about flat. Delinquency rates on all types of consumer loans have continued to rise; however, the increase in credit card delinquency rates has been particularly pronounced over the past year, with most measures at their highest levels in more than a decade.

Reflecting a reduction in safe-haven demands, long-term mutual funds, especially bond funds, attracted considerable inflows in April and May; money market funds saw net outflows over the same period as yields on these funds remained extremely low.

Treasury Finance

Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury conducted auctions of nominal and inflationprotected coupon securities across the term structure.  Issuance totaled about $265 billion and was generally well received, as bid-to-cover ratios remained within recent ranges. Measures of foreign participation continue to suggest strong demand for U.S. Treasury securities from abroad.

The functioning of the Treasury coupon market improved further.  Fitting errors from staff yield curve models continued to shrink, bid-asked spreads remained near pre-crisis levels, and trading volumes picked up.  Spreads between yields on on- and off-the-run notes narrowed considerably at the short end, although hedging-related demand appeared to maintain pressure on these spreads for longer-dated Treasury securities.  The implementation of the Treasury Market Practices Group's recommendation of a mandatory charge for delivery failures in the market for U.S. Treasury securities appears to have gone smoothly, and fails-to-deliver of Treasury securities have generally been low recently, with just a few noticeable exceptions.

State and Local Government Finance

Conditions in the municipal bond market continued to improve.  Gross issuance of longterm municipal bonds remained solid in May, as new capital issuance continued apace. Refundings decreased in response to higher interest rates, and short-term issuance

remained weak, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.   Yields on long-term municipal 2 bonds rose somewhat, on net, over the intermeeting period; even so, the ratio of municipal bond yields to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities dropped to its lowest levels in almost a year.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 expanded at an average annual rate of just ¾ percent during April and May, a significant slowdown from the rate of growth observed in the first quarter, as the reallocation of household wealth toward the safety and liquidity of M2 assets appeared to have moderated.  Retail money market funds and small time deposits contracted in both months, probably in response to declining interest rates on these assets.  Currency growth slowed, likely reflecting primarily a waning in foreign demand.  The monetary base continued its recent expansion in April and May, although at a slower pace of growth than in the first quarter, as the effect of Federal Reserve asset purchases on reserves was mostly offset by a drop in usage of liquidity facilities.

Commercial bank credit increased slightly in May following six consecutive monthly declines, but the turnaround reflected a rise in securities holdings and in the volatile 'other' loans category (that is, loans other than C&amp;I, real estate, and consumer loans). C&amp;I loans dropped at an annual pace of 16 percent in May amid subdued origination activity and broad-based paydowns of outstanding loans.  Home equity loans edged down-the first monthly decline in this category since October 2006-partly owing to banks' reductions in existing lines of credit.  Closed-end residential mortgages decreased at a 9 percent pace; originations were reportedly strong, but they were more than offset by loan sales to the GSEs.  In April and May, consumer loans originated by banks shrank at a 3½ percent pace, on average, and on-balance-sheet holdings decreased even more because of a number of large credit card securitizations.  The rise in banks' holdings of securities last month reportedly reflected the retention of some portions of these ABS deals.

First-quarter Call Report data showed a further widespread deterioration in credit quality. The industry-wide charge-off rate rose to more than 2 percent of all loans, the highest level since before at least 1985, and the overall delinquency rate increased to about 5½ percent, the highest level recorded since the fourth quarter of 1991.  Even with the pressure on earnings from worsening credit quality, large banks as a group were

profitable in the first quarter, reflecting a jump in noninterest income related, in part, to new FASB accounting rules and a decrease in noninterest expense.  In contrast, profits of banks not among the top 25 BHCs continued to be negative as loss provisions increased further.  For the banking sector as a whole, total unused commitments to fund loans, an indicator of bank credit availability, contracted sharply in the first quarter.  Regulatory capital ratios increased to near the upper end of their historical ranges in the first quarter, as commercial banks continued to receive large amounts of capital from parent holding companies while average tangible assets and risk-weighted assets declined markedly.

Loan pricing data from the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted in early May indicated that C&amp;I loan rate spreads over comparable-maturity market instruments rose noticeably compared with the February survey.  The increase was partly attributable to a steep increase in spreads for loans made under commitment.  As time has passed, more of these loans have been drawn under commitments that were priced since the onset of the financial crisis and so reflect wider prevailing spreads.

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $29.2 billion in April, from a revised $28.5 billion in March, as a decrease in imports was offset by a slightly larger fall in exports.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports of goods and services fell 2.3 percent in April after decreasing 2 percent in March.  Most major categories of exports fell in April, with exports of machinery, industrial supplies, and consumer goods exhibiting significant declines.

The average value of exports in the first quarter declined 39 percent at an annual rate, as almost all major categories of exports moved down, with exports of machinery, industrial supplies, and automotive products recording large decreases.  The decrease in exports of automotive products reflected weak global demand but also the significant production cutbacks implemented by U.S. automakers domestically as well as in Canada and Mexico.  Production cutbacks also contributed to sharp declines in auto imports (see below).  In contrast, exports of aircraft increased following the end of production disruptions at Boeing in the fourth quarter.

The value of imports of goods and services fell 1.4 percent in April after remaining about unchanged in March.  Imports of machinery and industrial supplies displayed significant decreases, and imports of services fell moderately.  Imports of oil and consumer goods increased, with the increase in the value of oil imports reflecting higher prices, as volumes moved down.

The average value of imports in the first quarter plummeted 55 percent at an annual rate. About one-third of the decline reflected a fall in the value of oil imports on account of lower prices.  All other major categories of imports also declined sharply.  Imports of machinery, automotive products, and industrial supplies exhibited particularly large declines.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In April, prices of core imports were little changed from March with a 0.3 percent decline in prices for material-intensive goods offsetting a 0.1 percent price increase in prices for finished goods.  In May, core import prices increased 0.2 percent, the first increase since August 2008, as prices for material-intensive goods increased 0.6 percent, reflecting recent rises in commodity prices.

The average level of core import prices in April and May was almost 2 percent at an annual rate below the first-quarter average.  Prices for material-intensive goods were down 5 percent, whereas prices for finished goods fell ½ percent.

Oil. The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil rose 9.8 percent in April and was up an additional 8.3 percent in May.  The index has now risen for four consecutive months since the trough that occurred in January of this year.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose at a more modest 3 percent pace in April before shooting up nearly 20 percent in May to average $59 per barrel for the month as a whole.  Since that time, spot WTI has continued to increase, closing most recently on June 16 at $70.62 per barrel.  While the lagged effects of OPEC supply restraint are likely providing some upward support, the sharply higher prices appear to also reflect more buoyant prospects for global demand for oil.

Exports. After falling sharply in February and March, core export prices rose 0.4 percent in April and 0.6 percent in May.  In both months, the increase was led by prices for agricultural products, which rose over 3.5 percent each month.  In contrast, non-agricultural industrial supplies rose at a more modest pace each month, increasing

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The average level of core export prices in April and May was ½ percent at an annual rate above the first-quarter average.  The rise can be attributed to the 10 percent increase in prices of agricultural products, which fell at a 12½ percent pace in the first quarter.  For non-agricultural industrial supplies, after a 28½ percent price decline in the first quarter, the average price level in April and May is down only 1 percent relative to the first quarter.  Prices of exported finished goods were little changed, as falling prices for consumer goods offset price increases for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial transactions for March and April and Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) custody data for May and the first half of June.  Overall, these flows are consistent with the recent easing of tensions in financial markets.  Although as of yet there is little indication of foreign investor interest in acquiring riskier U.S. assets, U.S. investors have resumed purchasing foreign securities.

After the unusual outflows in the fourth quarter of last year, when some official investors sold U.S. securities as they intervened to support their currencies, foreign official inflows have resumed this year (see line 1 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions').

As has been the case since last summer, official inflows continue to be overwhelmingly into U.S. Treasury securities (see the figure 'Foreign Official Financial Inflows through April 2009').  FRBNY custody data indicate strong official acquisitions in May and so far in June,

.

As conditions stabilized in interbank funding markets, drawings on central bank liquidity swap facilities contracted somewhat further in March and more noticeably in April; this decrease generated additional official inflows as Federal Reserve deposit claims at partner central banks (included in line 2) decreased.  Net outflows through the private banking sector persisted in both March and April (line 3), as private institutions continued to replace the liquidity swap facilities as sources of dollar funding abroad.  The slowdown in banking outflows in the past two months may reflect a greater ability of banks abroad to tap alternative sources of funds or a general reduction in the size of bank balance sheets.

Foreign private investors continued to seek the safety of Treasury securities in March (line 4a) but sold off some of their Treasury holdings in April as the tone in financial markets improved.  They appeared reluctant, however, to move into other types of U.S. securities (see the upper panels of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through April 2009').  After selling U.S. equities in January and February, foreign private investors purchased a small amount, on net, in March and April (line 4d).  So far this year, however, they have continued to sell, on net, U.S. agency and corporate debt (lines 4b and 4c).  A further indication of continued foreign investor caution is that foreign gross purchases and sales of all U.S. securities (not shown) remain near the subdued levels of last fall.

U.S. demand for foreign securities, however, has picked up so far this year (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through April 2009').  Strong purchases of foreign bonds, primarily new issues, in part reflect the improved environment for foreign bond issuance.  The renewed outflows into foreign securities are in sharp contrast to the net sales of foreign securities recorded in the second half of last year.

U.S. balance of payments data, including complete information on financial transactions in the first quarter, will be released on June 17 and discussed in a Greenbook supplement.

Foreign Financial Markets

The major currencies index of the dollar has declined more than 7 percent since the time of the April Greenbook, as the dollar depreciated substantially against the currencies of all of its major trading partners except the yen.  This decline appeared to be driven by a renewed sense of optimism about global growth prospects, leading investors to shift away from safe-haven assets in the United States and Japan to riskier assets elsewhere. This shift marked a reversal of the flows that supported the dollar and yen in the fourth quarter of 2008 when investors moved into safer assets.  Despite some speculation that foreign governments were selling U.S. assets and thereby hastening the dollar's decline, available data do not support these rumors (see U.S. International Financial Transactions in this part of the Greenbook), and officials at several Asian central banks publicly reaffirmed that their demand for U.S. Treasury securities had not materially changed.  The Mexican peso depreciated against the dollar in the wake of Mexico's weak macroeconomic performance over the period, while Chinese authorities held the renminbi nearly unchanged against the dollar.  However, the dollar depreciated against most other emerging market currencies, prompting several central banks to intervene to purchase dollars in recent weeks.

Global interbank markets improved in the wake of the May 7 release of the results of the Federal Reserve's Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, and the strong performance by financial stocks helped lead headline equity indexes higher.  Although the news over the period was dominated by the success that many U.S. banks had in raising capital in order to repay funds received from the TARP, several foreign banks also took advantage of improved credit conditions to raise capital, including Barclays, Lloyds, Commerzebank and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group.  In addition, foreign banks increased their issuance of debt outside of their government guarantee programs. Libor-to-OIS spreads in euro and sterling decreased as foreign banks began to successfully access capital markets.  Spreads between three-month euro Libor and OIS rates fell from 56 to 48 basis points while comparable spreads in sterling fell from 107 to 81 basis points.  The improved access to capital markets and the better economic outlook buoyed bank stocks, which rose 11 to 14 percent in Europe and Japan, while headline stock indexes in those countries rose 6 to 12 percent.  Most EME stock markets rose at least 10 percent, with several rising more than 20 percent, and mutual fund flows into those markets strengthened.

Yields on long-term sovereign nominal and indexed bonds rose over the period, though by less than in the United States.  Yields on benchmark German and British nominal bonds increased 32 and 45 basis points respectively, with rates on comparable inflation-protected bonds rising 7 and 19 basis points.  Although the widening differences between nominal and real bond yields might be interpreted as indicating that inflation expectations have increased, it seems likely that improving liquidity conditions contributed substantially to the more limited rise in inflation-protected yields.  The rise in yields has likely been at least partially driven by an increased willingness on the part of investors to move out of safe assets such as government bonds and into riskier investments; however, a segment of the investment community seems also to have grown concerned about the effect that rising fiscal deficits may have on inflation and the returns to holding long-term bonds.  On May 21, Standard &amp; Poor's cut its outlook for the United Kingdom, warning that government debt may soar close to 100 percent of GDP. Ten-year gilt yields rose 15 basis points over the following day and a half, while the pound declined 1.5 percent despite the fact that Fitch and Moody's reaffirmed their highest ratings for the United Kingdom.

The rise in bond yields among the advanced foreign economies came even though the ECB lowered its policy rate by 25 basis points to 1 percent while the Bank of England and Bank of Japan kept their policy rates fixed at very low levels.  The ECB and Bank of England also announced new unconventional monetary policy decisions. Yields on longer-term gilts fell immediately after the Bank of England's announced on May 7 that it would increase the size of its asset purchases from £75 billion to £125 billion, but this action only temporarily halted the upward trend in rates. Yields on covered bonds fell up to 30 basis points in the days following the ECB's May 7 announcement that it would purchase up to €60 billion of those bonds. As with gilts, yields on European covered bonds have since risen, but the spread between covered and government bonds has remained lower than its level prior to the ECB's announcement.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

The contraction of output in the advanced foreign economies deepened in the first quarter, with real GDP declining at an average pace of more than 7½ percent.  Domestic demand plummeted in all major economies, led by double-digit declines in fixed investment and sizable negative contributions of inventories to growth.  Recent indicators of economic activity, however, suggest that the pace of contraction likely moderated in the current quarter.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) rebounded from the exceptionally low levels reached in the first quarter, and industrial production stabilized somewhat, expanding in several economies for the first time in about a year.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to moderate, with headline inflation standing around zero in all major economies except the United Kingdom, where it has moved down to about 2 percent.  Excluding food and energy prices, the slowing in consumer price inflation has been roughly stable.  Over the intermeeting period, the European Central Bank (ECB) reduced its main policy rate ¼ percentage point and also announced that it will purchase €60 billion worth of covered bonds over the next 12 months.  The Bank of England (BOE) and the Bank of Japan (BOJ) have continued purchasing assets as part of their unconventional monetary policy actions.

Japanese GDP fell a record-breaking 14.2 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter following a 13.5 percent contraction in the fourth quarter.  Total domestic demand and net exports provided comparable negative contributions to the first-quarter fall.  Real private investment dropped almost 30 percent (a.r.), and has now fallen in six out of the past seven quarters.  Private consumption declined further, and government consumption was little changed.  Both exports and imports plunged at an unprecedented pace, resulting on net in a negative contribution of the external sector to growth of about 8 percentage points.

Recent indicators for economic activity are mixed but positive on balance.  Industrial production jumped a near-record 5.2 percent in April, although it remains well below its year ago level.  Consumption growth in March and April was much better than expected, and consumer confidence increased further.  Real exports rose sharply in April and imports edged up, suggesting that net exports might contribute positively to growth in the second quarter.

Indicators for the housing sector and the labor market remain weak.  In April, housing starts fell roughly 12 percent from the previous month and were down more than 30 percent in the last 12 months.  The ratio of job openings to applicants (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) reached a record low level of 0.46 in April.  Employment fell 1.7 percent over the last 12 months, a rate consistent with the 2001 and 1974 recessions, and the unemployment rate increased to 5 percent.

Japanese consumer prices fell slightly over the 12 months ending in April, leaving inflation well below the peak of 2.3 percent reached last July.  Excluding food and energy prices, 12-month consumer price inflation was -0.4 percent in April.

The Bank of Japan left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting period and continued to purchase commercial paper, corporate bonds, equities, and government bonds.  On the fiscal front, political infighting appears to be slowing the implementation of the fiscal stimulus packages announced earlier this year. At the end of May, however, the Japanese government enacted a supplementary budget funding a large portion of the stimulus.

In the euro area , real GDP contracted 9.7 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, with German GDP falling more than 14 percent.  Inventory adjustment was a significant drag on euro-area GDP growth after contributing positively to growth late last year.  Both investment and consumption spending declined at about their fourth-quarter pace.  The negative contribution of net exports was less severe than in the previous two quarters, as the decline in imports was deeper than the drop in exports.

Indicators received during the intermeeting period point to a moderation in the pace of contraction in the current quarter.  Industrial production in March and April fell at the slowest rate since last August.  Retail sales edged up in April for the first time in seven months.  The business climate index and economic sentiment indicators rebounded moderately in April and May.  PMIs rose in April and turned up sharply in May.

In contrast, labor market conditions have continued to worsen.  The euro-area unemployment rate rose to 9.2 percent in April, up from a low of 7.2 percent in early 2008.  However, the extent of deterioration has varied considerably among euro-area countries, with the Spanish unemployment rate up more than 10 percentage points from

its most recent low, while Germany's unemployment rate has risen only about ½ percentage point.  The relatively small response of the German unemployment rate, partly, reflects government subsidies to firms to retain employees.  The decline in the German workweek has been more significant.

Twelve-month euro-area inflation was zero in May, down from 0.6 percent in April. Excluding energy and unprocessed food, inflation was 1.6 percent.

The Governing Council of the ECB cut its main policy rate 25 basis points, to 1 percent, at its May 7 meeting.  In addition, President Trichet announced plans to extend the maturity of liquidity operations up to 12 months, prolong the duration for the extended list of eligible collateral to the end of 2010, and buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds. At its June 4 meeting, the ECB kept its policy rate unchanged and provided more details on its asset purchase program: Covered bond purchases will be made in both primary and secondary markets, will be spread out over the year starting in July 2009, and will involve bonds that are eligible for use as collateral in the ECB's financing operations, with a minimum rating of AA from one of the three main ratings agencies.

In the United Kingdom , real output contracted 7.3 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the first quarter, pushed down by a correspondingly sharp fall in domestic demand.  Private consumption dropped almost 5 percent, and investment tumbled amid cutbacks in capital expenditures across virtually all sectors.  Inventories continued to contribute negatively to growth, whereas the external sector again contributed positively to growth.

Incoming data suggest that the pace of economic contraction has moderated markedly in the second quarter.  Industrial production edged up in April after declining for 13 consecutive months.  In May, the PMI index rose above 50 for the first time since April 2008, a reading consistent with a slight expansion.  Orders for new houses and lending for house purchases edged up in March and April, suggesting that activity in the housing sector has stabilized somewhat.  In May, the number of persons claiming unemployment benefits posted the smallest increase since July 2008.

Price pressure eased noticeably in recent months.  The 12-month rate of consumer price inflation fell to 2.2 percent in May. Excluding food and energy, inflation was 1.4 percent.

During the intermeeting period, the BOE continued its steady purchases of public and private assets under its quantitative easing program.  As of June 4, the BOE had acquired nearly £ 80 billion in assets, the vast majority ( £ 77 billion) of which were gilts.

In Canada , real GDP fell 5.4 percent in the first quarter (s.a.a.r.) following a 3.7 percent decline in the previous quarter.  Total domestic demand declined almost 10 percent, as investment fell sharply and inventories provided a sizable negative contribution to growth.  The decline in private consumption was smaller than in the fourth quarter, but government consumption growth slowed.  Net exports made a large positive contribution to growth as imports fell faster than exports.

More recently, retail sales turned positive in March and the index of leading indicators edged up in April.  Manufacturing shipments rose slightly in April, and new orders fell a moderate 3.2 percent following a 3 percent fall in March.  Housing starts have continued to fall and in May were 11 percent below the first-quarter average.  After a brief respite in April, employment declined in May and has contracted in six of the past seven months.

Twelve-month headline inflation in April was 0.6 percent, down from its peak of 3.5 percent in August 2008.  Inflation excluding food and energy was 1 percent in April, down from last year but within its range over the past several years.

At its June meeting, the Bank of Canada kept its policy rate at 0.25 percent and reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Data received since the last Greenbook show that first-quarter real GDP contracted sharply in Mexico, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore but expanded considerably in India and Indonesia and slightly in Korea.  For the current quarter, indicators suggest continued stabilization of activity in emerging market economies (EMEs).  In China, which appears to be front-running the recovery, retail sales and fixed asset investment expanded strongly.  Financial conditions have continued to improve in most EMEs since the time of the April Greenbook:  CDS premiums narrowed further, equity markets surged, the currencies of several EMEs have appreciated, and capital flows to EMEs appear to have increased.  Inflation continued to decline in emerging Asia and has begun to ease in Latin America.  After cutting policy rates aggressively earlier, many central banks in emerging Asia have kept their rates on hold since the last Greenbook, although Indonesia and the Philippines are exceptions.  Central banks in Latin America are continuing to lower policy rates, as their easing cycle began later than emerging Asia's.

In China , indicators point to a relatively strong expansion in economic activity, boosted by aggressive fiscal and monetary stimulus.  In May, all subindexes of the purchasing managers index were in the expansionary range, including, for the first time since June 2008, the new export orders index.  Cement and auto production experienced large increases in April and May, reflecting a rebound in the construction sector and continued strong demand for durable goods.  Fixed asset investment also grew sharply over the first two months of the second quarter, and retail sales remained robust.  The trade balance in April and May shrank relative to the first-quarter average as imports increased.  The fiscal stimulus appears to be a significant driver of investment and imports.  The Shanghai composite stock index has risen more than 60 percent from its trough in November and is up 13 percent since the time of the April Greenbook, likely providing a boost to consumer confidence.

Benchmark interest rates and banks' reserve requirements have been on hold since the end of last year, but the Chinese authorities have been encouraging loan growth this year after limiting it over the past few years.  Consequently, the increase in outstanding loans through May of this year already exceeds the growth seen in all of 2008.    Chinese consumer prices in May were 1½ percent below their year-earlier level, but seasonally adjusted monthly inflation has been positive in each of the past three months.

India's GDP grew 7.8 percent (s.a.a.r) in the first quarter of 2009, well above staff and market expectations.  Growth was particularly strong in the services and construction sectors.   The headline purchasing managers index increased in both April and May, led by orders and production.  The trade deficit narrowed in April, as the fall in imports was sharper than that in exports.  Consumer price inflation increased in April, whereas wholesale price inflation decreased.  This divergence reflects the large increase in food prices in April, which account for a greater share of consumer prices.  The government's fiscal deficit for the 2008 fiscal year came in at a record high 6.2 percent of GDP, well above the official target.  National elections concluded in May, and the National Congress Party increased the strength of its coalition government and reelected Manmohan Singh as the prime minister.  Markets reacted positively to the election results, as the Congress Party has long supported economic reforms.

Economic activity in the newly industrialized economies ( NIEs) 1 generally continued to contract in the first quarter, as external and domestic demand remained weak.  In South Korea, however, first-quarter GDP inched up after a severe contraction in the fourth quarter of last year, primarily because of the effect of previous fiscal stimulus and monetary policy easing.  Indicators for the second quarter point to some firming of activity among the NIEs.  Exports have picked up from their depressed levels in previous months, and April industrial production was up across the region.  Retail sales and indexes of consumer and business sentiment also show some signs of recovery. Moreover, purchasing managers index readings have improved, although they remain in the range indicating contraction.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to fall across the region during the second quarter and turned negative in Taiwan and Singapore, reflecting considerable slack in economic activity and, in some cases, continued declines in administered energy prices.  Hong Kong announced a new stimulus package worth HK$10 billion (0.6 percent of GDP).  The stimulus includes a one-off income tax rebate and spending on public infrastructure.  Central banks have kept policy rates unchanged, following significant rate reductions in previous months.

Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN-4)  2 , real GDP contracted sharply in Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand the first quarter but rebounded in Indonesia, rising a surprising 6.2 percent.  Available indicators for April suggest a resurgence of activity in Thailand, where industrial production increased considerably on a monthly basis.  Exports increased in April in Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Despite these monthly improvements, the level of trade in these economies is still well below its pre-crisis levels.

Inflation continued to recede across the region.  With declining price pressures, the central banks of Indonesia and the Philippines each lowered their policy rates 25 basis points in May.  Bank Indonesia reduced its policy rate an additional 25 basis points in early June.

Real GDP in Mexico fell a dramatic 21½ percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, matching the quarterly contraction at the peak of the 1994-95 peso crisis.  So far in the second quarter, incoming data provide a mixed picture.  The manufacturing purchasing managers index moved up, on balance, in April and May, but activity in the services sector weakened with a large adverse effect of the swine flu outbreak.  The outbreak peaked in late April and forced the government to temporarily suspend public education and all non-essential activities in Mexico City.  In April, exports declined further, but at a much slower pace than in the first quarter.   The trade deficit narrowed, as declines in imports exceeded those in exports.

Twelve-month headline consumer price inflation remained at around 6 percent in recent months, reflecting, in part, the earlier pass-through from the depreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar.  During the intermeeting perid, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) cut its policy rate 75 basis points, bringing it down to 5¼ percent.  With recent stability in the foreign exchange market, Mexican officials announced that the BOM will reduce its daily foreign exchange sales to the interbank market to $50 million a day from the current $100 million.  The BOM will also reduce the amount it auctions on any day when the peso depreciates against the dollar at least two percent from $300 million to $250 million. The officials left open the possibility of auctioning larger amounts if market conditions warrant.

Brazilian real GDP declined 3.3 percent at annual rate in the first quarter, pulled down by the continued plunge in investment.  Private consumption was up 3 percent, supported by fiscal stimulus and government-sponsored credit growth.  Both exports and imports continued to plummet in the first quarter each falling about 50 percent at an annual rate. On the production side, industrial output declined sharply, while services output rose 3 percent.  There have been signs of recovery so far this quarter.  Industrial production rose for the fourth straight month in April but remained 15 percent below its September peak.  The purchasing managers index continued to climb from its lows in January. There have been anecdotal reports that inventories have been winding down.

At its mid-June meeting, the Central Bank of Brazil cut its target for the policy rate 100 basis points, to a record low 9¼ percent.  Net capital inflows have resumed, prompting the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate upward pressures on the real. Inflationary pressures continued to abate.

In Russia , real GDP fell 32 percent in the first quarter, in part, reflecting the adverse effects of the earlier declines in oil prices.  Industrial production, retail sales, and transportation all contracted.  However, boosted by the recent increases in oil prices, net exports jumped 28 percent in March and posted a small gain in April following eight straight months of decline.  The purchasing managers index has improved but remained in the range indicating contraction in May.  Inflation has slowed, due, in part, to stabilization of the ruble.  The central bank cut the refinancing rate 150 basis points to 11½ percent in a series of moves over May and June.  In addition, the central bank has recently started to purchase foreign currency to stem ruble appreciation.

In emerging Europe , economic activity collapsed in the Baltic economies, with firstquarter real GDP contracting at an annual rate of 22 percent in Estonia, 38 percent in Lithuania, and nearly 50 percent in Latvia.  In Latvia, the collapse in output raised doubts about the government's ability to meet the fiscal targets in the country's IMF program and led to increasing pressure on the Latvian exchange rate in early June.  In mid-June, Latvia's parliament passed draconian budget cuts, increasing the likelihood of securing the next IMF disbursement.  Elsewhere in emerging Europe, real GDP also contracted, but to a much lesser extent.  Particularly affected were some countries in Central Europe with relatively large automobile sectors.
