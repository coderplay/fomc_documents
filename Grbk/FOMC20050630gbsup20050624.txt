Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Manufacturers' Shipments, Orders, and Inventories

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft ticked up 0.2 percent in May following an upward-revised increase of 1.4 percent in April.  Deliveries of communications gear jumped 8.5 percent and recouped much of the previous month's decline.  But shipments of computers and peripheral equipment declined 2.4 percent, and shipments in the non-high-tech category edged down 0.2 percent.  New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft declined 2.3 percent in May, reflecting widespread declines.  The staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders moved down 1.9 percent in May after having risen 0.8 percent in April.

The book value of manufacturing durable goods inventories (which constitute nearly twothirds of total manufacturing inventories) increased at an annual rate of less than $10 billion in May following an anemic accumulation in April.  The inventory-shipments ratio was unchanged at 1.41 months in May.

Housing

Sales of new and existing homes remained at a high level in May.  Sales of existing homes (including single-family homes and condos and co-ops) edged down 0.7 percent in May from April's record high.  Sales of existing single-family homes slipped roughly 1 percent in May while sales of condos and co-ops rose 2-1/4 percent.  The inventory of existing homes for sale increased in May and represented 4.3 months' supply at the May sales pace, similar to the average over the past year and a half.  Sales of new homes rose 2 percent in May to an annual rate of nearly 1.3 million units; sales were revised down about 3 percent in each of the two previous months.  The stock of new homes for sale edged up in May, representing 4.2 months' supply at last month's sales pace, about the same as the average during the past year.

The median sales price of existing homes was up 12-1/2 percent in May from a year earlier.  During the twelve months ending in May, the median sales price of existing single-family homes advanced 12 percent, and the median price of condos and co-ops rose 15 percent.  The average sales price of new homes was 8 percent higher in May than a year earlier; the twelve-month change in May 2004 was 6-3/4 percent.  The median price of new homes sold in May was up only 2-1/2 percent from a year earlier, compared with the increase of 8-1/4 percent posted during the year ending in May 2004.
