We continue to assume that the broad  real value of  the dollar will decline gradually over the forecast  period, but from a higher starting point that reflects the dollar's recent appreciation, most notably  against the euro and the yen.  On balance, the broad real value of  the  dollar is projected to weaken 4 percent from its  average  in the  current quarter by the end of  next year, with the dollar recording  declines against most industrial country  currencies  and emergingmarket  currencies. The expected  depreciation  of the dollar, against a backdrop of continued strong  foreign activity,  should be sufficient to imply that the negative  arithmetic  contribution of  net exports to  real GDP  growth will narrow to near zero  by the end of next year.  Core import prices are projected to rise 2-1/4 percent this year and 3 percent next year.

Recent Developments

International financial  markets. Since the June FOMC  meeting, the dollar's average  value against the currencies  of the major foreign industrial  countries has risen 2  percent,  led by appreciations  of about 3-3/4 percent against the euro  and 2-3/4 percent relative to the yen.  The dollar  appears  to have been supported by a heightened  market perception that, despite the recent signs  of some slowing in the growth of economic  activity in the United States, prospective longer-term U.S.  growth and rates of  return  remain more  favorable than those in Europe and Japan.  The  dollar depreciated slightly on balance against  developing-country currencies  over the intermeeting  period, mainly reflecting  a 9 percent decline against  the Mexican peso  after a peaceful presidential election.

The only major industrial country central  bank to change its monetary policy stance  since the June FOMC  meeting was the Bank of Japan, which ended  its zero interest  rate policy  and raised the  target for the  overnight rate to 25  basis points  on August  11. This  action,  if  not its exact timing, had been widely anticipated  and generated little market reaction.  Short-term  interest  rates in the major foreign industrial countries  have risen  slightly on average  over the intermeeting  period.  Average long-term rates abroad have edged down. Changes  in foreign equity prices have been mixed, with the most notable development being  a 5 percent  fall in Japan.

Economic  activity abroad. Activity in the foreign  industrial countries was strong  in the second quarter, although  limited available  forward-looking indicators  suggest  some  moderation in the pace  of  growth  in the current  quarter On balance, incoming data for Japan  have been positive.
