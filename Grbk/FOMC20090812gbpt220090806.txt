Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

The incoming data suggest that overall economic activity is stabilizing.  Employment and manufacturing output continued to move lower through June, but the pace of decline has slowed noticeably in recent months.  Moreover, a sizable pickup in motor vehicle production appears to be under way.  Housing activity is likely in the process of emerging from its prolonged slump, and consumer spending has moved down only a little further, on net, after having fallen sharply in the second half of last year.  The decline in equipment and software investment seems to be moderating, although the incoming data do not point to an imminent recovery.  Regarding inflation, core consumer price inflation has remained relatively stable in recent months, though a jump in gasoline prices pushed up overall consumer inflation in June. 1

Labor Market Developments

Job losses continued in June, although at a less rapid pace than earlier in the year.  Private nonfarm payroll employment fell 440,000 per month, on average, in the second quarter, down from an average of nearly 700,000 in the first quarter.  Most industries reported a slower pace of job loss in recent months, and employment in nonbusiness serviceswhich includes education and health, along with other categories-rose in June for a second month.

In addition to cutting jobs, firms have reduced their labor input by shortening hours worked.  Average weekly hours of production and nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls, which had fallen steeply, on net, since last September, edged down further in June.  Aggregate hours of these workers fell at an annual rate of nearly 8 percent in the second quarter, only a little less than in the first quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate moved up 0.1 percentage point in June to 9.5 percent.  The fraction of workers who were working part time for economic reasons held steady in June, but at a high level.  The labor force participation rate dropped back a bit in June, but has fallen relatively little, on net, since the onset of the recession, despite the deterioration in labor demand.  Among the factors that may have contributed to the resiliency in labor force participation, the emergency unemployment compensation (EUC) program that began in July 2008 has likely encouraged unemployed

individuals to stay in the labor force.   In addition, losses in household balance sheets 2 may have led some workers to delay retirement and some secondary workers to enter the labor force.

Other indicators also suggest a slower pace of deterioration in labor demand.  With the effects of changes in the timing of summer shutdowns in the auto industry and other difficulties with seasonal adjustment largely behind us, both initial claims for unemployment insurance and insured unemployment appear to have moved down since June.  Layoff rates-as gauged by the layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey and the percentage of short-term job losers from the household survey-stayed high in recent months, while measures of job vacancies appear to have stabilized at low levels.  In addition, alternative measures of labor market slackjob availability as reported in the Conference Board survey and hard-to-fill positions as indicated in the NFIB survey-have not deteriorated further.

Regarding forward-looking indicators of labor market conditions, hiring plans in the NFIB survey have moved up a bit so far this year, and those in the Manpower survey have edged sideways; both series had fallen steeply during the past two years.  In addition, households' expectations of future labor market conditions have shown a marked improvement.

The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 5.3 percent in the second quarter after edging up at a rate of 0.3 percent in the first quarter.  Over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of this year, labor productivity is estimated to have risen 1.6 percent.

Industrial Production

The pace of decline in industrial production (IP) slowed markedly to a still considerable annual rate of about 12 percent in the second quarter.  The available indicators of production for July, including weekly output data, suggest that IP increased noticeably last month, led by a jump in motor vehicle assemblies; excluding motor vehicles, output in manufacturing likely rose a bit last month.  Regarding capacity utilization, the factory operating rate recorded another historical low in June:  At 64.6 percent, this rate was about 4 percentage points below its previous cyclical record low in December 1982. 3

After having fallen at an annual rate of nearly 70 percent in the first quarter, the production of motor vehicles and parts declined another 14 percent in the second quarter. Preliminary estimates for July indicate that light vehicle assemblies rose sharply and, combined with a concurrent rise in parts output, likely contributed about ¾ percentage point to the rate of change in total IP last month.  Elsewhere in the transportation sector, the output of aircraft and parts declined roughly 16½ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, as production moved down following a post-strike rebound to a somewhat above normal level earlier this year.  Recently, Boeing announced a further delay in the 787 Dreamliner program.   Despite the delay, commercial aircraft production 4 probably will remain close to current levels in coming months due to Boeing's large backlog of orders. 5

After tumbling in the first quarter, the production of high-tech equipment fell at a more modest annual rate of 7½ percent in the second quarter.  Production in the various components was mixed last quarter, as continued declines in the output of computers and communications equipment were partly offset by an increase in semiconductor output. The second-quarter gain in semiconductors was mostly due to higher chip production, particularly of microprocessors and DRAM, which partly reflected the replenishment of inventories following substantial reductions in the past few quarters; output in nonchip categories, such as circuit boards, continued to move down.  For computers, unit

shipments moved slightly higher in the second quarter, but real output fell as production shifted toward lower-valued machines, such as netbooks.  The output of communications equipment in the second quarter declined at an annual rate of 20 percent, a decrease broadly consistent with the steep drop in capital expenditures by major telecommunications service providers over the first half of the year.

Indicators of future movements in high-tech output continue to be mixed.  For semiconductors, Intel is upbeat about semiconductor demand over the remainder of this year, but it also reported that its revenue will decline in the third quarter, partly because of the shift to lower-priced chips.  After having plunged in the first quarter, orders for circuit boards increased last quarter, and shipments rose in June for the first time this year.  Further downstream, anecdotes remain mixed, but several industry sources report an increase in third-quarter PC demand.  Cisco recently announced that its revenue was flat in the second quarter and will be little changed in the third quarter.  Although Cisco reported that its orders began to increase last quarter, it was not certain that the pickup would be sustained.  Finally, the diffusion index of planned capital spending on high-tech equipment in the NABE's quarterly survey was little changed in the second quarter; at about 50, the index suggests that high-tech spending is likely to remain lackluster in the near term.

In the energy sector, production fell at an annual rate of 14 percent in the second quarter, reflecting weather-related drops in the output of utilities and continued sharp declines in drilling activity.

Excluding the production of energy, motor vehicles, aircraft, and high-technology products, output fell at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter, about one-half of the pace of decline in the first quarter.  While the markedly slower pace of decline was broadly based, a notable exception was the output of business equipment, whose 21 percent plunge last quarter was only slightly less steep than in the first quarter. Elsewhere, the production of consumer goods fell at an annual rate of 5 percent last quarter-after dropping 9 percent in the first quarter-as declines continued in both durables and nondurables.  The indexes for both construction and business supplies also fell at a slower pace last quarter.  The production of durable materials declined at an annual rate of 24 percent in the second quarter, but the index for nondurable materials was little changed, in part because of higher output in the chemical industry.

Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity have brightened somewhat recently and suggest that factory output is poised to turn up modestly in the next few months.  The

three-month moving average of the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders rose for the second straight month in June, and both the diffusion index of new orders from the national manufacturing ISM survey and the average of the new orders diffusion indexes from the regional manufacturing surveys moved above 50 last month.  Lastly, manufacturing activity in the foreign sector appears to have edged up in recent months, possibly signaling the return of some external support for domestic manufacturing.

Motor Vehicles

Production of light motor vehicles was at an annual rate of about 4½ million units in the second quarter-little changed from its historically low first-quarter rate-as the effects of the shutdowns at GM and Chrysler were offset by modest increases in production at most other automakers.  The pullback in production this year has slashed dealers' stocks of domestic light vehicles to extremely low levels, and the days' supply of vehicles fell from a peak of 100 days in February to a fairly comfortable 70 days at the end of the second quarter.  Days' supply fell further to an extremely low level in July as sales were boosted appreciably by the government's so called cash-for-clunkers program (see below for more discussion).

The latest industry schedules call for production to rise substantially in the third quarter, to an annual rate of 6.4 million units, reflecting the resumption of operations at GM and Chrysler and efforts by other automakers to boost assemblies now that inventories have become leaner.   The weekly production data we have received for July point to an 6 appreciable rise in vehicle output.  Production at scheduled levels this quarter should help bring inventories into better balance.

Sales of light motor vehicles edged up in the second quarter, rising for the first time since the recession began.  The improvement in the second quarter coincided with both a decrease in consumers' concerns about tight credit conditions and a rise in the percentage of respondents in the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers noting lower prices and the availability of good deals.

In July, sales of light motor vehicles soared about 1.5 million units, to an annual rate of 11.2 million.   As noted, the surge in demand last month largely resulted from the cash 7 for clunkers program, and the composition of the sales increase was heavily skewed towards automobiles.   The Congress allocated $1 billion to the program under the 8 Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save (or CARS) Act, which was enacted in June. The program-which provides auto dealers with vouchers to be applied against the purchase price of new vehicles after eligible trade-ins-officially began on July 27 and was expected to run through the end of October.   However, the response so dramatically 9 exceeded expectations that all of the vouchers appear to have been exhausted by early August. 10 Although the program is boosting sales significantly, much of that increment in demand appears likely to be borrowed from later in the year.

Consumer Spending

Consumer spending in the first half of this year moved a little lower, on balance, after having fallen sharply in the second half of last year.  The fiscal stimulus package, including lower tax withholdings for workers, one-time payments for retirees, and increased benefits for the unemployed, has provided a noticeable boost to disposable income in the first half of the year but could not overcome the restraint on household purchases from the weak labor market and the substantial earlier declines in net worth. Real PCE edged down 0.1 percent in June after holding steady in May and declining 0.2 percent in April.  Apart from the jump in motor vehicle sales last month, indicators of other spending in July, such as ICSC's weekly chain store sales and MasterCard's estimate of retail sales, were mixed.

The personal saving rate, which had jumped slightly above 6 percent in May, moved back down in June to 4½ percent.  In large part, the recent movements in the saving rate appear to reflect the transitory boost to disposable income from the fiscal stimulus in recent months.  Nonetheless, even after smoothing through the effects of temporary stimulus, the data suggest that households are saving a higher proportion of their income than prior to the recession, as would be expected given the enormous loss of wealth.  Whether a structural shift in the saving function is in process will be difficult to discern for quite a while.

Although the usual determinants of spending remain weak, some of the conditions facing households have generally improved recently.  Household net worth, while still far below its pre-recession levels, is receiving a boost from the rise in equity prices since their low point in March.  In addition, the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) indicates that the amount of additional tightening of conditions and standards for consumer credit has moderated further.  That said, the weak labor market continues to place significant strains on households.  Even though higher transfers and lower taxes led to a significant increase in disposable income in the second quarter, nominal wages and salaries recorded another large decrease last quarter (albeit less than the decrease in the first quarter), and the unemployment rate has continued to rise.  In addition, measures of consumer sentiment recently have retraced a portion of their earlier gains, although they still remain well above levels seen at the turn of the year.

Housing

Data from the housing sector over the past few months indicate that construction activity may finally be emerging from its extended decline.  In June, single-family housing starts registered a sizable increase, and the level of starts stood 30 percent above its record low in the first quarter of this year.  Adjusted permit issuance-which is often a more reliable indicator of the underlying pace of new construction activity-was somewhat below the rate of starts in June but also has generally moved up in recent months.  However, in the much smaller multifamily sector, starts have continued to decline, on net, this year after having plunged in the second half of 2008 amid tight credit conditions and rapidly deteriorating demand fundamentals for apartment buildings.

The latest sales data suggest that new housing demand may also be strengthening after having stabilized in the early portion of this year.  The Census Bureau's measure of the number of new-home sales agreements jumped to an annual rate of 384,000 units in June, an increase of 17 percent from the record low in January.

.  Although sales levels still remain quite modest, they have been enough, given the very slow pace of production, to pare the overhang of unsold single-family houses:  In June, these inventories stood at about one-half of their peak in the summer of 2006, and the months' supply of new homes was down considerably from its record high in January.

Sales of existing single-family houses, which had been fairly flat early in the year, posted their third consecutive monthly increase in June, and pending home sales agreements through June suggest that resale activity will ascend further in the months ahead. 11 To be sure, the existing-home market has been supported for much of the year by heightened volumes of transactions involving bank-owned and other distressed properties, which reportedly accounted for about 40 to 45 percent of all sales transactions between December and April-roughly double their share over the same period in the preceding year. 12 More recently, however, estimates from the National Association of Realtors indicate that distressed sales dropped to one-third of existing-home transactions in May and June; this development suggests that the most recent uptick in resales has been driven by an increase in transactions of nondistressed properties.  Meanwhile, though foreclosure activity has been very elevated for some time now, existing-home inventories have been on a downward trajectory (both in levels and in relation to sales) since early 2008. 13

The apparent stabilization in housing demand seen in recent months is likely due, in part, to improvements in housing affordability stemming from low rates for conforming mortgages and lower house prices.  Even though the market for private-label nonprime mortgages remains closed, rates for conforming 30-year fixed-rate mortgages-at about 5¼ percent-remain very low by historical standards, and spreads between rates for

jumbo and standard conforming loans have continued to narrow in recent months (even if they remain elevated relative to pre-crisis norms).  As for house prices, the repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance fell 9¼ percent over the 12 months ending in May, a somewhat slower rate of decrease than over the preceding 12-month period. 14 Although the declines in house prices over the past several years have been good for affordability, that positive influence appears still to be tempered to a degree by the sizable number of potential homebuyers who remain hesitant to purchase houses for fear of additional price declines.

Equipment and Software

Real investment in equipment and software (E&amp;S) continued to contract sharply in the second quarter, although the estimated 8¼ percent annual rate of decline was substantially smaller than in the previous two quarters.  The moderation in the rate of decrease in E&amp;S spending resulted from a flattening in business purchases of motor vehicles and a slower rate of decline elsewhere.

Business outlays on motor vehicles leveled off in the second quarter after an extended period of steep declines.  Medium and heavy truck sales increased in both May and June. However, both truck sales and orders remain extremely depressed.  Deliveries to rental car companies dropped in May and June but rebounded some last month. 15 Demand for light vehicles from other businesses moved sideways last quarter-albeit at a very low level-and increased a fair bit in July.

In the high-tech sector, real spending declined, on balance, in the second quarter, though with mixed results across components.  Real outlays on computers and peripheral equipment edged up at an annual rate of about 5 percent in the second quarter, the first increase since a year ago.  However, the BEA estimates that business spending on software continued to fall in the second quarter, at an annual rate of 12½ percent.  As for forward-looking indicators, orders for high-tech equipment were up, on balance, in recent months from their low point in the first quarter, but the NABE index of capital spending plans for computers and communications equipment remained at a low level in July.

Outside of high-tech and transportation, real spending on equipment dropped again in the second quarter but at a less precipitous pace than in the previous quarter.  Although orders in June remained below shipments in this category, the gap has closed somewhat, implying a slower rate of decline in firms' backlogs of unfilled orders and suggesting somewhat diminished downward pressure on shipments in coming months.

Although the fundamental determinants of investment in E&amp;S remain weak, conditions appear less unfavorable, on balance, than earlier in the year.  In particular, the decline in business output was less pronounced last quarter than in prior quarters, and the user cost of capital fell back somewhat in the second quarter after spiking last year.  Other forward-looking indicators have generally improved recently, but they remain at levels consistent with a weak outlook for E&amp;S investment.  Corporate bond spreads over Treasury securities have continued to ease, and monthly surveys of business conditions and sentiment generally have been less downbeat than earlier in the year.  In addition, the July SLOOS reported that the net percentage of banks that tightened on commercial and industrial loans receded somewhat, although the share of small businesses reporting increased difficulty in obtaining credit remained quite high in the June NFIB survey.

Nonresidential Construction

Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector generally remain dismal, with spending in most major categories remaining on a downward trajectory through June. While real spending excluding drilling and mining moved up somewhat in the second quarter, this increase came on the heels of significant declines over the preceding two quarters and was driven almost entirely by energy-related projects (such as new electricity generation facilities and refinery expansions), which surged noticeably in the second quarter.  Apart from this pocket of strength, construction activity continues to be under downward pressure from a slew of negative fundamentals:  Available data show that vacancy rates are rising and that property prices are generally plunging across sectors.  In addition, measures of architectural billings through June remained at levels consistent with further spending declines, and the nonresidential construction industry has continued to shed workers.  Finally, as indicated by the July SLOOS, the financing environment for nonresidential construction projects remains very tight, and available Call Report data from the first quarter show that banks are paring back nonresidential construction lending.

Real spending on drilling and mining structures dropped at an annual rate of 70 percent in the second quarter after an even larger decline in the first quarter; available indicators suggest that activity has tracked sideways at a low level in recent weeks.  The steep net

decline in energy prices from last summer's peak has greatly diminished incentives for additional drilling activity.  This downward pressure has been particularly pronounced in the natural gas sector, as spot prices have remained near a seven-year low because of weak demand and a glut of new supply from recently developed fields.

Business Inventories

The sharp cuts in production this year have reduced inventory stocks significantly, though stocks remain high relative to the weak level of sales.  In the second quarter, real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles are estimated to have fallen at an annual rate of $102 billion following a decline of $51 billion in the first quarter. 16 Similarly, the staff's flow-of-goods (FOG) inventory system indicates a considerable reduction in inventories last quarter.  Nonetheless, both the Census and FOG system measures of months' supply remain high, suggesting that further inventory cuts are in store if sales remain near their current pace.  However, the ISM's index of customers' inventories moved further into favorable territory in July; this reading hints at more-modest declines in inventory stocks going forward.

Federal Government Sector

The deficit in the federal unified budget deteriorated further in June.  The budget costs associated with the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), the conservatorship of the mortgage-related GSEs, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), and the effects of the recession on revenues and outlays have all contributed to the continued widening of the budget gap.  The deficit for the 12 months ending in June totaled almost $1.3 trillion, about $1 trillion larger than in the same period a year earlier.

Federal outlays, adjusted for payment-timing shifts and excluding financial transactions such as those related to the TARP and the GSE conservatorship, were 10 percent higher in the April-June period than a year earlier.  The surge in these outlays has primarily reflected an increase in stimulus-related spending and the rise in income-support payments as labor market conditions have deteriorated. 17 Notably, outlays for regular unemployment insurance benefits have soared, and payments for the temporary EUC program have been greater than anticipated last winter when the program was expanded.

In addition, the stimulus package has boosted federal aid to state and local governments. As measured in the NIPA, real federal expenditures increased at an annual rate of 11 percent in the second quarter, largely reflecting a sharp rebound in defense purchases from a relatively low level in the first quarter.

Receipts in the April-June period dropped 24 percent relative to a year earlier as economic activity declined. 18 Individual income and payroll taxes fell 20 percent, mostly reflecting the decrease in wages and salaries and the likely lower capital gains realizations.  Corporate income taxes were substantially lower than a year earlier, as corporate profits have fallen.

State and Local Government Sector

Real purchases by state and local governments rose at a relatively robust pace in the second quarter.  Following sharp drop-offs in the previous two quarters, real investment spending rebounded in the second quarter, increasing at an estimated annual rate of about 18 percent.  This substantial boost in spending is likely attributable to a number of factors, including anticipatory spending of stimulus funds, easing of credit conditions in the municipal bond market, and significant reductions in construction costs. 19 However, these data are very volatile, and some of this strength may be reversed in coming months. Hiring by state and local governments continues to be lackluster.  Employment gains in the second quarter averaged 4,000 per month, significantly below the average of roughly 16,000 per month in the previous five years.

According to the Census Bureau, state tax revenues continued to plummet in the first quarter, falling about 12 percent relative to a year earlier.  The declines were widespread, with 45 out of 50 states experiencing a drop in revenue.  The falloff in state revenueswhich was sharper than states expected-has left many states scrambling to close budget shortfalls for the current fiscal year.  For example, the California legislature recently approved a package to help close the estimated $26 billion budget shortfall that had opened up for the current fiscal year after having already implemented substantial budget cuts and tax increases in February.

Prices

Overall PCE prices moved up 0.5 percent in June following little change in each of the previous three months.  The June pickup reflected a sizable jump in gasoline prices, stemming from the earlier increases in crude oil prices.  Over the 12 months ending in June, headline consumer prices declined about ½ percent, compared with a rise of about 4 percent over the year-earlier period.  Excluding food and energy, PCE prices increased 0.2 percent in June; over the past 12 months, these prices have risen 1½ percent. 20

Although energy prices jumped in June, the latest available survey data show that gasoline prices essentially flattened out in July.  With crude oil prices up from their

average in June and July, retail gasoline prices are likely to rise somewhat over the next couple of months.  Spot prices for natural gas have leveled out in recent months after plunging to very low levels this spring, and retail prices for natural gas increased slightly in June following large declines in the first five months of this year.  Consumer prices for electricity continued to fall in June, as earlier declines in fossil fuel input costs have continued to pass through to electricity rates.

We estimate that PCE food prices flattened out in June after having fallen for five consecutive months, a pattern suggesting that the pass-through from the dramatic downturn in spot prices of farm products in the second half of last year may now be complete. 21 Spot prices for a wide variety of farm products moved up noticeably in the earlier part of this year, but many have retreated, on balance, over the past two months. Futures prices, however, continue to point to increases in farm prices over the rest of the year.

Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose at an annual rate of about 1¾ percent in the first half of this year.  This pace reflects the net effect of a number of factors.  Low readings on nonmarket price inflation apparently pushed down core PCE price inflation significantly around the turn of the year.  But the tax-related hike in tobacco prices this spring boosted core inflation noticeably.  In recent months, nonmarket prices have no longer been pushing down core inflation, and tobacco prices have changed little.  Both the overall index of core PCE prices and its market-based component rose 0.1 percent in May and 0.2 percent in June.

Nearly all of the broad measures of inflation have slowed over the past four quarters. Headline PCE prices in the second quarter were slightly lower than a year earlier, compared with a rise of 3¾ percent in the four quarters ending in the second quarter of last year, and core PCE inflation stepped down from 2½ percent to 1½ percent.  The price index for gross domestic purchases has decelerated considerably-by an amount similar to that for overall PCE prices-whereas changes in GDP prices, which exclude the price of imported oil, have slowed by less over the past year.

Median year-ahead inflation expectations in the Reuters/Michigan survey, which stood at 2.9 percent in the final July survey, have been holding relatively steady in recent months after bouncing back from about 2 percent around the turn of the year.  Longer-term expectations stood at 3.0 percent in July, about the same as the average over 2008.

At earlier stages of processing, the PPI for core intermediate materials turned up in June following a string of monthly declines that likely reflected pass-through from the large declines in spot commodity prices in the second half of last year.  Commodity prices rebounded considerably over the first six months of this year, and they have increased noticeably further since the June Greenbook.  In particular, the CRB index of spot industrial prices has risen about 10 percent since the middle of June, and the Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has increased about 12½ percent.  Price increases have been widespread for industrial materials, with particularly large increases for prices of metals.

Labor Costs

All of our measures of hourly compensation and wages suggest that labor costs have decelerated sharply this year in response to the considerable deterioration in labor market conditions.  The ECI for private industry workers increased at an annual rate of only ¾ percent in the first half of 2009 after having risen nearly 2½ percent in 2008.  The slowdown was broadly similar for both the wages and the benefits components of the index, with the step-down in benefits primarily reflecting a large drop in nonproduction bonuses. 22 After incorporating sizable changes to the wages and salary data in the comprehensive revision to the NIPA, we currently estimate that P&amp;C hourly compensation in the nonfarm business sector fell at an annual rate of 1¾ percent in the first half of 2009 after having risen 2½ percent in 2008; if these estimates prove accurate, the decline in the first half of this year would be the largest drop in nominal compensation on record. 23

Appendix

Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts

The comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA) was released on July 31.  The revision reflected the incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of more-comprehensive source data as well as some changes in methodology and definitions. 1

The most notable revision is that the four-quarter change in real GDP was revised down by 1 percentage point in 2008, to 1.9 percent, and by nearly another 1 percentage point at an annual rate in 2009:Q1, to negative 6.4 percent.  These downward revisions occurred in a variety of expenditure categories, with the largest contributions coming from personal consumption expenditures, net exports, and inventory investment.  Revisions to the rates of change in real GDP in the preceding few years were small.   The recent revisions make the recession look somewhat 2 deeper than before, and they help reduce (but not eliminate) the tension between the published declines in real GDP and the labor market data.  The revisions also leave the change in GDP in 2008 closer to that year's change in gross domestic income (GDI), though the change in GDI was also revised down in earlier years such that, on net, the statistical discrepancy was about unrevised in the first quarter.

The change in real disposable personal income (DPI) was also revised downward over the past two years and especially in the first quarter, as new source data pointed to considerably greater weakness in both employee compensation and household receipts of dividend income.  In the 1990s, however, real DPI is now estimated to have been substantially higher, reflecting new estimates of unreported proprietors' income, rental income, and the cost of so-called cafeteria benefits plans; this higher level of income carried forward.  Thus, the personal saving rate was revised up about 1 percentage point, on average, from the mid-1990s through 2007.  More recently, however, the downward revision to the change in real DPI was greater than the downward revision to real PCE, and the saving rate is now reported to have increased less over the past year than before; indeed, the saving rate was revised down slightly in 2009:Q1.  The level of corporate profits was also revised downward over the past few years, and the profit share of GNP is now about 1 percentage point lower than before.

Given these new data, we now estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose 1 percent during 2008, a downward revision of about 1¼ percentage points.  In addition, we estimate that the change in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector will be revised

down sharply to an increase of only 2½ percent in 2008 and to a decline of 2½ percent at an annual rate in 2009:Q1.  With these revisions, compensation per hour now shows a clear and substantial deceleration over the past year, and we estimate that unit labor costs will be reported to have declined over the past year.

The BEA's changes to its price indexes were generally small.  PCE inflation was revised down in 2008 and again in the first quarter of 2009, primarily reflecting new estimates for the change in the nonmarket component of prices.  Core PCE prices were affected by a change in definition, as restaurant meals are now included in core prices; core PCE price inflation generally revised slightly higher with this new definition.  However, despite the definitional change, core PCE inflation is now estimated to have been lower in the first quarter because of new lower estimates of the change in nonmarket prices.  The market-based component of core PCE prices underwent a more substantial change in definition (involving the treatment of hospitals and other nonprofit institutions), and the change in these prices was revised up about ¼ percentage point per year, on average, over history.  Note that these definitional changes to core PCE and market-based PCE did not affect overall PCE prices. 3

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Conditions in financial markets showed signs of continued improvement over the intermeeting period, as risk premiums generally narrowed and the functioning of shortterm funding markets improved a bit.  Broad stock price indexes rose about 13 percent, reflecting strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy is stabilizing.  Bank equity prices rose in line with the broader indexes.  Both the expected path of the funds rate as well as nominal Treasury yields were little changed over the period, while near-term inflation compensation fell slightly.  Spreads on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds narrowed further and are now a bit below their peak levels following the 2001 recession.  The spread over Treasury yields of the rates on conforming fixed-rate mortgages and adjustable-rate mortgages declined, but the latter remained elevated.

Bond and equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations slowed in July, and outstanding bank loans to households and nonfinancial businesses continued to decline.  The available indicators suggest that household credit quality deteriorated further in recent months, while indicators of business credit quality were mixed.  The July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices indicated that demand weakened and banks continued to tighten standards and terms on all major loan categories, although the net percentages of banks doing so declined further.

Treasury Yields and Policy Expectations

The expected path of the funds rate derived from futures quotes was little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Investors initially marked up their policy expectations following the release of the June FOMC statement as they apparently interpreted the statement as suggesting a more favorable assessment of growth prospects than had been anticipated.  However, investors marked down the expected policy path after the June employment report and the Chairman's semiannual monetary policy testimony.  Market participants reportedly took note of the comments indicating that monetary policy would be highly accommodative for an extended period and seemed more confident that the FOMC had the tools necessary to withdraw policy accommodation in a smooth and timely manner when needed.  With our standard term premium assumptions, futures quotes indicate that market participants continue to expect the onset of policy tightening in the first quarter of 2010.  However, none of the respondents to the August primary dealer survey expect a rate increase before the second quarter of 2010.

Yields on nominal Treasury securities were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period, despite sizeable intraday movements in response to macroeconomic data releases and Federal Reserve communications.  The June employment report sent yields lower, while the stronger-than-expected reports on housing starts and manufacturing activity precipitated rate increases.  Option-implied volatility on 10-year Treasury yields remained high, although it declined somewhat on balance.

Five-year TIPS-based inflation compensation declined about 15 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period, while five-year inflation compensation five years ahead increased about 25 basis points.  Changes in survey-based measures of inflation expectations were mixed.

Financial Institutions

Investor sentiment toward the financial sector improved further over the intermeeting period, boosted, in part, by second-quarter earnings results that were generally better than expected at larger banking institutions.  Bank equity prices rose about 17 percent over the period, and CDS spreads on financial firms declined.  Nonetheless, some investors commented that the positive upside surprises at large financial institutions were mostly related to investment banking and trading activities, which are less prominent sources of revenue at smaller or regional institutions, and mortgage refinancing activity, which may recede if longer-term rates rise.  Market participants also focused on the large consumer loan losses reported by many banks.

The financial condition of CIT Group, Inc., one of the largest lenders to middle-market firms, worsened sharply over the period.  After failing to receive government support, CIT obtained $3 billion in private financing on July 20 from some of its largest existing bondholders.   While reports suggest that CIT has averted a near-term funding crisis, prices of CDS contracts on CIT indicate that the risk of bankruptcy continues to be very high.  Broader conditions in financial markets have to date remained largely unaffected by these developments.

Short-Term Funding Markets

Functioning in short-term funding markets generally showed further improvement over the intermeeting period.  Consistent with a reduction in concerns about the financial condition of large banking institutions, Libor rates continued to edge down.  Three- and six-month Libor-OIS spreads-while still somewhat elevated by historical standardsdeclined a bit further and stand at levels last recorded in early 2008.  The changes to

Regulation D that became effective on July 2 appeared to have only a small effect on trading in the overnight federal funds market.

Bid-asked spreads for most types of repurchase agreements ticked down.  Since the June Greenbook, spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP were little changed, on net, remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past two years. Outstanding commercial paper in the CPFF declined from roughly $110 billion to $60 billion in July, as only 40 percent of the volume of maturing paper coming due was rolled back into the facility.

Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities

Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserve assets remained around $2 trillion, as an increase in securities held roughly offset declines in funds supplied under credit and liquidity facilities.  Around $59 billion in Treasury securities was purchased, including $1.5 billion in TIPS, bringing the total amount of purchases to about $227 billion. Further, the Federal Reserve purchased about $12 billion in agency debt and about $124 billion in agency MBS.  Market commentary and the results of the August primary dealer survey suggest that investors expect no modifications to Federal Reserve purchase programs at the upcoming FOMC meeting.

On June 25, the Federal Reserve announced extensions of and modifications to a number of its liquidity programs.   Reaction in financial markets to the announcement was muted, 1 and participation in these facilities generally continued to decline over the intermeeting period.  TALF loans backed by asset-backed securities totaled $5.4 billion in July, and loans backed by legacy commercial mortgage-backed securities equaled $636 million. No requests for loans to finance new-issue CMBS were submitted.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock price indexes rose about 13 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period, as investors responded to strong second-quarter earnings reports and indications that the economy may be stabilizing.  The spread between the staff's estimate of the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms and an estimate of the real 10-year Treasury yield-a gauge of the equity risk premium-narrowed a bit but remained high by recent historical standards.  Option-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index also declined a bit further.

Over the intermeeting period, yields on BBB-rated and speculative-grade corporate bonds declined about 80 and 140 basis points, respectively.  As a result, corporate bond spreads narrowed further and are now below the peak levels reached in 2002 following the previous recession.  Excluding effects related to CIT, staff estimates of bid-asked spreads for both investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds were little changed. Conditions in the leveraged loan market continued to improve as secondary-market prices rose further and bid-asked spreads narrowed.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With most reports in hand and analyst estimates for the rest, operating earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 firms in the second quarter are estimated to have come in about 25 percent below year-earlier levels, less negative than first-quarter growth. The four-quarter rate of decline for nonfinancial firms in the index also appears to have turned up.  In addition, the data suggest that, on a nonseasonally adjusted quarter-over-quarter basis, operating earnings rose substantially in the second quarter, for both nonfinancial as well as financial constituents.  Moreover, both the financial and nonfinancial reports were substantially stronger than market participants had expected, with about three-fourths of the reports exceeding analysts' expectations-a high share by historical standards.  The magnitude of the positive surprises was also large.  In contrast, reported revenues were close to analyst estimates on average, an indication that the earnings news primarily reflects larger-than-anticipated cost reductions.  Companies' guidance about future earnings has been neutral overall, and an index of revisions to analysts' forecasts of yearahead earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms turned slightly positive over the past two months after having been deeply negative for more than a year.

Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms were mixed.  The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations rose in the first quarter, as did the aggregate liquid asset ratio.  Moody's ratings downgrades of corporate bonds of nonfinancial

companies continued to substantially outpace upgrades in the second quarter, but the pace of deterioration moderated some from that observed in the first quarter.  The expected default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody's KMV dropped in July to about one-half of its peak level earlier in the year, as stock price gains translated into higher estimated asset values and lower leverage. The six-month trailing bond default rate ticked up in June with the default of General Motors.

Business Finance

Gross speculative-grade and investment-grade bond issuance by nonfinancial corporations slowed in July from its outsized second-quarter pace.  Issuance of institutional loans in the syndicated leveraged loan market reportedly continued to be extremely weak.  Meanwhile, bank loans and commercial paper continued to run off, leaving net debt financing by nonfinancial corporations at around zero.

The pace of gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms, both from seasoned and initial-public offerings, slowed in July following a very robust second quarter.  Equity retirements from cash-financed mergers and estimated share repurchases were modest in the first quarter and outpaced by issuance.  As a result, net equity issuance in the first quarter was positive for the first time since 2002.  In the second quarter, announcements of mergers and acquisitions and new share repurchase programs remained weak. Equity issuance by financial firms slowed to a trickle in July after ballooning in the second quarter, when banks raised most of the equity capital required by the SCAP and many other financial institutions sold additional shares.  Financial bond issuance was solid, with only about 20 percent issued under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate markets have remained under considerable strain.  Outstanding commercial mortgage debt was roughly flat in the first quarter, the weakest performance since 1995, and bank balance sheet data point to a further contraction in the second quarter.  Sales of commercial properties continued to drop in the second quarter, with the monthly average now at levels last seen at the beginning of this decade. Moreover, nearly 40 percent of properties were sold at a nominal loss.  Commercial real estate prices dropped again in May and June, leaving the price indexes about one-third lower than their peak levels in 2007.  The delinquency rate on securitized commercial mortgages shot up further in June from its already elevated level in May, in part owing to the bankruptcy of General Growth Properties.

III-11

Commercial mortgage CDS spreads narrowed over the intermeeting period, primarily in response to two policy actions and announcements.  The first CMBS subscription in TALF, though small in size, apparently reduced the uncertainty regarding the criteria the Federal Reserve would apply to reject legacy CMBS.  In addition, the announcement that the Public-Private Investment Program would finance investment in AAA-rated CMBS bonds that had been downgraded and thus were ineligible for legacy TALF financing reportedly helped mitigate much of the negative effects of recent downgrades by rating agencies.

Household Finance

The rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages dropped back below 5½ percent over the intermeeting period, with its spread to the 10-year Treasury yield narrowing slightly.  The spread of the yield on the 5/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) over the 2-year Treasury yield declined but remained elevated.  Issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs was about the same in May as in April.  MBS issuance by Ginnie Mae grew slightly in May, while the private-label MBS market remained shuttered.

Home prices showed some signs of stabilization in April and May.  The Federal Housing Finance Agency index and the LoanPerformance national index dropped 6 percent and 9 percent, respectively, over the year ending in May, while the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller 20-city index posted a decline of 17 percent over the same period.  Monthly readings on the LoanPerformance index actually increased in March, April, and May, though the monthly data are particularly noisy and subject to large revisions.  Delinquency rates of both prime and subprime mortgages continued to rise.

Issuance of consumer ABS has reached its pre-crisis levels, mainly driven by TALFfinanced issues.  Spreads on AAA-rated ABS were about unchanged over the intermeeting period and remained well below their peaks at the end of 2008.  Interest rates on new auto loans were about flat in the second quarter at levels well below those seen earlier this year, and interest rates on credit cards were little changed in May. Delinquency rates on auto loans at captive finance companies rose a little in April and May; delinquency rates on credit card loans were little changed over the same period and remain near their highest levels in more than a decade.

Possibly reflecting an improvement in risk appetites-and perhaps stimulated by recent outsized returns-long-term mutual funds, particularly bond funds, attracted considerable

Treasury and Agency Finance

Over the intermeeting period, ten auctions of Treasury securities totaling $252 billion were held.  Although the auctions were for record amounts, they were generally well received early in the intermeeting period, with bid-to-cover ratios near or above recent levels.  Foreign demand at these auctions also appeared solid.  However, auctions for the two- and five-year notes during the week of July 27 were met with tepid demand.  In its midquarter refunding announcement, the Treasury indicated that its financing needs likely would require gradually increasing auction sizes and making potential changes in the auction calendar and in the range of benchmark securities offered.  The Treasury also indicated that TIPS issuance would likely increase in fiscal year 2010 and that it is considering replacing the 20-year TIPS with a 30-year TIPS.  Changes to the TIPS program will be announced in November.  Finally, the Treasury noted that it expects to reach the debt ceiling in the last quarter of this calendar year.

Indicators of Treasury market functioning were little changed over the intermeeting period, and functioning continues to be somewhat impaired.  However, fitting errors from the staff's nominal yield curve model continued to shrink and are now at levels similar to those seen in early 2008, pointing to improved market performance.  Bid-asked spreads held roughly steady, and trading volumes remain low.  The staff's measure of the on-therun liquidity premium for the 10-year Treasury note was little changed at elevated levels, although well below its peak last fall.

Auctions of agency debt were generally well received during the intermeeting period. The spread between yields on senior and subordinated agency debt narrowed significantly following the announcement by Freddie Mac that it would be tendering offers for all of its outstanding subordinated debt.  On July 20, Freddie Mac announced the pricing of the tender offers and reported that it tendered nearly $3.9 billion of its $4.4 billion of outstanding subordinated debt.  Market participants reportedly expect Fannie Mae to follow suit by buying back its subordinated debt.

State and Local Government Finance

Conditions in the municipal bond market were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds was solid in July, mostly driven by the strength in new capital issuance.  Short-term issuance was moderate, consistent with

typical seasonal patterns.  Yields on long-term municipal bonds were little changed over the intermeeting period, as were their ratios to yields on comparable-maturity Treasury securities.  Rating upgrades in the second quarter continued to outpace downgrades, as rating agencies continued to implement changes to the rating scale for municipal credits toward the more lenient corporate scale.  On July 14, Moody's lowered California's credit rating from A2 to Baa1. However, on July 24, the state reached a deal to close its $26 billion budget gap, alleviating concern of near-term further deterioration of the state's credit quality.  Investors reportedly remain concerned about the state's longer-term budget.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 increased slightly, on net, over the past two months.  Retail money market mutual funds and small time deposits dropped sharply in June and are estimated to have contracted again in July, likely reflecting the very low rates of interest on these assets and a continued reallocation of wealth toward riskier assets.  These declines were partly offset by net growth of liquid deposits, suggesting some portfolio reallocation within M2 assets as well.  Currency growth was also weak, on balance, which reportedly reflects soft foreign demand with global economic conditions stabilizing.  The monetary base declined appreciably in June and July because of a reduction in use of liquidity and credit facilities that more than offset continued large-scale asset purchases.

Commercial bank credit contracted further in June and July, as all major loan categories declined.  Core loans fell at an 8¾ percent pace, on average, reflecting weaker demand for most types of loans, some substitution from bank loans to other funding sources, and an ongoing tightening of lending standards and terms.  C&amp;I loans dropped steeply amid subdued origination activity and broad-based paydowns of outstanding loans.  In the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, respondents indicated that the most important reasons for the decline in C&amp;I loans this year were weaker demand from creditworthy borrowers and the deterioration in credit quality that has reduced the number of firms that respondents viewed as creditworthy.  The contraction in commercial real estate lending accelerated, as large fractions of respondents in the July survey again noted tighter standards.  While that fraction was down somewhat from the April survey, it remained higher than the fraction for any other loan category aside from nontraditional mortgages.

Regarding lending to households, residential real estate loans are estimated to have contracted in July for the fourth straight month, in part because of a continued rapid pace of securitizations and loan sales to the GSEs.  The contraction in home equity lending

steepened in June and July, likely owing in part to further reductions in the credit lines of existing customers over the past few months, as indicated in the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  The stock of consumer loans originated by banks continued to shrink at a moderate pace in June and July, while on-balance-sheet holdings decreased more rapidly.  The decline in consumer loans is consistent with weaker demand and some further tightening of standards and terms.

Appendix

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices

The July 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also included two sets of special questions:  The first set asked banks to rank the causes of declines this year in commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) lending, and the second set asked banks about their expectations for lending standards relative to norms over the past decade. This appendix is based on responses from 55 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. 1

In the July survey, domestic banks indicated that they continued to tighten standards and terms over the past three months on all major types of loans to businesses and households, although the net percentages of banks that tightened declined compared to the April survey.   Demand for 2 loans continued to weaken across all major categories except for prime residential mortgages. The fraction of domestic banks reporting additional weakening in demand in this survey was slightly less than in the April survey for C&amp;I loans and home equity lines of credit, approximately the same for commercial real estate (CRE) and nontraditional residential mortgages, and slightly more for consumer loans.

In response to a special question on the sources of decline in C&amp;I lending this year, domestic banks ranked decreased loan demand and deteriorating credit quality as the most important sources.  In response to a second special question, most banks expected their lending standards to remain tighter than average across all lending categories until at least the second half of 2010; for below-investment-grade firms and nonprime households, the expected timing is later, with many banks reporting that standards for such borrowers will remain tighter than average for the foreseeable future.  On balance, the largest banks generally expected lending standards to remain stringent for longer than other banks.

Lending to Businesses

Questions on commercial and industrial lending. About 30 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported tightening standards on C&amp;I loans to large firms.  That percentage is roughly

10 percentage points lower than in the April survey, continuing the declining trend that began after the measure reached a peak of roughly 85 percent in the November 2008 survey.  Standards on C&amp;I loans to small firms were reported as having been tightened by a net fraction of about 35 percent of domestic respondents, down from above 40 percent in April and 70 percent in January.

Tightening of the various terms on C&amp;I loans by domestic respondents continued, but, in general, the net fractions that reported tightening continued to fall from their highs in late 2008. Approximately 60 percent, on net, reported increasing spreads of loan rates for large firms, compared with 80 percent in April.  For small firms, about 65 percent reported increasing spreads, compared with 75 percent in April.  These movements contrast with the narrowing in corporate bond spreads over the same period.  Significant net fractions of respondents continued to report tightening of other price terms on loans to firms of all sizes; in particular, the costs of credit lines and premiums charged on riskier loans were reported as having been tightened by net fractions in excess of 50 percent of respondents.

U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks also reported tightening their business lending stance further over the past three months.  For C&amp;I lending, the net percentage that reported having done so was again lower than in the previous survey.  About 15 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported tightening credit standards for C&amp;I loans, compared with 30 percent in April and 65 percent in January.  Regarding lending terms, about 30 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported increasing the costs of credit lines, compared with 65 percent in April.  The net percentage of foreign respondents that reported increasing premiums on riskier loans was 30 percent, down from 70 percent in April.  In addition, about 15 percent of foreign banks reported increasing the spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds, down from about 60 percent in April.

The predominant reasons banks gave for tightening credit standards or terms for C&amp;I loans resembled those reported in the previous two surveys.  Both domestic and foreign respondents nearly unanimously cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook and large majorities cited a reduced tolerance for risk.  Domestic respondents also widely noted a worsening of industry-specific problems, while foreign respondents were more likely to cite an increase in defaults by borrowers in public debt markets, as well as deterioration in their banks' current or expected capital positions.  The net fraction of foreign banks reporting concern over decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&amp;I loans fell substantially to 30 percent from about 70 percent in the April survey.

Considerable net fractions of domestic respondents again reported weaker demand for C&amp;I loans from firms of all sizes.  About 45 percent of domestic respondents reported weaker demand for C&amp;I loans to large firms, on net, and 55 percent indicated weaker demand from small firms; these figures are somewhat lower than the April figures of 60 and 65 percent for large and small firms,

respectively.  About one-fourth of reporting foreign banks, on net, indicated weaker demand for C&amp;I loans, in contrast to the April survey, in which these banks reported that demand was about unchanged, on net.

Both foreign and domestic respondents unanimously cited a decreased financing need by customers for investment in plant or equipment as a reason for weaker demand for C&amp;I loans over the past three months. The other predominant reasons for weaker demand included decreases in the need to finance inventories, accounts receivable, and mergers or acquisitions.  On net, about 25 percent of domestic banks reported that inquiries from potential business borrowers had declined during the survey period, slightly less than was reported in April.  A little more than 15 percent of foreign banks reported a decline in such inquiries, an increase from the April survey.

Special Question on Commercial and Industrial Lending

The July survey included a special question on C&amp;I lending.  To gather information about the effects of supply and demand in the market for C&amp;I loans, the survey asked banks to rank the relative importance of five potential sources of the decline in C&amp;I lending this year.  According to domestic banks, the most important factor, on average, was lower loan demand from creditworthy borrowers because their funding needs have declined, followed by deteriorating credit quality of potential borrowers.  Foreign banks, in contrast, ranked lower loan demand due to reduced funding needs third, and listed deteriorating credit quality as the most important reason, followed by tighter bank lending standards.  Despite strong corporate bond issuance over the past few months and improved functioning in the commercial paper markets, both domestic and foreign banks indicated that one of the least two important factors (among those listed on the survey) was the availability of other sources of funding.  Respondents also indicated that higher spreads and fees were relatively unimportant.

Questions on commercial real estate lending. The fraction of domestic respondents that reported tightening standards on CRE loans fell to about 45 percent, compared with 65 percent in April.  Still, this fraction is higher than that reported for C&amp;I loans and all consumer lending categories except nontraditional residential mortgages.  About 45 percent of foreign banks also reported tightening standards on CRE loans, a slight increase from the figure reported in April. The net percentage of domestic respondents that reported weaker demand for CRE loans fell slightly to roughly 65 percent, but it remained large by historical standards and relative to other loan categories.  About 45 percent of foreign respondents also reported weaker demand, a slight increase from the April survey.

resumed declining from its peak level of about 75 percent one year ago.  The measure fell approximately 25 percentage points in this survey to roughly 20 percent.  For the second consecutive survey, domestic banks reported increased demand from prime borrowers for residential mortgages; however, consistent with the recent reduction in refinancing activity, the net fraction fell to 15 percent from 35 percent in April.   The net fraction of respondents that 3 tightened standards on nontraditional residential mortgages fell to roughly 45 percent from 65 percent in April.  The net fraction that reported weaker demand for such mortgages was little changed at around 15 percent.

The net fraction of domestic banks that reported tightening their lending standards on home equity lines of credit fell to roughly 30 percent from 50 percent in the April survey, and the fraction of banks reporting weaker demand for home equity lines of credit decreased to about 15 percent from 30 percent in the April survey.

Questions on consumer lending .  For the second consecutive survey, domestic banks reported little change in their willingness to make consumer installment loans. The net fraction of domestic banks that reported tighter credit card lending standards fell significantly from nearly 60 percent to around 35 percent.  Similarly, the net fraction of domestic banks that reported tighter standards on consumer loans other than credit cards declined to 35 percent from 45 percent in April.  For both credit card and other consumer loans, domestic banks continued to report tightening of loan terms and conditions, although the net fractions of banks that tightened were not as high as in April. The net fraction of domestic banks reporting weaker demand for all types of consumer loans rose a few percentage points to about 20 percent.

Questions on existing credit lines. As in the April survey, significant net fractions of respondents reported decreasing the sizes of credit lines for existing customers on all types of business and consumer accounts surveyed.  Nevertheless, these net percentages edged down for all categories of credit lines.

Special Questions on the Levels of Lending Standards

A set of special questions asked domestic banks about the level of their current lending standards relative to the average level over the past decade (longer-term average) and about their expectations for this relative level in the future.   Most of the recurring survey questions ask banks about changes in the levels of their lending standards over the past three months rather than about the levels of their lending standards.  Because recent survey responses have indicated widespread tightening of standards, these special questions were intended to elicit information about whether banks have responded to the current economic downturn by pushing the level of

their lending standards above the longer-term average and, if so, whether the elevated level of standards is expected to persist for some time.

For C&amp;I loans to investment-grade firms, 50 percent of the respondents reported that their standards were tighter than the longer-term average but were expected to return to average levels by the end of 2010 or earlier.  In addition, 25 percent of respondents indicated that standards on investment-grade C&amp;I loans were not tighter than the longer-term average.  Around 20 percent of respondents indicated that they expected C&amp;I lending standards for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade C&amp;I loans to remain tighter than their longer-term average for the foreseeable future.  When weighted by outstanding C&amp;I loan amounts on banks' books, this measure rose to nearly 25 percent for both credit quality classifications. 4

With respect to CRE lending standards, nearly all banks indicated that current standards were tighter than their longer-term average levels.  Around 40 percent expected standards to return to longer-term average levels by the second half of 2010 or in 2011 for both investment-grade and non-investment-grade lending.  However, 40 percent indicated that standards for investmentgrade CRE lending would remain tighter than their longer-term average levels into the foreseeable future, and about 55 percent expected this outcome for non-investment-grade CRE loans.

For prime residential real estate lending (including home equity lines of credit), of the respondents that reported that standards were currently tighter than longer-term average levels, about one-half expected standards to return to those levels by the end of 2011, with most of those expecting a return by the second half of 2010.  When weighted by residential real estate loans on banks' books, however, the fraction that indicated standards would indefinitely remain tighter than their longer-term average levels rose from less than one-half to more than three-fourths.  The comparable measure for nonprime standards was about 60 percent unweighted, and about 80 percent when weighted.

With respect to prime credit card borrowers, in the unweighted analysis, roughly one-third of respondents expected standards to remain tighter that their longer-term average levels for the foreseeable future, while one-fourth expected a return to longer-term average levels in 2011, and one-fourth expected a return earlier than 2011.  Lending standards for nonprime credit card borrowers were expected to remain tight for a longer period, with two-thirds of respondents not expecting a return to longer-term average levels for the foreseeable future.  When weighted by credit card loans on banks' books, about 80 percent of respondents reported that credit card lending standards would remain tighter than average for the foreseeable future for both prime and

III-A-10

nonprime borrowers.  The weighted analysis also showed that almost all respondents with large credit card operations considered credit card lending standards to be tighter than the average over the past decade.

When asked about expected lending standards for other consumer loans to prime and nonprime borrowers, 25 percent and about 20 percent of respondents, respectively, reported that standards for such loans were not tighter than longer-term average levels.   Another 50 percent and 25 percent of respondents, respectively, indicated that standards for consumer loans to prime and nonprime borrowers were tighter than longer-term average levels but would ease by the end of 2011 or earlier.  Weighting by on-balance-sheet loans, however, again indicated much smaller percentages of loans at banks for which respondents either expect standards to ease in the nearer term or view standards as not currently tighter than average.  For prime borrowers, nearly 65 percent of outstanding other consumer loans were held by respondents that did not see their standards for other consumer loans easing to longer-term average levels in the foreseeable future, and only 10 percent of loans were held by respondents that reported prime lending standards were not tighter than longer-term average levels.  For nonprime borrowers on a weighted basis, about 85 percent of other consumer loans were held by respondents that did not expect lending standards for these loans to ease to longer-term average levels in the foreseeable future, and around 5 percent of other consumer loans were held by banks that indicated their nonprime standards on such loans were not tighter than longer-term average levels.

Trade in Goods and Services

In May, the U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $26 billion, the smallest deficit since 1999, as exports increased moderately and imports declined.

Trade in Goods and Services

<!-- missing-text -->

n.a.  Not available.  ...  Not applicable.

The value of exports of goods and services rose 1.6 percent in May after falling 2 percent in April.  The May increase was led by a climb in exports of industrial supplies, particularly of petroleum products, and reflected both higher prices and greater volumes. Exports of capital goods and consumer goods rose modestly, whereas automotive products and services fell.

Despite the May increase, the average value of exports in April and May declined 8.5 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter, with exports of capital goods recording the most pronounced weakness.  Most other major categories of exports also declined, with only industrial supplies and agricultural goods showing increases, helped by higher commodity prices.

The value of imports of goods and services fell 0.6 percent in May, a deceleration from April's 1.5 percent decline.  Imports of petroleum products exhibited the largest decline in May, with the fall wholly reflecting lower volumes, as petroleum prices rose.  Imports of services and automotive products moved down a touch, while industrial supplies were flat.  Overall imports of consumer goods were also flat, as a large decline in pharmaceuticals offset increases in a number of other goods.  In contrast, imports of computers moved up strongly.

The average value of imports in April and May fell 14 percent at an annual rate from the first quarter.  Lower imports of industrial supplies and capital goods accounted for most of the decline, but services and automotive products also declined.  In contrast, imports of consumer goods and petroleum recorded small increases.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In June, prices of imported core goods rose 0.2 percent, following a 0.3 percent increase in May.  The June increase reflected higher prices for materialintensive goods, which rose 0.6 percent.  Within that category, higher prices for unfinished metals led to an increase in prices for industrial supplies, and prices for imported foods also rose.  Prices for finished goods edged up, increasing 0.1 percent across all major categories.

The average level of core import prices in the second quarter was 1.2 percent (a.r.) below the first-quarter average, a much smaller drop than the 11.3 percent decline observed in the first quarter.  One factor contributing to the difference was a deceleration in prices of material-intensive goods, which fell only 2.6 percent in the second quarter after having fallen 30.1 percent in the first quarter.  Likewise, prices for finished goods fell less in the second quarter than in the first.  In contrast, prices for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors fell more rapidly in the second quarter, dropping 1.6 percent after having declined only 0.7 percent in the first quarter.

Oil. The Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil rose for a fifth straight month, increasing more than 20 percent in June.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose by a similar amount, averaging just less than $70 per barrel for the month as a whole.  In July, the price of spot WTI was volatile but, on net, was little changed, and closed most recently on August 4 at $71.42 per barrel.  The lack

of change of oil prices on balance reflects the offsetting of positive news regarding global economic activity by high global crude and petroleum product inventories and increased OPEC production.

Exports. Core export prices jumped 1.4 percent in June after increasing 0.7 percent in May.  Prices for material-intensive goods rose 2.9 percent, led by higher prices for agricultural exports.  Prices for finished goods rose 0.2 percent, as higher prices for capital goods excluding computers and semiconductors and for consumer goods offset falling prices for automotive products.

The average level of core export prices in the second quarter was up 3.1 percent at an annual rate from the first-quarter average.  The rise can be attributed to the 20.8 percent increase in prices of agricultural products, which had fallen at a 12.3 percent pace in the first quarter.  For non-agricultural industrial supplies, after a 28.4 percent price decline in the first quarter, prices were up 2 percent in the second quarter.  Prices of exported finished goods firmed 0.5 percent on balance.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial transactions for May and June that support the view that tensions in financial markets eased in those months.  Private investors both in the United States and abroad appear to have resumed purchases of riskier cross-border securities.  Foreign private investors have also resumed their purchases of U.S. Treasuries.  Foreign official inflows picked up further in May and June and the more recent custody data from FRBNY suggest they weakened only slightly in July.

Notwithstanding their strong demand for Treasuries in June, foreign private investors' purchases of U.S. Treasuries in the second quarter were well below those in the first quarter and the second half of last year (see line 4a of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions' and the upper panels of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through June 2009').  However, foreign private investors' purchases of U.S. stocks picked up smartly in the second quarter, with large purchases in May and June (line 4d). Foreign investors sold little U.S. agency and corporate debt, on net, in May and June, in marked contrast to the large net sales recorded since last summer (lines 4b and 4c).

Similarly, U.S. investors made sizable purchases of foreign securities in the second quarter (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through June 2009'), a significant swing from the net sales recorded in the second half of last year.

Foreign official inflows in the second quarter were well above the pace of the first quarter (see line 1 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions') and exceeded their 2007-08 rate.

. As has been the case since last summer, official inflows continue to be overwhelmingly into U.S. Treasury securities (see the figure 'Foreign Official Financial Inflows through June 2009').  FRBNY custody data indicate that official acquisitions of  U.S. Treasuries remained strong in July, although total official inflows appear to have weakened a touch as most countries reduced their holdings of agencies.

Amounts outstanding of the Fed's central bank liquidity swaps have declined to $76 billion as of July 31; the unwinding of these swaps is recorded as a reduction in U.S. official claims on foreigners (line 2).  U.S. banks continued to lend abroad in June

(line 3), allowing foreign banks to reduce their draws on the swap lines.  A slight upward trend in gross cross-border bank claims (not shown), also reflects this reengagement.

Foreign Financial Markets

Stock markets rose globally, on net, and the dollar depreciated mildly against most currencies as positive U.S. earnings reports and news of strong growth in emerging Asia lifted investor sentiment.  European and Japanese stock indexes have increased roughly 9 and 6 percent, respectively, since the June Greenbook.  European bank stocks rose about 17 percent, spurred by early reports of better-than-expected profits among some European banks as well as by strong earnings reports from some U.S. financial institutions.  Mutual fund flows to the EMEs turned positive after a brief period of outflows in late June; emerging Asian stock markets have increased 8 to 25 percent, while emerging Latin American stock markets have increased 2 to 15 percent.  Since the June Greenbook, the dollar has depreciated about 4 percent on a trade-weighted basis against the major foreign currencies and about 1 percent against the currencies of other important trading partners of the United States.

Overnight interest rates in the euro area have declined to about 35 basis points in the wake of the June 24 injection by the European Central Bank (ECB) of one-year funds at a fixed rate of 1 percent.  Banks took down a record €442 billion in the operation, increasing euros outstanding from ECB refinancing operations 45 percent.  The ECB also began its purchases of covered bonds, buying roughly €5 billion of bonds so far.  Yields on intermediate-term European covered bonds have declined roughly 30 basis points since the purchases began in early July.  In contrast, yields on longer-dated gilts rose as much as 19 basis points immediately after the Bank of England (BOE) surprised markets by leaving the size of its Asset Purchase Facility (APF) unchanged at £125 billion at its July MPC meeting.  Gilt yields continued to edge higher as the bank's purchases neared their limit under the facility, which was reached last week; however, the completion of purchases, which was expected, had little apparent impact on the gilt market.  Market participants were divided as to whether the BOE would authorize any further purchases at its August meeting, but the MPC decided to renew its purchases just as the Greenbook closed.  Citing the depth of the recession, the BOE raised the size of the APF to £175 billion and widened the set of gilts it would purchase, stating that it expected to conduct its additional purchases over the next three months. Benchmark gilt yields fell about 20 basis points on the announcement.

Although the BOE may yet choose to make further use of its Asset Purchase Facility, bank officials have begun to publicly discuss the outlines of a possible exit strategy; Deputy Governor Charles Bean disclosed that it was quite likely that the BOE would raise its benchmark interest rate before selling any securities acquired through the

Facility.  ECB officials have also begun to publicly discuss the outlines of an eventual exit strategy-ECB Vice President Lucas Papademos stated that the decision to drain excess liquidity need not be made before interest rates were raised.  He also implied that the ECB would eventually revert to its pre-crisis method of conducting refinancing operations, in which it auctioned fixed amounts of funds that banks compete to borrow, rather than offering funds in whatever quantities banks demand at fixed rates.

Spreads between euro and sterling Libor and corresponding overnight index swap rates have declined since the June Greenbook, and functioning in the FX swap market has reportedly improved.  Nonetheless, spreads in the FX swap market remained well above their pre-crisis levels, and market participants welcomed the Federal Reserve's June 25 announcement that it would extend its swap lines with other central banks through February 2010.  The ECB, BOE, and Swiss National Bank (SNB) announced that they would continue to conduct 7- and 84-day auctions of dollar funding until at least September 30, but they discontinued their 28-day auctions, citing low demand.  The SNB, ECB, Polish central bank, and Hungarian central bank also separately agreed to continue their own one-week swap operations supporting the exchange of euro and Swiss francs until at least the end of October.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

Recent indicators of economic activity in the advanced foreign economies suggest that the pace of contraction has moderated further.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) continued to rebound, although they do not yet point to expansion for all countries. Industrial production, while remaining well below pre-crisis levels, jumped in Japan, edged up in the euro area, and stabilized further elsewhere.  Economic sentiment indicators also improved.  However, labor market conditions continued to deteriorate, and credit standards remain generally tight.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation moderated further, with all major advanced foreign economies except the United Kingdom experiencing negative headline inflation. Excluding all food and energy prices, consumer price inflation has remained roughly stable.  Over the intermeeting period, the ECB began to implement its plan to purchase €60 billion of covered bonds over the next 12 months, and the BOE expanded its asset purchase program from £125 billion to £175 billion.

In Japan , indicators for the second quarter are positive on balance.  Real exports surged a record 60 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, but their level remains depressed, at 30 percent below their 2008 peak.  After a 22 percent plunge in the first quarter, industrial production rose 8.3 percent in the second quarter but remains at a low level.  These developments, combined with much-better-than-expected growth in real consumption, point to a return to positive growth in the second quarter.

In contrast, performance in the housing and labor sectors has continued to be poor. Except for the temporary, regulation-induced decline in 2007, housing starts are at their lowest level since records began in 1965.  Starts fell about 16 percent over the second quarter and are down more than 30 percent in the past 12 months.  House price appreciation in the major cities, which had turned positive in 2007, moved back down, falling almost 10 percent through the first quarter from a year earlier.

The deterioration in the labor market continues.  The job openings-to-applicants ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) reached a record low level of 0.43 in June.  Employment fell 2.1 percent over the past 12 months, the largest fall since 1955.  The unemployment rate rose to 5.4 percent in June.  Furthermore, the 12-month change of real wages reached a record-

low of negative 5.3 percent in June; in manufacturing, real wages fell more than 12 percent.

Japanese consumer prices fell 1.8 percent over the 12 months ending in June.  Prices excluding food and energy fell 0.7 percent over the same period.

The BOJ left its target for the call rate unchanged at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting period and extended its program of purchases of commercial paper, corporate bonds, equities, and government bonds until the end of this year.  On July 21, Prime Minister Taro Aso dissolved the lower house of Parliament; general elections will be held on August 30.

In the euro area , recent indicators suggest that the pace of contraction moderated in the second quarter.  Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in May after declining 7.4 percent in the first quarter and 1.4 percent in April; in particular, Germany's industrial production jumped 3.7 percent in May.  Retail sales grew 0.2 percent in April, the first positive reading in seven months, but fell 0.5 percent in May and 0.2 percent in June.  The business climate index, as well as consumer and industrial confidence, has rebounded somewhat in each month since April.  PMIs generally posted gains from April to July, although they are still in the contraction region.  The Ifo index of German business sentiment edged up further in July, continuing a recovery from its historical low in March.

However, labor market conditions continued to worsen.  The euro-area unemployment rate rose to 9.4 percent in May, up from a low of 7.2 percent in early 2008.  The extent of deterioration has varied considerably among euro-area countries, with the Spanish unemployment rate up more than 10 percentage points from its most recent low, while Germany's unemployment rate has risen only ½ percentage point.  The relatively small

response of the German unemployment rate partly reflects government subsidies to firms to retain employees.

The net percentage of euro-area banks reporting a tightening of credit standards applied to firms declined to 21 percent in the second quarter, down from 43 percent in the first. The net tightening continued to mainly reflect expectations regarding general economic activity and the industry or firm-specific outlook.  The net percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase and for consumer credit also decreased in the second quarter.

According to the flash estimate, twelve-month euro-area July inflation was negative 0.6 percent.  In June, headline inflation was negative 0.1 percent.  The downturn in energy prices has been an important factor in the decline of inflation:  Twelve-month energy price inflation in June was negative 11.9 percent, off from the peak of 17 percent in mid-2008.  Excluding energy and food, June inflation edged down to 1.4 percent.

The Governing Council of the ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent at its August 6 meeting.  Following the ECB's record liquidity injection of €442 billion in one-year funds, the overnight EONIA rate has declined to about 0.35 percent since end-June, just above the 0.25 percent rate on the ECB's deposit facility.  The ECB has begun to implement plans to buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds, and by early August had purchased about €5 billion in such bonds.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP contracted 3.1 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, according to the preliminary estimate, bringing the cumulative drop in activity since early 2008 to almost 6 percent.  The output of services industries fell 2.6 percent, with the largest declines observed in the transportation sector.  The volume of activity in production and construction industries contracted 0.6 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively.

Indicators received since the last Greenbook are broadly consistent with a stabilization of economic activity in recent months, but signs of a general economic recovery remain limited.  The PMIs for manufacturing and services stood at 50.8 and 53.2 in July, and indicators of consumer and business confidence improved further.  The Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate jumped to 7.6 percent in April, and the claimsbased measure ticked up to 4.8 percent in June.  Both the Halifax and Nationwide house price indexes have edged up in recent months, after having fallen about 20 percent from their peaks.

The supply of credit to the nonfinancial sector continues to be tight, and the demand for credit very weak.  Net lending to private nonfinancial corporations again turned negative in the second quarter, while net lending secured by dwellings reached a historical low. According to the BOE's Credit Conditions Survey, lenders reported an increase in default rates and losses given default on both corporate and household loans in the three months

to mid-June.  However, respondents on net expected an increase in the availability of credit to households and corporations over the following three months.

The 12-month rate of headline inflation moderated to 1.8 percent in June, falling below the BOE's 2 percent target for the first time since September 2007.  Producers' input prices fell 11.0 percent in June from a year earlier.  Wage inflation has slowed noticeably in recent months.  Average earnings including bonuses rose 2½ percent in the year to May, 1½ percentage points less than its average growth rate over the previous five years.

On August 6, the Monetary Policy Committee of the BOE expanded its asset purchase program from £125 billion to £175 billion and widened the range of gilts it was willing to acquire.  The Committee allowed itself three months to complete the additional purchases.

In Canada , indicators received so far for the second quarter have been mixed.  Monthly GDP fell 5.9 percent at an annual rate in May, following a 2.5 percent contraction in April.  Housing starts declined a further 8½ percent in the second quarter.  Employment also fell over the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter.  On the positive side, retail sales rose ¾ percent and building permits increased in May.  In addition, business credit rose ½ percent in June, and the balance of opinion for future sales from the Bank of Canada's business outlook survey hit a near-record high.

Twelve-month headline inflation in June declined to negative 0.3 percent, down sharply from its 3.5 percent peak in August 2008.  Inflation excluding food and energy remained at around 1 percent.  Median hourly earnings were down ½ percent in the second quarter.

The BOC kept its overnight target rate unchanged, at 0.25 percent, at its policy meeting in late July.  In the statement following the meeting, the BOC reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep its target rate at this level until the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The BOC also revised up its projections for growth somewhat, citing a more modest retrenchment of household and business spending, improved financial conditions, and better terms of trade than had been projected in April.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Recent data show that economic activity surged across emerging Asia in the second quarter.  Real GDP rebounded sharply in China and South Korea, and the preliminary estimate in Singapore indicates substantial growth.  In China, policy stimulus lifted activity, which in turn contributed to boosting exports of other countries in Asia. Indicators for these other countries also point to a strong rebound in the second quarter. In Latin America, activity remained depressed in Mexico, partly reflecting the adverse effect of the swine flu outbreak.  In contrast, activity in Brazil appears to have recovered. Twelve-month consumer price inflation further moderated across the emerging market economies, with several countries in Asia registering deflations.  After cutting policy rates aggressively earlier, many central banks kept their policy rates on hold while others in Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Russia continued to lower them.

The staff estimates that in China real GDP rose 18½ percent at an annual rate in the second quarter.  The jump in growth partly reflects strong fixed-asset investment, which was 36 percent higher in the second quarter than a year earlier.  Investment was supported by the fiscal stimulus package and a massive surge in bank lending.  Industrial production also grew at a solid pace in the second quarter. In a promising signal of external demand, the export order subindex of the manufacturing PMI, which crossed into expansionary range in May, rose further in June and July.  The trade surplus in the second quarter narrowed to $145 billion, as exports flattened and imports rose sharply, driven in part by the increase in commodity prices and stronger domestic demand.

Benchmark interest rates and banks' reserve requirements have been on hold since the end of last year, but Chinese authorities have been encouraging loan growth this year after limiting credit growth the past few years.  Consequently, outstanding loans in June were 34 percent higher than a year earlier.  Chinese authorities expressed concerns that the lending may prompt asset bubbles and nonperforming loans, but they were not likely to significantly curtail lending in the near term.  Thus far, the loan growth has not triggered inflationary pressures.  Chinese consumer prices in June were 1¾ percent below their year-earlier level, and prices were flat in the second quarter relative to the first.

India 's indicators suggest robust growth in the second quarter.  Industrial production grew in April and May.  The headline PMI averaged 55, up from about 47 in the previous two quarters, suggesting an expansion in economic activity.  Exports rose in the second quarter, ending three consecutive quarters of declines, but even higher imports kept the trade balance in deficit.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation fell in May and rose back up in June due to higher food prices, but the closely watched wholesale price index fell sharply in June, primarily reflecting declines in energy prices.  The government released its 2009-10 fiscal year budget, which targets a deficit of 6¾ percent of GDP. Citing lack of sufficient detail regarding medium-term consolidation of government finances, markets reacted poorly, with the local market index falling, the rupee depreciating, and sovereign bond spreads widening.

Economic activity in the newly industrialized economies ( NIEs) 1 rebounded sharply in the second quarter as exports, particularly to China, generally picked up and as domestic demand strengthened in some cases.  In South Korea, real GDP grew at a 9¾ percent pace, supported by strong domestic demand resulting mainly from the effects of previous policy easing, and by exports.  In Singapore, the advanced estimate (unofficial) suggests that activity also rebounded sharply, ending four consecutive quarters of negative growth, on account of strong activity in the biomedical and electronic sectors.  In Taiwan, industrial production rose steeply in the second quarter, and exports shot up, partly owing to the upturn in the high-tech sector.  In addition, a recent surge in imports of capital goods and consumer products suggests that domestic demand has likely firmed.  Hong Kong's indicators, including improvements in consumer sentiment and increases in property prices, also point to recovery of activity in the second quarter.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to fall across the region, reflecting slack in economic activity and, in some cases, declines in domestic energy prices and transport costs.  Amid the lower inflation and still-fragile economic environment, central banks have kept policy rates on hold at low levels.

Across the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN-4 2 ) , economic indicators suggest a rebound in activity during the second quarter, particularly in Thailand, which experienced the sharpest decline over the previous two quarters.  Exports from the region have picked up, aided by demand from China, and industrial production has generally moved up in the second quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to fall across the region, with Thailand and Malaysia registering deflation in recent months. The central banks in Indonesia and the Philippines further eased monetary policy, lowering rates 25 basis points in July.

In Mexico, real GDP likely continued to contract in the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the first.  Industrial production fell sharply in May due to a two-week shutdown of manufacturing plants in response to the swine flu outbreak.  The automotive sector showed signs of improvements with auto exports increasing and inventories falling, but production was held back by the restructuring of Chrysler and General Motors.  Both exports and imports rose in June, but they remained relatively weak overall.  The unemployment rate rose to 5¾ percent in the second quarter.

Twelve-month headline consumer price inflation is abating, reflecting tepid domestic demand and the stabilization of the peso, but remained stubornly above the upper limit of the Bank of Mexico's 2-to-4 percent target range.  Nevertheless, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate 75 basis points to 4½ percent during the intermeeting period.  In the legislative elections held on July 5, the ruling PAN party lost the majority of the lower house of Congress to the opposition PRI party.  The results cast some uncertainty over the Calderon administration's ability to achieve its economic reform agenda.

In Brazil , data releases suggest that activity likely recovered in the second quarter, supported in part by the fiscal stimulus.  Brazil also benefited from strong Asian growth, which lifted exports of primary commodities.  Retail sales edged up over the April-May period and appear to have been strong in June, boosted by tax holidays for autos and

appliances as well as by solid credit growth to households.  Industrial production rebounded in the second quarter, but remained well below its peak of last fall.  Anecdotal reports suggest that inventories have been winding down.

Inflationary pressures continued to abate, with 12-month consumer price inflation falling below 5 percent in June for the first time since 2007.  At its mid-July meeting, the central bank of Brazil cut its target for the policy rate 50 basis points to a record low of 8¾ percent.  The accompanying statement was widely interpreted as signaling no additional cuts this year.  The government's development bank, the only domestic source of long-term lending, also reduced its loan rates.  Net capital inflows continued, prompting the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market to mitigate upward pressures on the real.

In Russia , first-quarter real GDP contracted at an unprecedented 30 percent annual rate. The decline was broad based, with sizable contractions in private consumption, investment, and exports.  Indicators suggest that real GDP was flat in the second quarter. Although industrial production contracted and retail sales remained weak, activity in the construction and agriculture sectors was strong.  Also, exports in April and May rose following several months of declines.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation has moderated over the past few months, with the June reading falling below 12 percent for the first time since January of last year.  Amid the declines in inflation and weak economic activity, the central bank cut its policy rate 50 basis points in early July to 11 percent, bringing the cumulative rate reduction for the past four months to 200 basis points.  The central bank has been intervening in the foreign exchange market to stem ruble appreciation, resulting in a renewed accumulation of foreign exchange reserves, which have risen $30 billion since March to about $410 billion by the end of June.

In emerging Europe , economic activity continued to fall in the three Baltic economies of Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia in the second quarter following substantial double-digit real GDP contractions in the first.  Lithuania's real GDP plunged at an annual rate of 34 percent in the second quarter, and the available indicators for Estonia and Latvia also point to further contractions.  In late July the IMF and Latvia agreed on a set of policy actions that will put the country's IMF program back on track and free up a second tranche of IMF funding of about €200 million.  In exchange for the aid, Latvia will undertake additional budget tightening throughout 2012.  Lithuania indicated that it could seek IMF assistance to help finance its budget deficit.  Elsewhere in emerging Europe, economic activity also remained depressed in the second quarter, but to a substantially lesser degree than in the first.
