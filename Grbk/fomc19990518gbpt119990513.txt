SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Domestic Developments

The U.S.  economy continued  o  enjoy  a  combination f  brisk  rowth  and  low t o g inflation  ring he  first arter  f  1999. A further  uge  increase  n omestic du t qu o h i d spending  more  than ffset    sharp rop  in  net  exports,  ropelling al o a d p re GDP upward at  a somewhat faster  ace  than e projected  n  the  last  reenbook. This p w i G gain  came at  no immediate  inflation  st,  owever, ecause  wages were co h b remarkably ubdued  and,  moreover, abor roductivity  gistered other s l p re an striking  dvance.  All  this  dded  up  to  a  surprisingly  rong erformance or a a st p f corporate  rofits,  d  share rices  esponded ccordingly. p an p r a

The prospects  or emand seem more positive   this tage han  we anticipated f d at s t in  our  previous  orecast,  t he  same is  true f he upply  side f he  equation. f bu t o t s o t The recent  ood news on productivity  inforces e  view  that  igh  levels  f g re th h o investment  re  paying  off n  greater  fficiency,  d  we have  become more a i e an sanguine  about he  outlook or utput er  worker  hour.  Additionally,  ge t f o p wa increases  ppear o e  on a  lower  track  han  we previously  ad  thought: a t b t h Although  the  extraordinarily ll  first-quarter  e  n  the mployment cost sma ris i e index  was  partly    reflection   eclines  n  commissions  and  bonuses  that  ould a ofd i c be  reversed  o  some degree n  coming quarters,  low  inflation  te ppears o  be t i a ra a t damping the  underlying  age trend ven  more than  we previously d allowed w e ha for  in  ur  forecast. l old,  e have  ended  up  in  this  reenbook with o Al t w G a noticeably  ore favorable  ombination f nemployment and  inflation  an m c o u th before.

That  said,  ur  economic  forecast tains me familiar atures--in  rticular, o re o fe pa a moderation  in  the ace  of conomic  expansion nd  an eventual  irming f ages p e a f o w and prices.  lthough  the atest se  n  the  stock arket  creates  ome additional A l ri i m s momentum  in  consumption  and  other omponents  of omestic emand going c d d forward, e have  resisted e  temptation  o  throw  in  the owel  and  extrapolate w th t t the  steep ptrend n  share rices  n  the  face  of arnings  hat  eem likely u i p i e t s to disappoint  he arket.  The abatement f  wealth  gains,  long  with  negative m o a accelerator  fects  the emand for  houses, utos,  nd  business  quipment, ef on d a a e should  curb  the  growth  of omestic pending nd  more than ffset    lesser  rag d s a o a d from  the xternal  ector.  eal  GDP, after  ising  -1/4 ercent  n  1998,  is e s R r 4 p i projected  o  increase  -1/2 ercent  n  1999 and  a  bit ore than -1/2 ercent n t 3 p i m 2 p i 2000.

Key  Background Factors

The "bond  market  vigilantes"  pear o  have  been  reacting  ust  uch  concerns ap t toj s -- but  only  mildly. ndeed, he ackup  of  Treasury ields  n  recent  eeks I t b y i w seemingly as  been, o  an  important  egree, n  unwinding  of he arlier ight h t d a t e fl to safety,  s  investors ve  shown a  greater  reference  f ate  or quities d a ha p o l f e an relatively  sky rivate  ebt bligations.  e result s  been  that  inancing ri p d o Th ha f conditions  ave  remained  distinctly  tractive  r ouseholds nd  businesses. h at fo h a Under the  circumstances,  have  altered  ur  monetary  policy  ssumptions  o we o a t incorporate  rise  n  the ederal  unds  rate ver  the ext ear  or  so, hough  only  a a i f f o n y t modest  one  that  erely  validates rrent  arket  expectations d  that ould  do m cu m an w little  re than  maintain    rough  stability  real hort  ates  n  the ontext f n mo a of s r i c o a adverse nflation  end. i tr

Under this  unds  rate ssumption,  e are  projecting at onger-term easury f a w th l Tr yields  ill luctuate inly  in  their  ecent  ange,  robably ending   bit o  the w f ma r r p t a t high  side ext  year. ith the  economy slowing,  owever, he  risk  preads n n W h t s o

corporate  ebt  are  likely  o  widen  somewhat. Banks may also ecome less d t b accommodative  in  other ays,  tightening nding tandards  nd adjusting nw le s a no rate erms  of redit. t c

Especially  mportant  or he  economic  outlook,  owever,  is he  path f  the  stock i f t h t o market.  Share  prices  re  well  above  the  level  ontemplated n  the ast  orecast-a c i l f seemingly  on a  trajectory  eeper  han hat  n  the ost  extreme  upside lternative st t t i m a simulated  n  the arch Greenbook (the ne  putting  he  Wilshire  000 at  15,000 i M o t 5 by  the  end  of  next ear). he internal mentum  of  the arket  may well eep y T mo m k prices ising,  t  with  valuations ready o  far eyond  the  historical  nge,  e r bu al s b ra w find  it ifficult  buy  comfortably  nto  he  thought hat  nvestors e oing  to d to i t t i ar g shrug  off ompletely he arnings  isappointments  mplied y  our  essentially c t e d i b flat  rofit recast.  oreover,  Y2K  jitters  e ikely  o  afflict  e  corporate p fo M ar l t th securities  rkets  to  some degree  later is  ear,  nd  monetary  policy s ma th y a i assumed  to  tighten  lightly  xt  year. onsequently,  e are rojecting at s ne C w p th equity rices  ill dvance  only  a  bit urther   the oming months and  then lip p w a f in c s back  some in  2000.

We  are  anticipating  at  he  inflation-adjusted e f he  dollar  gainst    broad th t valu o t a a index  of urrencies  ill e  essentially  changed  on balance ver he  next c w b un o t several  uarters, llowing    somewhat lower  path han as projected  n  the q fo a t w i March Greenbook. The dollar  s  expected o  be  supported  y  the reater i t b g strength  f he  U.S.  economy relative    foreign  conomies  and  by  the o t to e expectation  hat eturns  n financial vestments  ill emain  higher  n  the t r o in w r i United  States  han n  the till latively  uggish  conomies  of apan  and  Europe. t i s re sl e J Nonetheless,  pside otential r he  dollar  ay be  limited  y  the urrent u p fo t m b c account eficit,  ich  will iden  considerably rther  ver  the  projection d wh w fu o period.

Foreign  economic  prospects  ave  generally  mproved  somewhat in  recent h i weeks,  although  egative  isks  n  the  outlook  ay not  have  diminished  uite o n r i m q s much  as  upbeat raders   foreign  tock arkets  seem to  have  assumed.  Overall, t in s m we now are  predicting at oreign  eal DP  will ise  -1/4 ercent  n  1999 and th f r G r 2 p i 2-1/2 ercent  n  2000--larger ins han e had  forecast  n  the  last  reenbook. p i ga t w i G The Brazilian  conomy is xpected o  pull ut  of ecession  ooner han  we e e t o r s t previously  redicted, d  the  growth  rates  or exico and  Korea  have  been p an f M raised  ppreciably.  apan, owever,  still    expected o  contract  lightly,   net, a J h is t s on both  this  ear  and  next,  nd  growth  in urope  is xpected o  remain  modest, n y a E e t o balance.

Crude oil rices  ave  been  pushed  higher ince ate  arch by  a  combination  f p h s l M o OPEC  production  utbacks nd  a slight  irming f orld  demand. We  now are c a f o w predicting at he rice f  West Texas  intermediate ll verage ore than  $18 th t p o wi a m

The forecast s  the TI  price ropping  back  to  $17.25 in ha W d a  barrel  y  the  second  quarter  f 000  and  holding ut  at hat evel  hrough he b o 2 o t l t t end of  next ear.  Although  this  nding  price s nly  a  little  gher  han n  the y e i o hi t i last  orecast,  l rices  verage  a  good bit igher han  we previously  ere f oi p a h t w anticipating.

We  are  projecting at  uro-area th e GDP growth  will e  about -1/4 ercent  his b 2 p t year  and  a  little  ss n 000.

That attern  s riven  ainly r t 1 i p i d m by continued apanese eflation:  onsumer prices  n  Japan  are xpected o  fall J d C i e t more than 1-1/2 percent  n  1999 and  to  decline  bout  percent  n 000.
