THE DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL ECONOMY

Real GDP and Corporate Profits

According to  BEA's final estimate, real GDP increased 3.3 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter of 1997. Final sales rose 2-1/2 percent, with rapid growth in  business fixed investment partly offset by a  lull in consumer spending and a further decline in net exports. Inventories accumulated at a  pace well above that of the first quarter, contributing about 3/4 percentage point to second-quarter growth.

The final estimate of  real GDP growth was 0.3 percentage point below the 3.6 percent pace reported in  BEA's preliminary release. The August Greenbook forecast anticipated essentially no revision to GDP growth. Exports of goods and services did not grow as  much as we had anticipated mainly because of a  sharp downward revision to agricultural exports. The final estimates of growth in PCE services and producers' durable equipment also came in  a  little below our expectations.

The estimates of corporate profits for 1997:Q2 were little changed. Corporate profits (with inventory valuation adjustment and capital consumption adjustments) are now reported to  have risen $15-1/2 billion from  the first-quarter level, and  the profit share of GNP (excluding Federal Reserve banks) stayed at 9.6 percent, the same as in the first quarter.

Taking account of  the final second-quarter estimates, together with the other data that have become available since Wednesday (reported below), we  would be  inclined to leave our forecast for growh of  real GDP in  the current quarter close to  where it was in the Greenbook--about 2-3/4 percent at an  annual rate.

Manufacturers' Orders. Shipments, and Inventories

New  orders for total durable goods rose 2.7 percent in  August. The staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods--which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-increased 2.8 percent. The increase was driven by a  marked turnaround in  bookings for electronic components, which jumped 78 percent in  August after having declined almost 23 percent in July. This big swing may have been the result of  pre-announced price cuts on computer components that became effective in  August. Excluding electronic components, real adjusted durable goods orders dropped 3.3 percent in  August reversing July's 2.9 percent increase.

New  orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts fell 5.4 percent in  August after having risen almost 10 percent during the preceding two  months. The August drop was due in  large part to the reversal of  July's outsized increase in bookings for search and navigation equipment; excluding this category, new  orders were down 0.7 percent.

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft and parts fell 2.4 percent in August. Shipments of communications equipment posted another large increase, but shipments of computing and office equipment declined and shipments of  other nondefense capital goods (excluding aircraft) dropped back 2.3 percent.

Revised data on  manufacturers' inventories for July now indicate a  somewhat smaller accumulation in July, $18.7 billion (annual rate), than the $25.7 billion increase shown earlier. Sales of  Existing Homes

Sales of  existing homes rose 3.3 percent in  August to a  record rate of 4.32 million units; the July sales rate was revised down slightly to 4.18 million units. The average level of sales during the first two months of  the current quarter was up 2-1/4 percent from the second-quarter average. Among regions, sales rose in the Midwest, the South, and the  West, but declined in  the Northeast.

The median price of  existing homes sold rose 4.3 percent during the twelve months ended in  August while the average price increased 6.1 percent. Cutting through the monthly volatility, twelve-month percent changes in average prices for existing homes have accelerated so far this year. However, these price changes are not adjusted for the characteristics of  the homes sold. The repeatsales index, which is compiled by  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and which attempts to control for quality change by  looking at sales of the same units over time, was up 3.6 percent in  the second quarter from its reading a  year earlier. The four-quarter percent changes in  the repeat sales index have been  trending down since early 1996. Consumer Sentiment

The final tabulation of  the results of the Michigan SRC survey of  consumer sentiment for September shows a  slightly lower level of the overall index than reported earlier; nonetheless, the September reading remains second only to  July's record high. Households' assessments of current conditions are now reported to have picked up in September to a  shade above July's high; consumers' views about their personal financial situation in  the year ahead and their

appraisal of  buying conditions for large household appliances became more positive. The index of expected conditions is now reported to be little changed in September, albeit at a  relatively high level. In response to questions not included in  the overall index, consumers remained optimistic about labor market prospects, and their opinions about buying conditions for houses improved markedly to a  level just below its previous high in early 1994.

Both mean and median expected inflation for the coming year rose 0.2 percentage point in September to 3.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively. Regarding the inflation outlook for the next five to  ten years, the mean expectation edged down in September to 3.7 percent while the median moved up to 3.2 percent.
