Recent Developments

International financial markets.  Since  the March FOMC  meeting, the nominal exchange  value  of the dollar has risen about 3-1/2 percent, on balance, in  terms of the major currencies index.  The broad index has moved up  about 2-1/2 percent, as the dollar has gained less against currencies of other important trading  partners.  The dollar has been supported in part by higher U.S.  interest rates,  as the surprising pace of U.S.  economic  growth and indications  of heightened  domestic price pressures  have continued  to fuel  expectations  of  more U.S. monetary tightening.  Even when the U.S. stock market fell sharply  in mid-April,  sympathetic movements in other stock markets  and a shift toward the perceived  safety  of dollar-denominated  instruments belied what had been a popular "disaster scenario" for the dollar-that a break in the U.S. market would precipitate  a shift in investors' preferences  toward foreign  assets.  The largest appreciation during the intermeeting  period--about  7 percent--came  against the euro, with smaller gains against sterling, the yen, and the Canadian dollar.  The dollar is up  somewhat against the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real as well.

In moves that were largely anticipated by the markets, the European Central Bank, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of Canada, and the Reserve Bank of Australia all raised official rates during the intermeeting period.  Authorities pointed to concerns about potential inflation generally,  with the ECB being more explicit than in previous official communications  about concerns that euro weakness was adding to inflationary  risks.  Short-term and long-term interest rates moved up in Europe and Canada, but declined slightly in Japan.

. The Desk did not intervene  during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent data from the industrial  countries confirm a fairly widespread  strengthening of activity so far this year.  A cluster of positive indicators  suggests that Japan  is experiencing  a rebound from its sagging performance  at the end of last year, although labor-market conditions still are very soft.  Even after allowing  for leap-year effects that have boosted some indicators,  improvements in industrial production,  housing,  and shipments of manufactures indicate that activity strengthened in the first quarter.  Business confidence  (as measured by the March Tankan survey) and other forwardlooking indicators  also have improved  a bit.

The euro area has shown  further indications of solid expansion.  Unemployment rates have continued to move down,  while industrial production,  construction,

and  orders ave  remained  firm. reawide  business  entiment  tayed t ts  ecord h A s s a i r high  level.  rowth in anada and  the nited ingdom slowed  in he irst G C U K t f quarter  ut  still  pears o e  quite  obust. b ap t b r
