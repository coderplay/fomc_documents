Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

Led by strong growth in final sales, economic activity expanded at a solid pace in the second quarter.  In particular, net exports surged and residential investment posted another robust gain.  Consumer spending and business investment rose at moderate rates last quarter.  However, manufacturing output decelerated a good bit, and the pace of inventory investment dropped considerably.  In the past few months, the labor market has continued to improve gradually.  On average, payrolls have expanded a bit more rapidly than we estimate is necessary to absorb net new entrants into the workforce, and the unemployment rate has edged down to 5 percent.  Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation has moderated in recent months.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market continues to make steady progress:  Private payroll employment rose 144,000 in June, bringing the average gain for the first half of the year to 172,000 jobs per month, roughly on par with the average monthly increase last year.  Hiring in the services industries and in construction remained strong in June, but manufacturing employment declined further.  Aggregate hours of production workers rose at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the second quarter, a bit faster than in the first quarter.  More recently, the four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance has fallen to 317,000 in the week ending July 30, noticeably below the mid-June readings.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged down 0.1 percentage point in June, to 5.0 percent, and the labor force participation rate dropped back 0.1 percentage point, to 66.0 percent.  The unemployment rate currently stands about where it was in mid-1997, when we judge the labor market to have been roughly in equilibrium.  Several other indicators are also approximately in line with their 1997 average levels.  The share of persons working part-time for economic reasons, the short-term quit rate-which provides a measure of workers' perceptions of the relative abundance of alternative employment-new hiring plans (as measured by the Manpower survey), and the rate of insured unemployment have all moved back to the favorable levels of eight years ago.

However, other indicators of labor market conditions are a bit weaker than their 1997 levels.  According to the National Federation of Independent Business survey, the fraction of firms with a position described as hard-to-fill remains visibly below where it was eight years ago, an indication that smaller firms face few shortages of workers. Households' perceptions of job availability are also below the average level in 1997.  In addition, many job seekers continue to experience long periods of job search.  Despite

dropping lately, long-term unemployment is still high, and the exhaustion rate-the proportion of workers leaving the unemployment insurance (UI) rolls after having used their entire period of eligibility (usually twenty-six weeks)-remains somewhat elevated. Finally, the number of monthly layoff announcements, which should move down as labor market conditions improve, has not yet reached the low levels of the mid-1990s.  On balance, these indicators suggest that the unemployment rate may be understating, if only a little, the amount of slack that remains in the labor market.

Based on the latest National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) data, we now estimate that productivity in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the first quarter and 2 percent in the second quarter.  Over the four quarters ending in the second quarter of 2005, productivity rose an estimated 2¼ percent, a considerable step-down from the comparable period four quarters earlier.

Industrial Production

Industrial production climbed 0.9 percent in June, led by a weather-related jump of 5.3 percent in the output of utilities.  Manufacturing production advanced at a solid pace in both May and June.  However, these gains followed small declines in the preceding two months.  As a result, factory production rose at an annual rate of only 1½ percent in the second quarter, partly reflecting a slowing pace of inventory investment.  Still, indicators for July suggest that the improved pace of activity in the late spring continued last month.

The second-quarter deceleration in manufacturing production was due, in part, to a contraction in motor vehicle output, as both medium and heavy truck assemblies and light vehicle production moved lower.  Light vehicle assemblies fell to an annual rate of 11.1 million units in April and May-well below their first-quarter pace-as producers worked off elevated light truck inventories.  In June, assemblies rebounded to a rate of 11.7 million units, and they are estimated to have remained at that rate in July.  For the third quarter as a whole, manufacturers' schedules call for light vehicle production at an annual rate of 11.8 million units.

In the high-tech sector, the pace of production growth has been only lukewarm of late.  In June, the output of high-technology products edged up 0.2 percent, the smallest increase since December 2003 and well below the longer-run (1972-2004) average monthly gain of 1.6 percent (not at an annual rate).  For the second quarter as a whole, the output of communications equipment posted a moderate increase, and computer production rose at an annual rate of 15 percent-a relatively modest gain by the standards of that sector but well above the meager 2004 increase.  Nonetheless, anecdotal evidence on high-tech production has been positive.  Recent industry reports point to strengthening business demand for communications equipment, which bodes well for domestic production because U.S. manufacturers specialize more in products geared toward business use.

addition, the CIO Magazine diffusion indexes of future spending plans for data networking equipment and computer hardware popped up in July.

Upstream from computers and communications equipment, the production of semiconductors has been sluggish.  Output increased just 0.8 percent in June, capping a sharp deceleration for the second quarter as a whole.  Going forward, Intel's third-quarter guidance is consistent with accelerating production of microprocessors and flash memory, which make up almost one-fourth of industry semiconductor production. Moreover, the increased usage of the latest generation of semiconductor chips (such as dual-core microprocessors) may boost production in coming months. 1

Elsewhere, industrial production showed mixed results in the second quarter.  The index for business equipment rose at a annual rate of 9.7 percent, and the index for defense and space equipment shot up at a rate of nearly 17 percent.  In contrast, the output of consumer goods slowed to a 1.7 percent gain, and the output of business and construction supplies rose more modestly than in the first quarter.  Materials output, which accounts for about one-fourth of total industrial production, declined at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the second quarter; drops in the production of paper and steel-industries in which inventories remain elevated relative to consumption-more than accounted for the decline.

The available weekly output data suggest uneven production growth in July.  Total motor vehicle assemblies edged up, electricity generation increased a little further after an enormous rise in June, and lumber production appears to have rebounded from its drop in June.  However, the output of crude oil was held down by the recent hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico.  Among the forward-looking indicators, the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders rose markedly in June, and the Institute for Supply Management's new orders diffusion index moved higher in July.  The regional indexes such as the Empire State Survey and the Philadelphia Business Outlook Survey also improved in July.  Taken together, these series are consistent with solid near-term gains in manufacturing output.

Motor Vehicles

After dipping in the first quarter, sales of light vehicles rebounded in the second quarter to an annual rate of 17.2 million units.  In July, sales of light vehicles surged further to 20.6 million units.  The jump in July sales reflected the extension of General Motors' (GM) employee-discount program and the introduction of similar programs by Ford and Chrysler.   These programs have proven to be immensely popular even though the Big 2 Three automakers seem to have offset some of the cost of the new programs by cutting back on incentives that traditionally have been used to fuel sales. 3 Industry contacts suggest that customers may be responding positively to the programs' fixed, 'no haggle' pricing.  According to the Michigan Survey, the July sales increase-which was concentrated in light trucks-may also have benefited to some extent from diminished concerns about gasoline prices.  Overall, the Michigan index of car-buying conditions jumped in July to its most favorable level since last December.

Reflecting the elevated pace of sales, inventories of light vehicles fell in June and are estimated to have declined again in July to their lowest level since early 2002. 4 Inventories appear to be particularly lean at GM, which reported that-excluding periods affected by strikes-its stock of light vehicles may be at the lowest level since 1975.

Consumer Spending

After having posted sizable gains in the second half of last year, real consumer spending expanded at a more moderate pace in the first half of this year.  Excluding the wide swings in motor vehicles purchases, consumer outlays rose at an annual rate of more than 4 percent in the first quarter before decelerating to a 3 percent pace in the second. The moderation was consistent with the temperate fundamentals underlying consumption in the first half.  More recently, both stock prices and consumer confidence have moved up from their levels earlier this year.

Consumer Confidence

<!-- missing-text -->

The monthly pattern of consumer spending was uneven in the second quarter.  After increasing solidly in April, total real personal consumption expenditures edged down in May and then jumped 1.1 percent in June.    Sales of cars and trucks rose sharply in June, 5 and outlays for a broad range of other goods also surged, putting spending on a strong trajectory going into the current quarter.  Expenditures on services expanded at a solid pace again in June as unseasonably warm weather boosted electricity usage.

Going forward, the most recent indicators suggest that spending in July rose at a good clip.  Purchases of motor vehicles climbed to a dizzying pace, and sales at the largest chain stores are reported to have been brisk.  In addition, the July readings of consumer sentiment from both the Michigan Survey and the Conference Board remained at levels consistent with healthy spending gains.

Real disposable personal income rose 0.5 percent in June but moved up at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent for the second quarter as a whole.  Although nominal wages and salaries posted a moderate rise last quarter, real income was held back by the jump in energy prices.  With increases in spending outpacing gains in disposable personal income in recent months, the personal saving rate is estimated to have fallen to close to zero last quarter.  Household wealth appears to have increased roughly in line with income in the first half of the year, leaving the wealth-to-income ratio nearly unchanged.  Movements in stock prices since June should have a more favorable effect on consumer demand.

Housing

Activity in the residential construction sector has remained quite robust.  New singlefamily homes were started at an annual rate of 1.67 million units in June, well above last year's pace and only a little below the average rate over the first half of this year.  After having dipped in May, starts of multifamily units rebounded to an annual rate of 337,000 units in June.  The permits data for both sectors suggest that residential construction will remain solid in the near term.  Permit issuance for single-family homes-after adjusting for activity in areas where they are not required-rose to 1.68 million units in June.  Moreover, the backlog of unused permits for single-family units increased substantially.

Home sales remained strong in June.  Sales of single-family existing homes rose 2½ percent in June to an annual rate of 6.37 million units, well above last year's average level.  New home sales also continued to increase briskly, jumping 4 percent in June to an annual rate of 1.37 million units.  Housing demand continues to receive a boost from low long-term mortgage rates.  Rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages stood at about 5.8 percent in early August.  However, rates for one-year adjustable-rate mortgages have continued to move up gradually-increasing roughly 40 basis points so far this year. Available indicators suggest that home sales will continue at a good clip in July.  The pending home sales index-which provides advance information about existing home sales in the near term-edged up in June, and the four-week moving average of mortgage applications for purchase remained in an elevated range.

Prices of existing homes have continued to climb sharply, while the rate of price appreciation for new homes has shown some signs of moderating.  The average sales price of existing homes in June was 9½ percent higher than that of a year earlier, about the same pace of appreciation as twelve months ago.  In the new-home market, the constant-quality price index-which controls for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, and a few other readily measurable attributes-was up 6¾ percent in the second quarter from the level of a year earlier, down somewhat from the 9¼ percent increase four quarters earlier.  Recent sales of new-home sales have been more heavily weighted toward houses priced below the median, and, as a result, the average price of new homes has decelerated noticeably more than the constant-quality index.

Equipment and Software

Business spending on equipment and software has been expanding at solid, if unspectacular, rates.  We now estimate that real outlays on equipment and software increased at an annual rate of 8 percent in the second quarter, about the same as the firstquarter pace.  Although outlays for transportation equipment shot up last quarter, spending growth outside of this volatile category was markedly slower than earlier in the year.  Nonetheless, fundamentals remain conducive to gains in capital spending: Business output continues to expand, financing conditions remain favorable, and although increases in corporate cash flow have tapered off over the past year, many firms still are holding ample stockpiles of liquid assets.  Moreover, according to survey evidence, businesses are optimistic about the near-term outlook.

In the high-tech sector, real business spending slowed to an annual rate of 15 percent in the second quarter from the 26 percent pace in the first quarter, despite another

appreciable increase in real outlays for computers and peripherals last quarter.  Spending on communications equipment rose at a subdued pace in the second quarter following a large first-quarter gain.  Similarly, increases in software spending stepped down substantially last quarter.  However, revenue guidance from major software vendors bodes well for future spending in this category.

Real outlays on transportation equipment jumped in the second quarter.  Real business purchases of light vehicles soared, led by increased demand for high-end light trucks.  In contrast, real spending for medium and heavy trucks was little changed last quarter.  Still, new orders for medium and heavy rigs shot up in June and rose further in July. Elsewhere in the transportation sector, real business outlays for aircraft increased in the second quarter-albeit from their lowest level in a decade-and domestic orders of aircraft picked up in May and June for the first time in a year.

Investment spending on non-high-tech, non transportation equipment declined at an annual rate of 3 percent in the second quarter, with the downturn concentrated in the machinery category.  Nonetheless, new orders outstripped shipments again in June, and the backlog of unfilled orders rose for the seventeenth consecutive month.  Furthermore, the positive July readings on orders and shipments from the surveys of manufacturers by the ISM and the Philadelphia and New York Reserve Banks point to near-term gains in this sector.

Nonresidential Construction

Although conditions in nonresidential property markets seem to be firming a bit, spending on nonresidential construction remains at low levels.  The vacancy rate for industrial buildings began heading down early last year, but even so, outlays on manufacturing structures have fallen in the past couple of months and have been roughly flat since the end of last year.  Spending in other categories has also been uninspiring over the past few quarters.  Outlays for commercial buildings have been about flat even though retail vacancy rates continue to be low.  Office construction remains at a depressed level despite a downward-trending vacancy rate, while outlays in the 'other' category have been edging down for some time.  In the drilling and mining sector, expenditures resumed an upward trajectory in the second quarter.

at a rate of $62 billion in the first quarter.  This sharp swing in the pace of real inventory investment is estimated to have subtracted 2¼ percentage points from the change in real GDP in the second quarter.  While stronger-than-expected sales of light vehicles in the second quarter contributed to the drop in inventory investment, the step-down may also suggest that efforts that businesses undertook to rebuild stocks during 2004 and early 2005 are largely complete.  Indeed, by the end of the second quarter, except for a few sectors with sizable overhangs (such as steel and paper), businesses seemed reasonably content with inventory levels.  This view is apparent in recent surveys, which suggest that an increasing number of firms are satisfied with both their own and their customers' inventory positions.

Data from the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system are roughly consistent with the NIPA data.  Inventories declined in May and June, and days' supply edged down for a third straight month.  Inventories appear elevated relative to consumption only for paper and, to a lesser degree, for food and for steel held by metal service centers.

Federal Government Sector

The federal budget picture has improved markedly in recent months as a result of exceptional strength in receipts.   Indeed, although outlays have continued to rise at the relatively rapid pace of the past few years, the deficit in the unified budget narrowed to about $336 billion over the twelve months ending in June, roughly $100 billion less than the twelve-month deficit over the preceding twelve-month period.

In June, federal tax receipts were nearly 10 percent above their year-earlier level. Individual nonwithheld taxes, which are mainly quarterly declarations for tax liability in 2005, continued to soar, as did corporate income taxes.  The surge in corporate receipts this year has likely been driven by strong growth in economic profits as well as by the expiration of the bonus depreciation provision at the end of 2004.

Outlays in June were 9 percent above their year-earlier level and reflected sizable increases in net interest payments, Medicare spending, and defense expenditures.  Data from Daily Treasury Statements for payments to defense vendors in July are consistent with further gains in real defense outlays this quarter.

According to the Mid-Session Review , the Administration now estimates that the budget deficit will come in at $333 billion in fiscal 2005, nearly $100 billion less than had been anticipated in February.  The Administration has also lowered its projections for

One reason for the downward revision to the longer-run deficit projection is that the Administration assumes that much of the surprising strength in tax collections this spring will be permanent; in addition, it has revised up the projected path for the tax base.  In contrast, changes to policy assumptions-in particular, the inclusion of a defense supplemental for fiscal 2006 and the phase-in of Social Security personal accounts starting in 2009-tend to boost the deficit.  Similarly, the Congressional Budget Office has reduced its projection for the 2005 deficit to the neighborhood of $325 billion; it will release updated budget projections in mid-August.

Changes to the Administration's Budget Outlook Since February

<!-- missing-text -->

Before leaving on August recess, Congress passed several pieces of legislation.  These include an energy bill that provides tax incentives to the energy sector over the next decade.  In addition, after ten temporary extensions of the surface transportation law that had expired two years ago, Congress approved a six-year highway and mass transit reauthorization bill.  The fiscal effects of these two bills are quite similar to what had been assumed in the President's budget.

State and Local Government Sector

We now estimate that real spending on consumption and gross investment by state and local governments rose at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the second quarter after an upward revised increase of 1½ percent in the first quarter.  The rate of increase in real spending also was revised up in 2004.  In the second quarter, much of the increase was in construction expenditures; spending on consumption items rose at a rate of a bit less than 1 percent in real terms last quarter, similar to the average pace over the preceding year. 6

The pickup in aggregate spending by the sector is consistent with reports of strengthening fiscal positions among the states.  Income and sales tax collections apparently were quite robust this spring, and many states seem to have ended fiscal 2005 (which closed on June 30 in all but four states) with higher balances in their operating accounts than they had anticipated a few months earlier.

Prices

The news about recent inflation developments has been favorable.   The PCE price index 7 was flat in June for a second consecutive month, bringing the increase for the past three months to 1.9 percent (annual rate), 1.5 percentage points below the rate of the preceding three months.  Although a deceleration in energy price inflation contributed significantly to this moderation, increases in the core PCE price index have also slowed markedly in the past couple of months.

PCE prices for energy fell 0.6 percent in June after a 2.4 percent decline in May.  Over the twelve months ending in June, the price index for energy rose 7.6 percent, a considerable slowdown compared with the 18 percent increase posted twelve months earlier.  Crude oil prices have rebounded substantially since mid-June, and survey data point to sharp price increases for gasoline in July.

The food component of the PCE price index was unchanged in June for a second consecutive month.  Prices of fruits and vegetables reversed earlier run-ups-which had reflected very tight supplies during the transition from the winter harvest to the spring

harvest-and these price declines offset price increases in other food categories.  During the twelve months ending in June, food prices rose 2.1 percent, about 1 percentage point less than during the preceding year.  More recently, wholesale meat prices fell substantially after a judicial ruling on July 15 that allowed the resumption of imports of young Canadian cattle into the United States; this change will likely help restrain retail consumer food prices by a small amount in the months ahead.

Excluding food and energy, the PCE price index rose at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the three months ending in June after having posted significantly larger increases earlier in the year.  Much of the recent slowdown has been in core goods prices, which had been pushed up noticeably by higher prices for imports, energy, and core intermediate materials last year.  Prices of core services have also decelerated recently, though much less than the slowing in goods prices.  The market-based components of core PCE inflation also have moderated of late, rising at an annual rate of 1½ percent in the three months ending in June, down from a 2½ percent rate during the preceding three months. During the twelve months ending in June, overall core PCE prices rose just under 2 percent, a shade less than the upward-revised increase of one year earlier.

Most broader measures of inflation have decelerated a bit during the past year.  In the four quarters ending last quarter, GDP prices decelerated about ½ percentage point from the year-earlier pace.  Excluding food and energy items, GDP price inflation has been about steady near 2½ percent as a slowdown in investment price inflation about offset faster price increases for government purchases.

Survey measures of inflation expectations have been mixed in recent months.  After having hovered around 3¼ percent from March through June, median year-ahead inflation expectations as measured by the Michigan Survey moved down to 3 percent in July.  By contrast, median five- to ten-year inflation expectations ticked up a tenth in July to 2.9 percent but still remained in the narrow range observed over the past few years.

At earlier stages of processing, the producer price index for core intermediate materials fell 0.2 percent in June after declining 0.3 percent in May.  During the three months ending in June, core intermediate materials declined at an annual rate of 1¼ percent-a striking turnaround from the 6½ percent rate of increase that was posted in the first three months of this year.  Outside of energy, commodity prices have also been relatively subdued lately.  Although the Journal of Commerce industrials index, which includes a substantial energy component, has edged up recently, the Commodity Research Bureau

spot industrials index, which excludes energy items, has fallen 2.4 percent.  Nonetheless, both measures of commodity prices have remained at an elevated level since the end of 2003.

Labor Costs

Over the three months ending in June, the Employment Cost Index (ECI) for hourly compensation in private industry rose at an annual rate of just 2½ percent, a second consecutive reading of meager compensation gains.  As of the end of June, the twelvemonth increase in the ECI was 3¼ percent, ¾ percentage point less than in the comparable period twelve months earlier.

Over the twelve months ending in June, the wages and salaries component of the ECI rose 2½ percent, roughly the same increase as over the previous year.  However, benefit costs rose 5 percent during the twelve months ending in June, a slowdown of almost 2½ percentage points relative to the rate of the preceding year.  Much of the slowdown in benefit costs was due to smaller increases in contributions to retirement and saving programs; many companies likely have benefited from the rebound in equity prices over the past two years and therefore have less need to make up for earlier losses sustained by their defined-benefit pension plans.  In addition, increases in costs for health insurance, which had slowed to the 7 percent to 8 percent range in recent quarters, eased further in the June report, and the twelve-month change stood at 6¼ percent, well below the double-digit increases of a few years ago.

Using the most recent NIPA data, the staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector increased at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the second quarter. This pace is down sharply from increases of 10 percent and 7 percent, respectively, in the preceding two quarters, when a year-end burst of bonuses and exercises of stock options apparently pushed up this measure of compensation considerably.  Unit labor costs are estimated to have risen at a 1½ percent rate in the second quarter, far below the outsized increases posted in recent quarters.

Appendix

Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts

The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 29, affected data back to the beginning of 2002.  The revision allowed the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) to incorporate more-comprehensive source data, including data from tax records and economic surveys, and to make methodological changes.  Although this year's revision mainly reflected the incorporation of new source data, BEA also made two noteworthy changes to their methods.  First, it began using the Census Bureau's Quarterly Services Survey as the source for data on investment in computer software and for several components of PCE services. 1 Second, it improved its estimates of the price of implicit services of commercial banks. 2

On a four-quarter change basis, real GDP growth was revised down 0.4 percentage point in both 2002 and 2003 and 0.1 percentage point in 2004.  Much of the downward revision was concentrated in personal consumption expenditures and investment in equipment and software. The downward revision to the change in real PCE was primarily due to updated information from two Census Bureau surveys:  The Service Annual Survey and the American Housing Survey. The largest source of downward revision to the change in real E&amp;S was shipments data on hightech equipment from the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufactures.  In the nonfarm business sector, we estimate that the four-quarter change in real output per hour will be revised down 0.6 percentage point in 2002, 0.5 percentage point in 2003, and 0.2 percentage point in 2004.

The BEA also revised its price indexes.  The average change in the GDP price index was revised up 0.2 percentage point per year from the fourth quarter of 2001 to the fourth quarter of 2004. Core PCE inflation was also revised up about 0.2 percentage point per year during the same period, with most of the upward revision occurring in 2004.  Most of the revision to core PCE inflation was due to changes in two nonmarket pieces: medical insurance and implicit services of financial institutions other than commercial banks.  The index for core market-based PCE prices was little revised.

On the income side of the accounts, the growth rate of gross domestic income was revised down in each of the open years and in the first quarter of this year.  The revisions to gross domestic income were, on average, larger than those to GDP, and in the first quarter of 2005, the revised statistical discrepancy was closer to zero than previously reported.  The growth rate of real disposable personal income was, on balance, revised down, mainly in 2004 and the first quarter of

2005.  Because personal outlays were revised down even more in 2002 and 2003 (largely because of downward-revised personal consumption expenditures), the personal saving rate was revised up 0.6 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2002 and 0.7 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2003.  However, the personal saving rate was revised up only 0.1 percentage point in the fourth quarter of 2004, and it was revised down 0.2 percentage point in the first quarter of this year.

Corporate economic profits were revised up in 2002 and most of 2003 (in large part to reflect new data from the Internal Revenue Service).  However, profits were revised down in 2004, principally because the BEA made a special adjustment to account for the apparent increase in stock-option exercises in late 2004.  The BEA used footnotes from corporations' financial statements to make its estimate of the effect of these exercises.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Developments in financial markets over the intermeeting period suggest that investors have become more confident of prospects for solid economic growth.  Market participants are now virtually certain of a quarter-point increase in the target federal funds rate at the upcoming FOMC meeting, and they have marked up the expected path of policy thereafter.  Yields on nominal Treasury coupon securities rose substantially, primarily reflecting higher real yields; inflation compensation based on TIPS yields was about unchanged.  Favorable corporate earnings reports for the second quarter lifted stock prices, credit spreads on speculative-grade bonds narrowed considerably, and measures of corporate credit quality remained strong.  Business debt expanded at a moderate pace in the second quarter and in July, and early indicators suggest that household debt growth likely eased in the second quarter from the first quarter's brisk pace.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

The FOMC's decision at its June meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points and the accompanying statement were about in line with investors' expectations and prompted only a limited market reaction.  Subsequent economic data releases and corporate earnings reports supporting an outlook for strong economic growth led market participants to raise their expected path for the federal funds rate.  On net over the intermeeting period, the expected policy path shifted up about 35 basis points, to a touch above 4 percent by year-end 2005, and up roughly 45 basis points, to nearly 4¼ percent, by the end of next year.  Surveys suggest that investors are certain of a quarter-point hike in the target federal funds rate at the August meeting and believe that the FOMC will make only modest changes to the accompanying policy statement.

Yields on nominal Treasury securities at two- and ten-year maturities have risen about 40 basis points and 30 basis points, respectively, since the June FOMC meeting, which is consistent with changes in policy expectations.  The July 7 terrorist attacks in London prompted a transitory safe-haven rally in the Treasury market, but yields returned to preattack levels the next day.  Yields rose on July 21 after the Chinese government unexpectedly announced a revaluation of the yuan, although much of the increase was reversed over the following days on indications that further revaluations would not be forthcoming in the near term.  Inflation-indexed Treasury yields moved up about in line with nominal yields over the intermeeting period, leaving inflation compensation little changed on net.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Corporate earnings reports that generally beat forecasts and the largely positive economic news lifted stock prices over the intermeeting period, with major equity indexes rising 3 to 7¼ percent.  The trend-adjusted twelve-month forward earnings-price ratio was little changed at around 5½ percent and remains in the narrow range registered since early 2004.  The spread between this measure and the real perpetuity Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-held steady over the intermeeting period at a level above its average over the past two decades.  Implied volatilities on both the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500 remained at historically low levels.

Spreads on BBB-rated bonds were down about 10 basis points.  Speculative-grade bond yields declined, and their credit spreads narrowed nearly 60 basis points.  Currently, these spreads are only about 40 basis points above the very low levels touched earlier this year. Quality spreads on commercial paper remained low.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Reports from about 400 of the S&amp;P 500 firms indicate that second-quarter earnings per share likely increased about 13 percent from four quarters earlier, and gains were registered broadly across sectors.  That increase implies a 3 percent advance from the first quarter to the second quarter (seasonally adjusted quarterly rate).  Analysts' forecasts of year-ahead earnings for the S&amp;P 500 firms were revised upward between mid-June and mid-July; the increase mainly reflected positive revisions to forecasts for energy firms.  Excluding these firms, revisions were, on balance, a touch negative and about in the range seen since mid-2004.

Overall, the financial position of nonfinancial firms continues to be strong, with firms still holding large stocks of liquid assets.  The dollar volume of corporate bonds that were downgraded increased in the second quarter, largely reflecting the downgrades of General Motors and Ford debt; among other firms, ratings upgrades about kept pace with downgrades.  In June, both the realized six-month trailing default rate on bonds and the expected year-ahead default rate based on KMV's firm-level estimates remained low.

Business Finance

Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rebounded in June and July from the lackluster figures posted in April and May, but hefty retirements have left net bond issuance only slightly positive in the past couple of months.  Short-term borrowing in July was robust:  Commercial paper outstanding rebounded after large quarter-end

paydowns that had damped second-quarter growth, and bank loans to businesses advanced briskly.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, U.S. banks, on net, eased standards further on C&amp;I loans over the past three months even as demand for loans continued to firm.  On balance, net business borrowing through bank loans, commercial paper, and bonds in July stepped up from the moderate pace recorded in the first two quarters of this year.

Gross public equity issuance was sluggish in the second quarter and remained so in July, although new registrations with the Securities and Exchange Commission suggest a pickup in IPOs in coming months.  The outsized first-quarter figures for equity retirements appear to have been surpassed in the second quarter, as strong profits and large cash positions continued to bolster cash-financed mergers and share repurchases. Hence, net equity issuance probably dropped even further into negative territory last quarter.

Commercial Real Estate

Growth of commercial mortgage debt likely maintained a double-digit pace in the second quarter, as the issuance of commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) set a record; the calendar of offerings suggests another large volume in the current quarter.  Spreads on BBB-rated CMBS widened in the second quarter and in July and were likely pressured higher by the heavy issuance.  Delinquency rates on CMBS declined further in June.  The ratio of net operating income to property prices, an indicator of the rate of return on commercial real estate, edged down further in the second quarter.  Even so, the spread of this ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough proxy for the risk premium on commercial real estate assets, widened somewhat in the second quarter but remained in the lower part of the range observed over the past decade.

Household Finance

Household debt is estimated to have expanded briskly in the second quarter but a bit less rapidly than earlier this year.  Mortgage debt growth likely eased a bit in the second quarter because of increases in mortgage rates and-based on prices of existing homesa possibly reduced pace of home price appreciation.  Since the last FOMC meeting, rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen about in line with ten-year Treasury yields. Boosted by stronger retail sales in June, consumer credit growth appears to have picked up from the tepid pace recorded in April and May.

III-11

The ratio of financial obligations to disposable personal income is estimated to have ticked up in the second quarter.  Bankruptcy filings have fallen somewhat in recent weeks, but they remain high, as many households evidently have been filing before the new bankruptcy law takes effect in October.  Other indicators of household credit quality have held steady at favorable levels.

The small rise in stock prices in the second quarter points to a slight increase in the ratio of household net worth to disposable personal income.  Net purchases of long-term mutual fund shares picked up in July from the second quarter pace, although net flows to domestic equity funds remained sluggish.

Treasury and Agency Finance

Consistent with the improvement in the federal budget in recent months, issuance of nominal Treasury securities has continued to decline, and the quantity of twenty-year TIPS auctioned in July was below market projections.  Nonetheless, demand at auctions over the intermeeting period was lackluster, with bid-to-cover ratios in the lower half of recent ranges.  The proportion of issues awarded to indirect bidders-a rough proxy for demand from foreign official institutions-averaged a bit above the levels reported earlier this year.  An alternative indicator of foreign official demand, the value of Treasury securities held in custody at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of foreign official institutions, increased over the intermeeting period at about the pace registered earlier in the year.

In the August mid-quarter refunding statement, the Treasury announced that it would reintroduce regular semi-annual issuance of a thirty-year nominal bond, with the auction calendar to be released in November.  The decision had been widely anticipated and prompted little market reaction.

The stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac declined 6 and 3 percent, respectively, amid investor concerns about legislation that would likely result in smaller GSE investment portfolios.  Spreads of yields on GSE senior and subordinated unsecured debt over those on comparable Treasury securities were little changed.

State and Local Government Finance

In July, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds to finance new capital projects exceeded the robust pace seen in the second quarter, and short-term issuance also edged up.  Credit quality in this sector has shown modest improvement this year, as rating

upgrades on municipal bonds have outnumbered downgrades.  Over the intermeeting period, the ratio of municipal bond yields to comparable-maturity Treasury yields ticked down.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 accelerated to an annual rate of 6 percent in June, an increase likely fueled by taxrelated flows and prepayments associated with mortgage refinancing activity, but M2 slowed in July as these factors waned.  Among the components of M2, small time deposits, whose rates of return adjust quickly to changes in market rates, continued to expand briskly in June and July, while liquid deposits and retail money funds were little changed, on balance.  Overall, M2 has grown somewhat faster this year than would be predicted by its historical relationship with GDP and the opportunity cost of M2 assets; this growth perhaps has been boosted by the flattening of the yield curve.

Bank credit picked up a bit in July, after a deceleration in June that reflected a runoff in securities holdings.  Real estate lending grew sharply last month, supported by robust activity in both the commercial and residential segments.  Consumer loans picked up from a moderate pace, perhaps with a boost from strong automobile sales.  C&amp;I lending, which has been bolstered by leveraged buyouts and merger and acquisition activity in recent months, was strong again in July.  By contrast, other loans, which are quite volatile, declined sharply in July after expanding in June.

Appendix

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices

The July 2005 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also queried banks about their current holdings and recent originations and securitizations of nontraditional mortgage products.  This appendix is based on responses from fifty-four domestic banking institutions and twenty U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.

Domestic commercial banks reported a further easing of lending standards and terms for commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans and commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  At U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, in contrast, lending standards and terms for these types of loans were little changed over the same period. On net, domestic banks experienced stronger demand for C&amp;I loans over the past three months, while foreign institutions indicated that demand for business loans was about unchanged.  Both domestic and foreign institutions reported stronger demand for commercial real estate loans, on balance, and a few respondents, on net, reported having eased standards on such loans.  A notable net fraction of domestic respondents reported stronger demand for loans to purchase homes over the past three months, while a small net percentage of banks also experienced a strengthening in demand for consumer loans. On net, credit standards for residential mortgages and consumer loans were about unchanged in the July survey, but a significant proportion of respondents indicated increased willingness to make consumer installment loans.

In response to a set of special questions on nontraditional mortgage products, domestic banks generally reported that such loans accounted for less than a quarter of their residential mortgage originations and of the mortgages on their books.  More than onehalf of respondents, however, noted that the share of mortgage originations accounted for by nontraditional mortgage products had been higher over the past twelve months than over the previous twelve-month period.

C&amp;I Lending

In the July survey, domestic banks reported a further net easing of standards and terms for C&amp;I loans.  About 15 percent of respondents, on net, reported having eased their credit standards for loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months, a slightly lower net fraction than in recent surveys.  On balance, 50 percent of domestic banks indicated that they had reduced the costs of credit lines for such firms in July, up from 40 percent in the April survey.  About 45 percent-a somewhat smaller net percentage than in the previous survey-reported that they had narrowed spreads of

loan rates over their cost of funds.  Domestic respondents also reported having eased other lending terms over the past three months:  About one-fourth of banks, on net, increased the maximum size and the maximum maturity of credit lines they are willing to extend to large and middle-market firms.  In contrast, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks-customers of which are likely to be larger firms-indicated that their lending standards and terms for C&amp;I loans were little changed over the past three months.  For C&amp;I loans to small firms, 11 percent of domestic banks, on net, noted that they had eased their lending standards-down from about 20 percent in April-and about one-third of respondents reported having trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds.

As in recent surveys, almost all domestic banks that reported having eased their lending standards and terms in the July survey cited more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as an important reason for having done so.  Large fractions of those respondents also cited an increased tolerance for risk and a more favorable or less uncertain economic outlook as reasons for their move toward a less-stringent lending posture.

Demand for business loans reportedly strengthened over the past three months.  Forty percent of domestic banks saw stronger demand for C&amp;I loans from large and middlemarket firms, on balance-about the same share as in the April survey.  In contrast, foreign institutions reported that demand for C&amp;I loans was about unchanged over the past three months.  About one-third of domestic respondents also experienced stronger loan demand from small firms.  As was the case in the April survey, a large majority of the domestic respondents that saw stronger loan demand pointed to borrowers' increased financing needs for accounts receivable and inventories as well as for investment in plant and equipment as having driven the rise in demand.  A substantial fraction of domestic banks also pointed to a rise in merger and acquisition activity as having boosted demand for C&amp;I loans.  Regarding future business, 27 percent of domestic and 15 percent of foreign respondents, on net, indicated that inquiries from potential business borrowers had increased over the past three months, down from about 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively, in the April survey.

Commercial Real Estate Lending

On net, 13 percent of domestic banks reported an easing of lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months, about half the fraction that did so in the April survey.  All but one of the thirteen foreign branches and agencies active in commercial real estate lending reported unchanged standards on this type of loan. About one-fourth of domestic respondents, on net, experienced an increase in demand for commercial real estate loans over the past three months, about the same share as in

the April survey.  On net, 15 percent of foreign institutions indicated that demand for this type of loan had increased, down from one-third in April.

Households Lending

About one-fifth of domestic institutions reported in the July survey that they had become more willing to make consumer installment loans over the previous three months, a somewhat larger share than in April.  However, standards and terms on credit card and non-credit-card consumer loans were reportedly little changed, on net, over the same period.  A modest net fraction of banks reported stronger demand for consumer loans in the July survey.

Credit standards on residential mortgage loans were reportedly unchanged in the July survey.  Demand for mortgages to purchase homes strengthened over the past three months:  One-fifth of domestic respondents, on net, reporting stronger demand for such loans.

The July survey included a set of special questions on banks' current holdings and recent originations and securitizations of residential mortgages that could be categorized as nontraditional mortgage products.  These products include-but are not limited to-adjustable-rate mortgages with multiple payment options, interest-only mortgages, and so-called 'Alt-A' products, such as mortgages with limited income verification and mortgages secured by non-owner-occupied properties. 1

About one-third of domestic respondents indicated that the share of residential mortgages on their books that could be classified as nontraditional mortgage products was less than 5 percent, and another third reported that the share of such products was between 5 percent and 15 percent.  These shares are roughly similar if the responses are weighted by the respondent banks' dollar volumes of residential mortgages outstanding at the end of the first quarter.  Only one bank indicated that nontraditional mortgage products accounted for more than one-half of residential mortgages on its books.

About one-third of domestic respondents reported that over the past twelve months the share of their residential mortgage originations that could be categorized as nontraditional products had been less than 5 percent.  An additional 43 percent of respondents indicated that their share of nontraditional mortgage originations was between 5 percent and 25 percent over the same period.  Banks reporting shares in this

range accounted for about 75 percent of all residential mortgages on the books of the survey respondents at the end of the first quarter.

More than half of respondent banks indicated that the share of nontraditional residential mortgage originations over the past twelve months was higher than it had been over the previous twelve-month period.  Twelve percent of respondents noted that this share was substantially higher.

A large majority of respondents reported that their bank had securitized less than onequarter of nontraditional mortgages originated over the past year.  These institutions accounted for about one-half of the residential mortgages on all respondents' books.  In contrast, three large banks-which accounted for almost 40 percent of the respondents' residential mortgages outstanding-indicated that the share of nontraditional mortgage originations that had been securitized exceeded 75 percent.  On balance, a majority of the banks indicated that they were less likely to securitize nontraditional mortgage products than traditional mortgages.  However, three large institutions-which accounted for more than 40 percent of the residential mortgages of the respondentsindicated that they were more likely to securitize nontraditional mortgage products.

Banks were also asked about the share of residential mortgages on their books used to finance purchases of second homes or homes for investment purposes.  A substantial majority of banks indicated that this share was less than 10 percent.  Most respondents also indicated that over the past year, the share of residential mortgage originations used to finance purchases of second homes or homes for investment purposes was less than 10 percent.  One-fourth of the respondents noted that the share of originations accounted for by such loans was moderately higher over the past twelve months relative to the previous twelve-month period.  Banks with larger mortgage portfolios were more likely to report an increase in this share.

Net Trade in Goods and Services

(Billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted)

<!-- missing-text -->

In May, the value of exports of goods and services increased slightly from April's strong level, as higher services exports were partly offset by a moderation in exports of goods. Within goods, exports of agricultural products and consumer goods both increased sharply, while exports of industrial supplies increased at a moderate pace.  However, these gains were more than offset by weaker exports of both automotive products and capital equipment, as aircraft exports stepped down from April's elevated level.

The average value of exports in April and May increased 17½ percent (a.r.) from the first quarter.  Exports of capital goods showed the strongest gain, although exports of industrial supplies, agricultural goods, and services also moved up markedly relative to the first quarter.

The value of imported goods and services decreased almost 1 percent in May, led by a sharp decline in the value of oil imports.  Imports of non-oil goods also decreased, with both industrial supplies and capital goods exhibiting significant declines, more than offsetting a brisk increase in imports of automotive products and a modest gain in imports of consumer goods.  Services imports increased moderately.

On average, the value of imports in April and May increased 8 percent (a.r.) from the first quarter, as an increase in the value of oil imports and higher imports of capital goods more than offset lower imports of automotive products and consumer goods.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In June, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods both fell 0.4 percent, marking the second consecutive month of falling prices.  As in May, the main contribution to the price decline came from non-oil industrial supplies.  After increasing briskly in March and April, the price index for non-oil industrial supplies fell 1.1 percent in May before declining another 1.1 percent in June, mainly on lower prices for natural gas and metals.  Food prices fell 1.7 percent in June, reflecting lower vegetable prices.  After large price increases earlier in the year, the finished goods categories had only small price movements in June.  Prices for both automotive products and capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) were unchanged in June. The price index for consumer goods fell 0.1 percent.  Prices for computers increased 0.1 percent in May, and prices for semiconductors fell 0.1 percent.

In the second quarter, NIPA core import prices rose 2.1 percent at an annual rate.  The main contributors to the overall price increase were foods and non-oil industrial supplies, where large price increases in March and April were only partially undone in May and June.  In the second quarter, the import price for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) increased about 2 percent, a much slower rate of increase than in the first quarter.  Automotive products and consumer goods saw only small price increases.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 7.6 percent in June.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil rose more sharply in June, up 13 percent to average nearly $56.50 per barrel.  The spot price rose late in May from about $50 per barrel to over $60 per barrel in late June as storms in the Gulf of Mexico threatened oil production and refining infrastructure.  In July, the spot price averaged $58.70 per barrel and closed at $60.87 per barrel on August 3.  This recent run-up owes, in part, to several production disruptions and delays as well as the death of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.  The prices of heavier grades of crude oil have also increased, but not to as great an extent as the price of WTI.  In addition to ongoing concern about this hurricane season, oil prices remain elevated because of expected strong world oil demand going forward, concerns about future supplies from Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, Venezuela, and Russia, and limited spare production capacity in OPEC.  The price of the far-dated futures contract (currently for delivery in December 2011) closed at $59.19 per barrel on August 3.

Exports. In June, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods were unchanged from May.  A 1.2 percent increase in prices for agricultural products offset a 0.6 percent fall in prices of non-agricultural industrial supplies and a 0.2 percent fall in the prices of exported consumer goods.  Export prices for both capital goods and automotive products rose 0.1 percent.  Prices of exported computers fell 0.4 percent, whereas prices for semiconductors increased 0.3 percent.

In the second quarter, prices of core exports (on a NIPA basis) rose 4 percent at an annual rate.  Prices for agricultural products and non-agricultural industrial supplies increased briskly.  Prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) rose 1¾ percent.  Prices for both automotive products and consumer goods increased only slightly.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Net private foreign purchases of U.S. securities slowed for the fourth consecutive month in May (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table).  Although, on net, private foreigners purchased agency bonds (line 4b) for the first time in four months, these purchases were more than offset by declines in private purchases of Treasury securities (line 4a) and corporate stocks (line 4d).  Net purchases of corporate bonds (line 4c) remained fairly strong.

Foreign official inflows (line 1) also slowed in May, after a sizeable inflow in April.  The easing is primarily attributed to countries other than the G10 and OPEC: Norway, which actively manages its oil fund, contributed significantly to this slowing.  Inflows from China have remained relatively strong so far this year.  Partial and confidential data on custody accounts at FRBNY indicate further sizable foreign official inflows in June and July.

U.S. acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) continued at their recent pace in May.  Net purchases of stocks (line 5b) moved back towards recent levels, while U.S. purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a) ticked up from April's level.  However, it is difficult to know how much of this increase reflects larger purchases and how much reflects more complete reporting, given the effects of the ongoing review of the TIC data on net transactions in foreign bonds.

The volatile banking sector (line 3) registered a large net inflow in May, which more than offset the sizeable outflow in April.  For the year to date, the banking sector has recorded a net outflow of less than $1 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets

The trade-weighted major currencies index of the dollar declined slightly, 3/4 percent on net, over the intermeeting period.  The dollar appreciated early in the period as short- and long-term dollar-denominated interest rates increased more than those of other industrial currencies, buoyed by data reinforcing the view that economic growth in the United States would likely continue to outpace that of Europe and Japan.  However, the dollar later more than fully retraced these gains although interest rate differentials registered no further changes.  Major equity indexes rose across the globe over the period, driven by a number of better-than-expected earnings reports.  On July 21, China announced a major change to its exchange rate regime, including an immediate 2.1 percent appreciation of the renminbi versus the dollar.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated 1-3/4 percent on balance against the euro and 3/4 percent versus the Canadian dollar.  The dollar appreciated 1/2 percent versus the yen and 1 percent against sterling.  Much of the dollar's movement versus sterling came in reaction to weaker-than-expected U.K. economic data and preceded the terrorist bombings in London on July 7.

The three-month sterling spot interest rate declined 13 basis points over the intermeeting period.  At the July 7 meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, four of the nine members voted for a cut in the repo rate, and, at the August 4 meeting, the MPC lowered the Bank's repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent, citing a slowdown in the growth rates of household spending and business investment.  Yields implied by sterling interest rate futures currently show that the market is assigning some probability to another 25-basis-point cut by the Bank of England by early next year. Three-month euro interest rates were little changed on net; statements by several European Central Bank officials during the period appeared to be tailored to quash market expectations of any monetary easing in the euro area in the near term.  Ten-year sovereign yields rose about 20 basis points in Europe and Japan, less than the 30 basis-point increase in the benchmark Treasury yield.  Japanese yields were boosted by press reports that some members of the Bank of Japan's Policy Board had expressed a belief that Japanese consumer prices would begin increasing by year's end.  Headline equity indexes rose about 2 percent in Japan and about 4 percent in the euro area and the United Kingdom over the period.  Stock prices were boosted by many stronger-thanexpected earnings reports, particularly in the energy sector, which continued to be supported by rising crude oil prices.

In emerging markets, the main event of the period was the long-awaited change in China's exchange rate regime, although the ultimate extent of the change remains uncertain.  On July 21, the Chinese authorities announced that the renminbi would no longer be pegged to the dollar at a rate near 8.28 yuan per dollar.  Instead, the authorities announced that they were moving to a 'managed floating exchange rate regime based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies.'  The exchange value of the renminbi against the dollar was moved immediately to 8.11 yuan per dollar, a revaluation of  2.1 percent.  China's announcement raised some immediate speculation that the relatively small initial step could soon be followed by further exchange rate moves, but on July 26 the People's Bank of China issued a statement warning market

participants not to expect additional substantial exchange rate moves in the near term. Since July 21, the exchange rate, heavily managed by official Chinese institutions, has registered only very small fluctuations near 8.11 yuan per dollar.  The role of the currency basket in the management of the renminbi exchange rate, as well as the basket's composition, remains unclear for now.

China's announcement was immediately followed by sizable movements in the exchange rates of a number of Asian currencies against the dollar, but these movements were largely retraced in the ensuing days.  Malaysia also ended its formal peg of the ringgit to the dollar soon after China's announcement.  On net over the period, the dollar depreciated about 2 percent against the Korean won and the Singapore dollar, and about 1 percent versus the Malaysian ringgit.  The dollar was little changed against the Thai baht and Taiwan dollar.  Hong Kong did not change its exchange rate regime, and its currency only registered very small fluctuations against the U.S. dollar.  Equity prices rose substantially in a number of Asian markets over the period, led by a 10 percent increase in Korea.

In Latin America, the dollar depreciated about 1-1/2 percent against the Mexican peso and the Brazilian real .  Brazilian asset prices experienced much volatility early in the period on concerns that President Lula may become implicated in a growing bribes-forvotes scandal in Brazil's congress, but these concerns seemed to abate late in the period. On net, equity prices rose 6 percent in Brazil, 8 percent in Mexico, and 10 percent in Argentina.  The Argentine sovereign yield spread over Treasuries declined sharply due to the issuance of new debt replacing old defaulted securities.  Mexico's EMBI+ spread declined 21 basis points from an already very low level.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Growth in the foreign industrial economies appears to have turned down a bit in the second quarter, with the United Kingdom, Japan, and the euro area all showing evidence of slowing.  Japanese industrial production fell slightly on average in the second quarter. The preliminary GDP estimate for the United Kingdom indicates growth of 1.5 percent in the second quarter, as the pace of expansion in the construction, service, and manufacturing sectors slowed from the first quarter rate.  In the euro area, the external sector exerted a drag on growth, as the trade surplus through May was down relative to the first quarter.  In contrast, Canadian real GDP seems to have accelerated slightly, according to monthly GDP estimates.

Consumer price inflation remained subdued overall.  In the euro area, core inflation posted its slowest rate since early 2001 in June, but headline inflation moved up to 2.2 percent in July.  In Canada, consumer prices continued rising at moderate rates.  The inflation rate in the United Kingdom moved up to the Bank of England's 2 percent target in June.  Mild deflation persisted in Japan.

In Japan , real workers' household spending fell 1.4 percent in June, while retail sales rose 0.1 percent, following a 1.4 percent decline in May.  In the second quarter, retail sales grew more than 3 percent from a year ago, the fastest rate of growth since the mid1990s.  Tokyo department store sales were flat in June.

After falling 2.8 percent in May, industrial production increased by 1.5 percent in June. Investment indicators released since the last FOMC meeting were mixed.  Core machinery orders fell 6.7 percent in May, but the Bank of Japan's July Tankan index of private capital investment plans for large firms in all industries projects expenditure growth of 9.4 percent in FY 2005, a substantial increase from the March survey.  Overall, firms view business conditions as improving.  The Tankan diffusion index of business conditions for firms of all sizes and industries bounced back in June to its December level, after dipping in March.  The external sector continues to make negative contributions to growth:  real exports of goods rose 1 percent in June while real imports of goods rose 4 percent.

Japanese labor markets continue to gradually improve. The unemployment rate declined to 4.2 percent in June, the lowest level since 1998 and employment rose 30,000 in the second quarter, slightly faster than the first-quarter pace.  Total cash earnings (which

include overtime pay and bonuses) rose 1.3 percent in June from one year ago, the biggest increase in two years.  Nationwide core consumer prices (which exclude fresh food but include energy) fell 0.2 percent in June from a year ago.

Data for the euro area suggest that growth was weak in the second quarter.  After providing considerable stimulus to growth in the first quarter, the external sector appears to have been a drag on growth in the second quarter; the euro area trade surplus was down in April and May relative to the first quarter, as imports grew faster than exports. Euro-area retail sales rebounded in May and June from a particularly weak showing in April, but retail sales for the second quarter as a whole were down 0.2 percent from the first quarter.

Euro-area industrial production declined 0.3 percent in May; however, recent improvement in business sentiment suggests that industrial activity may be picking up. Driven by a rise in industrial confidence, the European Commission's measure of euroarea economic sentiment turned up in June after falling in May to its lowest level in more than a year and a half.  The euro-area manufacturing PMI moved back above the 50

threshold for growth in July for the first time since March.  The PMI for the services sector remained around 53, near where it has been for much of the past year.  The German IFO index of manufacturing sentiment continued on a positive trend and rose significantly in July.

Labor markets conditions showed some improvement, with the euro-area unemployment rate edging down to 8.8 percent in May and remaining there in June.  In Germany, the national definition of the unemployment rate also moved slightly lower to 11.6 percent in July.

Euro-area twelve-month consumer price inflation rose to 2.2 percent in July, above the ECB ceiling.  In contrast, core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed food, slipped to 1.4 percent in June.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom rose 1.5 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Service sector output grew 2.4 percent while total output from the production industries fell 1.6 percent; both were slower than their first-quarter paces.  Output of the construction sector continued to slow, rising 1.6 percent compared with a rise of 2.6 percent in the first quarter and of 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Large revisions to GDP going back almost two years also changed the outlook for household balance sheets.  The household savings rate is now thought to have hit a record low in 2004 as consumption was revised up and income was revised down in the first half of the year.

Early indicators for the third quarter indicate a slight improvement over second quarter activity.  After falling throughout the second quarter, business confidence rebounded strongly in July.  Consumer confidence also improved slightly in July.  The purchasing managers' index for manufacturing in July retained most of June's strong gains, and the PMI for services edged higher in July.

Month-to-month house price growth continues to be just a bit above zero on average. According to the Nationwide Building Society index of house prices, the twelve-month change of house prices was 2.7 percent in July.  Household net borrowing for house purchase was stable in June at ₤ 11.5 billion.

Inflationary pressures seem to have picked up a bit recently.  The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation reached the Bank of England's 2 percent target in June. Twelve-month consumer price inflation excluding energy has risen considerably since early in the year, rising from 1.2 percent in January to 1.6 percent in June.  Producer input price inflation has also risen, reaching 12 percent on a twelve-month basis in June.

In Canada, incoming data for the second quarter suggest continued improvement in economic activity.  In May, GDP by industry advanced 3.6 percent (a.r.), led by expansions in the utilities, energy, and oil extraction sectors.  Manufacturing activity also grew, although more slowly than overall output.  Retail activity contracted in May, but this followed outsized gains during the first four months of the year.

Other indicators for the second quarter were mixed.  Housing starts turned up again in June after a May lull; overall, though slowing a bit compared to 2004, the housing sector continued to see elevated activity in the first half of 2005.  The composite index of leading indicators continued its recent solid advance in June.  Retail sales turned down in May, following very strong advances the previous several months.  The manufacturing sector, after a bit of a pickup on balance the previous few months, seemed to stall again in May, with shipments flat and new orders down.

The solid employment gains of the previous few months continued in June, with even the beleaguered manufacturing sector adding jobs.  The unemployment rate edged down again, to 6.7 percent, matching a 30-year low also reached in mid-2000.

In June, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 1.7 percent , while the twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding the eight most volatile components, came in at 1.5 percent.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Indicators of economic activity across the developing economies have been mixed.  In Asia, a slowdown in Chinese growth in the second quarter was offset by acceleration in Korea and a rebound in Singapore.  In Latin America, growth continues at about its prior rate.  With few exceptions, incoming inflation figures have surprised on the downside, perhaps reflecting little pass-through to date of higher crude oil prices into regulated domestic energy prices across the developing countries and tighter monetary policy in Latin America.

The staff estimates that real GDP growth in China slowed to 5 percent (s.a.a.r.) in the second quarter, based on the published four-quarter change of 9½ percent.  The staff's GDP growth estimate is consistent with indicators for investment growth which were lower in the second quarter, after a spike in the first quarter.  Export growth and consumer spending remained quite strong.  With import growth slumping, the trade surplus soared, exceeding an annual rate of $100 billion in the second quarter.  Fourquarter consumer price inflation was just 1.7 percent, almost half of its first-quarter pace, partially reflecting declines in food prices.  Holdings of foreign exchange reserves exceeded $700 billion in June, but the pace of accumulation slowed from the first quarter. On July 22, China revalued the renminbi by about 2 percent against the dollar and announced it is moving to a managed float of the renminbi against an undisclosed basket of currencies.  There has been considerable attention paid to bids by Chinese companies to purchase U.S. companies over the past few months.  One of the most prominent bids, CNOOC's bid for Unocal, was dropped by CNOOC recently, citing U.S. political opposition.

Recent economic news out of Hong Kong has been generally positive.  In the second quarter, unemployment fell to 5.7 percent and trade volumes, a good indicator of growth in the entrepôt economy, rose to new highs.  In part reflecting higher food prices, 12-month consumer price inflation increased to 1.2 percent in June, the highest reading since 1998.

Indicators for Korea have shown considerable strength since the June Greenbook.  GDP growth jumped to 5 percent in the second quarter, due entirely to robust domestic demand.  Following the GDP release, the Korean government announced that it was withdrawing plans to introduce a fiscal stimulus plan for later this year.  Industrial production rose almost 2½ percent in June, boosted by strong consumer demand for durables.  Recent sales and confidence surveys remained elevated.  Signs of a stepdown in export growth are mounting, however.  The current account surplus for the second quarter was less than half of that registered in the previous quarter.  Consumer prices have decelerated in recent months and the unemployment rate ticked up in June.

Incoming data from the ASEAN countries suggest that economic activity picked up in the second quarter.  In Singapore, the unofficial advance estimate of second-quarter real GDP indicates a surge of over 12 percent.  Elsewhere in the region, industrial production in recent months was up from the first-quarter level on average in Philippines and Thailand, but was down in Malaysia.  Trade data show the ASEAN economies continue to run trade surpluses on average.  The exceptions are the Philippines and Thailand.  In Thailand, the trade deficit continued to widen because higher oil prices increased the nominal import bill.

Aside from Singapore, headline consumer price inflation remained elevated across the region, reflecting higher food and energy prices.  Citing concerns over inflation, some countries have tightened monetary policy recently.  In mid-July, the Philippine central bank increased the reserve requirement 2 percentage points, and the Thai central bank raised its key interest rate 25 basis points to 2.75 percent.  In Indonesia, the central bank authorities introduced a new one-month target interest rate, initially set a bit higher than market-determined rates, in line with their simultaneous announcement of a 'tightbiased' monetary policy for the remainder of the year.

In the Philippines, the political situation has deteriorated following allegations that President Arroyo was involved in electoral fraud.  Partly reflecting the political situation, Moody's, Standard &amp; Poor's, and Fitch downgraded their debt rating outlooks for the Philippines from stable to negative.

On July 22, Malaysia changed its seven-year-old exchange rate regime from a dollar peg to a managed float following China's exchange-rate announcement.  The central bank statement indicated that the objective will be to maintain a stable currency around its 'fair value' against a trade-weighted index of trading partners' currencies.  Since the announcement and through the end of July, the ringgit has appreciated nearly 1.3 percent.

In India , recent indicators have remained positive.  GDP rose 6.4 percent in the first quarter, boosted by robust consumer demand, and average industrial production in the first two months of the second quarter was 2½ percent above the first-quarter level. Consumer prices decelerated throughout the second quarter, although the effect of the partial lifting of fuel subsidies in mid-June has yet to show through.  The trade deficit continued to widen in the second quarter, reflecting surging imports.

In Mexico , recent data releases point to a moderate pickup in economic activity from a weak performance in the first quarter.  Industrial production was held down in March and April by sluggish U.S. demand for Mexican manufacturing exports, but rose almost 1 percent at a monthly rate in May and was up 3 percent from a year ago.  Similarly, the country's index of economic activity (a monthly proxy of real GDP) rose at a monthly rate of 0.8 percent in May and is up 3.4 percent from a year earlier, mainly on the back of solid performance in the services sector.  In addition, data for retail sales and investment (not shown) suggest that domestic demand has remained relatively unaffected by high real interest rates.

Mexico's inflation outlook has improved in recent months.  After tightening monetary policy a dozen times since early last year, the Bank of Mexico has not changed its policy over the last four months, in line with recent statements suggesting that its tightening cycle is over.  The rate on 28-day peso-denominated bills has been stable at about 9.6 percent for the past month, up almost 5 percentage points since the tightening began. In June, twelve-month consumer inflation was 4.3 percent, down from the 5.2 percent registered last year, and within striking distance of the 4 percent upper limit of the central bank's target range.  Core inflation was even lower at 3.4 percent in June and has continued trending down.

In Brazil , data releases since the last Greenbook have been generally positive.  Industrial production jumped in May, raising the April-May average 1¼ percent above its firstquarter level.  Unemployment declined in May to below 10 percent and moved down further in June, partly reflecting exits from the workforce.  With data available only through May, retail sales appear to have increased slightly in the second quarter. However, both consumer and business confidence declined in the second quarter.  The external sector remains a bright spot, with nominal exports registering strong growth. Headline consumer prices were about unchanged in June, bringing down the twelvemonth inflation rate to 7.3 percent.  Part of this decline reflects a fall in food prices and the fact that Petrobras, the government oil firm, has not raised domestic prices of important fuels so far this year.  However, taken together with a decrease in wholesale price inflation in May and June, it may signal that the sizeable appreciation of the real in recent months is finally passing through.

In June and July, the Brazilian central bank kept its policy rate, the Selic, on hold at 19¾ percent.  In the minutes to the July meeting, the central bank expressed concern that core inflation measures remain too high to be compatible with the inflation target. Political scandals continue to make headlines, as members of the parties supporting President Lula have been accused of being bribed for their support for the administration's legislation.  Although initially the impact appeared to be limited, it is now beginning to affect the President's popularity and financial markets.

The economic recovery in Argentina appears to be maturing.  The unemployment rate has fallen relatively steadily to about half of its level at the peak of the crisis.  In the first quarter, real GDP rose at an annual rate of just 2 percent as construction took a respite from its earlier heady pace of expansion.  In the second quarter, industrial production rose 1.5 percent, about the same rate as in the first quarter, despite reports of energy shortages. Twelve-month consumer price inflation was over 9 percent in July, partly reflecting a jump in food prices earlier in the year.  Inflation remains above the upper end of the central bank's unofficial target range of 5-8 percent for 2005, but under the government's unofficial upper bound of 10.5 percent.

Since the completion of the debt swap, Argentina has held several successful local auctions for long-term bonds.  In face value terms, the government has placed $3 billion of inflation-indexed peso-denominated bonds.  Foreign participation in these auctions has reportedly been significant.  Subsequently, Argentina announced it will no longer auction inflation-indexed peso-denominated bonds, preferring instead dollar-denominated bonds. In the latest auction, dollar-denominated bonds with a face value of almost $0.5 billion were placed.  Another $0.5 billion was sold to the Venezuelan government in an off-market transaction.  However, Argentina's eventual access to international capital markets will largely depend on the outcome of ongoing negotiations with the IMF over a new program.

In Venezuela , preliminary estimates point to real GDP growth of 25 percent (a.r.) in the first quarter, supported by oil revenue-financed government spending.  Inflation eased a bit in the second quarter, but remains high, boosted by the March devaluation of the bolivar as well as by expansionary fiscal policies.  Oil production remains constrained by numerous problems at the government oil firm and the government's continued hostility toward private investors.  In addition, profits from the state-owned firm are being used for social programs rather than maintenance and investment, raising concerns about future production.  In July, President Chavez succeeded in amending the central bank law so that the state oil company is no longer obligated to sell its dollar inflows to the central bank.  Moreover, the central bank was forced to make a one-time transfer of $6 billion out of its nearly $29 billion of international reserves to a new fund that can potentially be tapped to pay for imports, to invest in social or infrastructure projects with high import content, or to service external debt.  Some portion of future oil revenues is also expected to be added to the fund, thus increasing Chavez's ability to fund social programs.
