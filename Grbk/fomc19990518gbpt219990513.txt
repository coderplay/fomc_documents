The gains  in  recent  uarters  ave been  impressive, t q h running  well  above  the  average f  the  preceding ouple  of ears--and, o c y we believe,  ore than  can  be attributed  mply  to  a sluggish  djustment  f  labor m si a o input o  the  surge n  output.

The performance  of the stock markets of the emerging market economies  in Asia was  impressive.

The yield spread of bonds  in these countries over Treasuries fell  about  50 basis  points  as well. All the major  floating currencies of emerging Asia appreciated  against the dollar,  generally from  1  to 3  percent. Gaining much more  was the Indonesian rupiah, which  appreciated  12 percent  against the dollar. An  unwinding of the effects  from a  bout of domestic  turmoil,  which  unsettled Indonesian  financial  markets in the period before  the March  FOMC,  helped magnify the appreciation  of the rupiah  as well  as the sharp rise in the Indonesia stock market.
