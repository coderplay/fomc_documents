Domestic Developments

Overview

The economy has  continued o  hum  along  in  recent onths,  propelled t m by renewed growth  in  consumer spending  and a  strong ptrend n  business  utlays  or ew u i o f n equipment. With incoming  reports  n corporate  arnings  roviding ore upside o e p m surprises  han  disappointments,  e  stock arket  rallied rther  uring he  intermeeting t th m fu d t period.  The favorable  inancial vironment nd a  general ood  of  optimism  among f en a m households  and  businesses  ode  well  for ustained  olid rowth  in  domestic  final b s s g demand.  However, growth  of  activity ems likely  o  be damped considerably  n  the se t i near  term  by  a slowing  of nventory  ccumulation rom  the  unsustainably isk  ace of i a f br p the  first lf f  the  year.  Accordingly,  e are  predicting at eal DP  will ncrease ha o w th r G i just  -1/4  percent,  t  an  annual ate,  ver  the  second  half. his  is oughly 2 a r o T r 1/2  percentage  oint lower  than  in  the ast  reenbook--the  rue ifference  eing p s l G t d b exaggerated y  the  switch n  aggregation  ethod to  chain eighting,  hich is b i m w w subtracting ound 1/4  percentage  oint rom  GDP  growth  rates  n average  throughout ar p f o the  projection riod. pe

Our forecast  or  economic  activity   1998 is  little  anged. We  continue  o f in ch t look  for n increase  n  real DP  of  about  2 percent,  n a  fourth  uarter  o  fourth a i G o q t quarter  asis.  The recent pside urprise  n  the  stock arket  suggests  n  added  boost b u s i m a to  private  emand next  year, hrough ealth  and cost-of-capital  ects,  t  the  further d t w eff bu appreciation   the  dollar  n exchange  markets  since arly uly  is ikely  o  result  n  a of o e J l t i greater  eakness in  net  exports han e previously  nticipated. w t w a

We  have  reassessed  ur  assumptions egarding  he  prospective  rowth  rate f o r t g o potential tput  in  light  f  the ew NIPA  data; e have  concluded  that e should  put ou o n w w the  underlying  yclically justed  rend or  real DP c ad t f G at  2.1  percent er  annum.  As a p result, r  GDP  forecast  mplies ittle  ange  in  the nemployment rate rom  the ou i l ch u f 4.8  percent eported  n  July.  While it s nlikely  hat here ill e any  broad  strains r i i u t t w b on  physical  apacity  n  the  industrial  ctor, e  tightness  he  labor arket  probably c i se th oft m will  show through  gradually  n  wages and prices. hat  said,  e have  once  again i T w trimmed our  forecast  f  core  CPI inflation    2-1/2 ercent n  1997 and 2-3/4 ercent o to p i p in  1998,  partly  ecause  of xpected reater  eakness  of  non-oil mport rices  nd a b e g w i p a slightly wer  level f  resource tilization. lo o u

Key  Background  Factors

We  have  retained  ur  previous ssumption hat he  federal  unds  rate ill e  held  at o a t t f w b 5-1/2 ercent ntil  ell  into ext  year  and then  raised  omewhat to  prevent   slippage p u w n s a in  real hort ates  s  inflation  ses. iven  the  normal  lags n  the  response f s r a ri G i o

However, it eems probable hat ome o s t s tightening  ill e  necessary,  t  least  or  time, o  avert n  ongoing  deterioration w b a f a t a in the  trend f  inflation    1999 and beyond. o in

The bond market  recently  ook  a  run  at  its  revious yclical ws  for ields, t p c o y and despite    backup in  the ast ouple  of  weeks,  long-term ates  emain  below the a p c r r levels  uilt  nto ur  previous orecast.  nd  because  we are  projecting  somewhat b i o f A a more benign  growth  and inflation  vironment oing  forward, e have  lowered  our en g w predicted  ath  for ominal  bond yields. onetheless,  e still pect  that ong-term p n N w ex l rates  ill rend pward gradually  s  the  perception  f  increasing  ost ressures w t u a o c p enhances  concerns  about  the  possibility  Fed  tightening--concerns t,  s  noted, e of tha a w assume  will ltimately   validated  y  the  System's ctions. u be b a

We  expect  that  hare rices ill how no sustained  pward movement  from s p w s u here  and will ecline ubstantially  1998.  The anticipated ward movement  in d s in up interest  tes hould end  to  erode  equity alues. lso  important,  hough, s  our ra s t v A t i expectation  hat   flattening   corporate  rofits ll n  time  undermine  the  view  that t a of p wi i the  S&amp;P 500 can  continue  o  record ouble-digit  rnings ains ven  in  a  moderatet d ea g e growth,  low-inflation  onomy.

Our fiscal  olicy ssumptions  ave  been  little  anged by the  enactment  of  the p a h ch budget  agreement.

Recent Developments  and Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

We estimate that eal r GDP grew 2-1/2  percent annual ate)  ast  uarter,    bit bove ( r l q a a the  June  Greenbook and BEA's advance  report. At  this  uncture,  major  uncertainty 1 j a about  the  second-quarter ithmetic  he  pace  of  stockbuilding.  literal  anslation ar ist A tr of  the  June  reports  n  manufacturing  nd  trade tocks ould  point o  a substantial o a s w t upward revision  o  BEA's already  efty dvance  estimate. oreover,  BEA's estimate t h a M of  inventory  nvestment utside  f  manufacturing  nd  trade--constructed  m  a  hodgei o o a fro podge of  direct  nd indirect idence--looks pecially  igh  by historical  andards. a ev es h st We  find o support or  such  rapid ccumulation  n  anecdotal  eports  r  other n f a i r o indicators. e way or  another,  e expect  that  EA  will ublish   number for On w B p a second-quarter ockbuilding at s  significantly er  than  the  data  currently   hand st th i ow in suggest--though t  necessarily   the  next  ("preliminary")  timate  f  second-quarter no in es o GDP. Even with  this  djustment,  owever,  our  assumed second-quarter te f a h a o inventory  ccumulation emains  well  above  the  pace  consistent th  moderate  growth a r wi in  sales,  nd,  thus,  e expect he ace  of  stockbuilding   diminish n  the  current a w t p to i quarter  nd thereby estrain al rowth  substantially.   a  result,  are  predicting a r re g As we that eal r GDP will dvance  at  an  annual ate f  2.2  percent n  the urrent  uarter, a r o i c q despite  n  acceleration   final  ales. a in s

The implied ecline  n  the b p w d i average  workweek  seems doubtful,  nd we are  anticipating onsiderable  napback  in a a c s total  ours  in  the  ensuing onths  (perhaps eptember, ather  han  August,  given  the h m S r t UPS  strike).  he low level f  initial  aims  in  recent  eeks certainly ggests T o cl w su a vibrant  emand  for orkers, s  do  a variety  f  other arket  indicators. d w a o m

The Longer-Run  Outlook

As indicated  n  the  overview, e have  reduced  our  forecast  f  real DP i w o G growth  over the  second  half  f  this  ear  noticeably  n  response o  the urprisingly  gh  rate f o y i t s hi o inventory  ccumulation  hrough  the  second  quarter. hat  buildup ame on  the  heels f a t T c o several  uarters  hat,  n  the evised IPA, now show a less avorable  rend n q t i r N f t i aggregate nventory-sales  tios.  t s  impossible  o  gauge  with  any confidence he i ra I i t t timing nd dimension  of  movements in  this  olatile ctor, t  we now expect  that a v se bu a downshift n  inventory  ccumulation ill irectly duce  real DP  growth  by roughly i a w d re G a  percentage oint n  the  second  half. he predicted  rowth  of  real inal  ales  as p i T g f s h been  revised p a  bit o  3-1/2 ercent. u t p

Anticipating at nventory  nvestment ill ave  been  brought o  a  sustainable th i i w h t pace  by the  end of  this  ear, e expect hat nventory  ccumulation ill e a  neutral y w t i a w b factor  n  GDP i growth  next  year.  As noted  in  the  overview, evisions   the  outlook r to for  final  ales  ncorporate t  only  some added  restraint  ming from  the  higher s i no co exchange  value  of  the ollar, t  also   modest  positive crement oming from  a d bu a in c higher  level f  stock rices. n  net, e expect hat  eal inal  ales like  eal DP) o p O w t r f s ( r G will  advance  about  2 percent. s before,  he  moderation ext  year  in  the  growth  of A t n aggregate emand is  rooted n  the  less avorable  inancial nditions  nticipated  r d i f f co a fo 1998 and in  our  view  that ates  f  accumulation f  physical  apital  n  the  household r o o c i and business  ectors  re  already igh.

Consumer spending. Our forecast  f  consumption  growth  is arginally o m stronger  han  last  ime, ut  the  basic ontour s  unchanged: a  strong ebound  in  the t t b c i r third  uarter  rom  a weak second  quarter  nd then  slowing  through he  remainder f q f a a t o this ear  and in  1998. y

The projected  lowing  in  consumption  growth, o  a  pace  of  about  2-1/2 ercent s t p in 1998,  owes mainly  to  a  projected  lackening  f  employment and income growth. s o Although  we continue o  expect  a  reversal  f  fortunes  n  the  stock arket  next ear, t t o i m y i is  likely  hat  he  bulk  of he  direct  ffect  f  a  retrenchment  n  equity rices  ould not t t t e o i p w be  felt  ntil  ate n  the  year r  in  1999,  given he  usual ags n  the esponse f u l i o t l i r o consumption  to  changes  in  wealth.  However, consumer  sentiment  ould  become a  less c favorable  actor  uch  sooner, or  it urrently  eems to  be on  the  high  side f  what f m f c s o might  normally e  expected n the  basis f  such  macro variables  s  the  rates  f b o o a o unemployment and  inflation,  rrent  r  prospective. cu o

The dollar  has  risen  about  3  percent  against  an  index  of eight  major  developing country  currencies  over the  intermeeting  period. Intense  exchange  market  pressures  in some  Asian countries  in July  resulted in  appreciation  of the  dollar in  terms  of several of their  currencies. The currencies  of Thailand  and  the  Philippines  have  depreciated; Indonesia's exchange  rate band  has been  abandoned;  and  the  currencies  of Malaysia and  Singapore  have  experienced  downward  market  pressure. In  contrast,  the  Mexican peso  has  appreciated  about  1-3/4 percent  in  terms  of the  dollar over the  intermeeting period  as  Mexican  congressional  elections  proceeded  without  incident. In  order  to counter recent  peso  strength,  Mexican  officials  increased  the amount  of their most recent  offering  of dollar  put options  and  planned  future  amounts.

Available  indicators  suggest  that economic  activity  expanded  further  during  the second  quarter  in  all  the  major  foreign  industrial  countries  except  Japan. The  very limited  data released  so  far  for  the  third  quarter  and  forward-looking  survey  data imply that output  growth continues. In  Germany,  production  data  for the  second  quarter show  further  output  growth. Real  manufacturing  orders  and  business  sentiment improved  sharply. However,  through  July,  German  unemployment  increased  further to 11.5  percent. In  the  United  Kingdom,  real  GDP  grew  at  an  annual  rate  of 3.5  percent in  the  second  quarter. The  unemployment  rate  fell  further  to  5.5  percent  in  July,  1.2 percentage  points  below  its  end-1996  level. Canadian  indicators  of production  and spending  show  further  expansion  in  the  second  quarter. Employment  rose  substantially in  the  second  quarter  and  edged  up  further  in July,  while  the  unemployment  rate declined  to  9  percent,  bringing  the  total  decline  in  that  rate  for  this  year  to 0.7 percentage  points. In  Japan,  weakness  of  industrial  production,  housing  starts,  and new  car registrations  in  the  second  quarter reflects  the  payback  from  strong  spending in  advance  of the  April  1 increase  in  the  consumption  tax. Increases  in  machinery orders  in  the  second  quarter  suggest  rising  investment  spending  ahead.

Inflation  in  the  foreign  G-7  countries  remains  subdued. For the  latest  months, twelve-month  increases  in  consumer  prices  continued below  2  percent  in  all  these countries  (including  Italy)  except  the  United  Kingdom. U.K.  retail  prices  excluding mortgage  interest rates  were  3.0  percent  above their  year-earlier  level  in  July,  above the  government's inflation  target. German  12-month  inflation  has  moved  up  slightly  to 1.9  percent.
