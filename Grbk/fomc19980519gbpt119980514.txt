SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Domestic Developments

Overview

The U.S.  economy has  continued  o  power ahead, uch more forcefully an  we t m th anticipated.  eal  GDP  growth  in  the  first arter  ay  well  have  exceeded  the R qu m Commerce  Department's  dvance  estimate f  4.2  percent,  nd  the  unemployment rate a o a plunged  to  4.3  percent n  April.  Although  the ightness   the  labor arket  has i t of m resulted  n  an  acceleration   wages,  price nflation  s  remained  subdued  to  date--a i of i ha product f,  mong  other hings,  ood productivity rformance,  avorable  il nd  nono a t g pe f o a oil mport  prices,  nd  ample domestic  manufacturing  apacity. i a c

As best  we can  tell, e igh  dollar  nd the  Asian  economic  slump  have  had th h a the  expected ffect  n  the  U.S.  trade alance;  he  available  ata hrough ebruary e o b t d t F point o  a sizable  ecline  n  net  exports. hus,  the  story ehind he  economy's t d i T b t surprisingly  pid rowth  lies  n  the  remarkable obustness  f  domestic  final  emand. ra g i r o d Although  the  effects  f  Asia's  roubles  n oil rices nd  interest tes  ave  been  a  plus o t o p a ra h in  that egard,  he ustained  ull arket  in  equities s  also een  important. he r t s b m ha b T resultant  n-up  in  wealth  has  provided ubstantial  petus o ousehold  demand, and ru s im t h the  reduced  cost f quity inance  as  helped  stimulate  usiness  nvestment. o e f h b i

Our forecasts   moderating rowth  of  demand have long  been  premised  on  an of g assumption hat ome reversal  f  stock rices  ould be  precipitated   a failure t s o p w by of corporate  arnings o  meet  unrealistic  pectations. wever, we have  also arned e t ex Ho w repeatedly  hat,  iven he  prevailing ychology  of  investors,  greater  hock--perhaps t g t ps a s a  significant  ghtening   monetary  policy--might   required  o  put  a damper on the ti in be t market's  ptrend.  That  concern  appears o  have  been  fully  arranted,  s  disappointing u t w a earnings  or ome firms ave  only  caused  investors   turn o  other ompanies,  and f s h to t c aggregate  rice-earnings  tios  ave  reached ew heights  n  recent eeks. We  still p ra h n i w think hat he  market  is ulnerable, t  with  our  forecast  ased  on  a steady ederal t t v bu b f funds  rate,  e have  projected  nly  a modest  setback  ver  the orecast riod--enough w o o f pe simply  to  stem  the ptrend n  the  market  PE. That  projection lds tock rices  ell u i ho s p w above  the  path e previously  ad  anticipated,  helps o  explain  he ustained  igher w h and t t s h level f  activity ing  forward n  this  orecast. o go i f

We  are  projecting at  eal DP  growth  will verage -1/4 ercent t  an annual th r G a 2 p a rate rom the  current  uarter  hrough  1999. This  rate s ore than  1-1/2  percentage f q t i m points lower han  the  trend f  the  past ear.  The moderation n  growth  reflects  t s t o y i no only  the aning effects  f he  easing f  financial nditions  hat  as  occurred ince w o t o co t h s last  pring ut  also he  abatement  of  favorable  ccelerator fects  n  investment. s b t a ef o

This  growth  scenario  mplies  hat  he  labor arket  will emain  taut,  nd  despite i t t m r a some good  news on benefits sts n  the  first-quarter   report,  foresee  efty co i ECI we h increases  head  for eal  ourly ompensation.  At the  same time, hough, e continue a r h c t w to  think hat  he  downswing in  actual  nd  expected rice nflation  er  the  past ear t t a p i ov y will end  to  restrain minal  wage hikes n  the  near  term.  We've raised  ur t no i o compensation  forecast  nly  marginally,  nd  a reassessment  f roductivity  ends o a o p tr suggests  o  us  that  usinesses  an  accommodate slightly rger  eal age gains. t b c la r w Meanwhile in  the  goods  markets, mple  factory  apacity  ill end  to  hold  down a c w t prices;  his  hould elp  to  offset  he pward pressure  n  the  prices  f radable  oods t s h t u o o t g associated  ith  the oderate  real  epreciation   the  dollar  nticipated   this  orecast. w m d of a in f On a consistently  asured  basis hat  akes ccount  of echnical anges  to  the  index, me t t a t ch core  CPI inflation  rojected  o  show a clear  pward tilt  om the .1  percent  ace  of isp t u fr 2 p the  past welve  months;  the ate f  increase  n  the  overall  PI is xpected o  move t r o i C e t closer  o  that n  the ore  as  a  result  f  a  firming n il rices. t i c o i o p

As with  any forecast,  bstantial  certainties  tend  he  present  rojection. su un at t p On the  negative  ide,  n  terms  of he  prospects  or ggregate  emand,  the  Asian  story s i t f a d continues  o  play  out.

Of course,  hese isks  re ot  mutually xclusive, t e t r a n e and  one  can  conceive f ombinations  hat ould push  events n  directions  have o c t w i we not  contemplated.

Key  Background  Factors

As noted  above,  the  forecast ntinues  o  be  conditioned  n a steady ederal  unds co t o f f rate. onger-term nterest  tes  ave  fluctuated etty  arrowly n  recent  eeks,  rather L i ra h pr n i w than  easing   bit s  we  had  thought ikely  n  light  f ur  earlier pectation   a softer a a l i o o ex of

With real nterest tes  nticipated   be  fairly  table, r  expectation  f ome i ra a to s ou o s small  slippage  n  equity rices  ests  n  the  notion hat  he  market  will ot  be  able o i p r o t t n t entirely  hrug ff he  failure   corporate  rofits   resume  a brisk ptrend n  coming s o t of p to u i months. Bullish  nalysts  o  date  have  found  ways of xplaining  way the  violation a t e a of traditional  luation  enchmarks--and hile  some of  those rguments  may well ave va b w a h some merit,  any of  them  seem strained  o  us. However, a bubble  market  requires  o m t n rigorous  ogic--just elief  hat  hat has  gone  up probably ill o  up further  nd  that l a  b t w w g a one can  bail ut  quickly nough  to  protect  ne's apital  hould ravity  eassert self. o e o c s g r it Consequently,  n  the  absence  of  any  dramatic hock, e have  assumed a  smaller i s w decline f  equity  rices n  this rojection,  d  one that  tarts om a  higher evel. o p i p an s fr l

With  regard o  fiscal  olicy,  he ncoming  data  on  expenditures  nd  on t p t i a withheld nd nonwithheld axes ave  all ointed o  the  likelihood at  he  budget a t h p t th t surplus  or iscal  ear  1998 will onsiderably  xceed  our  previous  stimate;  e are f f y c e e w now looking  for he  government  to  be in  the lack pwards of  $50  billion.  art f  the t b u P o revision  s  attributable  our  stronger  conomic  forecast,  t he  continuing  evenue i to e bu t r surprises  lso eem to  reflect gher ffective x  rates. lthough  it ill e  some time a s hi e ta A w b before  we have  the  data ecessary o  sort  ut  the  causes f  those igher ates,  review n t o o h r a of  the  usual uspects  uggests  hat  t ould be  unwise  to  look  for  substantial s s t i w a reversal; nsequently,  have also  raised  ur  forecast  f he  fiscal  999 surplus  o co we o o t 1 t more than  $40 billion.

In  the  aggregate,  he utlook or conomic  growth  abroad  has  changed  little t o f e since he  March Greenbook. On an export-weighted sis,  e expect hat oreign  eal t ba w t f r GDP  will ncrease  bout  2 percent n  1998 and 3 percent  n  1999. On  a broad  importi a i i weighted  basis,  he t real exchange  value  of  the ollar  as  moved down, on  balance, d h since he  March Greenbook.

Government  spending.

Real  purchases y state  nd  local overnments  are  projected  o  rise  .2  percent b a g t 2 in  1998 and  2.4  percent n i 1999. Spending  in  this  ector  as  been  on the oft  ide n s h s s i recent uarters, rticularly  the  case  of  construction, re we estimate  hat q pa in whe t expenditures  ave  fallen  bout  4 percent ince heir  eak  in  the  first arter  f  last h a s t p qu o year.  This  weakness  seems  somewhat surprising ven  the  improved  positions   most gi of state  udgets nd  the emand for  spending n infrastructure,    so  we are  looking or b a d o and f a  moderate  bounceback  in  construction tivity er he  forecast  eriod. n the  tax ac ov t p O front,  e continue o  assume  that arge urpluses  ill rompt  many  state  overnments w t l s w p g to  enact inor  tax uts.

Reflecting  trong  .S.  activity d  the  lagged ffects   the  dollar's  preciation,  al s U an e of ap re imports re  projected  o  rise -1/4 ercent n  1998 and  then  slow  to  a 7 percent  ain a t 9 p i g in  1999. All  told, t  exports  re  projected  o  reduce eal  .S.

Labor markets.

International Developments

Recent  Developments

Developments  since  the March  FOMC  meeting  point  to a weakening  of foreign economic  activity  on  average,  as we  had  expected. Output  has declined  substantially in Japan  and  several  Asian  developing  countries  but  continued  to  expand  robustly  in continental  Europe  and  Canada. The  dollar,  having  risen  against  the yen  and  declined against  European  currencies  over  the intermeeting  period,  is  unchanged  on  average  in terms  of major currencies.1 It  has  appreciated  slightly  against  a  broad  set  of currencies including  those  of emerging  market  economies. Reflecting  the  combined  effects  of the downturn  in Asia, past  appreciation  of the  dollar, strong  U.S.  domestic  demand,  and some  residual  seasonal  variation  in trade  flows,  U.S.  real  net  exports  subtracted  an estimated  2-1/4 percentage  points  from  GDP  growth  in the first  quarter.

Over the  intermeeting  period, the  dollar declined  almost 4  percent  against  the mark,  which  was  bolstered  by  signs  of robust  German  economic  activity  and  by prospects  for a smooth  launch  of the  euro  following  the  EU  summit  in  early  May. Although  the eleven  countries  selected  to join the  currency  union  came  as  no  surprise, the continued  above-trend  expansion  of these  economies  supported  the view  that German  interest  rates  may  rise  before  the end  of the  year. German  short-term  and long-term interest  rates  rose  about  8  basis points  over  the  intermeeting  period,  and French  rates  rose  slightly  more. Italian  short-term  rates  declined  further,  narrowing their  gap  with  German  rates  to  140 basis  points. Equity  markets  in  continental  Europe rose  from  1 to  7  percent  over  the  period,  to  new  highs  in  most  cases,  bringing  their total  rise  since  the  turn  of the  year  to between  23  and  46  percent. For the  most part, these  increases  have  led  to  declines  in  earnings/price  ratios  that  have  been  roughly matched  by  comparable  declines  in  long-term  real  interest rates.

The  dollar  rose  1-1/4  percent  against  the yen  as  news  of further  weakening  in Japanese  economic  activity  more  than offset  the effects  of the  announcement  of  a large fiscal  stimulus  package  and  massive  intervention  by  the  Bank  of Japan  in  support  of the yen. On April  9-10,  the BOJ  sold  $21.8  billion dollars  against  yen,

Japanese  interest  rates  fell  10  to 28  basis  points  along  the  yield  curve,  and the  Nikkei equity  price  index  fell  almost  6 percent  over  the period. The  dollar also  firmed  more than  3 percent  against  the pound,  as  U.K.  GDP growth  slowed  and  expectations  of a
