Domestic Developments

We  had  thought hat  he  sub-2  percent  eal t t r GDP growth  recorded  n  the  second i quarter  as something f  a  fluke,  ut  the eacceleration   conomic  activity  is w o b r ofe th summer has  been  even  sharper  han  anticipated   he ugust  Greenbook. t int A Domestic  final  emand has  remained  strong, spite  ome damping effects d de s of higher ortgage  rates  n home construction,   inventory  nvestment  as m o and i h evidently  ecovered rom  the ow  pace  of he  spring;  ll  old,  omestic pending r f l t a t d s has  been  increasing ster  han e expected. xports ave  accelerated fa t w E h impressively  f ate,  ut,  n  terms f he ontribution   he  external  ector  o o l b i o t c oft s t real DP, that ise  as  been  offset  y  stronger ports. lthough  the abor G r h b im A l market  has  remained aut,  nd  prices  ave  continued  o ncrease  ppreciably r t a h t i a fo oil ome other ommodities,  ore  inflation  s  remained  subdued. s c c ha

The  upcoming benchmark  revisions   the ational  ncome  accounts ould to n i c change  the ecent  umbers significantly,    at  present  eal DP  appears o  have r n but r G t risen t n annual ate f  about  3-1/2 ercent  ver he  first ree uarters  f he a a r o p o t th q o t year.  We  are  expecting  he rend o emain  at east  hat  trong  n he ext ouple t t t r l t s i t n c of  quarters, though 2K  distortions  uld  make it xtremely ifficult  see. al Y co e d to Looking  beyond  the  very  near erm, owever, f  tock rices  ail  o egain  he t h i s p f t r t ground  they ecently ve  lost--and  are  assuming  that  hey  will  ot--waning r ha we t n wealth  effects  hould egin  to emper  growth  in  demand growth  as  we move s b t through ext  year. n

In  this  orecast,  visions   our  underlying  ssumptions bout  the utlook or f re in a a o f the  foreign  xchange  value f he  dollar  nd  for iscal licy  end o  work e o t a f po t t against    more marked slowing f  GDP  growth.  With  the  dollar  ow assumed  to a o n decline  oticeably er  the  forecast  eriod, e  external  ector  s xpected o n ov p th s i e t exert ess rag  than  we previously  rojected. reover,  we believe  hat  he l d p Mo t t outcome  of his  utumn's udget  process  ill e  to  leave ederal  pending t a b w b f s higher han  we had  assumed--or, r hat  atter, an  the urrent  udget t fo t m th c b agreement  allows. hus,  we are rojecting--as ore--that  al DP  will T p bef re G expand  at  a  rate  f  about  percent  n  the atter lf  f 000.  And,  in n initial o 3 i l ha o 2 a extension  f ur  forecast,   are  showing  an  increase  n  real  DP  of o o we i G 2-3/4 ercent  n  2001 as  less timulative  nancial nditions sh  the  pace  of p i s fi co pu expansion  further low  that  f otential tput. be o p ou

However,  the  projected celeration   activity   either  arge  nough  nor  soon de of isn l e enough  to  prevent  urther ghtening  abor arkets,  nd  we expect hat  he f ti ofl m a t t unemployment rate  ill all  o   percent  y  early  ext ear efore dging ack w f t 4 b n y b e b up to  4-1/4 ercent  uring  2001.

We  project  hat  he ore PI will  ick p  from  a  pace  of in t t c C p u about  2 percent  n  1999  to  2-3/4 ercent  n  2000, nd  then  edge  up  further  ust i p i a toj

Most of  the  dollar's  cline  gainst  he ajor-currencies  dex  came from  a  4.4 de a t m in percent epreciation,    balance,  gainst  he en.

However,  after  he  G-7 expressed  oncern  about en  appreciation, t c y Bank of  Japan  Governor  Hayami indicated at  here ight  be  some room for th t m maneuver  that ould  allow  the  BOJ to  respond o  foreign  xchange w t e developments,  nd  in  recent  ays  the en  has  given ack  some of ts  arlier a d y b i e strength.  he yen's  et  appreciation pears o  have  had a  negative  mpact n T n ap t i o Japanese tock rices, pecially   the  export nd  technology ectors, t  bond s p es in a s bu prices  allied. r

Economic  activity abroad. Economic activity  in the major foreign industrial economies  has strengthened. Second-quarter  GDP in Japan did not show the extent of payback  that many had  expected following very  strong first-quarter growth and instead registered an increase  close  to  1 percent at an annual rate.  In particular,  private  consumption  continued to be firm.  Third-quarter Japanese indicators  of activity  and demand have been  mixed: August industrial  production was strong, but the  unemployment rate remains at record levels.

Expansion  in the euro area appears to have taken better hold in the  major core countries. Data from the current quarter  (industrial production)  and more forward-looking  indicators (orders  and  confidence)  suggest that Germany  should rebound  from  its disappointing  second-quarter  performance,  and growth  appears to have  firmed  in France  and Italy. According to revised  data, the  pace  of economic  activity  accelerated  in the United  Kingdom in the second quarter to an annual rate  of 2-1/2 percent,  and an array of third-quarter indicators (industrial production,  retail  sales,  and confidence)  point to a further quickening. The Canadian  economy  is slowing  somewhat from its unsustainable  pace earlier this year, but it  still posted growth  of 3-1/4 percent  in the second  quarter.  Recent indicators  are consistent with continued  solid expansion.

Price pressures  remain  subdued, despite  some passthrough of higher oil prices into broader price  measures. Oil-price increases helped  Japanese  CPI inflation (twelve-month basis)  turn positive  in August,  the first increase  since January. Euro-area  harmonized  CPI inflation  also  moved up a bit, but  still is only about  1 percent. Despite the  pickup in activity and demand  in the  United Kingdom,  retail price inflation  at just over 2 percent is  well below the  official  2-1/2 percent target.  Canadian  headline  inflation  at 2 percent is comfortably  within the  official 1 to 3 percent  target range,  and core inflation  is only  1-1/2 percent.

Many  Asian countries have exhibited  further signs  of strong recoveries  amid more favorable  financial  market conditions,  although  the region has been affected  by several  unrelated negative  events.  Another very strong GDP performance  in the  second quarter has confirmed  that Korea is in the midst of a robust expansion.  Boosted  in part  by recovery  of the global electronics  market, output also strengthened  further  in Malaysia, the Philippines,  Hong  Kong,  and

Taiwan (although  he  economic  effects  f he  Taiwan earthquake hould ecome t o t s b more apparent oon).  China  appears o  have  continued  ts  ecent low  but s t i r s positive  rowth  in  the econd  quarter.  n  contrast,  e  Indonesian  conomy g s I th e remains  troubled  y ongoing  domestic urmoil. b t
