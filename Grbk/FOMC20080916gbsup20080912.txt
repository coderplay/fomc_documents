Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Retail Sales

Total nominal retail sales decreased 0.3 percent in August; sales in the retail control group of stores fell 0.5 percent following gains in June and July that were revised down. Although a drop in gasoline prices contributed to the decrease in nominal retail control spending in August, sales fell back in a number of other categories, especially nonstore retailers and electronics and appliance stores.  Given our projection for consumer prices, this nominal decline would appear to translate into a further decrease in real PCE control, albeit not as large as the declines in June and July.  Among outlets excluded from the retail control, sales at building material and supply stores declined last month, but sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers increased.

Consumer Sentiment

The early September reading for the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer attitudes jumped sharply from the low levels recorded over the past several months, and inflation expectations fell; declines in gasoline prices likely contributed to both movements.  This month's preliminary sentiment figure reflected large increases in nearly all of the components, especially those included in the expected conditions subindex.  Among those items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved noticeably and stood at its lowest level in nearly a year.  Households' appraisals of buying conditions for cars strengthened, apparently in response to the introduction of incentive programs, but respondents' attitudes toward purchases of homes worsened.  The median of expected inflation over the next twelve months dropped more than a percentage point, to 3.6 percent, and the median of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years moved down to 2.9 percent, about the same as its average over the past five years.

Business Inventories

The book value of retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, rose at a solid pace in July.  Combined with the inventory figures for manufacturing and wholesale trade, book-value inventories in the entire manufacturing and trade sector, excluding motor vehicles and parts, rose at an annual rate of $124 billion in July, a modest step-up from the second-quarter accumulation.  However, because changes in book-value inventories can be heavily influenced by price changes that lead to revaluation of existing stocks, these book-value data can differ substantially from real inventory changes.

Federal Government Budget

According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the federal government recorded a deficit (adjusted for routine payment timing shifts and financial transactions) in August of $91 billion-wider than in the same month last year and a little above our expectation. The adjusted deficit for the 12 months ending in August was $403 billion, more than $210 billion larger than it was in the same year-earlier period.

Receipts in August were almost 6 percent below their level a year earlier, probably reflecting the slowing pace of economic activity.  Individual income and payroll tax revenues, which made up the bulk of receipts in August, were 4 percent below their yearearlier level.  The small amount of corporate tax payments typically made in August was also lower than its level a year earlier.

Outlays in August were up 5 percent from their year-earlier level, which left the cumulative increase in spending for the 12 months ending in August a little slower than the brisk pace in the preceding 12 months.  Defense spending in August was almost 7 percent above its year-earlier level and was in line with the staff's expectation.

Producer Prices

The producer price index for finished goods declined 0.9 percent in August reflecting a sizable drop in energy prices.  The PPI for finished food rose 0.3 percent, and excluding food and energy, the PPI for finished goods rose a modest 0.2 percent last month. However, prices for capital goods other than motor vehicles and high-tech equipment posted another large increase.  In addition, cost pressures continued to be evident at earlier stages of processing.  The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose 1.7 percent in August following increases of 1.2 percent and 2 percent in June and July, respectively.  Last month's price increases were again concentrated in chemicals, plastics, and other energy-intensive materials.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $62.2 billion in July, as a large increase in imports of goods and services more than offset a strong increase in exports.

<!-- missing-text -->

In July, exports rose 3.3 percent, supported by a surge in exports of automotive products. Exports of consumer goods, industrial supplies, capital goods, and services also increased briskly.  In contrast, agricultural products fell back after jumping up in June.

The value of imports of goods and services surged 3.9 percent in July, led by a strong increase in imports of oil (both on account of higher volumes as well as an increase in price).  Imports of industrial supplies, capital goods, and services also increased.  In contrast, imports of automotive products and consumer goods edged down.

Revisions to previously published data led to a slight downward revision to nominal export growth in first half of the 2008, primarily due to lower exports of services, and a slight upward revision to nominal import growth over the same period.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In August, prices of core imports rose just 0.2 percent, down sharply from increases near 1 percent in previous months.  Much of the deceleration reflected slower rates of increase for prices of material-intensive imports, consistent with the recent easing of many primary commodity prices. Prices of imported finished goods also slowed noticeably in August to a monthly rate of only 0.1 percent.  Relative to the second quarter, core import prices for the July-August period were up 6.8 percent at an annual rate, marking a noticeable step-down from the previous two quarters.  Price increases for material-intensive goods accounted for the lion's share of the July-August increase, although finished goods prices also contributed.

Oil. The BLS price index for imported oil declined 12.8 percent in August, reflecting the steep fall in spot oil prices since mid-July.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil averaged $117 per barrel in August and has continued to decline and closed at $100.68 on September 11.

Exports. Core export prices declined 2 percent in August, the first monthly decline in nearly two years.  The fall in core export prices was entirely attributable to a drop in prices for material-intensive goods; agricultural export prices fell 9.6 percent and those for nonagricultural industrial supplies fell 2.5 percent.  In contrast, prices for exported finished goods rose 0.2 percent in August, similar to recent rates of increase.  The average price of core exports in July and August rose at an annual rate of 7.6 percent from the second quarter, down from double-digit rates of increase in the first half of the year.
