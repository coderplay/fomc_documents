Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Real Gross Domestic Product

According to the BEA's advance release, real GDP moved up at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter following a decline at a ¾ percent rate in the second quarter.  The BEA's third-quarter estimate somewhat exceeded our expectation, as stronger-than-anticipated estimate of private inventory investment more than offset a weaker-than-expected final sales.

Final sales accelerated in the third quarter, increasing at an annual rate of 2½ percent after having risen at a ¾ percent rate in the second quarter.  This acceleration was driven by private domestic expenditures, which turned up in most categories following secondquarter declines.  Real personal consumer expenditures increased at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter after having fallen at an annual rate of 1.0 percent in the second quarter-a swing that was particularly pronounced in the durable goods category because of the temporary boost to motor vehicle purchases from the 'cash-for-clunkers' program.  Residential investment spending also turned up in the third quarter, rising at an annual rate of nearly 25 percent, following 14 consecutive quarterly declines.  Though expenditures on business fixed investment continued to contract in the third quarter, the rate of spending decline moderated a fair bit, in part as a result of a small upturn in outlays on equipment and software.  In the government sector, federal spending posted another strong quarterly increase, at an annual rate of 7.9 percent, while spending at the state and local level edged lower.  In the external sector, imports of goods and services were estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 16-½ percent in the third quarter and exports to have risen at an annual rate of almost 15 percent.  On net, trade in goods and services subtracted about ½ percentage point from the change in real GDP reported in the advance  third-quarter estimate after having boosted the second-quarter change by more than 1½ percentage points.

The BEA estimated that a slower pace of private inventory liquidation contributed about a percentage point to the change in real GDP in the third quarter:  Real private inventories fell at an annual rate of $131 billion following a $160 billion decline in the preceding three-month period.

On the income side of the accounts, real disposable personal income fell at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the third quarter, retracing much of a second-quarter increase that had been augmented by one-time economic recovery payments of $250 to beneficiaries of

Social Security and other retirement programs.  The personal saving rate fell to 3.3 percent in the third quarter after having jumped to 4.9 percent in the second quarter. According to the BEA, nonfarm business output rose at an annual rate of 4.0 percent in the third quarter; this implies that nonfarm business productivity increased at an annual rate of 7½ percent in the third quarter following an increase at a 7 percent rate in second quarter.

Consumer Spending

Real PCE fell 0.6 percent in September after jumping in August.  For the third quarter as a whole, PCE moved up at an annual rate of about 3½ percent.  The recent monthly volatility was the result of swings in motor vehicle sales during and after the government's cash-for-clunkers program.  Real outlays for other goods and services moved up by a robust ¼ percent per month, on average, in the third quarter.  While the spending gains were broad-based across the various categories of goods and services, the increases for furniture, electronics, and other durable goods were especially pronounced. Real disposable personal income was reported to have fallen for the fourth consecutive month in September.

The final October reading from the Reuters/University of Michigan survey indicated that consumer sentiment edged down relative to September and remained at a level consistent with only sluggish gains in spending.

Prices and Labor Costs

The latest monthly readings on PCE prices came in broadly similar to our estimates in the October Greenbook and indicate that consumer price inflation has remained subdued in recent months.  Both total and core PCE prices edged up 0.1 percent in September. Broader measures of inflation also showed a deceleration in prices over the past year. The change in GDP prices over the four quarters ending in 2009:Q3 was only ¾ percent compared with the increase of 2½ percent over four quarters ending a year earlier.  GDP prices excluding food and energy also decelerated over that period, reflecting a drop in core PCE inflation and a deceleration in both residential and business fixed investment prices.

After decelerating sharply in the first half of the year, measures of labor costs rebounded in the third quarter, posting moderate rates of increase.  Based on the most recent NIPA data, we estimate that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector (as published in the productivity and cost release) increased at an annual rate of nearly 2 percent in the third quarter after decreasing at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half.  The fall in this measure of compensation per hour in the first half included a drop of 4¾ percent (annual rate) in the first quarter, which may have reflected a steep decline in bonus payments; a similar drop in bonuses reported in the employment cost index (ECI).

Following an increase at an annual rate of only ¾ percent over the first half of the year, the ECI for private industry workers increased at an annual rate of 1¾ percent over the three months ending in September.  The ECI index for wages and salaries, which increased at an annual rate of 1¾ percent over the three months ending September, was boosted by gains in several industry categories such as retail trade, accommodation and food services, and other services, which may reflect the increase in the minimum wage in July.  The ECI index for benefits rose more slowly, increasing at an annual rate of 1 percent over the three months ending in September, as increases in a number of components were partially offset by declines in the retirement and savings, state unemployment, and workers' compensation components.

According to the ECI, employer contributions for health insurance rose 4¾ percent over the 12 months ending in September, up from a rise of 4 percent over the preceding year. Taken together, the available indicators thus far provide no evidence that any dramatic change in the rate of increase of health insurance costs is in the offing.  Private surveyswhich typically show somewhat larger increases than the ECI-suggest that overall premiums (that is, the shares paid by both employers and employees) will rise in the neighborhood of 6 to 7 percent in 2010, just a bit above the survey results for 2009.

Among the major plans for public employees, premiums in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program are expected to increase 7½ percent, on average, in 2010 after a rise of 6½ percent in 2009.  The premiums for the California Public Employees' Retirement System are expected to move up 3 percent in 2010 after a 5 percent increase in 2009.
