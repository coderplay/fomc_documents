Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Spending and Confidence

Retail sales appeared to improve last month.  Total nominal retail sales decreased 1.8 percent in November; sales in the retail control group of stores fell 1.5 percent following declines in September and October that were slightly larger than reported earlier.  A large drop in nominal sales at gasoline stations in November, reflecting declining gasoline prices, more than accounted for the overall drop in nominal retail control spending last month; elsewhere, nominal sales moved up in a number of categories, especially at general merchandisers and electronics and appliance stores. Among outlets excluded from retail control, sales at building material and supply stores and motor vehicles and parts dealers fell further last month.

The early December reading of consumer sentiment from the Reuters/University of Michigan survey improved a bit, although the index remained close to the all-time lows recorded in 1980.  The increase mostly reflected improved perceptions of buying conditions for large household appliances.  Among those items not included in the overall index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months moved up noticeably and stood just below its highest level on record. Households' appraisals of buying conditions for cars strengthened, but their attitudes toward purchases of homes reversed much of the gain in November.

The survey measures of expected inflation moved lower, likely influenced by sharp declines in gasoline prices and expectations of deep discounts more generally.  The median of expected inflation over the next 12 months dropped more than a percentage point, to 1.7 percent, and the median of expected inflation over the next 5 to 10 years moved down to 2.7 percent, at the low end of the range recorded over the past five years.

Business Inventories

Folding in a small decline in the book value of retail inventories (excluding motor vehicles and parts), book-value inventories in the entire manufacturing and trade sector (excluding motor vehicles and parts) dropped at an annual rate of $97 billion in October as businesses continued to rapidly deplete their inventory stocks.  Of course, because changes in book-value inventories can be heavily influenced by price changes that lead to revaluation of existing stocks, these book-value data can differ substantially from real inventory changes.  Despite firms' efforts to keep up with declining sales, the ratio of book-value inventories to sales (excluding motor vehicles) moved up steeply again in October.

Producer Prices

The producer price index (PPI) for finished goods declined 2.2 percent in November reflecting a sharp drop in finished energy prices.  Core finished goods prices edged up 0.1 percent as prices for most categories of both core consumer goods and capital equipment were soft.  Prices at earlier stages of processing also retreated.  The PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy declined 2.3 percent, marking the third consecutive month this index has declined.  The intermediate price declines were widespread, with prices of certain metal products, chemicals, and other energy-intensive goods posting especially large declines.

The PPI medical price indexes, which are used as source data for PCE prices, were also soft on average in November.

The Domestic Financial Economy

Revisions to Household Net Worth

The December release of the Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States included substantial revisions to the estimates of the market value of corporate equities and the market value of residential real estate; accordingly, the release also included revisions to the estimates of household net worth.  The revision to the value of residential real estate boosted the trajectory of household net worth from 1999 to 2007 but reduced it after that; the net effect of this revision in the second quarter of this year was negligible.  The revision to the value of corporate equities raised the trajectory of household net worth from 1999 to the second quarter of 2008. On net, the estimate of household net worth in the second quarter of this year was revised up $3 trillion.

Household Net Worth

<!-- missing-text -->

For the value of corporate equities, the revisions were based on the following improved data sources and methods:  For common shares of publicly traded firms, values are now benchmarked to quarterly aggregates of microdata from the Center for Research in Security Prices.  For preferred shares of publicly traded firms, values are now estimated using a perpetual inventory method based on data from Standard &amp; Poor's and Thomson Financial Services.  For closely held firms, values are estimated using data from the Internal Revenue Service, Compustat, and Forbes . 1

For the value of residential real estate, the revisions were based on the following improved data sources:  For owner-occupied housing, values are now benchmarked to American Housing Survey data for 2001, 2003, and 2005, and changes in the value of single-family homes in nonbenchmark quarters are estimated using a recently developed house price index from LoanPerformance (LP).  Previously, we used an index from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (formerly the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight).  For renter-occupied housing, changes in the value of single-family homes in nonbenchmark quarters are estimated using the LP index; this category had no revisions to benchmarks.

The International Economy

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit widened to $57.2 billion in October, as a fall in imports was more than offset by a significant decline in exports.

<!-- missing-text -->

In October, the value of exports of goods and services declined 2.2 percent.  Much of this decline was the result of a fall in exports of agricultural goods and industrial supplies, which largely reflected a decrease in the prices of these goods.  Exports of aircraft, automotive products, consumer goods, and services also moved lower.  In contrast, exports of capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) rose in October.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of imports of goods and services fell 1.3 percent in October, led by declines in imports of non-oil industrial supplies, capital goods, and automotive products.  These declines were partly offset by an increase in the value of oil imports, which reflected a higher volume of oil imports.  Imports of consumer goods also moved up, because of increases in imports of pharmaceuticals and household goods.  Imports of services were essentially unchanged.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. Following October's 0.9 percent decline-which had been the largest one-month decline over the 14-year history of the index-prices of core imports fell 2.1 percent in November.  Most of November's drop was due to a fall of 5.6 percent in the prices for material-intensive goods.  Within material-intensive goods, prices for foods, chemicals, and metals all dropped sharply.  After being unchanged in October, prices for finished goods fell 0.4 percent in November, with lower prices for all major categories.  For finished goods, November's price decline is the largest one-month decline since May 1997.

The average level of core import prices in October and November was 8½ percent at an annual rate below the third-quarter average, as prices in all sub-categories posted declines.  The main contributors to the overall price decline were foods and non-oil industrial supplies, whose prices fell at annual rates of 17½ percent and 24¼ percent respectively.  The average price of imported finished goods declined at a ½ percent pace.

Oil. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' price index for imported oil fell 25.8 percent in November, reflecting the continued steep drop in spot oil prices.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil averaged $57 per barrel in November and has continued to decline, closing most recently on December 11 at $47.98.

Exports. Following a decline of 2.4 percent in October, prices of exported core goods fell 3.8 percent in November.  Prices of nonagricultural industrial supplies fell 8.2 percent in November-a sharper decline than the drop of 4.2 percent in October.  Prices of finished goods, which had increased 0.4 percent in October, fell 0.3 percent in November. After dropping 8.4 percent in October, prices of exported agricultural products fell 7.0 percent in November.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The average level of core export prices in October and November was 20 percent at an annual rate below the third-quarter average, as prices for material-intensive goods fell sharply.  Prices for agricultural products and non-agricultural supplies fell at annual rates of 47 and 36 percent respectively.  For exported finished goods, falling prices in November did not offset the price increases in October.  As such, the average price level for finished goods was up at an annual rate of 1½ percent from the third-quarter average.
