The economy continues  o  barrel  head, roducing efty  ncreases   output nd t a p h i in a employment. Our guess  is hat  eal DP  growth  will pproach  5  percent,  n t r G a ata annual  rate,   the urrent  uarter, sed  on  solid  ains n  most  categories in c q ba g i of spending--domestic  d foreign.  ith  rising  sset  rices  ontinuing  o  boost an W a p c t wealth  and  credit  emaining eadily  vailable,  e  run-up n  interest  tes  his r r a th i ra t year  has  failed  o ut  much of   dent  in  aggregate  emand to his  oint. t p a d t p

Nonetheless,  here re nly  a  few  signs hat  nderlying  nflation  ends  re t a o t u i tr a deteriorating.  though  the  labor  arket  is idely  reported  o e  extremely  aut, Al m w t b t employers  have  managed to  maintain   strong  ace  of verall  iring  ithout a p o h w a step-up  n  measured  wage inflation.  is  could e  at east  n  part ecause i Th b l i b employers  are  compensating orkers  in  ways not  captured  y  the  available w b statistics,  we also hink hat ominal  pay  increases  ave  been  muted by  the but t t n h lagged  effects  f ast  ear's ry  low  inflation.  rthermore,  any firms ppear o l y ve Fu m a still    be  managing  to  offset creases   labor  nd  other  osts  hrough to in in a c t productivity  provements, nd  "core" nflation  tes  ave  remained  subdued. im a i ra h That  said,    steep ebound  in  oil rices  as  left  ts  ark on  overall  onsumer a r p h i m c inflation,  d  the PI has  risen  -1/2 ercent  ver  the ast welve onths--up an C 2 p o p t m from 1-1/2 ercent arlier is  ear  and  the ighest  ncrease  ince  arly 997. p e th y h i s e 1

Key Background Factors

Barring n autonomous  stock arket  slide,  believe  hat  he  growth  of a m we t t aggregate emand is  unlikely  o  moderate  unless onetary  policy  pplies  ome d t m a s additional straint    the  coming  months.

International Developments

While  recent readings from different  regions have  been mixed, growth  of overall economic  activity  abroad  appears  to have moderated  only  slightly in  the second half of this year from its rapid pace  of the first half.  Japanese output unexpectedly  declined  in the third quarter,  and Japanese  growth going forward has been marked down  somewhat.  However, robust recent indicators for the euro area suggest  a greater momentum of domestic  demand which,  with the anticipated  stimulus from the  depreciation  of the euro, has caused an upward revision in projected  growth.  The recovery  in the developing  economies  appears to be proceeding  generally  as expected. On balance,  foreign growth is projected to average  about 3-1/2 percent per  annum over the forecast period, down from this year's rate of 4 percent  and little  changed  from the forecast in the November Greenbook.

Movements  of dollar exchange  rates  over the intermeeting period have been roughly offsetting,  with some weakening  of the  dollar against the  yen and strengthening relative to the euro. Looking forward,  the dollar is expected to depreciate moderately  in real terms over the forecast  period, as the expanding U.S. external  deficit and bright growth prospects  abroad  diminish global investors' relative demand  for dollar assets.  Mainly  because of an improvement of the U.S. competitive position arising from this projected  depreciation, the drag on U.S. growth  from net exports  is expected to wane over time.  The recent surge in spot crude  oil prices  has resulted  in  a ratcheting  up of the near-term  oil price outlook, but  it is  still expected  that fundamentals  will push prices lower later in the forecast period. Core import prices are projected to continue to rise modestly.

Recent Developments

International Financial Markets. Since  the November FOMC meeting, the exchange  value of the dollar is little changed  on balance,  as movements  against various currencies  have been  largely offsetting.  The dollar has depreciated  1-1/4 percent  versus  the Japanese  yen but appreciated  2-3/4 percent  against  the euro. The euro hit a new low  in early December, crossing below parity with the dollar, reportedly on market concerns  about euro-area  governments' commitment to market-oriented  policies. Signs of a cyclical  upswing in Europe have helped push up bond yields over the intermeeting  period.  European equity  prices have risen  strongly.  In  emerging  markets,  financial  conditions appear to have improved on balance  over the past  month; yield spreads  on sovereign bonds have continued  to fall,  and  equity  prices have generally risen.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts  of the  System or the Treasury.

Economic  activity  abroad. Recent data on economic activity in the foreign industrial countries  have varied  across regions. In the  euro  area, growth  picked up sharply in the third quarter.  Most forward-looking  indicators--notably consumer and business sentiment--suggest  further  strength.  In contrast, Japanese growth turned  negative  in the third  quarter following  a spurt in  the first half of the year,  as  domestic demand  fell sharply. Underlying  inflationary  pressures remain quiescent in the foreign  industrial  countries,  though higher oil prices continue to boost headline inflation.  In  the euro area, consumer price inflation has edged  up further, but is  still comfortably  below  the 2 percent ceiling specified by the European  Central Bank.  Japanese  core consumer prices remain flat,  while wholesale prices continue  to decline.

The latest indicators  of activity  in developing  countries  have also been diverse. In Latin America,  the Mexican  economy continued  to register robust growth, and in  Argentina there has been  evidence of a nascent recovery. However, activity weakened  in Brazil in the  third quarter after a  strong performance  in the first half of the  year.  China,  Hong Kong,  and Korea have continued  to recover strongly, and activity in Taiwan  appears  to be rebounding  from the September earthquake. In contrast,  growth  in several ASEAN countries  slowed  in the third quarter from an unsustainably rapid second-quarter  pace.  Inflation pressures  in  developing countries have been  generally  subdued.  In developing  Asia, inflation  rates remain  low or negative. In Latin America,  with the exception of Brazil, inflation rates  have edged  down further.

U.S.  net exports and prices.  The nominal U.S.  trade deficit widened  slightly in September, bringing the  expansion in the deficit  for the third quarter as a whole to  $35  billion  at a  seasonally  adjusted  annual rate. In  the third  quarter, the value of exports  rose, reflecting  strong  increases in capital  goods  and industrial materials,  but the value of imports rose  even faster, with sizable  increases recorded  in all  major categories  except food. Import prices--most notably oil-rose strongly  relative to export  prices in the third quarter. Despite the rise in the nominal  deficit  in the third quarter,  the contribution  of net exports  to U.S. real GDP growth was less negative than in the  previous two quarters, as real export growth picked up and real import growth continued  at the  second-quarter pace.

The increase in the price  of non-oil  goods imports  quickened in November,  and these prices  rose at an annual  rate of nearly  2  percent for October and November combined.  Prices of core goods imports  (which exclude computers, semiconductors,  and oil) moved  up even more  strongly over this period,  led by a large increase in  prices of industrial  materials. Prices of total goods  exports

increased  oderately  n  November, but,  or ctober nd  November combined, m i f O a they  rose t   2 percent  nnual  rate,  sharp ickup rom  the ace  of revious a a a a p f p p quarters.

The price f mported il ose o  more than  $20  per  barrel  n  September.  For  the o i o r t i third  uarter, e  U.S.  oil mport rice  ose early  4  per arrel, flecting q th i p r n $ b re strengthening rld  demand and  ongoing  production  estraint  om  OPEC.
