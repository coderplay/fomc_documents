On average,  he  annual ate f  growth  in  real t r o GDP was revised  p u 0.3 percentage  oint ver p o the  period rom the  fourth  uarter  f  1994 to  the  first arter  f his  ear.

A net capital inflow was recorded through private banking transactions in the second quarter on a month-end basis (line 3). The net inflow was particularly large  in June, more than reversing the net outflow recorded in May.

Foreign Exchange  Markets

Between the June-July  FOMC meeting and mid-August, the foreign exchange value of  the dollar rose 2 percent on a weighted average basis against other major currencies (formerly, the narrow index).  With respect to individual currencies, the dollar rose against the yen,  the Canadian  dollar, and sterling, but declined against the mark  and other European  currencies.

The dollar's overall rise was led by an appreciation of  more than 4 3/4 ercent p against the yen, as investors viewed  the prospects for fiscal stimulus and financial reform in Japan to have faded further during the period.  Japan's bridge bank proposal failed to spur market enthusiasm, and doubts remained about how aggressively banks would be closed or merged.  The new LDP government appeared to be offering little new by way of fiscal policy stimulus, with the economic program of  the new administration  containing to a great extent proposals that are  merely a repackaging of elements put forth by the previous administration.  Statements  made in late July by Finance Minister Miyazawa, who seemed to indicate less interest in conducting  official intervention operations  to support the yen than had been present  in the previous administration, also  prompted some yen selling.  Furthermore,  data releases during the period, particularly on employment, continued to show weak or weakening  activity.  The yield on the Japanese bellwether government bond declined 15 basis points, and equity prices declined more than 2 3/4 percent.

The dollar rose 3 percent against the Canadian dollar,  as market sentiment toward Canadian assets soured.  The yield on the ten-year Canadian government bond rose about 20 basis points during the period, even as the yield on the comparable U.S. Treasury security  edged down on balance and other G-10 bond yields declined.  Equity prices in Canada fell nearly  12 percent.

.The  three-month  rate on Canadian finance paper rose almost 15 basis points  during the period.

The Mexican peso declined nearly 2 1/2 ercent on balance against the dollar during p the period.  The downward pressure  on the peso prompted the Bank of Mexico to tighten its monetary policy stance on August  10, which drove the one-month interest rate up about 200 basis points from its level immediately  preceding the move.  (From the beginning  of the intermeeting period on June 30, the one-month  interest rate showed a net decline,  in part reflecting end-of-month and perhaps end-of-quarter  money market pressures.) Mexican equity prices declined almost  17 percent.

Asset prices in Russia continued to be pressured,  with the ruble  falling beyond the limits of its daily band near the  end of  the period.  Russian authorities  countered with an announcement on August 12 of the imposition of limitations on domestic banks' purchases of  foreign exchange. The announcement  of  these controls  boosted rubledenominated  short-term government bill rates very sharply, with quotes rising as much as 140 percentage points on the morning of August 13. The one-month interbank deposit rate ended the intermeeting period up about  1 percentage point, and the yield spread  of Russian Brady-style debt over U.S. Treasury  securities rose 9 percentage points.  Russian equity prices moved down more than 33  percent.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of  the System or the Treasury.

Developments  in Foreign Industrial Countries

Available data on second-quarter  real economic activity indicate that the Japanese economy  contracted  sharply for a second consecutive  quarter, due to an implosion of business  fixed investment and a contraction in household consumption.  In contrast, real GDP appears to have expanded in the major European economies  during the second quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the first three months of 1998. In most of the European economies,  current indicators  suggest that strong domestic  demand continues to offset relatively poor external performance  due to the Asian economic crisis.  In contrast, in  Canada, domestic as well as foreign demand seems to have slowed from its earlier rapid pace.

Inflationary pressures  in most foreign industrial  countries remain subdued.  One exception is the United Kingdom, where consumer price inflation still remains slightly above the government's 2  1/2  percent target.

Individual country notes. In Japan, economic  indicators for the second  quarter suggest significant weakness  in economic  activity.  Industrial production during the second quarter dropped 5.3  percent (not annualized) from the first-quarter average,

notwithstanding  modest  rebound  in  June.  Similarly,  tal  achinery  orders  uring he a to m d t second uarter  ere  down almost q w 6.5 percent  rom  their  lready  eak  first-quarter . f a w pace Labor  market  conditions ve  continued  deteriorate   ecent  onths, ith  the ha to inr m w unemployment  rate  n une ising   a  post-war  igh  and  the ffers-to-applicants  o i J r to h o rati falling    its  eakest evel  n wenty ears. abor  market ncertainty pears  o e to w l i t y L u ap t b weighing eavily  n  the ousehold ector, ere  expenditures ll  urther  uring  he h o h s wh fe f d t second  quarter  nd  auto egistrations  tinued  o ecline.  n  July,  he evel f  onsumer a r con t d I t l o c prices  net f  he eptember  increases  n o-payments nder he ational ( o t S i c u t N Health Insurance  ystem)  was down about /2  ercent  rom  the ear-earlier el.
