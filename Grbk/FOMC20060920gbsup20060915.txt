The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Prices

The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in August, down from the much larger increases seen, on average earlier this year; smaller increases in energy prices and in housing costs last month contributed to the moderation.  As a result, the three-month change in the CPI moved down from 5.7 percent in May to 3.6 percent in August.  Over the twelve months ending in August, the overall CPI rose 3.8 percent, up ¼ percentage point from a year earlier.  Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.2 percent in August for a second consecutive month.  The three-month change in the core CPI was 3 percent in August while the twelve-month change stood at 2.8 percent.

The index for consumer energy prices rose only 0.3 percent in August, as increases in gasoline prices early in the month were almost completely offset by the sharp downturn in prices over the remainder of the month.  Available survey data for gasoline point to a sizable decline in the CPI for gasoline in the September.  Consumer food prices rose 0.4 percent in August, reflecting a large increase in the prices for fresh vegetables and a rebound in the index for meats, poultry, fish, and eggs.

Prices of core goods rose 0.2 percent in August, after having slipped 0.1 percent in the preceding month.  Both the decline in July and the rebound in August were driven by swings in nondurable goods; in particular, apparel prices moved up 0.9 percent in August after having fallen 1.2 percent the month before.  Compared with a year earlier, core goods prices were 0.6 percent higher, about the same as the increase in the preceding year.

Prices of core services rose 0.2 percent last month, down from the increases of 0.4 percent per month posted in each of the previous three months.  Rent of shelter rose 0.2 percent in August; the increase in owners' equivalent rent slowed to 0.3 percent, and the index for lodging away from home declined.  Prices for non-energy services have moved up 3.7 percent since August 2005, compared with an increase of 2.7 percent in the preceding year.

The chained CPI or C-CPI-U rose 3.4 percent during the twelve months ending in August, 0.4 percentage point less than the change in the official index.  The corresponding change in the core C-CPI-U was 2.7 percent, 0.1 percentage point less than the official core CPI.

According to the preliminary reading for September from the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) survey, both year-ahead and longer-term inflation expectations fell back from their elevated readings in August.  The median of expected inflation over the next twelve months moved down from 3.8 percent to 3.1 percent.  Expected inflation over the next five to ten years moved down from 3.2 percent to 2.9 percent, its average over the past ten years.

Personal Income and Consumer Spending

Nominal sales in the retail control group of stores rose a modest 0.2 percent in August following a downward-revised gain of 0.6 percent in July.  Across types of stores, changes in nominal spending were mixed in August.  Some -such food and beverage stores and food services outlets -posted solid gains, while others -such as gasoline stations and furniture and home furnishing outlets -saw moderate declines.  We now estimate that real outlays in the control category of personal consumption expenditures increased 0.2 percent in July and edged down 0.1 percent in August.

The preliminary report from the Michigan SRC showed that consumer sentiment rose in early September from an August level that was held down by a slump in the first half of the month.  The increase in early September reflected a strengthening in the 'expected conditions' component of the overall index that more than offset a weakening in the 'current conditions' component of the overall index.  Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved noticeably.  In addition, the appraisal of buying conditions for cars edged up, while the appraisal of buying conditions for homes edged down.

Industrial Production

Industrial production edged down 0.1 percent in August, and its manufacturing component moved sideways after having risen 0.4 percent in July.  In August, the output of motor vehicles and parts increased 1.0 percent.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, manufacturing production edged down 0.1 percent; in the previous two months, gains averaged ¾ percent.  The output of mines dipped 0.3 percent in August, mainly because crude oil and natural gas extraction decreased.   The output of utilities also fell in August 1 as electricity usage moderated following several months of above-average temperatures.

Capacity Utilization

(Percent of capacity)

<!-- missing-text -->

The production of high-technology products edged up just 0.3 percent in August following more rapid gains in the previous three months.  Computer production continued at a sluggish pace, increasing 1.4 percent. The production of communications equipment appears to be moderating following large gains in the first half of the year: After little change in July, the output of communications equipment fell 2.2 percent last month.  Semiconductor production also rose more slowly in August, as a decrease in the output of printed circuit boards and printed circuit assemblies subtracted from the gains among producers of semiconductor chips.

Coming on the heels of widespread strength, the rates of change in production for market groups excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-technology products fell back or decelerated in August.  The output of durable consumer goods rose while the production of nondurable consumer goods edged down 0.2 percent.  The gains in business equipment slowed, increasing 0.3 percent in August after July's upwardly revised rate of 2.7 percent while the output of defense and space equipment rose 0.3 percent.  The output of materials slipped 0.2 percent in August, and the production of business supplies fell 0.6 percent.  The output of construction supplies also edged down, as decreases in plastics, air conditioners, and several wood-related series offset increases in the output of construction steel, concrete products, paving and roofing materials, and electric lighting equipment.

The factory operating rate edged down 0.2 percentage point in August, to 81.0 percent, but it is still 1.2 percentage points above its 1972-2005 average.  Operating rates also fell in August for both mining and utilities.  By stage of process, the rates at the crude stage of processing decreased for the first time this year; the rates for primary and semifinished processing and for finished processing also slipped.

Business Inventories

The book value of inventories in manufacturing and trade, excluding motor vehicles and parts, increased at an annual rate of $81 billion in July after having risen $110 billion in June.  The inventory-sales ratio in this category ticked up to 1.19 months in July.

The International Economy

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In August, import prices of non-oil goods and core goods rose 0.5 and 0.3 percent, respectively.  These increases reflected higher prices for material-intensive goods, with a 13.6 percent increase in natural gas prices providing an additional boost to the price index for non-oil goods.  After falling 1.0 percent in July, prices for non-fuel industrial supplies resumed the upward pace of earlier months, with an increase of 0.5 percent in August.  This increase reflected higher prices for metals which offset lower prices for chemicals and building materials.  Food prices were also up, increasing 2.5 percent.  In comparison, prices for imported finished goods were little changed. Prices for imported computers rose 0.2 percent, whereas prices for semiconductors were flat.

The average level of core import prices in July and August was 3½ percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter average, as prices were higher in all major sub-categories. Prices for material-intensive goods were up 7¾ percent (a.r.), whereas prices for finished goods increased at a 2¼ percent (a.r.) pace.

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil rose 2.3 percent in August.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged around $73 per barrel in August and has averaged $66.50 per barrel thus far in September.  In early August, the spot price of WTI surged to $77 per barrel following the disruption of supplies from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay.  Since then, oil prices have fallen sharply.  Market participants appear to have taken a more benign view of supply, reflecting the cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, a partial resumption of  production from the Prudhoe Bay oil field, forecasts predicting fewer hurricanes this season, and a perception that punishment of Iran for its nuclear program is not imminent.  The spot price of WTI closed at $63.98 per barrel on September 13.

Exports. In August, prices of U.S. exports of total goods and core goods increased 0.4 and 0.7 percent, respectively.  Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies increased 1.5 percent in August, reflecting higher prices for chemicals, metals, and fuels. Agricultural export prices rose 1.0 percent.  Within finished goods, prices for both capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and consumer goods were up 0.2 percent in August.  In contrast, prices of exported computers and semiconductors fell 1.6 and 2.0 percent, respectively.

The average level of core export prices in July and August was 7 percent at an annual rate above the second quarter average, as prices increased in all major sub-categories.  Much of the increase can be attributed to the 14 percent increase in the prices of materialintensive goods, as prices of both agricultural products and nonagricultural industrial supplies rose sharply.

The import and export price data for August came in quite close to our expectations.  As a result, we have not revised our outlook for trade prices from the September Greenbook.
