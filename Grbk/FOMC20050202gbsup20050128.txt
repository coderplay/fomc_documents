Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Real GDP

According to the BEA's advance release, real GDP rose at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the fourth quarter, following an increase of 4 percent in the third quarter.  The BEA's overall estimate of final sales was, on balance, in line with our expectations, but its estimate of private inventory investment was weaker than ours.

Final sales increased at an annual rate of 2¾ percent in the fourth quarter after a rise of 5 percent in the previous quarter.  Consumer spending continued to rise at a robust pace-4½ percent in the fourth quarter following an increase of 5 percent in the third quarter.  Expenditures for durable goods posted another strong gain, at an annual rate of 6 ¾ percent in the fourth quarter, after having surged at an annual rate of 17¼ percent in the preceding quarter.  Outlays for equipment and software also continued to rise at a brisk pace, with the gain of 15 percent in the fourth quarter off only slightly from the 17½ percent pace in the third quarter.  Residential investment was little changed in the fourth quarter following a small rise in the third quarter.  With data on merchandise trade for December still outstanding, the BEA estimated that exports fell at an annual rate of 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter and that imports rose at a rate of 9.1 percent; taken together, net exports subtracted 1.7 percentage points from the estimated change in real GDP.  Total government spending rose at an annual rate of 0.9 percent in the fourth quarter after having increased 0.7 percent in the third quarter.  Real private inventories are reported to have increased $11 billion in the fourth quarter, following a $27 billion decrease in the previous quarter.  The swing to accumulation added 0.4 percentage point to the change in real GDP last quarter.

The GDP price index increased at an annual rate of 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  PCE prices rose 2.5 percent, and core PCE prices moved up 1.6 percent, a touch higher than we forecast in the January Greenbook.  The four-quarter change in core PCE prices was 1.6 percent, up from 1.2 percent over the four quarters of 2003.

On the income side of the accounts, real disposable personal income increased at an annual rate of 8.4 percent in the fourth quarter, boosted about 4½ percentage points by the special Microsoft dividend.  The personal saving rate increased to 1.3 percent; excluding the Microsoft dividend, the personal saving rate was close to zero.  Real output

in the nonfarm business sector rose 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter.  That estimate implies that productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the fourth quarter following an increase of 1.8 percent in the third quarter.

Shipments and Orders for Durable Goods

The advance GDP report incorporated the data on shipments of nondefense capital goods that were released on Thursday; those data were, on balance, just a touch stronger than we had expected.  Excluding aircraft, shipments rose 2.2 percent in December, more than offsetting the previous month's decline.  Shipments of computers and peripheral equipment moved up 1.6 percent in December but deliveries of communications gear dropped 5.7 percent to their lowest level since August 2003.  In the non-high-tech category, shipments ramped up 3.4 percent, as shipments in industrial machinery partially recovered from the previous month's plunge and shipments of metalworking machinery posted the second largest gain in the twelve-year history of the series.

New orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft moved up 1.8 percent in December following a 0.9 percent increase in November.  Orders of computing equipment rose 8.8 percent while bookings in the volatile communications sector fell 3.8 percent on the heels of an even larger drop in November.  Outside of the high-tech sector, bookings increased 1.1 percent, as orders of industrial machinery retraced part of the precipitous drop posted in November and manufacturers of metalworking machinery recorded historically unprecedented gains in orders.  The staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders rose 1.9 percent in December.  This series--which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments--has historically been a useful indicator of near-term activity in the industrial sector.

The book value of manufacturing durable goods inventories (which constitute about twothirds of the total manufacturing inventories) decreased at an annual rate of $1.4 billion in December, the first decumulation in this category in more than a year.  Shipments of total durable goods rose 2.1 percent in December, and the inventory-shipments ratio dropped to 1.38 months.

Labor Costs

The employment cost index of hourly compensation for private industry workers rose at an annual rate of 3 percent over the three months ending in December, after having posted a 3.5 percent increase over the previous three-month period.  For the twelve months ending in December, private-industry hourly compensation advanced 3.8 percent, about ¼ percentage point less than during 2003.

The wages and salaries component of the ECI moved up at an annual rate of 1.5 percent in the three months through December, the smallest quarterly increase since March 1999.  Over the twelve months of 2004, wages increased 2.4 percent, ½ percentage point less than during 2003.

Benefits costs increased at an annual rate of 6 percent in the three months of 2004-a pickup from September's low rate, but still a bit below the average percentage increase over the past two years.  Over the twelve months of 2004, benefit costs rose nearly 7 percent, compared with about 6½ percent for 2003.  Most benefit categories posted relatively restrained gains last year.  In particular, health insurance costs rose 7¼ percent during 2004, down from double-digit increases posted in 2002 and 2003.  However,

employer costs for defined benefit pension plans rose sharply last year, boosting the twelve-month change in retirement and savings costs to 26 percent from 12½ percent in 2003. 1

The advance estimate of compensation included in the GDP release also suggests a slower rate of increase in hourly compensation at the end of 2004.  The staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 3.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2004, bringing the change over the four quarters of the year to 3.8 percent.
