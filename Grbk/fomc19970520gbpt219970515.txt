RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Economic activity was extraordinarily robust in  the first quarter, but April data on  employment, industrial production, and retail sales point to a  marked slackening of growth in  the current quarter. Increased pressures on  resources have produced a  hint of deterioration in  the trends of  hourly labor compensation, but this has yet to  be  clearly mirrored in price inflation.

Real GDP

According to BEA's advance estimate, real GDP rose 5.6 percent at an annual rate in  the first quarter. Private domestic final purchases soared, reflecting large gains in  both consumer spending and business fixed investment, and inventory investment also rose sharply. The only sector that showed significant weakness was net exports, which reversed most of  the big increase in  the fourth quarter.

Since the publication of  the advance GDP estimate, we have received the usual monthly flow of  data as well as the Census Bureau's annual revisions to the retail and wholesale trade data and partial historical revisions to the NIPAs from the BEA. Taken together, the incoming information suggests that first-quarter GDP

growth may be raised fractionally: On  balance, we expect final sales to be little changed, as a  downward revision to consumer spending is offset by  upward revisions to other components, but the reported pace of  inventory investment in the  manufacturing and trade sectors has been even greater than BEA  had assumed. Unless otherwise noted, the discussion of  first-quarter activity in the remainder of  this section of  the Greenbook incorporates our expected revisions to the GDP data.

Labor Market Developments

Growth in  labor demand appears to have moderated slightly over the March-April period from its rapid pace of  the winter. Payroll increases slowed, and in  April, the average workweek dropped back from the high level in the previous two months. Labor markets remain tight, however: The unemployment rate moved down to 4.9 percent in  April (5.0 percent on concurrent seasonals), and the labor force participation rate edged down only slightly from its historical high in  March. In addition, initial claims for unemployment insurance, which had been boosted at least in  part in late April and early May by  flooding in  the Midwest and strikerelated layoffs, returned to about their first-quarter average during the week ended May 10.

Private nonfarm employment grew  about 140,000 per month, on average, in  March and April following increases averaging 240,000 per month over the previous five months. The slowing of  employment growth was concentrated in  the goods-producing sector. Construction posted job declines averaging 35,000 per month in  the past two months. These decreases likely were exaggerated by the weather: The outsized gains during the mild weather of  February apparently "borrowed" from later months and building conditions were subpar during the survey weeks in  March and April. Manufacturing employment, which had grown about 15,000 per month, on average, in the first quarter, dropped 14,000 in  April; 3,500 of  the decline reflects striking GM  workers in  Oklahoma.

The average workweek of  production or nonsupervisory workers dropped 0.3 hour in  April, to 34.6 hours--about equal to its average over the past six months. Aggregate hours of  production or nonsupervisory workers were unchanged in  March and fell 0.8 percent in  April, compared with average monthly growth rates of 0.4 percent from October to February.

The strength of  economic activity in  the past year has boosted labor force participation. The participation rate was little changed in  April after reaching a  record high in  March; since the beginning of the year, it has fluctuated between 67.0 percent and 67.3 percent. Taking a  slightly longer perspective, the participation rate has rebounded from its unexplained drop in 1995 and now stands above its level in late 1994. Participation rates of adult men and teenagers, which decrease noticeably in  the early 1990s, have been little changed, on net, since late 1994. In addition, the participation of  adult women, which had grown only slowly at the beginning of  the current expansion, has been moving up more rapidly in  the past year or so.

Some analysts have speculated that welfare reform has been a key  driver of  the upturn in  the labor force participation rate. In fact, there has been rapid labor force growth recently among women who maintain families--the group most likely to be  affected by welfare reform. However, this group accounts for only about 4  percent of  the population, and its labor force increase has added at most 0.2 percentage point to the aggregate participation rate over the past year. Moreover, even within this group, only about 60 percent have children under 18 years--a key eligibility criterion for many welfare programs. Also, the rise in  participation has not been limited to groups likely to  be  affected by  welfare reform. This suggests that job availability has probably been a  more important factor.

The staff estimates that output per hour of all persons in  the nonfarm business sector grew at a  2-1/2 percent annual rate in  the first quarter. Smoothing through the quarterly fluctuations, productivity has risen about 1  percent per year since the first quarter of 1995, after having stagnated over the previous two years. In the nonfinancial corporate sector, productivity grew 1.7 percent at an  annual rate in the fourth quarter and 2.1 percent over 1996 as a  whole. 2

GROWTH IN  SELECTED COMPONENTS OF  INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION (Percent change from  preceding comparable period)

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Industrial Production

Industrial production was unchanged in  April after posting sizable gains in  the fourth and first quarters. Output in  the manufacturing sector is estimated to have slipped 0.2 percent, dragged down by  a  sharp drop in  the production of  motor vehicles and related parts and materials. All told, the slump in  vehicle production probably depressed overall manufacturing output about 0.7 percent in  April, taking into account both the direct effects of lower assemblies and spillovers to  upstream industries like steel, metal stampings, and rubber. With the decline in  motor vehicle output, factory utilization fell to 82.4 percent last month; about 3/4 percentage point above the 1959-1996 average. Utilization in advanced processing was a  bit below its average, while the rate for primary processing was 4  percentage points above its long-term average.

Two factors contributed to the sharp drop in  motor vehicle assemblies from 12.5 million units (annual rate) in  March to 11.1 million units in  April. First, the automakers had stepped up production over the winter to replenish stocks that were drawn down by  the strikes in late 1996. And, with inventories of  most models having been restored to comfortable levels by  March, the companies planned to return output to more normal levels in  April. Second, local strikes against Chrysler and GM cut April's assemblies almost a  million units. The  bulk of  the strike-related production loss was associated with the recently settled dispute at a  Chrysler plant that makes engines for popular models of  light trucks. Because the assembly plants idled by  the strike had already been operating at full capacity, Chrysler has little room to recoup the lost production over the near term. Current schedules for the industry as a  whole, which show planned output of  about 12-1/4 million units at an  annual rate in  May and June, are little changed from prestrike plans. A  brief strike against a  GM parts plant was settled on  May 14, but threats of  additional work stoppages later this spring present a  downside risk to production.

By major market group (excluding motor vehicles and parts), the output of  consumer goods remained flat in  April, as declines in consumer durables were largely offset by  small gains in consumer nondurables. The output of  business equipment posted another solid gain, led by  a  good performance of  information processing equipment. Production of  aircraft and parts grew moderately after a  big gain in

the first quarter. Output of  construction supplies did not change in  April and remains around the very high level reached last November. Another substantial advance in  semiconductor output boosted growth in  durable materials.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note. Components may not sum to totals because of rounding.

The advance indicators of  industrial activity, though remaining upbeat, are consistent with some slowdown from the robust firstquarter pace. The diffusion indexes of  orders in  the National Association of  Purchasing Managers (NAPM) and the Dun &amp;  Bradstreet surveys decreased in  April but continue to suggest future increases in  production. In addition, the staff's adjusted durable goods orders series, derived from the M3 survey, declined substantially in March but remained at a  relatively high level.

Motor Vehicles

Light motor vehicle sales slowed in  April to 14.5 million units (annual rate) from 15.4 million units in  March, after adjusting for GM's and Toyota's extension of  the March reporting period into April. A drop in retail sales of  autos and light trucks appears to account for most of  the April decline because fleet sales (based on confidential data) fell only a  bit, after jumping in  March.

On  average, the pace of  vehicle sales over the first four months of  the year was about the same as that over 1996 as a  whole. The weakening of  the yen over the past several quarters has enhanced the competitiveness of  Japanese nameplates, and the popularity of several new  models has also boosted sales. As a  result, the share of  new automobile sales going to the three largest Japanese manufacturers has increased from 27 percent in  1996 to 29 percent so far this year.

<!-- missing-text -->

FRB

Several factors point to continued strength in  consumer demand in the near term. The Conference Board survey in  March and April reported that consumer plans to buy new automobiles in  the next six months were among the highest in  the past several years, while the Michigan Survey index of  car buying conditions for April remained in the favorable range witnessed over the past year. In  addition, the automakers are offering generous sales incentives this quarter. In the wake of its recently settled strike, Chrysler's supplies of light trucks are a  bit tight but not lean enough to place an appreciable drag on sales in  the near term.

Personal Income and Consumption

Growth in  consumer spending appears to  be  moderating after the blockbuster first quarter. Nonetheless, the underlying trend in consumption remains consistent with the positive fundamentals in  the sector, namely robust income growth, receding concerns about unemployment, and the huge gains in  household net worth over the past two years.

Much of  the statistical information for April is for spending on goods. As noted, motor vehicle sales sagged noticeably last month. In  addition, according to Census' advance April report, nominal retail sales in  the control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, fell 0.2 percent last month. In  addition, the data for the preceding two months were revised down to show a  0.6 percent increase in  February and no gain in  March. The drop-off in spending in  April was most pronounced at general merchandise stores, which had experienced a boom in sales in  the first quarter. Based on  the retail sales report and available information on  prices, the staff estimates that real PCE for goods excluding motor vehicles in  April was 0.2 percent (not at an annual rate) above the average level in  the first quarter.

Spending on services rose 3.6 percent last quarter, despite warm  winter weather that held down outlays for energy services; unseasonably cool temperatures in  April prompted a  rebound in  energy spending last month. Expenditures on  personal business services remained quite strong for the first quarter as a  whole, reflecting, in part, the sharp increases in spending on  brokerage services associated with the run-up in  trading volumes on major U.S. exchanges around the turn of  the year.

According to the advance NIPA estimates, real disposable income rose 6.4 percent at an  annual rate in the first quarter, and the 3 saving rate held steady at 5.1 percent. The apparent flatness of  the saving rate is  misleading, however. The rate was likely overstated by  about 0.3 percentage point in  the first quarter because BEA does not seasonally adjust the annual changes to government expenditures and the reindexation of  tax brackets that take place in January. Also, incoming data point to revisions to the advance estimates of  disposable income as  well as consumption. In  particular, data from the Treasury indicate that BEA's advance estimate of seasonally adjusted tax payments in  the first quarter was too low. 5 Taking into account the likely revisions to spending and income, we expect the saving rate to  be lowered slightly in  the next GDP release.

Readings on  consumer sentiment remained buoyant in  April. The Michigan SRC index rose to its highest level since the 1960s. Although many consumers mentioned concerns about rising interest rates, their views of  buying conditions for homes, vehicles, and large durables changed little, partly because of  an increase in  the number of  respondents who advocated buying now in  advance of rate increases. The Conference Board confidence index slipped a  bit in April, as views of current labor market conditions retreated from the extremely favorable level registered in  March.

Housing Markets

Housing activity has been buffeted by  unseasonable weather since late last year. However, cutting through the ups and downs, activity in  the single-family sector has remained essentially flat over the past couple of  quarters. Single-family starts in  the first quarter were about equal to the average pace for 1996 as a  whole, and permits have continued to fluctuate within a  fairly narrow

Despite dropping off a  bit in  March, new  home sales jumped to an  eighteen-year high in  the first quarter. However, the Census Bureau is in  the process of  implementing a  new  data collection procedure that has made these notoriously unreliable data even more difficult to interpret than usual. Existing home sales tailed off in  March after February's sharp gain. For the first quarter as a whole, existing home sales returned to just below the 1996 average.

More recent indicators of  single-family housing demand show a mixed picture. Builders' assessments of  new home sales have remained in  a  narrow range since late 1996. After smoothing through the gyrations in  weekly readings, applications for new  mortgages have firmed of  late after a  dip earlier in  the year. However, home buying attitudes as measured by the Michigan survey were less positive in  March and April than earlier in  the year.

Multifamily housing starts dropped sharply in the first quarter of 1997, about offsetting the fourth-quarter surge. Averaging through the fourth and first quarters, multifamily starts were in line with their average for the first three quarters of 1996. Business Fixed Investment

Real business fixed investment expanded at a 12 percent annual rate in  the first quarter: Growth in outlays for producers' durable equipment rebounded from a  weak fourth-quarter showing, and real investment in  nonresidential structures posted a  third consecutive quarter of substantial growth.

The strength in real PDE last quarter was widespread. In  the high-tech sectors, the continuing wave of  upgrades to  Windows NT and strong demand for high-end servers for computer networks reportedly have provided considerable impetus to spending on  computing and office equipment, and demand for communications equipment remained strong. In  addition, expenditures on  other equipment recouped the previous quarter's decline.

Recent data on  orders suggest that equipment investment will continue to advance at a  healthy clip. Orders for communications equipment were up  more than 12 percent in the first quarter. Anecdotal reports reinforce the view that the outlook is for brisk growth in  this sector: Competition is heating up  among service providers in  local phone markets in  anticipation of  deregulation, demand for wireless and personal communication systems is continuing

to  boom, and traffic on  the Internet is persistently bumping up against capacity constraints on phone and data lines. Orders for other capital goods, which had been on a  plateau for most of 1995 and 1996, broke out of  their recent range with a  healthy 5.5 percent gain in  the first quarter, suggesting further improvement in shipments of these items in  the months ahead.

Business spending on  motor vehicles was up considerably over the first four months of 1997. Fleet sales of light vehicles recovered from strike-depressed levels of  late last year. Demand for medium and heavy trucks also appears to  have firmed: Sales averaged 420,000 units at an  annual rate from January to  April, after a  dip in  late 1996, and the recent upturn in order backlogs bodes well for sales over the rest of  the year.

Although Boeing continues to ramp up production, domestic spending on  aircraft fell slightly in  the first quarter, when a large share of  deliveries were destined for foreign markets.

Real expenditures on  structures rose sharply in the first quarter after the fourth quarter's outsized 26 percent annual rate gain. Among categories of  buildings, office, other commercial, institutional, and lodging all registered double-digit increases; the only building category to decline was industrial, which slipped in  the wake of a  fourth-quarter surge.

Contracts for private nonresidential buildings fell in  the first quarter. However, this series often takes misleading turns, and the preponderance of  indicators of  future construction activity is upbeat. Commercial vacancy rates have continued to  decline, and the FDIC real estate survey of senior examiners and asset managers conducted in  the first quarter reported improved prices for real estate, fewer rent concessions, and a  higher volume of sales. Business Inventories

BEA's advance GDP estimate showed real nonfarm inventory investment of $47 billion (SAAR), more than twice the fourth-quarter pace, and the  newly available data for manufacturing and trade establishments point to an  upward revision--perhaps to around $53 billion. (Compared with BEA's assumptions in  the advance GDP release, the incoming data for manufacturers and wholesalers

were stronger, while the data for retail trade were weaker.) Nonetheless, for most manufacturing industries and trade groupings, the inventory-sales ratios in  March were among the lowest in  the current expansion.

In  manufacturing, inventories rose at  a $10 billion annual rate in  book value terms in  March and were up  at a  $19 billion rate for the first quarter as a  whole. Stocks of  nondefense aircraft and parts posted another sizable increase in  the first quarter. Excluding aircraft, stocks of  nondefense capital goods edged up. Changes were small in  other categories.

In  the trade sector, nonvehicle wholesale inventories continued expanding at  a  moderate pace in  March and over the first quarter as a  whole. Although inventory-sales ratios for most types of wholesale distributors edged up in  March, they remained near the low end of  the ranges observed in recent years. In  the retail sector, stores in the GAF grouping (general merchandise, apparel, and furniture and appliance) reported a  $7-1/2 billion drop in inventories in  March, following little net accumulation during the first two months of  the year. Inventory-sales ratios for most types of retail establishments in  March were near their lowest levels in recent years.

Federal Sector

The incoming news on  the fiscal 1997 budget has been very favorable. For the first half of  fiscal 1997, the unified federal deficit, adjusted for payment timing shifts and excluding deposit insurance and spectrum auction proceeds, was $15 billion (11 percent) lower than for the same period in fiscal 1996. Receipts were more than 7-1/2 percent higher than last year, while adjusted outlays were up only 4  percent. Spending growth was subdued across most categories. Outlays for income security programs were up less than 3  percent over last year, reflecting, in part, the strong economy. Spending on  Medicare grew slightly less than 9  percent, on  the low side of  its recent trend. And, although outlays for Medicaid rose about 8  percent, the increase was exaggerated by  an unusually low level of spending in  the first part of  fiscal 1996.

Individual nonwithheld tax payments surged in  April. These payments, which reflect both final payments on 1996 tax liabilities

and estimated tax payments for the first quarter of  calendar year 1997, were $30 billion higher than forecast in the last Greenbook and also substantially higher than OMB and CBO forecasts.

This 1997 "tax surprise" comes on  the heels of  a  similar but smaller (roughly half the magnitude) surprise last year. The surprise in  the spring of  1996 appears to have arisen because total taxable income in 1995 was somewhat higher than expected (according to  preliminary estimates), and the distribution of  taxable income was more skewed toward taxpayers in  the upper-income brackets. 9 Although no data are available on  the source of  this year's surprise, the factors that accounted for last year's tax surge may have played a  role again in 1997.

We do not know whether the past two years of data point to a permanent structural shift toward higher average tax rates or whether temporary factors (perhaps related to the capital gains generated by  a  soaring stock market) account for the high level of tax payments. Despite the uncertainty, CBO notified the Congress that "a  downward adjustment in  the deficit of $45 billion in 1997 and similar amounts for 1998 through 2002 would be reasonable for planning the budget resolution." 1 0

The CBO reading of  the revenue surprise paved the way for the Administration and the Congress to reach agreement on  the broad outlines of  a  plan to  balance the budget by  fiscal 2002. Under that plan, taxes would be  cut $85 billion, on  net, over the five years, reflecting up to $135 billion of  gross tax cuts (including a child tax credit, reductions in  capital gains and estate taxes, and new tax incentives for education) offset by  up to $50 billion of  ta increases. New spending initiatives include $16 billion for child

The $45 billion figur refers to the difference between CBO's current expectations of revenues in  fiscal 1997 and CBO's estimates from early March. It includes $25 billion for higher-than-expected nonwithheld taxes in April and an upward revision of $20 billion to its estimates of withheld taxes over fiscal 1997 as a  whole.

The plan specifies $115 billion in  Medicare cuts, $15 billion in Medicaid cuts, additional spectrum auctions, and reductions in  discretionary spending, which are still unspecified.

State and Local Governments

Real expenditures on consumption and gross investment by  state and local governments continued to grow slowly in  the first quarter. Spending on  consumption of  goods and services increased moderately, while outlays for construction held steady at their high fourthquarter level. Despite gyrations in employment growth over the past two months, average job gains thus far this year are about in line 11 with the 1996 pace.

Fiscal 1997 will end on  June 30 for all but four states, and most are finding themselves with sizable surpluses primarily because tax collections have been higher than anticipated. Stronger-thanexpected economic growth has contributed to the higher revenues: The Center for the Study of  the States reports that revenue growth is running well ahead of the roughly 4  percent gains projected during the budget planning process. In  addition, many states apparently experienced a  surge in  final payments in  April.

Developments on  the spending side have also contributed to the strong fiscal picture at the state and local level. One key factor is the sharp decline in  the number of  families on  welfare, which has fallen from a  high of  about 5  million per month, on average, in  the mid-1990s to  4-1/4 million, on average, between October 1996 and January 1997 (the first four months of  the federal fiscal year). The beneficial effects of  declining caseloads on  state and local budgets are especially great in  the current circumstance: Federal welfare assistance is now provided in  block grants that are based on caseloads over fiscal 1992-95, and thus the grants are unaffected by movements in  the welfare rolls. In contrast, had Aid to Families with Dependent Children remained in place, federal grants would have fallen in  lockstep with the shrinkage in  the welfare rolls.

The states collect little information about the  activities of former welfare recipients or the reasons they leave the rolls.

However, a  recently released study by  the Council of  Economic Advisers suggests that more than 40 percent of  the decrease in caseloads through fiscal 1996 can be explained by the strong economy, and almost a  third is related to state welfare reform efforts, which were undertaken under federal waivers.

Pressures from Medicaid have also lessened recently. Although the program has continued to see a  rise in  the number of  recipients, recent increases have been much smaller than those in  the early 1990s. The slow growth in recipients, in  conjunction with the moderation in  medical price inflation and the revamping of  many state Medicaid programs, has helped keep spending in  check. Labor Costs and Prices

Labor markets have tightened in  recent quarters, and labor costs have accelerated gradually. Held down by  flat benefit costs, hourly compensation, as measured by  the Employment Cost Index, increased only 2.5 percent at  an annual rate between December and March, compared with a  rise of  2.8 percent over the preceding three months. However, quarterly changes in  the ECI are quite volatile. Thus, we customarily focus on  the twelve-month changes; these show that hourly compensation of  private industry workers increased 3.0 percent in  the year ended in  March, up from a 2.7 percent rise in  the twelve months ended in  March 1996. Hourly wages and salaries increased 3.4 percent during the year ended in  March, while benefits rose 2  percent.

Several factors have damped increases in  benefits costs 12 recently. Employers' health insurance costs, as measured in  the ECI, have remained nearly unchanged over the past two years, although there have been some reports that they are picking up recently. Moderating medical care costs have helped hold down increases in  workers compensation. In  addition, employers have benefited from reductions in state unemployment insurance premiums, which reflect the lagged effects of declining layoff rates on  firms' experience ratings. In contrast, supplemental pay, which includes nonproduction bonuses, has picked up a  bit; it rose 2  percent over the year ended in  March after having fallen 1/2 percent over the preceding year.

EMPLOYMENT COST INDEX OF  HOURLY COMPENSATION FOR  PRIVATE INDUSTRY WORKERS

<!-- missing-text -->

The twelve-month change in  average hourly earnings of production or  nonsupervisory workers fluctuated between 3.7 percent and 4.1 percent over the past couple of months. Even so, it remained well above the pace of  the preceding year and thus continued to show a greater acceleration than hourly wages and salaries of  production or  nonsupervisory workers in the ECI. Shifts in  the occupational composition of  the workforce, which are not captured in  the ECI, may explain part of  the relatively greater acceleration in  average hourly earnings. In addition, some of the discrepancy between the two wage series has arisen because hourly earnings have been boosted by the rise in  overtime hours over the past several quarters, whereas the ECI is designed to measure only straight-time earnings. (Stock options and deferred compensation are not included in  either the ECI or average hourly earnings.)

Hourly compensation in  the nonfarm business sector--reported in the Productivity and Cost release--rose 4.7 percent in  the first quarter. Smoothing through the considerable quarterly volatility, hourly compensation increased 3.9 percent on  a  year-over-year basis, essentially the same pace as during the previous year. However, this measure of  hourly compensation has accelerated markedly since the second half of 1993, when the four-quarter rate of increase bottomed out at 1.8 percent--mirroring the pattern of  average hourly earnings. In  comparison, the acceleration in  the ECI started later and has been much smaller than in  nonfarm hourly compensation.

The consumer price index rose only 0.1 percent in  April, bringing the increase over the past twelve months to just 2.5 percent. This measure of  the inflation trend reached 3.3 percent late last year but has backed off virtually month by month as food and energy prices reversed their earlier run-ups.

The drop in  crude oil prices has been quite apparent in  retail prices in  the past two months. The CPI for energy fell 1.5 percent in  April after a 1.7 percent decline in  March; prices of  motor fuel, home heating oil, and natural gas decreased sharply in  both months.

Consumer food prices have declined slightly over the past two months, though they remain 2.8 percent higher than a  year earlier. At earlier stages of  processing, the PPI for crude foodstuffs and feedstuffs rose in  March and April following seven consecutive months of  declines; the recent upturn reflected increases in livestock and soybean prices.

The index for consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 1/4 percent per month in  March and April. On  a  twelve-month basis, core inflation was 2.7 percent in  April, the same as a  year earlier and up from the 2.5 percent figures of  the prior couple of  months. The increase last month included sizable rises in  tobacco and apparel prices that likely will prove to  be outliers.

The BLS recently introduced an experimental CPI using geometric means. This alternative index--which differs from the headline index by  its method of  weighting observations at  the  most detailed level--reduces the within-strata substitution bias that plagues the official CPI. The BLS intends to introduce geometric weighting in some of the detailed strata in  the official index in  January 13 1999. Based on  comparisons of  the relative performance of the official and alternative indexes over the past several years, the BLS estimates that applying the geometric mean formula within all strata would lower the growth rate of  the CPI about 1/4 percentage point per year; thus, this figure can be  taken as an upper-bound estimate of  the impact of  the planned change to  the CPI.

Other broad measures of prices present a  mixed bag of small accelerations and decelerations, and measures of  inflation expectations are lower than, or unchanged from, a  year ago. The PPI for intermediate materials less food and energy held steady over the past two months and has been essentially flat over the past year. The PPI for core crude materials dropped sharply last month; smoothing through the considerable volatility, it  has fallen 1  percent from its year-earlier level. On  balance, the Journal of Commerce index of  industrial commodity prices and the KR-CRB index of spot prices have been largely unchanged this year. However, metals prices have continued to  tick up in  recent weeks and have now mostly recovered from their steep decline in 1996.

The  FOMC's action at the  March meeting to raise the intended federal funds rate from 5-1/4 percent to 5-1/2 percent was widely anticipated, and yields on  Treasury coupon issues shifted up only 1  to 5  basis points that day. Yields rose further through mid-April on  data releases suggesting that economic activity was much stronger than expected. However, those increases were more than rolled back after the employment cost index and other reports suggested subdued inflation pressure and slowing growth, and after the release of favorable news on  the federal budget deficit. In  addition, Chairman Greenspan's speech of  May 8  was interpreted as reducing the likelihood of  further tightening. On  net, yields on  Treasury notes and bonds are down slightly since the  March FOMC meeting. Market odds on a  25-basis-point tightening at the May  meeting, as read from federal funds futures contracts, are less than 50-50 (chart).

Yields on  private money market instruments have risen somewhat since late March. Three-month Treasury bill rates, however, are down 20 basis points because of  a  sharp cutback in  supply, which resulted from the Treasury's continued reliance on  coupon securities in  the face of  surprisingly large tax receipts.

Major stock price indexes gyrated throughout the intermeeting period (chart) but  were up  4  percent to 7-1/2 percent, on  balance, boosted by  unexpectedly strong corporate earnings in  the first quarter. The Dow  and the S&amp;P 500 hit new  highs on  May 12, bringing their total increase since year-end to about 13 percent. The NASDAQ composite, while up strongly in recent weeks, has not fully retraced the decline from its peak in  January. Price-earnings multiples remain elevated, suggesting that market participants expect substantial growth in earnings from the already high levels.

Borrowing by  the nonfinancial business sector so far this quarter appears to  have held at its strong first-quarter pace. Business lending at banks has remained robust, and merger deals have continued to  generate considerable issuance in  the markets. In  the household sector, commercial bank data suggest a  continuation of  the moderate first-quarter growth of  home mortgage debt but possibly a further deceleration in  consumer credit. State and local government debt remains on a  slow growth path, while borrowing by  the federal government has plummeted because of  the elevated tax receipts. With

bank credit growing robustly and  households building up liquid assets to  pay  taxes, growth in  the broad monetary aggregates remained strong in  April.

Business finance

After a  solid first quarter, gross issuance of  nonfinancial corporate bonds slowed just a  bit in  April (table) and  then jumped in  the first half of  May. Investment-grade offerings were strong throughout the intermeeting period, supported by  large mergerrelated issues. In  contrast, speculative-grade issuance turned down in  April, amid weak inflows to  junk bond mutual funds; investors apparently became more cautious regarding the prospects for lowrated companies--mirroring the slide in  the stock market. This caution seems to  have abated in  recent weeks, as speculative-grade issuance and inflows to  junk bond funds have both recovered. Yield spreads of  speculative-grade bonds over Treasuries have widened a shade, on net, since the March FOMC meeting but remain very narrow by  historical standards.

Borrowing by  nonfinancial firms from banks remained robust in April, with domestic banks providing most of  the loans. Respondents to  the May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicated very little change over the past three months in  credit standards for C&amp;I loans but did note some easing of  terms, especially spreads of  loan rates over market rates for large and  medium-sized companies. About onefifth of  respondents, on  net, expected charge-offs of  business loans to increase in  the remainder of 1997 from the extraordinarily low rates of  the past few quarters. Standards for commercial real estate loans were reportedly unchanged, on  net, but the vast majority of  respondent banks said that their competitors had eased standards. Significant fractions of  banks reported easing spreads on  such loans over the past year, but other terms were little changed.

Nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding fell sharply in  April after rising moderately in  the first quarter (chart). The  most likely explanation for the decline is that strong profits reduced the need to  issue paper to  make first-quarter tax payments. Commercial paper issuance is poised to pick up in  coming weeks as several companies tap the  market to finance large merger deals.

Equity issuance by  nonfinancial firms was sluggish in  March and April in  large part because of  the extremely slow pace of  initial public offerings (IPOs). The IPO  market has been tepid this year,

with a  sizable share of IPOs being offered at prices below their filing ranges and first-day returns on  IPO shares dropping to  their lowest level since 1994. Overall, the equity issuance that has occurred has been overwhelmed by  retirements through mergers and share repurchases. Announcements of  new  repurchase programs have continued to  rise this year, reflecting the accumulation of  cash at large companies (chart).

Recent reports on  corporate profits have been extremely favorable. After-tax earnings in  the first quarter for S&amp;P 500 firms were about 14 percent above earnings posted four quarters earlier (chart). This robust growth, which was widespread across industries, surpassed expectations of  securities analysts by  a  large margin. Equity price indexes fell sharply from the  March FOMC meeting through mid-April, partly in  response to  higher interest rates and  the anticipation of  future FOMC tightenings. Prices recovered on  the favorable earnings news and surged in  early May amid declining bond yields and lessening fears of further Fed rate hikes. These broad market swings were accompanied by substantial intraday price volatility, as market participants reacted strongly to  economic news or  statements by  Fed officials seen as providing hints about the near-term course of  monetary policy. Despite the favorable earnings, price-to-earnings ratios for both the S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ indexes are  high by  historical standards (chart).

The  merger wave among nonfinancial companies that began in 1994 has shown no signs of  abating. The pace of  megamergers during the first four months of  this year, expressed in  dollars at an  annual rate, was fairly close to  the record volume in 1996 (chart), and  the backlog of  announced, but uncompleted, deals remained huge. Unlike the wave of  hostile takeovers of  the 1980s, the current one continues to  be  dominated by  friendly intra-industry mergers that look for potential economies of  scale or are driven by regulatory and technological changes. Also in contrast to  the 1980s, stock swaps have dominated cash-financed purchases. Structuring deals as stock swaps rather than cash purchases allows shareholders of  the acquired firm  to avoid an  immediate tax liability on  any  capital

gains and often enables the combined firm to  use a  more advantageous method of  financial accounting.1

Corporate credit quality has remained generally good. According to  Moody's, the value of  nonfinancial company debt upgraded in  the first quarter about equaled that downgraded, and among companies under review for a  rating change at the end of  the first quarter, anticipated upgrades slightly exceeded anticipated downgrades. In  addition, the  default rate on  speculative-grade debt during the first four months of  the  year dropped below the already very low rate in 1996. The only negative news was the increase in business failures in  the first quarter, which owed largely to startup  difficulties for firms with new  licenses in  wireless telecommunications.

Household finance

Growth in  total consumer credit outstanding picked up a  bit in the first quarter to  a 6-1/2 percent annual rate (table). Growth of revolving and "other" credit moved slightly higher, while the level of  automobile credit was about unchanged. Consumer credit decelerated, however, as the quarter proceeded. That trend, together with the sluggish pace of  bank consumer loans in  April, is consistent with the view  that credit availability has tightened a little and--more important--that consumer spending has moderated. In  the May Senior Loan Officer Survey, about half the banks, on  net, reported tightening standards on  new credit card accounts over the past three months, with a  smaller fraction reining in other consumer loans. The most common tightening action on  loan terms was to lower credit limits. In addition, a  fifth of  the respondents, on  net, reported a  decline in  demand for consumer loans.

Household borrowing in  mortgage markets increased slightly in the first quarter, and data from large commercial banks suggest that growth in  home equity and other residential real estate loans remained solid this spring. Mortgage applications for home purchases surged in  the week following the System's tightening. In similar episodes in  the past, borrowers have rushed to lock  in  mortgage rates in  anticipation of  further increases in  interest rates, but the active encouragement of  lenders and the faster turnaround now

available on  applications have amplified this effect. The volume of applications has dropped back somewhat since then  but remains relatively high (chart).

Like other long-term interest rates, the average commitment rate on  thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages rose through mid-April but subsequently has drifted down to  a  level slightly below that at the March FOMC meeting. Rates on  adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are up, on  balance, over the intermeeting period, but relative to  their indexes, ARMs are still being heavily discounted by  lenders. The average initial contract rate on  mortgages tied to  the Treasury one-year constant maturity yield is now  below that index (chart).

The few  recent indicators of  household credit quality suggest some further deterioration. The average delinquency rate on  auto loans at the  three captive auto finance companies rose to a new  high of  3.59 percent in  the first quarter (chart). Moody's reported that losses on securitized credit card loans rose sharply in  March from the  year-earlier period to an  annual rate of  6.72 percent, the highest in  the seven-year history of  this series (not shown). About one-third of  banks reporting on the Senior Loan Officer Survey expected charge-off rates on  consumer loans to increase over the remainder of  this year  because of  an increased willingness of households to  declare bankruptcy, worsening household financial conditions, and  previous aggressive solicitation of  borrowers by  the banks themselves.

Federal government finance

The seasonal inflow of  federal tax receipts has surpassed all expectations and should produce a budget surplus of  $85 billion in the second quarter (table). The staff anticipates that this surplus, together with $12 billion to  be  raised from  coupon issues, will be  used to  pay down $97 billion in  bills, on  net, this quarter. Weekly bill auction sizes have been cut substantially since the last FOMC meeting, and considerably more than is  typical for the second quarter, with the weekly competitive supply falling about $6  billion.

For most of  this decade the average maturity of  the Treasury's debt fell, reaching a  low point in 1996 of  a  little over five years. However, the recent cut in  bill auction sizes has reinforced the increase in  the average maturity of  the debt that began last year. Auctions of  ten-year notes were added last July and  October, an auction for  the  thirty-year bond was added in  November, and four

auctions were set for the indexed-linked ten-year note. The Treasury's actions reflected concern that issuance at  the long end had become bunched since 1993, leading to cash management difficulties. Given the budget projections then available, more auctions of  long-term debt with slightly smaller auction sizes were not expected to affect the average maturity of  the debt in  a significant way. However, because auction sizes at  the long end can only be  cut back so much without undermining the  liquidity of specific issues, the debt managers have been forced by  this year's unexpectedly small deficit to  pare both bills and intermediatematurity notes.

In  April, the  Treasury held its second auction of  indexedlinked ten-year notes, reopening the existing issue. This auction was less successful than the first, held in  January. The ratio of bids to  the amount offered was about half that observed at the prior auction, although, at 2-1/4, it  was similar to  the ratios observed at conventional ten-year note auctions. The market for these securities is still immature. Trading volumes remain very low, and a market for stripped securities has yet to emerge, but the Chicago Board of  Trade plans to  begin trading in  futures and options contracts based on  inflation-indexed securities in  July.

In  other news, the Treasury announced at the end of  April some changes to  its savings bond program to  make these instruments more attractive to savers. Interest rates on  Series EE  bonds issued after May 1, 1997, will be set at 90 percent of  the constant maturity yields on  five-year Treasury notes, a  noticeable increase from the rates set under the old procedures. The new  bonds will accrue interest monthly instead of  semiannually, making it easier to cash them in  without losing interest. However, to encourage longerterm holdings, there will be a three-month interest penalty for redemption within five years of  issuance.

After a robust performance in  late 1996, bond issuance by federal agencies slowed substantially in  the first quarter of  this year as interest rates rose (table). Nonetheless, the  trend toward global issues continued apace, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac issued bonds totaling $1.9 billion that were offered simultaneously in  the United States, Europe, and Asia and in  some cases were denominated in  foreign currencies.

Perhaps looking ahead to eventual privatization, some agencies have sought to diversify their activities and in  the process have

run into opposition. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank System have all raised congressional eyebrows by, respectively, flirting with  the life insurance market, investing in Philip Morris' debt, and  moving toward direct lending to individuals. House Banking Committee Chairman Leach has called for a  review of  the  investment and expansion plans of  these governmentsponsored enterprises, citing the possible use  of  their special status to gain an  unfair competitive advantage.

The Student Loan Marketing Association is well on  its way  to privatization. Some directors think that Sallie Mae ought to originate student loans as  well as buy them in  the secondary market and repackage them. Once a  proxy fight over this strategy is resolved, Sallie Mae could become a  holding company with one of  its subsidiaries containing all of  the government-related financial assets. This subsidiary would wind down gradually over the  next ten years.

State and local government finance

Gross issuance of  long-term municipal debt rose about 20 percent in  April from  the subdued first-quarter pace (table), owing to stronger new capital issuance reportedly in  anticipation of higher long-term interest rates. However, refunding issuance fell in  April in response to  the rise in  long-term interest rates that had already occurred. Net issuance remained positive, reflecting the reduced pace of  retirements of  pre-refunded bonds.

The credit quality of  municipal debt improved further in  the first quarter, with Standard and Poor's upgrading nearly twice as much debt as it downgraded (chart). The net upgrades reflected more solid fiscal positions that have accompanied the expanding economy and better financial management by state and local governments. As in  1996, the improvement in  credit quality would have been greater if  not for the net  downgrades at  municipal utilities, which continue to  be under pressure from  deregulation.

The record $2.9 billion offering of  taxable pension bonds, announced by  New  Jersey in  March and reported in  the last Greenbook, has been delayed. At issue is  the use of  bond proceeds to cover some unfunded pension liabilities, which would enable the state to reduce current contributions to the pension plan. Governor Whitman wants to  use this tool to free up some revenues for  other programs while maintaining a balanced budget. The  opposition is  portraying it as a financial gimmick, and at  least one rating agency is

questioning the need to use any such savings for budget purposes in an  expanding economy.

Financial intermediaries and money

Net inflows to stock and bond mutual funds slowed substantially in  March and  April from the robust pace earlier in  the year, as investors pulled back in  response to heightened volatility (table). Less affected were conservatively managed growth and income funds, which invest in large, well-known companies. International funds, which had the highest total returns in  the first quarter among all equity fund categories, also posted solid net sales in  March and April. Weekly data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) for early May show some pickup in  net sales of equity funds from the April pace, consistent with press reports suggesting an  upswing of investor interest. After posting an  outflow in  March, net sales of bond funds (excluding reinvested dividends) were zero in  April. However, weekly data indicate that flows have turned positive lately, with the increase mainly at junk-bond funds.

Liquidity ratios of  stock funds are very low, and the substantial decline over the past several years can be explained in part by the large and reasonably stable inflows to such funds (chart). In  this environment, portfolio managers have less concern about redemptions, and they seek to extract more yield in  a  rising market by holding fewer liquid assets. So far  this year, fund managers have not experienced any serious difficulty because of  the low  level of  liquid assets. The ICI's daily monitoring of large fund complexes, which is done when there are substantial stock market declines, indicated that during the downturn at the end of March none of  the funds had been forced to draw  on credit lines to meet redemptions.

Credit provided by commercial banks expanded at  a  brisk 11 percent annual rate in  April, above its first-quarter pace and driven by strong growth in  securities holdings (table). The  main increase in  securities occurred in U.S. government obligations held in  investment accounts at domestic banks and likely reflected the tax-related buildup in  deposits of  households. Still, there were noticeable increases in  other securities and in  securities holdings at foreign banks, for which household deposits are not a  significant source of funds.

Loan growth fell back  in  April from its first-quarter rate, with business and real estate loans remaining strong but consumer

and other loans weakening considerably. Consumer loans ran off  in April and were quite weak even after adjusting for securitization 2 and special factors. Some of  the  weakness may  have owed to continued substitution of  home equity credit for consumer loans and some to a  firming of  credit standards and terms by  lenders.

The  monetary aggregates expanded briskly in  April (table). M2 grew at  a  6-1/2 percent annual rate, slightly faster than in  the first quarter. Strong growth in its household liquid components suggests that individuals built up  deposits to  make tax payments. Weekly data for the latter half of  April and early May show a  dropoff in  these accounts, confirming the  tax story. The strength in  M2 showed through to  M3, which grew at an  8-3/4 percent annual rate in April. M3 was also boosted by  the  need to fund strong credit growth. Banks generally, but foreign banks in  particular, continued their heavy issuance of  large time deposits, in  part to replace other sources of  funds. Assets at  wholesale money market mutual funds ran off slightly last month because the lag in  their yields caused institutional depositors to  move cash directly into money market instruments in  the wake of  the policy tightening in  late March.

The May 1997 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices (which generally covered changes over the  preceding three months) posed questions about bank  lending standards and terms, loan demand by  businesses and households, and expectations about chargeoff rates for consumer and C&amp;I loans. The responses suggest that domestic banks have become even more accommodative lenders to businesses but have tightened credit to  households. They also indicate that foreign banks have taken some steps to restrict credit supply.

Citing stiff competition as their reason, large fractions of banks reported having eased terms on  C&amp;I and commercial real estate loans, though few  banks reported having reduced standards for these loans. The responses were mixed but suggest, on  net, that borrower demand for both types of  business credit strengthened slightly.

Once again, both standards and terms for consumer loans were tightened over the preceding three months, and banks reported less demand for these loans. Standards on  home mortgages were about unchanged, and demand weakened a  little.

Lending to Businesses

Like the January survey results, the  May results suggest that standards for commercial and industrial loans did  not change much over the preceding three months but that terms eased further. Almost no  domestic respondents reported having changed standards on C&amp;I loans to  large and small businesses, but a  few more than 10 percent eased standards for  middle-market customers (chart). By contrast, 10 percent of foreign banks, on  net, tightened standards for C&amp;I loans. Regarding terms for large and  middle-market borrowers, one-third of  domestic respondents reported having narrowed the spreads of  loan rates over market rates, about onefourth reduced costs of  credit lines and eased loan covenants, and about one-tenth increased credit lines or  eased collateralization requirements. Terms for small borrowers were eased by  only a  small share of  banks. By  contrast, small net fractions of  foreign respondents reported having tightened various terms on  C&amp;I loans, (whereas for  the past several surveys foreign banks reported having eased terms on  these loans). Those banks that eased standards or terms on  C&amp;I loans said they had done so  because of  more aggressive competition from other banks and from nonbank sources of  credit. The banks that tightened cited a  lower tolerance for risk and a deterioration in  their current or  expected future capital position.

On  net, domestic respondents reported no  change in demand for C&amp;I loans from large customers, but about 10 percent reported increased demand from  middle-market and small borrowers. However, about 15 percent of  foreign respondents, which typically lend to large firms, indicated weaker demand for C&amp;I loans. Domestic banks attributed stronger demand to increased financing needs for plant and equipment investment, inventories, and, for larger borrowers, mergers and  acquisitions. Weaker demand was attributed to  customers switching to other sources of  credit and increases in customers' internal funds.

On  net, about 5 percent of  domestic respondents said that over the preceding three months they had eased their standards for commercial real estate loans (construction and land development loans and loans secured by nonfarm, nonresidential real estate); but a  similar fraction of  foreign respondents said they had tightened their standards for these loans. The May survey was  the fourth consecutive survey to find little evidence of  changes in  the standards for these loans following the modest tightening of standards reported in  late 1995 and early 1996. Even so, 90 percent of  the domestic banks and 70 percent of  the foreign banks said that their competitors had eased their standards for these loans over the preceding twelve months. With respect to terms on commercial real estate loans, about one-half domestic banks and one-fourth of foreign banks reported having eased spreads over the preceding twelve months, but only small net fractions reported having changed other terms, including maximum loan size, maximum loan maturity, loan-to-value ratios, debt-service coverage ratios, and requirements for take-out financing. As  with C&amp;I loans, those banks that eased terms most commonly said they had done so  because of  increased competition from  banks and nonbanks; many also cited the increased liquidity of  these loans resulting from a more-developed secondary market for them and  the improved condition of  the commercial real estate industry. On net, about 10 percent of  domestic respondents and nearly 50 percent of  foreign respondents reported having experienced increased demand for commercial real estate loans.

Lending to Households

As  has been true since the beginning of 1996, significant fractions of  banks reported having tightened standards on  consumer loans. Nearly one-half the banks said they had tightened standards for new  credit card accounts over the preceding three months, and one-fourth reported having tightened standards on  other consumer loans. Nevertheless, banks' willingness to  make consumer installment loans was virtually unchanged from three months ago (chart). The net fraction of  banks more willing to  make these loans has hovered near zero for the past six surveys. Forty percent of the respondents lowered credit limits on credit card lines, and about 15 percent raised spreads of  loan rates over market rates. Terms on other consumer loans were about unchanged. On  net, 20 percent of  the respondents reported a  decline in  demand for consumer loans.

Banks reported little change in  their standards for  approving mortgage applications of  individuals to purchase homes. Ten percent more banks reported weaker demand for residential mortgages than reported stronger demand.

Expectations for Charge-off Rates

Additional questions on  the survey asked loan officers how  they expected charge-off rates for consumer and C&amp;I loans to  change over the remainder of 1997. About one-third of respondents, on  net, expected charge-off rates for consumer loans to go up, an eventuality most attributed to a  greater willingness on  the part of households to  declare bankruptcy; somewhat fewer blamed worsening household financial conditions and aggressive solicitations by their bank for these loans. One-fifth of  the banks, on  net, expected charge-off rates for C&amp;I loans to go up. Banks pointed to eased standards for these loans, a  deterioration in  business financial conditions, and a  deterioration in  the economy generally as the reasons for their outlook. Several banks also noted that recent declines in  the gross charge-off rate on  C&amp;I loans would translate into fewer future recoveries, raising the net charge-off rate.

Exports of goods and services were only 1/2 percent higher in January-February relative to  the fourth quarter. A  sharp rise in exports of  automotive products to Canada (from strike-reduced levels in  the fourth quarter), and solid increases in  exports of computers, semiconductors, and chemicals were nearly offset by  declines in other categories of  trade (mostly agricultural products, aircraft, and fuels). The decline in  agricultural exports primarily reflected a  reversal of  a  surge in shipments of grains and oilseeds in the fourth quarter, and the decrease in  aircraft exports was due to  a temporary drop in  January deliveries. Most of  the decline in  the value of  fuel exports, however, was in  price.

Imports of goods and services were about 3-1/2 percent higher in  January-February relative to  the fourth quarter. About threefourths of  the increase was in  imports of  automotive products (largely a  rebound from strike-reduced levels in the  fourth quarter) and in  imports of  computers and semiconductors. The CAW and  UAW strikes against GM  in  the fall had a  greater effect on automotive imports than on  automotive exports: The value of imported computers

(including accessories and parts) in January-February was 9  percent higher than in the fourth quarter, and the trade deficit in computers widened about $12 billion. The value of imported semiconductors turned up following four quarters of  declines. Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of  oil imported during January-February increased slightly from the level recorded in  the fourth quarter of 1996, as a lower-than-normal seasonal inventory drawdown offset a  decline in oil consumption. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil imports picked up in  March and April due to  a build-up in  oil inventories.

Prices of  imported oil declined substantially in  the first quarter, partly reversing the very large increase recorded in  the fourth quarter of 1996. Prices had risen significantly in the fourth quarter and at  yearend stood 37 percent above the December 1995 level. Spot WTI dropped $1.27 per barrel in  April, averaging $19.72 per barrel, its lowest level since February 1996. Prices traded near the  April average in  early May,  but jumped last weekend due to  increased tensions in  the Middle East. Spot prices are now trading near $21 per barrel.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports declined somewhat in  the first quarter. Declines in  prices of  computers, semiconductors, other capital goods, and consumer goods were partly offset by  moderate increases in  prices of industrial supplies and foods. Prices of non-oil imports have declined for six consecutive quarters.

Prices of  exports rose slightly in  the first quarter. Prices of  agricultural products increased somewhat after posting large declines in the third and fourth quarters of 1996, mostly because of higher grain and oilseed prices, reflecting renewed concerns of lower crop production in 1997. Prices of  nonagricultural exports were little changed in  the first quarter (as in  the fourth quarter) with increases spread among major trade categories with  the exception of  computers and semiconductors. These two quarters of small price changes followed five quarters of  modest price declines for nonagricultural products (related primarily to  industrial supplies).

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Very large gross capital inflows and outflows continued during the first quarter of  1997. Foreign official assets in  the United States increased by  $28 billion, despite the absence of substantial G-10 exchange market intervention and the appreciation of  the dollar against most currencies during much of  the period (line 1  of the Summary of  U.S. International Transactions table). Apart from the OPEC countries, which benefitted from high oil prices, the largest increases in  holdings were shown by  Spain and China. Preliminary data from the FRBNY suggest that net changes in official assets in the United States were modest in  April.

Foreign private net purchases of  U.S. securities continued at a  very rapid pace in  March, bringing the first quarter total to $86 billion (line 4). Purchases of  U.S. Treasury securities (line 4a) were particularly strong. As is frequently the case, the largest purchases were reported for the  United Kingdom, a  major center for trading U.S. Treasury securities. Foreign private net purchases of U.S. corporate and government agency bonds (line 4b) fell off in March, but the total for the quarter remained strong. Foreigners showed renewed interest in  U.S. stocks in  the first quarter, particularly in  February (line 4c).

U.S. net purchases of foreign stocks were also substantial in March and in  the first quarter as a  whole (line 5b); net purchases were concentrated in  Europe and Japan. In contrast, U.S. net purchases of  foreign bonds were modest for the quarter as a  whole (line 5a).

Banks and securities dealers reported large net capital outflows in  March and the first quarter as a  whole (line 3). Monthly average data on  net claims of  banking offices in  the United States on  their IBFs and own foreign offices also showed net outflows during this period (line 1  of  the International Banking Data table), concentrated at  foreign-chartered banks.

Foreign Exchange and Foreign Financial Markets

The foreign-exchange value of  the dollar rose significantly in April only to give back those gains in early May. On  balance, the weighted-average value of  the dollar has declined 1 percent since the  March 25 FOMC meeting. The dollar's see-saw behavior has occurred amid alternating views on  the next U.S. monetary policy action and alternating interpretations of  official views on the appropriate level for the dollar.

The release in  early April of  a  stronger-than-expected labor market report for the United States and remarks from Treasury Secretary Rubin, who indicated in  Tokyo that he  does not  believe in using currencies for trade policy, started the dollar on its April rise. After some mid-month declines, particularly against the  mark, amid comments from Bundesbank President Tietmeyer indicating that the Bundesbank is not interested in  a  further weakening of  the  mark, the dollar rebounded later in  the  month as the market came to the conclusion that the  April 27 G-7 meeting would not result in  any further qualification of  the strong dollar policy espoused by Secretary Rubin. While the formal statement on  exchange rates and financial markets from the.G-7 finance ministers and central bank governors "emphasized the importance of  avoiding exchange rates that could lead to  the reemergence of large external imbalances," market participants evidently interpreted that statement and the accompanying language,1 at least initially, as offering no objections to  the dollar's rise. Immediately following the release of  the statement, the dollar resumed its move higher, although subsequent remarks from Mr. Tietmeyer indicating concern about

currency overshoots seemed to restrain the dollar's upward momentum by  month-end.

Market readings of  official intentions reversed quickly in early May amid reports of discussions about the possibility of concerted intervention by  the United States, Germany, and Japan to restrain the dollar's rise. Consistent with sentiment that official concern over dollar strength was increasing, Bundesbank Council member Welteke indicated that a  further rise of  the dollar would not be  welcome. Subsequent remarks by  Japanese (Ministry of Finance) officials suggesting that they would like to see some yen appreciation and that the strength of  the G-7 statement on exchange rates had been misunderstood seemed to exert additional downward pressure on  the dollar, particularly against the yen. Reduced expectations for further tightening of  U.S. monetary policy, triggered by  Chairman Greenspan's May 8  speech at  New  York University in the wake of  somewhat softer data on  U.S. activity, also weighed on  the dollar.

The widely expected tightening by  the  FOMC announced after its March meeting generated little immediate movement in  the foreign exchange value of  the dollar, even though the action seemed to prompt a  rise in U.S. long-term interest rates relative to those abroad in  the days immediately following the  meeting. U.S. rates have subsequently eased, reflecting in  part reduced prospects for further monetary policy tightening in the  United States, with the ten-year Treasury yield little changed on  balance during the intermeeting period. Over the same period, the  bellwether bond yield in  Japan has risen nearly 20 basis points, perhaps reflecting more optimism among investors about Japanese economic activity, although data supporting this view  has not yet materialized and the roughly unchanged three-month rate fails to support the view  that expectations for Japanese monetary policy have changed substantially. The  German bond yield has declined more than 20 basis points during the intermeeting period, for reasons that are not entirely clear, and the three-month rate in  Germany has moved down almost 10 basis points. Resulting changes on  net in corresponding long-term interest rate differentials are roughly

consistent with the dollar's movements against individual currencies. The dollar has  risen 3/8 percent against the mark during the intermeeting period but has declined 5-1/2 percent against the yen.

Election results or pre-election nervousness appear to be affecting financial markets in several  countries. While sterling has  risen 1-1/2 percent on balance  against the dollar during the intermeeting period, long-term interest  rates have declined sharply in United Kingdom, moving down 60 basis points,  largely in reaction to  the announcement by the new Labour government that  it  is  taking steps to make the Bank of England more independent. This decline occurred even as  U.K. authorities moved to tighten monetary policy, prompting an increase in the base lending rate of 25  basis points to 6-1/4 percent on May 6. This move had been widely expected to occur soon after the  election.

The  dollar has firmed  less  than 1/2  percent against  the Canadian dollar, as Canadian authorities have evidently chosen to accept  the stimulative effects of a weaker currency rather than respond to the March action by the FOMC with increases in short-term Canadian policy rates  ahead of Canadian elections in June.

French financial markets have also been affected by the announcement of national elections to be held on May 25  and June 1. The franc had weakened shortly after mid-April as  the market began to  suspect that President Chirac might call an  election, and  shortand  long-term interest rate differentials against the mark rose significantly. Subsequent polls  giving the ruling center-right coalition a substantial  lead have led to  a recovery of the franc  and an  unwinding of  the movement in the long-term interest rate differential. The short-term spread has not completely reversed its earlier rise, however, ending the intermeeting up 9 basis  points on balance.

The Desk did  not intervene  for the U.S. monetary authorities during the period.

Developments in  Foreign Industrial Countries

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity picked up in the first quarter, although the pace varied considerably across the major industrial countries. First-quarter growth appears to  have continued at  a  robust pace in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan, while activity expanded at  a  modest pace in  continental Europe. More forward-looking indicators suggest that activity will pick up further in  Germany and France in  the second quarter, continue at  a modest rate in Italy, and slow temporarily in  Japan.

Inflationary pressures generally remain subdued in the foreign industrial countries. CPI inflation is under 2  percent in  Germany, France, Italy, and Canada. In  Japan, an increase in the  VAT rate was responsible for an  increase in CPI inflation to  a  little over one percent. In  the United Kingdom, CPI inflation eased somewhat further in April, largely reflecting a  decline in food and energy prices and recent sterling appreciation.

On  May 1M,  the Labour Party in  the United Kingdom won the general election by  a  wide margin. One of  the new government's first moves was to increase the Bank of  England's independence by giving it  the operational responsibility to  set interest rates. A general election has been called in  France, with the first round of voting on  May 25 and the second round on  June 1. Recent polls point to a  much-reduced majority for the Center-Right Coalition, but the outcome is likely to be  close. In  Canada, the Liberal Party is expected to  be re-elected by  a  wide margin in the June 2  election.

Individual country notes. In  Japan, economic activity continued to expand strongly on  average in  the first quarter. Production and consumption spending were front-loaded in advance of the April 1  increase of  the VAT from 3  to 5  percent, but spending likely fell off in the second quarter. Strong gains in industrial production, machinery orders, and new car registrations in  January were partially reversed in  February and  March, and new  car registrations fell nearly 29 percent further in  April.

Although some of  the surge in  durable goods spending was related to  the change in  the VAT rate, it  was also related to  last year's strong housing cycle that seems to  have come to  an end. Housing starts fell during the first quarter to  a  level 11-1/2 percent below the fourth-quarter average.

- 3. Percent change from  previous year.

The unemployment rate fell to 3.2 percent in  March while the job offers/applicants ratio remained at 0.73. The Tokyo CPI and wholesale prices rose in  April, largely as a  result of  the VAT increase. Wholesale prices have also been boosted in  recent months by  rising import prices.

The Bank of  Japan's March survey (Tankan) revealed a  striking contrast in sentiment between manufacturing firms and nonmanufacturing firms. The yen's depreciation since the  time of the previous Tankan has raised expected sales and profits of  many manufacturing firms. The survey showed a  modest increase in  the diffusion index of  business sentiment at  major manufacturers to 2 from -3  last November. This is the first positive value of  the index since November 1991. Meanwhile, firms' sentiment has deteriorated in  other sectors, particularly in construction, retailing, and other services, largely owing to concerns about the impact of the fiscal contraction.

The current account surplus narrowed in  the first quarter. A strong expansion in exports was offset by  a  surge in  imports as consumers and firms made purchases before the  April 1  increase in the  VAT.

Economic activity in  Germany appears to  have picked up in the first quarter from its tepid pace in the fourth quarter of  last

year, although growth likely remained well below potential rates, probably in  the 1  to 2  percent (AR)  range. Industrial production for February and March indicate that the construction sector recovered from its weather-related slump in  January, and total output increased 0.5 percent in  the first quarter from its fourthquarter level. Real manufacturing orders increased strongly in  the first quarter, led by  a  surge in  export orders. The IFO business climate survey, an  indicator of current and expected conditions in industry, continued to improve in  the first quarter, with the index crossing into the positive range for the first time since mid-1995. The labor market situation appears to  have stabilized following the jump in  unemployment at  the beginning of the  year, but total unemployment remains near the 4.3 million (SA) level. Consumer price inflation in  Germany remains subdued, with inflation registering 1.4 percent over the year to April.

- 3.  Percent change from  previous year.

A  number of recent outside forecasts, including the spring joint forecast from the German economic institutes, the German Council of Economic Experts, and the IMF's recent World Economic Outlook, project a  narrowing in  the general government deficit this year to  about 3-1/4 percent from 3.9 percent in 1996. On  May 15,

tax experts estimated a  shortfall in  tax revenue of  DM18 billion (0.5 percentage point of  GDP) this year, DM10 billion (0.3 percentage point) more than the Finance Ministry had accounted for in its deficit estimate of 2.9 percent of  GDP. Thus, supplemental measures will be  necessary if  Germany is to  meet the Maastricht deficit target of 3  percent of GDP. Although no formal announcement has been  made of  supplementary budget measures to bridge the shortfall, there has been talk of  additional cuts in social expenditures, an  increase in  the mineral oil tax, and revaluation of the  Bundesbank's gold reserves to  market prices in  order to  increase the profits paid over to the government.

In France, first-quarter growth of economic activity is estimated to  have remained modest. While industrial production rose sharply in  February on strength in  manufacturing output, the January-February average is little changed from the fourth-quarter average. In recent months, business confidence has risen sharply, mostly on strength in  foreign demand. In  the first quarter, consumption of  manufactured products rose about 2-1/4 percent, at an annual rate, after a  sharp fourth-quarter decline (associated with the end of  the government's earlier car-buying incentive program). After edging up in  February, the unemployment rate was unchanged in March, and consumer price inflation through April remains subdued.

In  the United Kingdom, the  economy has continued to expand rapidly, although sterling's recent strength has  begun to cloud the outlook for exports. Real GDP growth picked up  to almost 4  percent (SAAR) in  the first quarter, while the unemployment rate has continued to  drop, reaching 5.9 percent in  April. About half of the decline in  the unemployment rate since last October has been attributed to changes in  the unemployment benefit system. Consumer demand remains strong, and business confidence rebounded in  March and remained high in  April. However, export orders have fallen since last fall in response to the strength of sterling. In addition, industrial production was unchanged in  March, with a  small decline in  manufacturing, although the purchasing managers survey indicated that manufacturing output rose in  April in response to continued strength in  domestic demand.

<!-- missing-text -->

- 2.  Percent change from  previous year.

The twelve-month rate of  increase in retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments dropped to 2.5 percent in  April, meeting the government's inflation target. Prices of goods were up only 1.7 percent, reflecting a  sharp drop in seasonal food prices, lower energy costs, and the impact of  the strength of sterling. In contrast, services prices rose 3.3 percent. The underlying rate of increase in  average earnings backed off from the  high January rate

in  February and March. Nonetheless, the  most recent rate of 4.5 percent is up from 3.75 percent a  year ago, reflecting the tighter labor market.

As expected, the  Labour Party won  the  May 1  general election by  a  wide margin. One of  the new  Government's first moves was to raise official interest rates by  25 basis points, a  change which had been widely anticipated. More surprising was a  decision to  make the Bank of  England more independent by  giving it  the operational responsibility to set interest rates. Decisions will be  made by majority vote of a  nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, which will include the Governor of  the Bank of  England along with two  Deputy Governors and several appointed members from outside the Bank. These changes bring the authority of  the Bank more in line with that of  other G-7 central banks. The reforms stop short of  full compliance with the  Maastricht treaty, however, because the  Treasury will retain control of  the inflation target as  well as the ability to instruct the Bank on interest rates for a  "limited period" in "extreme economic circumstances." The Government has also pledged to introduce an early budget which will include a  welfare-to-work program to tackle unemployment, financed by  a  levy on excess profits of  privatized utilities industries.

In  Italy, real economic activity declined 0.9 percent (SAAR) in  the fourth quarter, mostly accounted for by  about one percent declines in  both business fixed investment and government spending, a  very large drop in  net exports, and two fewer working days in  the fourth quarter than in the third quarter. Household consumption, which showed some signs of  improvement due to the feed through of tax  incentives on  auto purchases, rose a  modest one percent.

First-quarter monthly indicators point to a  modest pick-up in activity. Industrial production rose in  the first quarter, more than offsetting the decline in  the  fourth quarter of  last year. Business sentiment rose significantly in  the first quarter. Consumer confidence rose in  January but has since declined slightly, and remains below its 1996 average. The quarterly unemployment rate edged up.

Inflationary pressures are likely to remain subdued in light of  continued moderation in  wholesale and producer price increases, reflecting both the appreciation of the lira over the past two years and the productivity gains due  to contained labor costs since 1993.

On  March 27, the government announced a  supplemental budget worth approximately $9  billion (about 3/4 percent of  GDP) in response to  the greater-than-projected deficit in the first-quarter. Key  measures of  the package include advanced taxation of  anticipated severance fund outlays by  private firms in 1997 and 1998, a

temporary freeze in  severance pay for public sector employees, and the elimination of advanced payments and cash outlays on  public work projects.

Indicators for the first quarter point to continued strong growth in  Canada. Industrial production, retail sales, manufacturing shipments, and new  orders registered sizeable increases for the average of  January and February over their fourthquarter levels. Housing starts in  the first quarter registered the largest quarterly increase in 6  years, but retreated somewhat in April. The Index of  Business Attitudes reached a  record high in  the first quarter. Employment was little changed in  January and February, but employment growth resumed in  March and April. After declining to 9.3 percent in  March, the unemployment rate rose in April as labor force participation increased. Consumer price inflation has eased in recent months and currently is slightly below the midpoint of the  Bank of Canada's target range of 1-3 percent.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

Growth has slowed in  Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and China, while in  Korea and Taiwan it  has picked up. Indications are that Russia is  on  the verge of  a  turnaround, as GDP appears to  have leveled off in the first quarter, but concerns about the reliability of the data remain. Inflation performance has been good in  most cases, surprisingly so in  Brazil. Also notable are recent declines in inflation in  Mexico, China and Russia, and a  fall in  the price level in  Argentina.

Mexico's trade surplus rose in  the first quarter despite a recovery in consumption and the real appreciation of  the peso. China's trade surplus also improved, as  did Argentina's. Brazil continued to record trade deficits in  the first quarter. Strong domestic demand contributed to narrowing of  the trade surplus in Taiwan and a  widening of  Korea's trade deficit. In  Thailand, the baht has come under renewed downward pressures.

Individual country notes. In  Mexico, monthly data show that the economy continued to grow in  the first quarter but at less than the rapid rate shown in  the fourth quarter of 1996. Industrial production rose 6.2 percent in the first quarter from a  year earlier. That is slower than the 12.8 percent growth rate in  the fourth quarter, reflecting in  part the  higher base period. The unemployment rate moved a  bit lower in  February, to 4.2 percent, and remained at that level in  March. The unemployment rate has declined from its post-crisis high of  7.6 percent in  August 1995 but remains above its pre-crisis level of  about 3-1/2 percent. Other indications point to some weakness in  the first quarter. Retail sales fell 3.4 percent in  the January-February period from the same period a  year earlier. Earnings reported by  Mexican corporations fell short of expectations in  most sectors as reported sales declined by  1.2 percent from the first quarter a  year ago.

Consumer price inflation has continued to  moderate in  recent months, registering a  monthly rate of  only 1.1 percent in  April. Increases in public sector prices and minimum wages in  December now appear to have been reflected in consumer prices, and inflation has returned to  the post-crisis lows of last October. The stability of the peso so  far this year and the usually low seasonal price

pressures during the summer make it likely that the inflation rate will remain near its current rate in coming months.

Recent trade data have been stronger than expected despite the continued real appreciation of  the peso and the recovery of domestic demand. After declining in the fourth quarter, the trade surplus rebounded in  the first quarter to nearly the level of  the third quarter, even as oil exports declined nearly 13 percent from the previous quarter (due in part to  a  decline in  oil prices). The trade surplus for March showed a  particularly large rise, with the gains coming largely from increased automotive and agricultural exports.

In  Argentina, the growth in  economic activity continues but at a  slower pace than the very high rates seen at the end of  1996 and the beginning of  1997. Industrial production in the first quarter was 8  percent above a  year earlier, down from nearly 12 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996. Somewhat unexpectedly, consumer prices fell in  March and April, offsetting the increase in  prices that occurred in  the first two  months of  this year. Accordingly, consumer price inflation over the past twelve months was 0.8 percent. The first quarter fiscal deficit of  the central government was $1  billion, equal to  the target for this quarter agreed upon with the IMF.

Strong Brazilian demand and a  record harvest continue to  boost Argentine exports; in the first quarter of 1997, they were up 19 percent over a  year ago. However, imports in the first quarter were

up 42 percent over the same period as  a  result of  a  stronger dollar and, hence, a  stronger peso. Consequently, the trade balance in  the first quarter shifted to a  small deficit from a  small surplus a  year earlier. International reserves (excluding gold) were $17 billion at  the end of  April, roughly 25 percent higher than a  year ago.

Taking advantage of  relatively favorable borrowing conditions, the  Argentine government has been placing large amounts of debt in international capital markets recently. The government anticipates raising about $9  billion in international capital markets for 1997 financing needs, of  which about two thirds has already been achieved. In  April, in a  move that was widely expected, Standard and Poor's upgraded its sovereign debt rating for Argentina to  BB from BB-. However, other rating agencies have not followed suit.

In  Brazil, industrial production (s.a.) fell by  2.1 percent in March, after very little change in January and February. Retail sales have been volatile in recent months, making it difficult to determine whether there is any clear trend. Economic activity in recent months has been  boosted to some extent by  a  good agricultural harvest. Inflation has remained remarkably low; consumer prices rose only 8.2 percent in  the year through April 1997, making it one of  the lowest twelve-month increases since the 1950s.

Brazil continued to record trade deficits in  March and April, bringing the deficit for the  year through April to $4  billion, compared with near balance over the same period in 1996. Import growth has been very strong; imports over the January-April period were 30 percent higher than a  year earlier. Some of  the deterioration in the trade balance can  be  attributed to the stronger

dollar, and, hence, the stronger currency. (Under the government's stabilization program, the central bank limits the extent to  which it  will allow the real to depreciate against the dollar.) In  April, the government tightened credit restrictions on imports and in early May increased a  tax on  other forms of credit that were aimed at reducing the demand for automobiles and other durable goods, the two major sources of upward pressures on imports.

The current account deficit in  the first quarter exceeded the capital account surplus by  $1  billion, resulting in a  drawdown in the central bank's international reserves. The desire to  maintain interest rates high enough to  attract capital from abroad (and thus avoid further drawdowns in reserves) also prompted the central bank in late April to leave its two key lending rates to financial institutions unchanged in  May. This represents a  departure from the practice of gradually reducing interest rates since early 1995, after the central bank no longer confronted strong downward pressures on  the real. International reserves stood at $59 billion at  the end of  March, down slightly since the end of 1996, but up considerably from $32 billion in  early 1995.

On  May 6, the government sold its controlling stake in  CVRD (Companha Vale do  Rio Doce), a  mining conglomerate, for $3  billion. The sale was the largest of  a  government-owned firm to  date in  Latin America. The sale of CVRD has symbolized the Cardoso government's determination to  enact needed fiscal and other economic reforms that are crucial to  the long-run success of its stabilization program. Privatization and other proposed reforms have been extremely controversial.

In  Venezuela, recent labor market developments have increased uncertainty about the short-term economic outlook. In  mid-March, the government signed an agreement on  a  severance payment reform with unions and private sector representatives that replaces the present severance payment system with one that is far less generous by  international standards. Because the agreement, which is expected to  be  approved by  Congress, will reduce the cost of firing workers in  the future, the reform is expected to increase labor productivity and growth in  the long run. However, existing employees will receive very large payoffs from the government over the  next few  years, which Finance Minister Matos estimates will cost the government 10 percent of  GDP. The huge fiscal cost of  the reform has thus raised concerns that the government will resort to more inflationary finance of fiscal deficits in  the future. (Although the government ran a  sizeable fiscal surplus in 1996, it was due to a  windfall generated by  the rise in oil prices that year.)

Other recent developments in the labor market have also fueled inflationary pressures. The  minimum wage was increased by  44 percent on  May 1  and public employees salaries were increased by  75 percent on  average in  February. Thus, although consumer prices posted their lowest monthly increases in  five years in  March and April, inflationary expectations are running high.

Real GDP declined year-over-year by  1.6 percent in 1996. The recession led to a  narrowing of  the non-oil trade deficit from $6 billion in 1995 to  about $5  billion in 1996. International reserves (excluding gold) at the end of  April were $12 billion, compared with $6.4 billion a  year ago. At  the end of  April, the IMF approved a

Venezuelan request to  extend its stand-by agreement, which is due to expire in  July, for another eighteen months.

China's soft landing continued in  the first quarter, as growth slowed slightly but remained high, and inflation moderated. GDP rose 9.4 percent in  the first quarter of 1997, the lowest quarterly growth rate reported since 1992. Industrial production, in particular, moderated. Twelve-month consumer price inflation of 4.0 percent in  March was at its lowest level since 1991. In  the first four months of 1997, China recorded a  trade surplus of $10.3 billion, compared with a  deficit of $0.6 billion in the  year earlier period; the  value of  exports rose 27 percent and the value of imports fell 2  percent from the year-earlier period. The surging exports and falling imports appear to  reflect in  part a  base-period effect, since the beginning of  1996 had the reverse pattern of falling exports and surging imports. International reserves reached $114 billion in  March, up $7  billion since the end of 1996.

In  Taiwan, inflation has plummeted in  recent months, with consumer prices rising only 0.5 percent in  the twelve months ending in  April. Industrial production grew strongly in the  first quarter, following strong growth at  the end of 1996. Taiwan ran a  trade surplus of $1.6 billion in  the first four months of  1997, down from the surplus of $3.4 billion in  the year-earlier period. Exports rose 3  percent, while imports rose 9  percent. Foreign exchange reserves were $89 billion at  the end of  March, virtually unchanged since the beginning of the year.

An  epidemic of  foot-and-mouth disease hit Taiwan's pig stocks in  March, leading Taiwan to  ban the  export of  pork. The decline in pork exports contributed to the  April trade deficit, as exports fell 3  percent compared with April 1996; the deficit was only Taiwan's fifth monthly trade deficit since 1983, and the first since 1995.

In  Korea, more financial scandals have appeared in the  wake of the  collapse f  Hanbo  Steel  Company o in  January.

The  current account deficit jumped to  nearly $8  billion in  the first quarter, compared with a  deficit of $4.6 billion a  year earlier. However, the monthly figures indicate a  downward trend ($2.3 billion in  March versus $3.1 billion in January); customs-

cleared trade numbers for April indicate a  continuation of  the trend. Industrial production in  March grew at  a  robust rate of just over 9  percent (year-over-year), with some signs of  pickup in  key industries such as semiconductors. Inflation remained at moderate levels in  April.

In  Thailand, the baht has come under renewed strong downward pressures, prompting strong intervention support. On  May 14 the Bank of  Thailand issued the following statement: "Today the  Bank of Thailand and the Monetary Authority of Singapore jointly intervened in  the foreign exchange market to stabilize the value of  the Thai baht. This concerted operation is aimed at stemming excessive speculative activities which may lead to disorderly conditions in the Thai and regional financial markets. Other appropriate measures will be  taken as  necessary." Also on  May 14, the overnight interbank interest rate rose sharply from 11.5 percent to 18 percent. On  May 15, the central bank  was reported to have raised short-term interest rates to 25 percent.

Since 1984, the baht has been tied to  a  basket of currencies with a  heavy weight on the dollar, but a  number of adverse developments over the  past year have shaken investor confidence and put downward pressures on  the currency. Thailand has been running large current account deficits (8  percent of  GDP in 1995 and 1996), and the banking sector has experienced a  rise in  non-performing loans as a  result of  plunging real estate prices. The stock market index fell by  25 percent in 1996, and has plunged by a  further 30 percent since the beginning of  this year. The rise in  interest rates in  February during an  earlier attack against the currency weakened the banking sector further. In  early April, Moody's downgraded Thailand's long-term foreign debt from A2 to  A3, citing Thailand's high current account deficit and the fragility of the banking sector. Despite Thailand's economic problems, the overall economy managed to grow by  almost 7  percent in 1996, and the  most recent consensus forecast called for 6  percent growth in 1997.

In Russia, President Yeltsin has made a  strong return from his eight-month illness, and the economy seems to  be  on the  verge of  a turnaround. Year-on-year GDP growth rates were very slightly positive for January and February, although there is some concern that the figures are an  artifact of  a  change in  methodology.

Inflation continues to decline; for the first four months of  1997, it came in  at 6.3 percent, higher than would be  consistent with the targeted annual rate of  12 percent but still lower than last year's inflation for  the same period. The ruble-dollar exchange rate has continued to remain well within the corridor set by  the Central Bank; on  May 6,  the ruble traded at 5,755 to  the dollar.

Yeltsin's return to full-time work may give a  needed jolt to economic reform, which had been stalled. In  March he  reshuffled his cabinet, bringing in  well-known reformers, including the dynamic former governor of  Nizhny, Novgorod Boris Nemtsov, and the effective but unpopular Anatoly Chubais. Nemtsov has begun to tackle the necessary but difficult task of  restructuring Russia's government monopolies.

The fiscal situation is still problematic. Tax revenues for the first quarter of 1997 were less than 60 percent of  projections. Wage, pension, and tax arrears continue to accumulate. While some proposals to  help firms settle their tax arrears have  been  made, a long-term resolution of the fiscal problems will not occur without both comprehensive tax reform and restructuring or closure of lossmaking firms. In  late April, a  sequestration plan for bringing expenditures in line with reduced revenue and a  tax reform package were submitted to  the Duma.

The fiscal reform measures removed important obstacles to the continuation of  Russia's three-year, $10 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility, which had been held up since late 1996. The IMF reached an  agreement with Russia on  a  plan for 1997 in late April, and the IMF Executive Board is expected to  vote on the plan on  May 16. The

IMF and Russia have agreed to  move from monthly to quarterly reviews.
