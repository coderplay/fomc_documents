RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

The remarkable combination of strong growth and low inflation continued during the first quarter. As expected, net exports exerted a  considerable drag on growth of real GDP, but that was more than offset by  a  large rise in domestic demand. Consumption and home building advanced briskly, and business outlays for equipment surged once again. Perhaps presaging less robust expansion ahead, however, inventory investment also picked up further to an extraordinary pace. The tight labor market has led to  a  discernible acceleration in labor compensation over the past year, but the steep decline in  energy prices and the  weakness in  non-oil import prices have led to a  further deceleration in  consumer prices in recent months.

Real GDP: 1998:Q1

The incoming data since the BEA  published its initial estimates would appear to translate into a  full percentage point upward revision in growth of  real GDP. Final sales may  be  marked down in the next reading, largely because of  weaker outlays for state and local government construction and a  slightly greater decline in  net

exports. However, the March inventory reports came in  much stronger than the BEA had assumed, contributing to  a  $26 billion upward revision to nonfarm inventory investment. The principal piece of information that the BEA  will receive prior to  its next estimate of first-quarter real GDP is the international trade data for March. Labor Market Developments

Recent data suggest that labor demand remains robust. Nonfarm payroll employment rose 262,000 in  April, and even with a  decline in March of 24,000, growth of  payroll employment has averaged 224,000 per  month so far this year. Moreover, the still-low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance in  recent weeks provides little hint of  moderation.

In several areas, employment gains in  April likely represented rebounds from  below-trend March levels. Specifically, bad weather during the March survey reference week seemed to  have depressed employment in construction, which rebounded 35,000 in  April, and at eating and drinking places, which jumped 33,000. Nonetheless, employment increased solidly in  a  number of other industries. Strong gains at help supply and computer services firms contributed to  a  rise of 139,000 in services, and jobs in  the finance and real estate industry rose another 30,000. In contrast, manufacturing employment fell 10,000 in  April, for a  third consecutive month of relative weakness.

As published, aggregate weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on  private nonfarm payrolls declined in  April for a  second month. However, last month's change was distorted by the length-of-pay-period problem in  the measurement of  the  workweek as  well as  by  difficulties in seasonally adjusting hours in manufacturing for the Easter holiday. Based on the  BLS's experimental corrected workweek series, which adjusts for these two factors, aggregate hours rose 0.7 percent in  April to stand 0.3 percent (not  at an  annual rate) above their first-quarter average.

In  the household report, the unemployment rate plunged 0.4 percentage point in  April, to 4.3 percent, after having held at around 4-3/4 percent since November. Declines were registered for most demographic and education groups. Even the rate for married men  with a  spouse present--a series that is a  less noisy indicator

than the aggregate rate--fell 0.3 percentage point to its lowest level (2.2 percent) since 1973. The labor force participation rate also dropped back in  April, from 67.2 percent to 67.0 percent, primarily because participation among teenagers--which is volatile from  month to  month--stepped down from its high level during the first quarter.

Other indicators of  labor market activity lately have been consistently upbeat. In  April, the index of the expected change in unemployment from the Michigan Survey Research Center survey moved to its most favorable reading since 1984. In  the Conference Board survey, perceptions of  current employment conditions deteriorated a bit  in  April but remained extremely positive, while consumers' expectations for employment conditions six months hence improved. The National Federation of Independent Businesses survey indicated that the percentage of small businesses reporting vacancies "hard to fill" rose one point, to 29 percent, in  April. Although somewhat dated, the Conference Board's index of  help wanted advertising held steady in  March, well above its level one year earlier.

As published, productivity in  the nonfarm business sector rose at an  annual rate of  just 0.2 percent in  the first quarter, reflecting a  5.3 percent increase in output and a  5.0 percent increase in  hours. As  mentioned above, however, the estimates of the workweek that underlie the published hours numbers have not yet been corrected for the length-of-pay-period problem. 2 Using the BLS's corrected hours estimates, productivity rose 1.6 percent in the first quarter. Incorporating the expected revisions to  output and using the corrected hours estimates, productivity rose 2.6 percent over the four quarters ended in 1998:Q1, compared with 1.2 percent over the previous four quarters.

Industrial Production

Industrial activity has decelerated sharply from the rapid pace of  the second half of last year: On the basis of production hours and available physical product data, the staff estimates that industrial production rose slightly in  April following a  weak first

quarter. Some of  the slowdown so  far this year was attributable to unusually warm  weather that damped utility output. More important, manufacturing growth slowed considerably: The staff believes that manufacturing output rose moderately in  April following small declines in  February and  March.

Although motor vehicle assemblies picked up  a  bit in  April, the deceleration in  manufacturing so far this year had been exacerbated by  the direct and  indirect effects of a  slower pace of  motor vehicle production. Production was  boosted temporarily in  the latter part of 1997 to  make up  for shortfalls that occurred last spring and summer; since peaking in  November, motor vehicle assemblies have dropped back 0.9 million units, to 12.2 million units at  an annual rate in  April. Even with this slowdown in production, inventories were a  little on  the high side in  March and  April, especially for

light trucks. In response, the  Big  Three have stepped up sales incentives this quarter, as discussed later in  the section on consumer spending.

Evidence is  mounting that some of  the  slackening in production is attributable to  the Asian crisis, although showing direct causal relationships at  the industry level is difficult. The May  Beige Book reported reduced Asian exports and increased competition from Asian firms for a  variety of  industries, particularly metals, industrial machinery, high technology equipment, apparel, paper, and chemicals. Production in  the chemical industry has recently slowed, and the inventory-to-sales ratio has risen to  the highest level since 1991. Output in  the semiconductor industry also appears to  have decelerated noticeably in  recent months. Manufacturers of semiconductor equipment have been affected by  the  Asian crisis: Several Asian firms have cancelled or  pushed back orders for this equipment, and a  survey by  the industry trade association indicates that manufacturers expect orders to decline 12 percent this year.

Leading indicators of industrial production point to  moderate growth over the next few  months. The staff's estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders advanced 2.2 percent (not at an  annual rate) in  the first quarter, 1.6 percentage points faster than in the fourth quarter of last year. The new  orders index from the  National Association of Purchasing Management also turned up in  recent months, while the new  orders index from the Dun &amp;  Bradstreet Manufacturing Survey remains at  a  high level (chart).

Recent indicators suggest that manufacturers may  have scaled back their capacity expansion plans. The six-month moving average of contracts for industrial buildings has fallen from the  high level reached last summer (chart). Also, according to a  semiannual NAPM survey released this month, a  substantially smaller percentage of manufacturers are planning to increase capital spending in 1998 than were planning such an  increase in  December (chart).

Consumption and Personal Income

Growth in  consumer spending has remained strong, and the fundamentals continue to be  highly favorable. Real income gains have been robust this year, household net worth has soared further, and consumer sentiment continues to hover near record levels.

The only household spending data available for the second quarter are for goods. Nominal sales in  the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, increased 0.4 percent in  April. Nominal outlays rose in  all major nondurable goods components. However, sales moved lower at  stores selling furniture and appliances and "other durable goods." On  the basis of retail sales and CPI reports, the staff estimates that real personal consumption expenditures for goods excluding motor vehicles increased 0.4 percent in  April to  a  level 0.9 percent above that in  the first quarter.

In  April, light vehicle sales (adjusted for shifts in reporting periods) rose 200,000 units, to nearly 15-1/2 million units (annual rate). The increase was concentrated in sales at the Big Three and likely reflected, in part, the effects of  a  sharp increase in incentives (chart). In response to concerns about inventories and market share, the Big Three initiated a  "coupon" program that runs to the  beginning of July and offers discounts of  between $500 and $1,000 per vehicle to original owners who still drive a  Big Three vehicle. The combination of aggressive pricing and strong gains in

income and wealth kept consumer attitudes toward new  vehicle purchases at  a high level in  April (chart).

Real outlays for services rose 3-1/2 percent at an  annual rate in  the first quarter. Spending for recreation services picked up noticeably, and brisk activity in  the stock market helped to  boost brokerage services--a component of  personal business services. However, warmer-than-average temperatures held down expenditures for energy last quarter. Temperatures in  April were about average, and if  this pattern were to continue through May  and June, we  would expect to see higher outlays for energy provide a  considerable boost to PCE  this quarter.

BEA's advance estimate showed that real disposable personal income surged 6-3/4 percent at an  annual rate in  the first quarter, and the saving rate rose to 4.2 percent. As usually occurs in  the first quarter of  the year, the level of  the saving rate was overstated (about 1/4 percentage point) because the BEA  does not seasonally adjust the annual federal government pay increase or cost-of-living adjustments to federal tax and transfer programs that take effect each January. 5 In addition, the introduction of  new tax  provisions under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 held down personal tax payments in  the first quarter--boosting DPI. However, the unanticipated surge in  tax  receipts this spring, which is discussed in  the federal government section, points to  an  upward revision to NIPA personal income taxes in  the first quarter because BEA  spreads the  April payments over the entire year. All else equal, this revision to personal income taxes would lower BEA's first-quarter estimates of  DPI and the saving rate. Turning to April, the labor market report suggests that real DPI posted another sizable gain. 6

Consumers remain extremely upbeat. The Conference Board index of  consumer confidence rose in  April. Respondents had somewhat less favorable appraisals of  current business and employment conditions, but  they were considerably more optimistic about business conditions, jobs prospects, and income gains over the next six months. The Michigan SRC index of consumer sentiment also rose in April and remains just a  touch below the historical high reached in February. One factor supporting consumer sentiment appears to be favorable appraisals of  future real income gains, which can be constructed from survey responses regarding nominal income and expected inflation. The improved expectations regarding real income gains reflect the decline in  expected inflation, which has  been important for some time, and the more recent improvement in expected nominal income growth over the coming year.

Housing Markets

The market for single-family housing has expanded rapidly in recent months. During the first quarter, sales of existing homes rose to  a  strong 4.7 million unit annual rate; sales of  new homes were at  the highest pace in  any quarter except one in  the late 1970s. Home sales have been boosted by  the continuing improvement in  housing affordability resulting from declining mortgage rates and rapidly growing employment. Also, the huge increase in  financial wealth no doubt has added to  housing demand.

Construction of single-family homes rose 9 percent in  the first quarter, to an  annual rate of 1.24 million units, the highest quarterly average since late 1993. Many analysts had attributed a large part of  the strength of starts in January and February to  an artificial boost from unusually warm  weather. However, the weather

in  January and February was also extremely wet, which generally depresses construction. Furthermore, single-family starts declined only 2-1/2 percent in  March, even though the  weather turned colder than normal and remained unusually wet. The absence of  an appreciable "payback" in March suggests that the strength of singlefamily starts in  the first quarter may  have been due less to the weather and more to  the underlying fundamentals.

Builders appear to  have been exercising considerable restraint with regard to inventories, presumably in  an  effort to  avoid repeating past episodes of  overbuilding. For example, from the first quarter of 1997 to  the first quarter of  this year. the average number of  units for sale declined 4  percent, even though sales rose nearly 4  percent. In terms of  the number of  months of sales, the inventory declined from 4.5 months to only 4.1 months, the lowest quarterly ratio on record. The historically low level of  unsold homes in  relation to sales has likely been an  additional factor underlying the increase in single-family starts in  the first quarter.

The combination of  strong sales and declining inventories has been reflected in  rising house prices. The rates of  increase in the nominal price indexes for both new (constant-quality) homes and for repeat sales of existing homes have moved above their respective averages for the period beginning in  the early 1980s but remain below the upper end of  their ranges in recent years (chart, upper 10 panel). In  real terms, these house prices have also accelerated

10. The chart shows the year-over-year changes in  the constantquality price index for new homes and in  the repeat sales index for existing homes that are smoothed with a  four-quarter moving average. Both indexes control for the regional composition of sales and seek to  minimize the effects of  shifts in  the mix of structural features of  homes sold. However, in  addition to changes in  the underlying trend of  house prices, the repeat sales index reflects the net effect of  home improvements, structural deterioration, and changes in  neighborhood characteristics between earlier and later dates of sale; observations that show extremely large increases or decreases in  price are excluded.

in recent quarters (lower panel); 11  these recent rates of increase are near the upper end of their ranges in recent years, although they are still below the levels of  the late 1970s and the mid-1980s. In  sum, both nominal and real house prices have risen; however, the acceleration to date has been modest.

Multifamily housing starts retreated sharply in the first quarter following a  burst of activity in  the fourth quarter of 1997, but they remained above the average pace during 1997. Nonetheless, starts appear to have been running low  relative to permit issuance, and the stock of  unused permits for multifamily units has edged up, suggesting some potential for construction to rise. Moreover, the multifamily rental vacancy rate in  the first quarter was unchanged from its level a  year earlier, which was the lowest first-quarter level since 1986.12

Business Fixed Investment

Real business fixed investment rebounded from its fourthquarter decline to post an increase of 18 percent at an  annual rate in  the first quarter. This expansion was driven by soaring expenditures on  producers' durable equipment, which grew at a  29 percent annual rate, the largest quarterly gain since the fourth quarter of  1983. Outlays on  nonresidential structures, however, remained depressed. Looking forward, some slowdown from  the heady growth of  the first quarter seems likely, although a  strong orders picture and the recent strength in  business output point to the potential for growth to remain at  a  substantial pace in  coming quarters.

While the first-quarter surge in spending on  producers' durable equipment reflected widespread strength, real outlays on office and computing equipment again led the  way. The  first-quarter growth rate of  93 percent at an  annual rate for this category was driven by the steepest decline in  prices in  twenty years. A  number of factors contributed to this exceptional price decline. First was Compaq's decision to cut inventories by  moving toward the "channel assembly" method of production, which involves pushing inventory closer to the customer by  shipping components to resellers, who then assemble them into a branded computer. This inventory adjustment was facilitated

by  extensive price-cutting, which placed downward pressure on prices throughout the industry. 1 3 Second, overproduction of  high-end servers and a  shift in  demand toward lower-priced machines in  the fourth quarter of last year led to an unexpected increase in  these high-end stocks, placing further downward pressure on  prices. Finally, Asian currency developments have reduced prices for semiconductors and other imported components. As  the effects of these special factors run their course, computer price declines will likely become less steep as the year progresses.

In  the transportation sector, business expenditures on  motor vehicles rose at  a  6-1/2 percent annual rate in  the first quarter and appear set for  another large increase this spring. Sales of medium and heavy trucks have been trending up  over the past year, and the rise in unfilled orders over this period indicates that this strength should continue. Sales of  light vehicles in the current quarter should be  boosted by  the improved incentives discussed earlier; the sales of vehicles that are leased to consumers appear in  the national accounts as PDE. Domestic expenditures on  aircraft accelerated in the first quarter, and the large backlog of orders suggests that a  high level of  deliveries will be maintained in  the coming quarters.

Outside of  computers and transportation equipment, the  orders picture suggests that equipment investment will continue to advance at a  robust pace. Orders for communications equipment grew 22 percent in  the first quarter and have been running well ahead of shipments. Orders for other categories of  equipment declined in the first quarter but are still above shipments, implying a  significant backlog of  unfilled orders that ought to  maintain moderate growth in shipments in  the near term.

Outlays on nonresidential structures were temporarily boosted in  the fourth quarter by  the purchase of structures at the  Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve; the dropback from this purchase, combined with the construction-put-in-place data, points to  a  decline in outlays of 10 percent at an  annual rate in  the first quarter, the fourth decline in the past five quarters. 1 4 The  data on construction

Business Inventories

Investment in  business inventories excluding motor vehicles was amazingly heavy in  the first quarter. Nonetheless, for most manufacturing nd trade  groupings,  book-value  inventory-sales  tios a ra in  March were within the ranges observed over the past twelve months.

The growth of  manufacturers' stocks slowed in  March after having accumulated fairly rapidly in  the first two months of  the quarter. Contributing to the slowdown were liquidations of stocks held by  producers of aircraft, primary metals, and industrial machinery. The  latter industry  ncludes  akers of office  nd i m a computing equipment, who  reported    slight awdown  in  book-value a dr stocks in  March; with shipments rising strongly, the inventoryshipments ratio in  this category, as discussed earlier, fell sharply for the fourth month in a  row.

Inventory accumulation was boosted considerably in  the first quarter y large  increases  n  a number  of sectors  hat old b i t h petroleum stocks. The unusually warm winter reduced demand for refined products, and low  prices provided an  incentive for refiners and distributors to accumulate stocks. Despite further large price declines, book-value stocks at petroleum refiners fell at only a $1.5 billion rate in  March after having declined $9.5 billion on  net in the  previous  two months; however, the  BEA estimates hat eal t r stocks  held  by  refiners se ro $11 billion  average  annual rate)  n ( i January and February.

the pattern seen in  these sectors, the BEA's estimate of  real nondurable inventories held by  nonmerchant wholesalers, a  grouping that also includes a  large petroleum component, rose only a  bit in the first quarter.

Inventories held by  merchant wholesalers excluding motor vehicles accumulated at  a  $10 billion annual rate in  March, about in line with sales.15 Inventories in  the "other nondurables" grouping increased markedly, continuing the large up-and-down swings of previous months. In  March, the  buildup in  this volatile sector was  driven by  increased stocks at  alcohol and  drug wholesalers. However, in recent months, no  single subcategory has consistently driven the large changes in  this grouping.

Book-value inventories at  non-auto retailers rose at a  $23.7 billion annual rate in  March; moreover, rather than having declined slightly, February stocks are now  estimated to have increased at $12.2 billion annual rate. As  a  result, at a  $19.2 billion annual rate, the average pace of stockbuilding in  this sector in  the first quarter was nearly four times its fourth-quarter pace. Much of  the step-up in  inventory investment last quarter occurred at stores selling nondurable goods, but higher rates of accumulation also occurred at furniture stores and dealers selling lumber and building supplies. Still, sales growth was strong last quarter, and inventory-sales ratios for most types of  retail establishments were in  the middle or  at  the low end of  their recent ranges.16 Federal Government

Real consumption and gross investment by  the federal government fell nearly 8  percent (annual rate) in  the first quarter because of a  sharp drop in defense spending. Nondefense purchases rebounded from the fourth-quarter level which had been  held down by  the sale of equipment and structures at the Elk Hills Petroleum Reserve. Over the past four quarters, real defense spending fell 2  percent, and real nondefense spending was nearly unchanged. Spending restraint and robust growth of  receipts appear to  have brought the

NIPA measures of the federal budget into surplus in  the first quarter for the first time since 1969.17

Incoming unified budget data have pointed to  an  even larger surplus for fiscal year 1998 than seemed likely at the time of  the last Greenbook. The budget recorded a  $19 billion surplus over the twelve months ending in  March, and daily data indicate that April receipts were robust. Indeed, the Congressional Budget Office now projects that the fiscal 1998 surplus will be  in  the range of $43 billion to $63 billion, up from a projected surplus of  $8  billion in March. The improvement reflects stronger-than-expected receipts of withheld and employment taxes and nonwithheld taxes, combined with weaker-than-expected outlays.

Receipts rose 8  percent in the first quarter compared with a year earlier, led by  growth of 9 percent in  personal income taxes and social insurance collections. Net corporate income taxes fell, as a  small rise in collections was more than offset by  increased refunds. The stalling of corporate taxes is consistent with the relatively weak growth seen in  S&amp;P 500 profits. First-quarter outlays were only 1-1/2 percent higher than a  year earlier, held down by  a  drop in  defense spending and a  leveling-off in  debt service payments.

Daily Treasury Statements indicate that April tax payments were 10 percent higher than a year earlier. Nonwithheld personal income taxes and social insurance contributions--primarily final payments on 1997 income tax liability--were $20 billion, or 16 percent, higher than last year's heady level. Preliminary calculations incorporating the  April data show that the effective personal income tax rate on a  liability basis--the ratio of  the staff's estimate of personal income tax liability to the  NIPA tax  base--rose

1/2 percentage point in  1997, to 13-1/2 percent (chart). 1 8 The effective tax rate, computed on a  liability basis, has risen 2  percentage points since the 1992-94 period, as a  result of an increase in  marginal tax rates, increased capital gains realizations, real bracket creep, and a  shift in  the income distribution. April collections were also boosted by strong withheld personal income tax and social insurance receipts.

A  fiscal 1998 supplemental spending bill was enacted at  the end of  April. The bill provides $3  billion in  budget authority for military spending related to Bosnia and Iraq, $2-1/2 billion for natural disaster assistance, and $500 million for veterans' compensation. The bill also included $2-1/2 billion of rescissions of  budget authority (which are not expected to  affect outlays) for low-income housing reserve funds and for excess contract authority for  the Airport Improvement Program. OMB expects that the  bill will raise outlays $1  billion in fiscal 1998 and $1-1/2 billion in fiscal 1999. Not much headway has been made on the fiscal 1999 budget. The Senate passed its version of  the Budget Resolution in  early April, calling for small tax cuts financed by  reductions to mandatory spending, but the House has yet to vote on  a  budget blueprint.

State and Local Government Sector

Real consumption and investment outlays by state and local governments now appear to  have been little changed in  the  first quarter. Increases in  spending on  consumption items were largely offset by  a  drop in  outlays for construction that now looks to  have 19 been larger than BEA  had assumed. Sizable declines were recorded in  all major categories of construction except highway construction, which rose a  little. The pattern suggests that the difficulties associated with the attempts to  pass legislation reauthorizing transportation programs did not substantially disrupt construction; it  now appears that legislation will not be  passed for at least several weeks. State and local employment rose 18,000 in April, nearly the same as the average increase in  the first quarter.

The fiscal health of  the state and local sector remains favorable, with state governments faring especially well. All states appear to be  finishing fiscal year 1998, which ends on  June 30 for most states, with their general fund budgets in  balance. Ending balances have risen as a  share of expenditures in  each of  the past five years, consistently outstripping states' expectations (chart, top panel). Although the final tally for 1998 is  not yet available, revenues again appear to  be  coming in  above expectations while outlays are close to target. According to the Center for the Study of  the States, state tax collections for the first three quarters of  the fiscal year (1997:Q3 through 1998:Q1) were, on average, 6  percent above collections for the same period one year earlier. Moreover, although state data are not yet available, extrapolations based on federal nonwithheld income tax payments this spring suggest that states that collect income taxes have received strong payments once again.

Regarding local governments, reports from the National League of Cities and the National Association of Counties indicate that the fiscal positions of  these jurisdictions are improving, although they do  not appear to  be as  well off as the states, in  part because they rely heavily on  property taxes rather than personal income taxes for their revenues. In  recent years, overall receipts from property taxes as a  share of  state and local expenditures have fallen, while income tax revenue has risen (chart, lower panel).

Prices

In  April, the CPI increased 0.2 percent, the largest increase in six  months. Energy prices edged down after having fallen rapidly in  the previous four months, and food prices edged up after having been unchanged in  both February and  March. Consumer prices excluding food and energy rose 0.3 percent, as  tobacco prices jumped and services prices accelerated. Over the twelve months ending in April, the CPI rose only 1.4 percent, down from the 2-1/2 percent rate recorded over the previous twelve-month period. Excluding food and energy, CPI inflation over the past year was 2.1 percent, the smallest twelve-month increase since April 1966.

Consumer energy prices declined only 0.1 percent in  April. Gasoline prices fell more slowly than in  recent months, as crude oil prices, which had bottomed out in  mid-March, began to  move up somewhat. Since their recent trough, crude oil prices have risen roughly $2.50 per barrel; the spot price of  West Texas intermediate,

for example, has averaged nearly $15.50 per barrel thus far in  May, up from the low  of about $13 per barrel recorded in  mid-March. As a result, private survey data suggest that, on a  seasonally adjusted basis, the retail price of gasoline turned up in  May, the first increase in eight months.

The CPI for food was relatively stable for a  third month in April. Grocery store prices were down a  tenth for a  third month, and the index for food away from  home rose 0.2 percent, matching its average for the year to date. Over the twelve months ending in April, food prices were up just 2.0 percent, down from a 2-3/4 percent pace in  the year-earlier period. Farm prices in  April remained well below the levels of a  year earlier, and agricultural futures prices have changed little, on  balance, since the  week of the March Greenbook. As of  May 10, planting of  crops was moving ahead at a  faster-than-average clip despite weather-related delays in  some regions.

The index for consumer prices excluding food and energy increased 0.3 percent in  April. Goods prices edged up, reflecting a jump in  tobacco prices, but prices of  durable goods fell further. Tobacco prices have fluctuated widely in  recent months: the April index is now  up 4-3/4 percent from December, which is roughly consistent with announced price hikes over this period. The index for non-energy services rose 0.4 percent last month, the largest increase in  three years. Owners equivalent rent rose 0.4 percent in April, after having increased 0.2 percent in  March; as a  result, the six-month increase in  owners equivalent rent has picked up  to 3-1/2 percent (an annual rate).

Falling import prices have helped hold the rate of change of core CPI commodities to 0.2 percent over the year ending in  April, despite a  sizable increase in  tobacco prices; prices of non-energy services advanced 3.0 percent over that period, a  bit less than over the preceding twelve months. Declines in prices of  motor vehicles have been an  important contributor to the deceleration in  prices of core consumer goods. However, the prices of  other import-sensitive goods--such as apparel and footwear, toys, and photographic equipment--have also declined. The small deceleration in prices of non-energy services is the result of slower price increases for services other than shelter and medical care, such as  air fares and personal care services.

Large declines in energy and non-oil import prices and the deceleration in food prices have also been important contributors to the  favorable performance of  other broad measures of  prices. In  the first quarter of  this year, the four-quarter changes in chain price indexes for GDP and for PCE excluding food and energy were down 3/4 percent and 1 percent, respectively, from  their pace a  year earlier. As  with the core CPI, the deceleration in  the chain price index for PCE excluding food and energy reflects a  decline in  prices of  durable goods and a  deceleration in  services other than energy and  housing.

Short-term inflation expectations held near their first-quarter level in  April and remain substantially below year-ago levels. As measured by  the Michigan SRC index, mean one-year-ahead inflation expectations edged down to 2.7 percent in  April, 1 percentage point below the level recorded a year earlier. The median one-year-ahead expectations were unchanged in April at  2.4 percent, about 1/2 percentage point lower than a  year earlier. Longer-term inflation expectations in  the Michigan survey--both the mean and the median--edged down in  April from their first-quarter average and now lie somewhat below year-ago levels.

Greater import price competition may have also helped hold down the PPI for finished goods, especially for capital equipment. Prices of  capital equipment in  the PPI fell 3/4 percent at  an annual rate in  the first quarter, reflecting further declines for motor vehicles and a  very large drop in  computer prices. In  April, prices of  capital equipment edged up 0.1 percent, as  the prices of  motor vehicles purchased by  businesses rose 0.4 percent. Overall computer prices declined more slowly in  April--2.3 percent--than in  the first quarter, despite an  even faster rate of  decline in personal computer prices. Excluding computers and motor vehicles, capital goods prices were unchanged, on  average, last month.

Prices at  earlier stages of  processing remain subdued. The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy was unchanged in  April, after declining in  the first quarter, and stood about unchanged from its level a  year earlier. The PPI for core crude materials fell further in  April to a  level 5-3/4 percent below a year earlier. Since mid-April, when the PPI was measured, the Journal of Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price indexes have risen a bit on  balance.

Labor Costs

The Employment Cost Index for hourly compensation of  private industry workers increased at  a  seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.7 percent over the three months ending in  March after having risen 4.3 percent in  the fourth quarter. Over the past twelve months, this measure of  hourly compensation rose 3.5 percent, up 1/2 percentage point from its pace in  the preceding twelve months.

On  a twelve-month-change basis, most industries registered an acceleration in  compensation relative to the year-earlier period, with the largest pickup in  finance, insurance, and real estate. Compensation in  FIRE has been boosted in  the past two quarters by sizable nonproduction bonuses and commissions generated, in  part, from a wave of  mortgage refinancings. Most occupational groups also recorded an  acceleration in compensation. The large pickup for workers in service occupations likely reflects the influence of last fall's minimum wage increase. We think that last year's increase of the minimum wage had a  larger effect than the 1996 minimum wage hike because a higher percentage of  workers were below the new  minimum at the time of the latest increase. Gains were also notable for most 20 white collar workers.

The acceleration in  compensation costs over the past twelve months resulted primarily from faster growth of  wages and salaries, which rose 4.0 percent over the twelve months ended in  March, 0.6 percentage point more than the increase over the preceding twelve months. By contrast, benefits rose a modest 2.3 percent over the past twelve months, just 1/4 percentage point above the increase recorded over the year-earlier period. Benefits were boosted by a pickup in  the costs of  health insurance and supplemental pay (including bonuses and wage differentials for overtime and late shifts). However, pension costs decelerated over the past year because rising stock prices reduced the need for employers to pay into defined benefit plans; costs for state unemployment insurance and workers' compensation fell sharply as  well.

Anecdotal reports point to  a  further pickup in  health insurance costs. Many managed care plans are raising premiums in  an  attempt to recoup the losses they suffered in 1997, and both consumers and providers are seeking changes (for example, fewer restrictions on access to specialists) that may  make it  more difficult for insurers

to  restrain costs. Additional upward pressure on premiums appears to  be coming from higher spending on  prescription drugs and efforts by  providers to offset the reductions in  Medicare reimbursements. Information about 1999 is  very limited, but  many insurers are reportedly seeking increases above those agreed to this year. For example, CalPERS, the second largest purchaser of employee health benefits (behind the federal government), will see an  average increase of  at least 5  percent in  HMO  premiums, and that figure could be  considerably higher if  Kaiser, which covers more than onethird of CalPERS HMO  members, were to achieve the 12 percent increase it  is seeking. In 1998, CalPERS HMO  premiums rose about 3  percent after having declined for four years.

Hourly compensation in  the nonfarm business sector--reported in the Productivity and Cost report--rose at  a  4.1 percent annual rate in the first quarter, down considerably from its rapid fourth21 quarter pace.21 Over the past four quarters, compensation per hour has increased 4.1 percent, little changed from  the 4.0 percent rise over the previous four-quarter period. This measure of compensation has continued to rise more rapidly than the  ECI, likely reflecting the rise in  overtime, a  shift toward industries with higher-than-average pay, and perhaps greater job-grade creep in  a tight labor market. These factors affect compensation per hour in the  nonfarm business sector but should affect the fixed-weighted ECI.

Information on  labor costs this quarter are mostly limited to the BLS monthly data on  average hourly earnings of  production and nonsupervisory workers. In  April, average hourly earnings rose 0.3 percent on  a  published basis; when adjusted for the distortion caused by  reporting problems with the workweek, however, they increased 0.5 percent, the fastest pace in six  months. On  both the published and adjusted basis, the twelve-month change in average hourly earnings was 4.2 percent in  April, up 1/2 percentage point from the year-earlier period.

The difficulties in adjusting hours for the Easter holiday this year may also affect average hourly earnings by reducing the amount of overtime worked during the week at establishments with  Monday-toSunday workweeks. Thus far, the BLS does not believe that an  Easter

adjustment is warranted for the average hourly earnings series for this April. Our own view is  that the Easter problem may have caused average hourly earnings in  all private industries to  be  understated in  April by  one or two cents. 2 2

APPENDIX

THE  LENGTH-OF-PAY-PERIOD PROBLEM AND  LABOR MARKET INDICATORS

Earlier this year, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uncovered a statistical error in  its method of  estimating hours and earnings of production or  nonsupervisory workers from the payroll survey. The problem, which has come to be  known as the length-of-pay-period (LP) bias, generates a  spurious negative correlation between measured hours or  earnings and the  number of  weekdays in  the first half of  each month and, to a  lesser extent, in  the month as a whole. The problem affects payroll series calculated directly from these data (average weekly hours and average hourly earnings) as well as estimates from other BLS programs that use these hours and earnings measures as source data (such as output per hour and compensation per hour in  the nonfarm business sector).

As  part of  the payroll (or  establishment) survey, the BLS asks establishments to report the paid hours of  production or nonsupervisory employees during the pay period that includes the 12th of  the month. For employees paid on  a  monthly or  semimonthly basis, the length of  this pay period varies from month to  month. For example, the semimonthly pay  period that includes the 12th can contain either ten  weekdays or eleven weekdays. Under the assumption that establishments report actual hours paid, the BLS makes an adjustment to each establishment's reported hours in  order to convert them to a  common weekly basis. Put another way, BLS staff standardize the hours reported by  establishments to  make them match a  standard-length month or semimonth.

Last fall, the BLS became aware of  a  negative correlation between the length of the month or semimonth and changes in  the reported levels of  average weekly hours and average hourly earnings. This spring, the  BLS interviewed a  sample of establishments that use monthly or semimonthly pay periods and confirmed that many have been reporting hours as  though each month or semimonth were of "typical" length. That is, some firms have  been "standardizing" the pay period themselves, so  when the  BLS performs its standardizing adjustment, it is, in  effect, over-adjusting hours for these firms. This problem, which mostly concerns establishments that have semimonthly pay  periods, has led to  an overstatement of  hours in  months with ten-weekday pay periods (which are "standardized" up  too much) and an  understatement in  months with eleven-weekday pay periods (which are "standardized" down too much). The problem appears to have begun in 1989, when the BLS stopped asking establishments to specify the length of  the pay period for which they  were reporting, and is concentrated in  the service-producing sectors of  the economy.

A  similar problem plagues the measure of average hourly earnings. The BLS computes average hourly earnings by  dividing total weekly payroll (of  production or nonsupervisory workers) at an establishment by  total weekly hours, after adjusting both numbers to reflect a  standard-length pay period. Thus, "over-standardization" can affect both payrolls and hours. Hourly earnings are not affected in  cases in  which the establishment reports both payrolls and hours on  an actual length-of-pay-period basis, or in cases in which the establishment reports both payrolls and  hours on  a standardized length-of-pay-period basis, for  which the biases from the  over-standardization cancel. However, a  significant number of

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

establishments standardize payrolls without standardizing hours.1 Thus, the BLS's over-standardization of  payrolls causes average hourly earnings to  be  overstated in  months with ten-weekday pay periods and understated in  months with eleven-weekday pay periods. This bias in  average hourly earnings is  much less severe than is the bias in  hours, but it is  nonetheless significant.

With the  May data (published in June), the BLS will institute procedures to adjust the hours and earnings data to account for these reporting problems and  will revise the data back to 1989 accordingly. In the meantime, the BLS has provided the public with an  experimental series of  corrected figures for average weekly hours and average hourly earnings, which the staff has used to correct other affected data series (table). Unfortunately, the corrected workweeks and earnings are available to  only one decimal place, and the associated rounding can  make a  considerable difference to the corrections made by  the staff. Thus, all of  the corrected series should be  viewed as approximate for the present. In  addition, the BLS's correction factors are not yet official and are subject to some uncertainty until the published (and rebenchmarked) series are officially released in June.

Additional complications arise when  we  use the BLS estimates to correct the data series published in  the BLS's Productivity and Costs release. In  particular, the data for the nonfarm business (NFB) sector, which is  the most prominent example, refer to  a broader group of workers than production and nonsupervisory workers on  -private nonfarm payrolls; they include nonproduction or supervisory employees, self-employed persons, employees of government enterprises, and unpaid family workers. Because the data subject to  the LP  bias refer to only the narrower group, we  must scale down the corrections to hours. This adjustment adds another, albeit small, element of  imprecision to the staff's corrections.

Output in  the nonfarm business sector is  probably not much affected by  the LP bias, because it  is constructed so as  to resemble a  product-side measure of output. The estimates for some elements of  output are influenced by  data on  the income side, but we  believe that this effect is small. Therefore, corrected output per hour in the nonfarm business sector can be  reasonably approximated by dividing output by corrected hours.

We  are more uncertain about how  to  adjust compensation per  hour for the LP  bias. For historical data (currently data prior to 1997), annual estimates of  compensation are derived independently of the  data from  the payroll survey (from  unemployment insurance system records, tax data, and other sources). Thus, the bias in compensation per hour has been the same as the  bias in output per hour just discussed. For the more recent period, however, the BEA uses the hours and earnings data from the payroll survey (along with other data) to estimate compensation. Moreover, even after benchmarking, the payroll survey data are used to interpolate the quarterly patterns between the annual benchmarks. BEA  staff have routinely made judgmental adjustments to the payroll data to smooth through movements that they viewed as distorted, either by observable special factors, such as  particularly bad storms, or because the data themselves appeared unusually volatile. As  a result, the BEA's estimates of  compensation probably have corrected

somewhat for the LP  bias, although there apparently is no  explicit correction for the LP  bias as such. Unfortunately, we  do  not know the extent to  which the BEA's compensation estimates correct for the LP bias, and thus we have little sense of the degree of  distortion remaining in  estimates of recent compensation per  hour, or  in  the intra-year movements in estimates of  past compensation per hour for earlier years.

Interest rates were little changed on  balance over the intermeeting period. After dropping a  bit in  early April, rates crept higher in response to public statements by FOMC members expressing concern about the risk of  unsustainably rapid economic growth. Rates stepped up a  notch near month-end amid press reports that the latest policy directive had tilted toward restraint, but they subsequently receded when incoming data indicated that inflation continued to  be  subdued even as the economy grew rapidly. Federal funds and Eurodollar futures rates remain relatively flat for contracts through the summer, implying (after allowance for a small term premium) that market participants place only small odds on  System tightening at the next few  FOMC meetings. Quality spreads on  corporate debt have widened a  bit but still are quite narrow by historical standards, and major equity price indexes have tacked on gains of 2  percent to 5 percent. The higher stock prices, in the face of slower growth in  earnings, have kept price-earnings ratios for these indexes near historical highs.

Private sector borrowing has remained brisk in recent months and has involved some shifting from shorter-term to longer-term debt, particularly by businesses. Gross bond issuance by nonfinancial firms rose to a  record level in  April from a  strong March, while bank loans to businesses weakened and net issuance of commercial paper turned negative over those months. Households have been adding substantially to  their total mortgage debt as  the housing market has boomed and have been refinancing a  sizable portion of their existing mortgages at lower rates. Consumer credit expansion has  been relatively light, at  least partly because of substitution into mortgage debt in  the course of refinancing a mortgage or obtaining a  home equity loan. Borrowing by state and local governments has  eased off its torrid pace very recently as municipalities have pared their offerings at a  time of  seasonally low  investor demand. Gross issuance of  Treasury debt has been trimmed of  late, as swollen tax-payment receipts have enabled the Treasury to pay down a  hefty amount of  marketable debt.

The monetary aggregates continued to grow rapidly in  April, boosted by a  larger-than-seasonal buildup in  household liquid accounts in  anticipation of income tax  payments. Since the fourth

quarter of  last year, M2  has grown at  a  rate of 8-1/4 percent, well above the upper bound of  its target range. In  May,  however, with the tax payment dates having passed, M2 balances are apparently running off.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of  nonfinancial corporate bonds surged in  April on  the heels of robust growth in  March, in large part reflecting a desire to lock in low  funding costs. A  large portion of  the proceeds from investment-grade offerings have been used to  retire shorter-term liabilities, including both  bank loans and commercial paper. Indeed, following a  slight runoff in  March, nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding dropped more than $8  billion in  April. Gross offerings of speculative-grade bonds climbed to a  record high in  April, but a  substantial portion of  the funds has been used to retire outstanding debt with higher interest rates. On  balance, total net borrowing by businesses over the past two months has moderated from  the elevated pace of early this year to one closer to that of 1997 as  a  whole.

The most recent spate of  junk bond issuance involved several companies with very low  bond ratings that entered the market for the first time. As a  result, the percentage of  total junk  bond proceeds raised through issues rated B-  or lower has jumped to 35 percent for the current year to date (chart, lower left), establishing a bond market tone reminiscent of  the go-go days of  the late 1980s. 1 Indeed, if  the recent pace persists, this year's dollar volume of proceeds from lower-rated junk issuance will surpass 1988's $20 billion record by  midyear. Perhaps because of  pressure from the recent flood of  offerings, junk spreads recently widened about 10 basis points, but they are still close to  historical lows.

Recent information on  corporate credit quality has been mixed. Missed payments by  two large retailers helped boost junk  bond defaults in  the first quarter; nonetheless, the default rate on  junk

debt remains quite low  by  historical standards. In addition, business failures slowed in  the first quarter after picking up  some during the second half of  1997. Rating changes in  the first quarter resulted in a  small net upgrade in  the nonfinancial sector (chart, lower right). However, looking forward, the amount of nonfinancial debt on  Moody's Watchlist for a  possible downgrade slightly exceeds 2 that on review for an  upgrade. Expected default rates, based on the distribution of outstanding debt by  rating and default probabilities across the rating classes, moved up  during the first quarter as the  share of  outstanding debt at  the bottom end of the credit-quality spectrum increased.

Gross equity issuance by  nonfinancial firms surged in  March but retreated to  a more modest $5-1/4 billion total in  April. Seasoned offerings have been bolstered in  these months by  companies issuing equity to  help pay for cash-financed acquisitions. IPO activity remained fairly light in  March and April. Although investors have bid  prices sharply higher for a  few Internet and computer software companies, they have otherwise remained relatively cautious about new  offerings.

Despite strong gross issuance of equities, net issuance has continued to  be quite negative and, based on  recent announcements, will remain so  for a  time. About $27 billion in  equity was retired in  merger and acquisition transactions completed during the first quarter, and  this pace was roughly maintained in  April. Since the beginning of  the year, more than half of  the equity retirement occurred through merger and acquisition deals of less than $1 billion, and lists of pending mergers suggest that this pattern will persist. Corporations also continued to announce sizable share repurchase programs.

With  most first-quarter earnings reports now in, the fourquarter growth rate in S&amp;P 500 earnings per share appears to have slowed to around 4  percent, from 7  percent in  the fourth quarter (chart, upper left). Profits in  the nonfinancial sector were nearly flat year-over-year. In contrast, the growth of  financial sector profits picked up  in the first quarter, to about 15 percent, driven by  spectacular gains in  the securities industry.

The deceleration in  the profits of  nonfinancial firms was more than accounted for by  a  plunge in  the profits of  oil and gas companies (chart, upper right), together with an erosion of earnings in  the technology sector that has stemmed partly from the financial turmoil in  Asia. In  contrast, profits for nonfinancial firms outside these two sectors--companies that account for about threefourths of the profits of  nonfinancial firms in  the S&amp;P 500--stayed on a  steady 5 percent to 7  percent growth path. Profits at  some of these firms--particularly airlines--have probably benefited from the lower fuel costs depressing energy sector profits; in fact, the decline in  fuel costs may  have boosted first-quarter earnings growth of  the "other nonfinancial" sector roughly 1 percentage point. Assuming that oil prices remain at  their current levels, this beneficial effect (on  four-quarter comparisons) likely will extend into the second quarter. After that, however, the boost to  profits is  expected to  dissipate and then to  at least partly reverse as the cost savings of  cheaper fuels are passed on  to consumers.

Reflecting the propensity of  both analysts and investors to view  the recent weakness in  profits as transitory and to view the economic outlook as  favorable to earnings, equity prices moved up to record highs during the intermeeting period before dropping back a bit (chart, lower left). Most major equity indexes rose 2 percent to 5  percent over the period, bringing year-to-date gains to between 15 percent and 20 percent, although the Russell 2000--an index of small-cap firms--has gained only about 10 percent year-to-date.

These recent price gains, together with the current flattening of  earnings, has pushed many valuation measures further beyond historical experience. The forward-earnings yield on the S&amp;P 500 -- equal to expected earnings in  the year ahead divided by  current price--has fallen below 4-1/2 percent (chart, lower right). At the same time, the real long-term bond yield, measured as  the difference between the nominal thirty-year yield minus the Philadelphia Fed's measure of long-term inflation expectations, has remained about unchanged at 3-1/2 percent.

Household Sector Finance

Total household debt appears to  have posted another sizable gain in  the first quarter, reflecting the robust expansion in consumer spending and housing activity. The growth of  household debt was again driven by  strong mortgage borrowing, as consumer credit increased only 3-1/2 percent at an  annual rate in  the first

quarter (table). The growth of consumer credit likely has been stunted to some extent by paydowns associated with this year's increased mortgage refinancings.

Low  mortgage rates and strong home sales continue to  fuel household mortgage borrowing. Complete data for the first quarter are  not yet available, but the figures for commercial banks and mortgage pools are indicative of robust growth. Available indicators for April point to a  continuation of  this trend; for instance, the  mortgage purchase application index from the Mortgage Bankers Association remains at an  elevated level (chart). The MBA index of  mortgage refinancing applications is also high, although below the peak reached in  January (chart).

The few recent indicators of  household credit quality have been favorable. The auto loan delinquency rate at the captive auto finance companies declined in  February and March and is  at its lowest level in  two years (chart). Also, the delinquency rate on credit card receivables backing securities rated by  Moody's fell in March from the  year-earlier period for the fourth consecutive month (not shown).

Households continue to  invest heavily in  stock and bond mutual funds. The Investment Company Institute reports that net sales of long-term mutual funds in  March totaled nearly $32 billion, with both stock and bond funds selling briskly (table). Staff estimates based on  weekly ICI data suggest that equity fund sales remained strong in  April, but that net flows into bond funds moderated some, quite possibly because of  redemptions associated with income tax payments. Sales of international equity funds have bounced back in recent months after falling off sharply in the October-January period; however, equity funds focused on  Asia had small net outflows in  March and  April. Preliminary data, provided by  the ICI on  a confidential basis, indicate that mutual fund inflows were very strong in  the first week of  May. Household balance sheets continue to  be strengthened by  rising equity prices, which boosted the ratio of household net worth to income to  a  new  high in  the first quarter (chart).

Federal Sector Finance

Strong inflows of  federal tax receipts this spring have led the Treasury to further pare its weekly bill auctions, from $14-1/2 billion in February to  $13-1/2 billion in  March and to

$13 billion in  April. The decline in  bills auctioned in  recent years has curtailed liquidity in this market, threatened the benchmark status of these instruments, and lengthened the average maturity of Treasury debt. Going forward, the Treasury plans to reduce coupon issuance and step up bill sales to  curb these trends: After this quarter, it will stop issuing three-year notes and will reduce the frequency of five-year note auctions to quarterly from monthly. Bill auctions are expected to rise back to the $14 billion to $15 billion range after the second quarter, reversing a  long string of  net paydowns. The Treasury also plans to slash the amount of cash  management bills outstanding by  about $50 billion in  the second quarter.

In  April, the Treasury held its  first auction of thirty-year index-linked bonds, raising about $8 billion at a yield of 3.74 percent. With a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.6, this auction was viewed as less successful than the initial auctions of  fiveand ten-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS), for which bids ran at least three times the amount sold. The Treasury plans to sell an  additional $8  billion of thirty-year indexed bonds in July as a  reopening of  this issue. TIPS yields have tended to rise in  recent months, and the  TIPS yield curve has a  pronounced downward slope, with the thirty-year bond yielding about 25 basis points less than the five-year note. This inversion may reflect, in  part, the combined effect of  high and rising real short-term rates and expectations that they  will eventually decline.

Foreign holdings of  marketable U.S. Treasuries evidently have plateaued after having risen substantially since early 1995. Foreign official holdings fell over recent weeks, primarily as a result of  the sale of  about $15 billion of  bills by  the Bank of Japan to  finance its mid-April intervention in support of  the yen.

Government-sponsored enterprises continued to issue large amounts of  debt over the intermeeting period, capitalizing on  the slightly lower market yields and the favorable financing environment resulting from the cutback in  Treasury auctions. Freddie Mac completed the largest U.S. corporate debt sale ever--a $5  billion issue of  its new  Reference Notes series. These notes are intended to take advantage of  the reduction in  Treasury issuance to establish GSE  securities as  benchmarks for corporate issuance and to realize the yield advantages of  the additional liquidity that is associated with such status. Fannie Mae  has been issuing in volume as  well and

has announced that it plans to sell $100 billion of  debt over the year compared with $80 billion issued in 1997. Despite heavier issuance, spreads between non-callable agency-issued securities and Treasuries have remained largely unchanged, currently ranging from 17 to 35 basis points. The GSEs are  mainly using these newly raised funds to expand their portfolio holdings. Fannie Mae's net  mortgage portfolio increased $11 billion in  the first quarter, and Freddie Mac's portfolio expanded $22 billion. Both reported record earnings for  the first quarter.

State and Local Government Finance

Issuance of  municipal debt slowed in  April to  $21-1/2 billion from a  near record $29 billion in  March. Issuers, typically faced with  weakened investor demand during the tax-payment season, were hesitant to come to market in April. New capital raised was about $13 billion, well below the  March figure (although substantially more than last April). As in  the first quarter, the largest issuance for new  capital was in  the education, health, and transportation categories. With the rates on  tax-exempt securities backing up 10 to 12 basis points in  April, refundings also declined from the very rapid March pace. Indicative of  the market's difficulty in  absorbing new  issues during the tax season, long-term yields relative to  Treasuries have risen a  bit despite the drop in issuance. Credit quality continued to  improve across all sectors over the first four months of  the  year, with the number of  upgrades outpacing the number of downgrades by a  ratio of around six to one. Monetary Aggregates and Bank Credit

The monetary aggregates expanded briskly in  April before slowing most recently. M2 grew at a 9 percent rate last month, about 1-1/4 percentage points faster than its first-quarter pace. A buildup in  household liquid accounts in  apparent preparation for income tax  payments boosted M2  growth well beyond the amount allowed for by seasonal factors. Indications are that M2 contracted in early May, presumably as tax payments cleared deposit accounts.

M3 grew slightly faster than M2 in  April. Most of  the increase in  M3's non-M2 components was accounted for by a 52 percent (SAAR) surge in  institutional money market mutual funds. The surge, which was most pronounced just before the deadline for corporate tax payments, was partly offset by a 10 percent runoff in large time deposits.

Net Percentage of  Domestic Respondents Tightening Standards for  C&amp;l Loans

The weakness in these deposits was linked to  a  decline in credit provided by  commercial banks in  April. Bank credit, adjusted for mark-to-market rules, fell at  a  2-1/2 percent rate, a  sharp turnaround from the double-digit monthly gains posted since the beginning of the year. Adjusted securities holdings fell at nearly a  19 percent rate in April following several months of  very rapid growth. Declines were evident in  both trading and investment accounts and were driven by  large sales of  mortgage-backed securities.

Loan growth also slowed markedly last month, registering only a 2-3/4 percent rise. The slowing was particularly pronounced for real estate credit and consumer loans. Even after adjusting consumer loans for a  sizable amount of securitizations, weakness was still evident in that category, most likely reflecting households' continued substitution of real estate credit for consumer loans. The reduced growth in  real estate lending by  banks owed partly to increased securitization of  home mortgages by  some large institutions in  April; underlying originations of primary mortgages apparently remained strong. The relatively small increase in  home equity loans (and the  March decline) reflects in part the folding of second mortgages into refinanced first liens.

Business loans, which slowed sharply in  March, declined a little in  April. The movement of  business loans from balance sheets to collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) contributed to some of  the softening in  business loans over March and April. In  addition, as noted, corporations have continued to  use the proceeds of  bond offerings to pay down bank loans and other forms of  debt. Business loans made by  foreign banks--for whom CLO issuance was particularly pronounced--plummeted at  a  31 percent annual rate last month, whereas domestic institutions recorded moderate increases.

The  May Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey found that a handful of domestic banks, on  net, had eased business lending standards since the January survey (chart) and that a  larger number had been providing more favorable terms, suggesting a more accommodative posture than in  January. 3 About 40  percent of  the domestic respondents, on  net, had narrowed yield spreads for large firms, and

about a  quarter reported narrower spreads for small businesses. By contrast, about a  quarter of  the branches and agencies of foreign banks reported tighter standards on commercial and industrial loans. About a  third, on  net, reported increasing costs of credit lines, and somewhat smaller proportions reported widening spreads and cutting loan sizes. These institutions--primarily arms of  Japanese banks--attributed their tightening mainly to  a weakening of  their parents' capital positions.

APPENDIX

THE MAY  SENIOR LOAN OFFICER OPINION SURVEY ON  BANK LENDING PRACTICES

The May 1998 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on  Bank Lending Practices, primarily covering changes over the past three months, posed the usual questions bearing on  the supply of  and demand for bank loans to  businesses and households. Additional questions targeted the recent growth in  bank securities holdings, residential mortgage loans, and loans to real estate investment trusts (REITS); banks' handling of  possible risks related to  the year 2000 preparedness of their customers; and the effects of the economic problems in  Asia on  the provision of trade credit to  firms in  the affected economies.

A  few of  the domestic respondents reported easing standards on loans to  businesses, and a  large percentage cut their spreads on such loans. These results are similar to those reported last year: in  January, lending standards were about unchanged, on  net, and fewer banks reported easing loan terms. The May survey shows foreign branches and agencies continuing to  pull back from business lending, with many--mainly those of Japanese banks--reporting tighter standards and terms. Lending to  REITS was reported to  have expanded rapidly over the past year, reflecting heavy demand. A number of domestic and foreign respondents reported increased requests for trade finance from firms in  emerging economies in  Asia affected by  the financial problems in  the region, but many of  the banks that had provided such finance in  the past indicated that they were less willing to do so  now.

The survey showed small mixed changes in  standards and terms on loans to households. A  few banks tightened standards and terms on credit card loans, but the number doing so was smaller than in  past surveys. The fraction of  banks tightening standards on  other consumer loans also declined, and terms on  such loans were about unchanged, on  net. A  few banks reported eased standards for residential mortgage loans in  May, following no net change in the January survey. Household credit demands appear to  have increased, especially in  the case of  mortgage loans.

Responses to  a  special question suggested that the recent rapid growth in  securities reflected banks' efforts to increase leverage in  order to  boost returns on equity. Other special questions indicated that banks have not generally cut  back on lending to customers because of  possible year-2000 problems, although many are now  including year-2000 related covenants in some loan contracts.

Lending to  Businesses

The number of  U.S. banks reporting easier standards and terms for business borrowers on  the latest survey remained in  the range seen over the  past several quarters. A  few  banks, on  net, reported having eased standards for large and middle market firms, while only one bank reported having done so for small businesses. About

40 percent of  the respondents, on  net, narrowed yield spreads for larger firms, a  considerably higher share than in  the January survey. As in  January, about a  quarter reported narrower spreads for  small businesses. Smaller fractions eased other terms, such as the size and cost of  credit lines, loan covenants, and collateralization requirements.

Many branches and agencies--primarily those of Japanese banks-reported curtailing their business lending. About a  quarter of  the foreign respondents reported tighter standards on  commercial and industrial loans. Large fractions tightened loan terms: about a third boosted the costs of  credit lines, about a  quarter widened spreads over base rates, and 20 percent cut the maximum sizes of credit lines. Smaller fractions tightened other loan terms. Those tightening standards and terms indicated that their primary reason for doing so  was a weakening of  their parent bank's current or expected capital position.

The fraction of  respondents reporting strengthening demand for business loans has trended higher since mid-1996. In  the latest survey, about 30 percent of  the domestic banks noted increased demand for business loans from larger firms, and 20 percent from small businesses. About 20 percent of  the branches and agencies reported a  pickup in  demand as  well. Consistent with the last couple of  surveys, the increased demand was attributed to  higher borrowing for  mergers and acquisitions, plant and equipment investment, and inventory financing, in  that order.

A  few of  the domestic respondents reported eased standards for commercial real estate loans; there was little change in standards at the branches and agencies. As  in  January, substantial fractions of  both the domestic and foreign respondents reported increased demand for these loans.

The reported easing of lending standards for business and commercial real estate loans on  recent surveys is consistent with the findings of the  March 1998 FDIC Report on  Underwriting Practices, which summarizes trends in  bank underwriting standards between October 1997 and  March 1998 based on  questionnaires filled out  by  FDIC examiners following bank examinations. Relative to the previous six-month period, the fraction of  banks at  which the examiners noted specific risky practices in  the underwriting of business and commercial real estate loans generally increased by  a few  percentage points. Nonetheless, the examiners reported an increase of only 1 percentage point, to 11 percent, in  the fraction of  banks that employed underwriting practices of  above average risk.

The  May Senior Loan Officer survey included special questions that showed loans to  REITS had grown very rapidly at  many of  the respondent banks. Indeed, the volume of such loans, which can  be either secured or  unsecured, nearly doubled at the respondent banks over the past year. The  most rapid growth was at large domestic banks and the branches and agencies of foreign banks. The respondents indicated that this growth reflected primarily the  need

to finance increased direct holdings of properties by  REITS and, to a  somewhat lesser extent, a  pickup in  merger and acquisition activity involving REITS.

Another set of special questions found that about a  quarter of the domestic respondents and a  somewhat smaller share of the branches and agencies were receiving more requests for loans to finance imports or exports (or for other forms of  trade finance) from firms located in  East Asian emerging economies affected by  the economic problems in  the region. However, more than 80  percent of both the domestic and foreign respondents that had provided such trade financing before the outbreak of  the Asian economic problems last year indicated that they were now either somewhat or considerably less willing to  provide such loans, and a  few respondents are now  unwilling to  make such loans.

Lending to  Households

Fewer banks reported changes in consumer loan standards and terms than on recent surveys, suggesting that more banks have completed desired adjustments to take account of the deterioration in consumer loan quality that became evident a  couple of  years ago. On  net, two banks expressed greater willingness to make consumer installment loans, five banks tightened standards on  credit card loans, and three banks tightened standards on  other consumer loans. Most banks reported no changes in  credit card terms, although about 10 percent cut the size of  credit lines on  new or existing accounts. Terms on  other consumer loans, which had eased at a  few  banks on the last few  surveys, were about unchanged in May. The demand for consumer loans of all types increased at  more than 10 percent of  the respondents, on  net.

Standards applied to  mortgage applications were also about unchanged, with just three banks easing them. Nearly two-thirds of the  banks reported increased demand for these loans. Even though this question specifically refers to  mortgages to  purchase homes, the large number of respondents indicating increased demand may reflect, in  part, the brisk pace of refinancing activity. Indeed, the banks attributed the recent rise in residential mortgage loans on  banks' books to  both increased home sales and higher refinancing activity. They noted that refinancing has boosted mortgage loans held by  banks both  because some households take "cash outs" to pay down other debts or  make new purchases and because the refinancing of securitized mortgage loans moves the loans back onto bank books, at least temporarily.

Securities Growth

Responses to a  special question about the reasons for the rapid growth in  securities holdings late in  1997 and early this year indicated that U.S. banks were purchasing securities in  order to leverage up their capital and boost returns on  equity. Until recently, many bank holding companies repurchased shares to  pay out excess capital. However, with stock prices high, this alternative may not be  attractive now. In addition, the respondents pointed to the fact that U.S. bank  holding companies that engage in  pooling-ofinterest mergers are not allowed to repurchase shares for a  time. For banks in these holding companies, strong earnings may generate more capital than the firm needs for its operations, and securities purchases may  be  viewed as a  low-cost way to  put the excess capital to  work. In  addition to higher desired leverage, a  number of  the

foreign branches and agencies reported that the trend in  financial markets toward the securitization of  new classes of  assets was presenting banks with attractive securities to purchase.

Year 2000 Risks

Additional special questions asked respondents about the management of risks resulting from possible year-2000 problems of their customers. Both the domestic and foreign respondents had generally included year-2000 preparedness in  their underwriting and loan review standards. However, the responses suggest that U.S. banks are somewhat further along in  the  process of  assessing such risks: Most U.S. banks had evaluated more than 5  percent of their material business customers for year-2000 compliance, while only about half of  the branches and agencies had done so. Nonetheless, even among the domestic respondents, only a  fairly small number had evaluated a  large fraction of their customers. While few  of  the respondents reported rejecting loan applicants because of  year-2000 compliance problems, more than a  third currently impose year-2000related covenants either almost all of  the time or some of  the  time.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS

U.S. International Trade in Goods and Services

In  February, the U.S. trade deficit in  goods and services widened to $12.1 billion, as exports declined more than imports. The  deficit for January-February combined was substantially larger than for any quarter of 1997. Trade data for March will be  released on  May  20.

<!-- missing-text -->

Source. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureaus of  Economic Analysis and Census.

In January-February, exports of  goods and services were 2-1/2 percent less than in  the fourth quarter and  were lower than in any quarter since the first quarter of last year. The decline in January-February was primarily in  the value of  machinery, agricultural products, and industrial supplies. Much of  the declines in  exports were to countries in  Asia (especially Korea).

Imports of goods and services in  January-February were 1/4 percent higher than in  the fourth quarter. Increases in the  value of  imported automotive products and service payments more than offset declines in  oil and capital goods. Service payments were boosted by a  one-time payment for acquisition of  broadcast rights for  the 1998 Winter Olympic Games. The decline in  oil imports was due entirely to  a  $3 per barrel fall in oil import prices during January-February; the quantity of  imported oil edged up. Oil Imports and Prices

After very strong oil imports in  the second and third quarters of last year (driven by  extremely robust consumption), the quantity of  oil imported declined 2-1/2 percent in  the fourth quarter and

remained at  about the fourth-quarter level in January-February. These relatively lower import levels were driven mostly by  lower consumption as a  result of  favorable winter weather. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil imports were flat again in  March but rose sharply in  April. The sharp rise in  imports during April was due  to a  large accumulation of stocks.

For the first quarter, the price of oil imports dropped by  the greatest percent since the first quarter of 1991. Prices declined from November through March as the  market reacted to  increased production from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the  United Arab Emirates, to  weak demand in  Asia, to  relatively warm  weather in  the northern hemisphere, and to the resumption of  oil production for export by Iraq. In  April, the price of  imported oil increased, as impending production cuts by both OPEC and non-OPEC producers were agreed and market prices rose. The spot price of  WTI in  May  has remained near its April average level of  $15.44.

Prices of  Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  non-oil imports fell about 5  percent (at  an  annual rate) during the first quarter. This was a  somewhat sharper decline than in  the fourth quarter of  1997. A  substantial drop in  prices of imported non-oil industrial supplies in  the  first quarter contributed importantly to  the  faster decline in  prices of  non-oil imports. Non-oil import prices edged down further in  April, with declines in  all major trade categories except imported foods.

Prices of  exports also fell about 5  percent in  the first quarter. The  decline was attributable mostly to  lower prices for agricultural products (primarily oilseeds and grains). nonagricultural industrial supplies, computers, and semiconductors. Export prices declined slightly in  April. There were declines in all major trade categories except automotive vehicles.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Net private foreign purchases of  U.S. securities remained strong in  February and  March, bringing the total for the first quarter to $76 billion--near the level of  last year's fourth quarter. (See line 4  of  the Summary Table of  U.S. International Transactions.) Although the total changed little between the quarters, there was a  significant shift away from  U.S. Treasuries into other types of securities.

<!-- missing-text -->

Foreign purchases of corporate and agency bonds increased by $20 billion between the fourth quarter of  last year and the first quarter of  this year (line 4.b). The increase was evenly split between corporates and government agency bonds. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both issued heavily in  the first quarter in  efforts to establish global benchmark note programs. The rise in  foreign purchases of U.S. corporate bonds mirrors the general step up  in domestic and foreign issuance by  U.S. corporations. Foreign purchases of U.S. equities also rose throughout the  first quarter (line 4.c). In  terms of  major countries and regions, only Japanese residents recorded significant net sales of U.S. equities ($3 billion) in  the quarter.

In  contrast, private foreigners sold almost $14 billion in U.S. Treasuries in  March, yielding small net sales for the quarter as a  whole (line 4.a). This compares with net purchases of  over $35 billion in  the fourth quarter. Net purchases in  the United Kingdom slowed considerably, but  most of  the swing from the fourth to  the first quarter is attributable to  the Netherlands Antilles, which swung from  net purchases of $11 billion to  net sales of $15 billion. Japanese residents sold over $7 billion in the first quarter, about the same as  in  the  prior quarter.

U.S. residents' purchases of  foreign securities slowed considerably in  the  first quarter as a  small pickup in  equity purchases was more than offset by large net bond sales in  March (lines 5a  and 5b). Within equities, the  pickup from the fourth to first quarter was more than entirely accounted for by a  swing in sentiment toward Japan--from sales of  $4  billion to  purchases of $3 billion. In contrast, U.S. residents on  net sold about $2  billion in  European equities in  the first quarter, following small net purchases in  the fourth. Within bonds, there was a  considerable slowing in  purchases in  Europe and a  swing from  net sales to  net purchases in  Japan.

Foreign official reserve assets in  the  United States rose almost $10 billion in  March, following very modest increases earlier this year (line 1). Asian economies account for most of  the March increase, especially Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Thailand. The increase in  Thailand's reserves reflects an  IMF disbursement. OPEC reserves in  the United States also increased in  March, while

reserves of  European countries, especially Spain, declined. Partial data for April from FRBNY indicate a  small net increase in  official holdings--a large decline in  Japanese reserves, associated with foreign exchange intervention, was offset by  a  modest increase in Hong Kong's reserves and a huge increase in  Brazil's. Brazil's total foreign exchange reserves rose by  more than $20 billion in  the first four months of  this year and much of  this increase is now reflected in  its holdings at FRBNY.

There were  modest net  capital outflows recorded through private banking transactions in  the first quarter (line 3). U.S. banks reduced their net liabilities to  affiliated foreigners significantly and increased their claims on  unaffiliated foreigners. Offsetting much of  these outflows was an increase in  borrowing by U.S. banks and securities dealers from private nonbanks abroad. Much of  this latter borrowing was associated with  RP  transactions and likely reflects, in part, the financing of  the large foreign sales of  Treasuries in  March.

Recorded international banking flows for the first quarter can be  quite volatile as  they reflect end-of-month data for  both the end of  the calendar year and the Japanese fiscal year. However, monthly average data for net interbank claims on  affiliated foreign offices indicate that the reduced reliance on  funds from foreign affiliates persisted into April (line 1 of  the  International Banking Data table).

Foreign Exchange Markets

Since the March FOMC meeting, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar, measured against the 16  currencies in our  narrow index  (see Appendix),  is  little changed on balance. Movements in the index meld a depreciation of almost 4 percent against the mark and related currencies  and respective appreciations of more than 3 percent and 1-1/4 percent against sterling and the yen.

Over most  of the intermeeting period, the dollar steadily depreciated against the mark. Early in the period, signs  of robust German economic activity and the rejection of petitions seeking to block German participation in EMU contributed to the mark's rise. The dollar/mark rate changed little following the long-anticipated selection of 11  countries to participate in Stage III of the monetary union on May 1-2. The mark continued to  firm on the prospect of a smooth introduction of the euro and signs of  continued increases in economic activity in the  11  countries slated to enter EMU. Although Bundesbank officials later voiced the opinion that German rate hikes were not immediately necessary, the dollar recouped only a small portion of its declines vis-a-vis the mark.

Despite an increase in the Canadian 3-month interest  rate of roughly  25 basis points, the U.S. dollar has appreciated almost 2 percent  against the Canadian dollar over the intermeeting period. This week's assessment in the Bank of Canada's  semi-annual monetary policy report that Canadian monetary conditions were appropriate contrasted with market participants' perceptions  of easy conditions and contributed to the Canadian dollar's weakness,

Against the yen, the dollar has  gained on continued indications of weak economic activity in Japan. Throughout April, market participants remained generally unimpressed as the details of the Y16 trillion fiscal  stimulus package announced in late March became available. Long-term Japanese yields declined steadily. with the bellwether yield falling almost 30 basis  points on balance. On April 9-10,  Japanese authorities sold dollars for yen on a massive scale,

The effects of the intervention were short-lived and relatively small  -- the dollar immediately

depreciated 3 percent but  recouped these losses within 10 days. The dollar's recovery was boosted by  the G-7 communique that noted the excessive depreciation of  the yen  but made no  mention of  a coordinated policy response. Japanese share prices have also responded to  the poor economic performance, falling almost 6  percent from  their levels near the end of  the fiscal year on  March 30. These declines leave Japanese equity prices up  only about 1/4 percent from the end of  1997.

Over the intermeeting period, market participants have marked down the odds of  a  further tightening of  monetary policy in  the United Kingdom. Both short-term and long-term interest rates have fallen. The shift in  sentiment has come on  data releases consistent with a  slowing in  output growth and an easing of  price pressures in the United Kingdom. Sterling weakened on  later-confirmed press reports that between the March and April meetings of  the Monetary Policy Committee the balance of  members voting for no change in interest rates shifted from  4-4  to  5-3.

Elsewhere in  Europe, on  May 4  the central bank of  Denmark raised its discount and repo rates by  50  basis points in  order to support the  crown. The increase came as a  surprise to  market participants. On  the same day, the central bank of  Spain cut its repo rate  by a  less-than-expected 25 basis points,

Equity prices in  most industrial countries have continued to rise. Since the  March FOMC meeting, the largest price increases have been recorded in  Europe, led by  a more than 6  percent gain in French share prices. Stock indices for Belgium, Sweden, Germany, and the United Kingdom have all increased 3-1/2 percent or  more during the intermeeting period. Since the turn of  the  year, increases in  European share prices range from 46 percent in  Italy to 18 percent in the  United Kingdom. Canadian share prices have risen almost 2  percent over the past seven weeks and have posted a  15 percent increase year to  date.

Asian financial markets have come under pressure again after two months of  relative calm. In early April, Indonesian and IMF officials reached an  agreement that accelerated reform measures and allowed for a  resumption of IMF disbursements on  May 4. Since then, social unrest in  Indonesia has intensified, partly in  response to  an increase in fuel prices, and the rupiah has declined 21 percent

against the dollar. Late in the period, Bank Indonesia  raised interest  rates across the maturity spectrum between 4 and 12 percentage points in reaction to the weakness in the rupiah. In Korea, labor unrest has weighed on the won. In the last several days, Yankee bond yield spreads  over U.S.  Treasuries have risen noticeably for Indonesia and Korea, although those for Thailand and Malaysia show very little change. Brady bond  stripped yield  spreads over U.S. Treasuries have moved up somewhat for Russia, Brazil  and to a lesser  extent for Mexico. Over the intermeeting period, equity prices in  Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand have fallen more than 20  percent. Share prices in Hong Kong are down almost 17  percent. In the past week, interest  rates in Hong Kong have risen roughly 2 percentage points, reflecting concern over developments in  Indonesia and anxiety that slowing economic activity in Hong Kong may lead  to speculative pressure on the Hong Kong dollar.

The Desk did not intervene in the foreign exchange market for U.S. accounts during the period. Developments in Foreign Industrial  Countries

Real GDP growth in the foreign G-7  countries appears to have remained sluggish in the first  quarter, due primarily to continued weakness in Japan. Growth in the United Kingdom also appears to be slowing from the rapid pace of the last two years. In  contrast, available indicators suggest that the major continental European economies are gathering steam, with improving domestic demand helping to  offset the impact of Asia on foreign trade. In Canada as well, robust growth in domestic demand has  continued to buoy the economy.

Inflation remains quite  subdued in most of the major foreign industrial  countries,  reflecting recent declines in oil prices as well as continued moderate wage growth. Inflation is  less  than 1 1/2 percent in France, Germany, and Canada and is under 2 percent in Italy. After netting out the effects of tax increases, inflation remains near zero in Japan. In the United Kingdom, however,consumer

price inflation remains slightly above the government's target of  21/2 percent.

The  heads of  state or government and the finance ministers from  the European Union met  in  Brussels during the first weekend in May  and formally selected eleven countries to launch the  third stage of  monetary union on  January 1, 1999. The  President and other members of  the board of  the new  European Central bank were also selected. Markets generally reacted favorably to  these developments despite a  last-minute compromise under which Wim  Dusienberg, the first President, is expected to  step down halfway through his term in  favor of  Jean-Claude Trichet, the current head of  the Bank of France.

Individual country notes. In Japan, economic indicators suggest that the economy contracted during the first quarter. Industrial production was down sharply, and the unemployment rate surged to  a  new all-time high of 3.9 percent in  March, with the ratio of job offers to  applicants at its lowest level since 1983. Consumer demand was also sluggish during the first quarter, with household expenditures up only slightly from their very weak fourthquarter level. New car registrations in  April were down 7  percent from a  year earlier--the month the consumption tax  was increased-and down 20 percent from two  years earlier. Despite the cutbacks in production, the inventory-to-shipments ratio soared to  its highest level since 1975, and business sentiment continued to  fall sharply. Consumer price inflation, net of  the effects of  fiscal measures, remains near zero.

Japan's trade surplus during the first quarter was $98 billion at an  annual rate, essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter. The  yen value of  both imports and exports declined from  their fourth-quarter levels. The decline in  imports reflects the  weakness of Japanese domestic demand, coupled with falling import prices. (During the first quarter, import prices were down 6  percent from a year earlier, led by  sharp declines in  the prices of  oil and lumber.) The decline in  exports can be  linked to the  Asian crises. In recent months, Japanese exports to  Korea, Thailand and Indonesia have fallen by  over one-third from a  year earlier.

On  April 24, the Japanese government released the details of  a massive ¥16 trillion stimulus package, which appears to contain ¥12 trillion (2.4 percent of  GDP) of "real water" stimulus. The real water portion of  the  package includes ¥4  trillion of temporary tax cuts, divided evenly between CY1998 and CY1999, and about ¥8 trillion of  government expenditures, mostly public works projects. The portion of  the  package that is  not real water consists of steps to  boost the land market (including plans to  streamline foreclosure on  bad loans and to  facilitate the sale of  underlying collateral) and  programs to  help small businesses. The stimulus package will be transformed into a  supplementary budget that will be  submitted to the  Diet later this  month.

Two financial reform measures were implemented on  April 1 as part of  Japan's "Big  Bang" program. First, the  Bank of  Japan Reform Law,  which strengthens BOJ independence and increases the transparency of  monetary policy formulation, came into effect. Second, a  new foreign exchange law abolishes restrictions on  crossborder capital transactions and allows Japanese citizens to  open deposit and investment accounts abroad.

Economic activity in  the eleven European countries scheduled to enter monetary union appears to  have continued to  expand at  a  moderate rate in  the first quarter. Partial data suggests that area-wide industrial production rose at  an  average rate of  about 1  percent, while both business and consumer confidence continued the upward trend begun last year. The average unemployment rate fell as a  result of widespread declines across countries. Inflation remains quite subdued across the area.

In  Germany, indicators for the first quarter suggest a  pick-up in  growth from its sluggish fourth-quarter pace, as  both production and orders rose substantially. The  rise in  orders owed primarily to increases in domestic orders, suggesting that the long-awaited pickup  in  domestic demand may  have begun to occur. Business confidence strengthened further during the  first quarter. Conditions in the labor market have improved somewhat this year, with the  all-German unemployment rate edging down from 11.8 percent in  December to 11.4 percent in  April. Consumer price inflation rose slightly in  April reflecting an increase of 1 percentage point in the value-added tax.

Incoming data for France suggest that growth continued at a healthy pace in  the first quarter. Consumption of  manufactured products increased 1.5 percent, as a  surge in  post-holiday purchases in  January was only partially reversed later in  the quarter. Durable goods purchases were especially strong in  March. For January and February on  average, industrial production increased 0.4 percent from the  fourth quarter, as continued strength in  manufacturing offset lower utilities production. Recent business surveys show that business confidence remains high. Conditions in  the labor market have continued to  improve; the unemployment rate declined to 12.0 percent in  March. Inflationary pressures remain subdued. In April, consumer prices were 1.0 percent above their year-earlier level.

In  Italy, monthly indicators generally point to  modest economic growth in  the first quarter. Although industrial production in  January and February changed little on average from its fourth-quarter level, consumer confidence more than retraced its fourth-quarter decline while business sentiment soared due to the removal of  any remaining doubt regarding Italy's first-wave entry into the  EMU. Inflation remains below 2  percent.

On  April 17, the government approved its long-range plan to eliminate the budget deficit by  2001 and reduce government debt to 60 percent of  GDP--the Maastricht reference value--by 2016. Reductions in  debt servicing costs account for most of  the projected decline in government indebtedness. Nonetheless, achieving the medium-term fiscal objectives remains a  challenge for the government as  the rift between the center-left coalition and the Communists on welfare reform and health care spending remains wide.

On  April 22, the Bank of Italy cut its official discount and Lombard rates by  50  basis points each. Currently, the discount rate stands at 5  percent and the Lombard rate at 6  1/2  ercent. p Since July 1997, Italian official rates have been lowered six times for a cumulative total of 4  percentage points.

The pace of  economic activity in the United Kingdom slowed further in  the first quarter. The preliminary estimate showed real GDP growth of 1.6 percent(SAAR); subsequent data suggest that the revised figure will be  a  little higher. Industrial production declined for the second consecutive quarter, as manufacturing output was little changed and continued mild weather led to  lower output of utilities industries. Output growth in  the service sector slowed somewhat, but consumer expenditure remained robust.

Recent survey data suggest that the outlook for manufacturing industries has deteriorated in the current quarter. Business sentiment weakened in  April, reflecting continued soft export orders due  primarily to  the strength of  sterling. Conditions in  the labor market remain tight, however, with the official claims-based unemployment rate dipping to  4.8 percent in  April, while underlying average annual earnings growth picked up  to 4.9 percent in  February. Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.6 percent over the year to  March, slightly above the government's target of  2  1/2 percent for underlying inflation.

In its May Inflation Report, the Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of  England lowered slightly its central projection for inflation over the  medium term, as economic activity appeared somewhat weaker than had  been assumed at  the time of the  February Report while sterling had appreciated somewhat further. The  MPC noted that in  the near term  the  balance of risks to  activity are on

the  downside. However, the risks to the exchange rate are asymmetric, so that in  the  medium term  the  balance of  risks to inflation are on  the  upside, reflecting the possibility of  the exchange rate falling more sharply than assumed in  the central projection.

On  April 23, the  Bank of  England Act 1998 was passed by Parliament. The  bill formally implements, as of  June 1, the changes to the Bank of  England announced by  Chancellor of  the  Exchequer Gordon Brown last May, including the granting of  operational responsibility for setting interest rates to  the  Bank of  England, the creation of  the  Monetary Policy Committee, and the transfer of banking supervision to the  Financial Services Administration. The provisions for setting monetary policy have been operating de  facto from the Chancellor's announcement last May.

In Canada, monthly indicators show that the economy has regained its momentum, shaking off  the effects of  the January ice storm in  eastern Canada. Real GDP at  factor cost rose 0.9 percent in  February, fully recovering from the 0.8 percent decline in January, and employment was up strongly for the quarter as a whole. Employment rose by  a  further 72,000 in  April, the second largest

monthly increase in  the past three years. The  unemployment rate fell to 8.4 percent in  April, down from 9.5 percent the  previous April, and the lowest since August 1990.

Housing starts rose at a  rapid clip in  February and March, reflecting strong income growth and moderate mortgage interest rates. Housing starts retreated in  April, but the decline was entirely due to a  drop in  volatile multiple-unit construction. Housing related purchases --  mostly furniture and appliances --offset weakness in  motor vehicle sales to  buoy overall retail sales in  February.

Consumer price inflation has edged back below the Bank of Canada's 1 to  3  percent target range in  recent months, to 0.8 percent (12-month change) in  April. Excluding food and energy, consumer prices rose 1.2 percent in  the 12 months to  April, down from 1.6 percent in February. The good inflation news comes despite the  depreciation of the  Canadian currency since October. Declines in  computer prices and  mortgage interest payments over the past year have helped hold down core inflation. A  3.7 percent decline in energy prices over the preceding twelve months has contributed to the low rate of  overall inflation.

In its semi-annual Monetary Policy Report issued on  May 13, the Bank of Canada indicated its belief that "monetary conditions in the recent range would be  broadly appropriate" over the  next six months. Beyond the six-month horizon, however, the Bank sees some tightening in  monetary conditions if aggregate demand remains robust and the economy continues to  take up slack.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

In  Korea and the ASEAN region, economic activity continued to be  generally weak due to a  decline in  domestic demand, although Singapore showed signs of  a  rebound. Growth has slowed in  China and contracted sharply in  Hong  Kong, but remains relatively steady in Taiwan. In  Latin America, growth was strong in  Argentina and Mexico, but weak in  Brazil and Venezuela. Inflation has generally been stable to  moderate, although it  accelerated in Indonesia as well as in  Venezuela.

The general adjustment toward surplus in external balances in Asia continued, with the exception of  Taiwan. In  Latin America, external balances continued to  deteriorate except in  Brazil, where the  trade deficit narrowed further.

Implementation of  reforms continued in  Korea. Thailand, and the Philippines under their respective IMF programs. In  April, Indonesia reached agreement with the IMF on  a  revised program and qualified for  a  $1  billion drawing on its stand-by in  May. However, Malaysia rejected an  IMF recommendation against bailing out insolvent firms.

Individual country notes. Korea is experiencing a  sharp recession. Based on  partial data for several components of aggregate expenditures, we  estimate that real GDP fell 8 percent (SAAR) during the first quarter. Real activity has contracted as a result of  a  downturn in  domestic demand that is attributable in  part to  a  high degree of  economic uncertainty, balance sheet adjustments by  corporations and households, and tight credit conditions. CPI inflation rose to  8.8 percent in  April on  a  12-month basis from an average rate of  below 5  percent in 1997 because of  the depreciation of  the  won.

Korea's current account surplus rose to $43 billion (AR) during the first quarter, a  swing of $72 billion from the $29 billion deficit recorded a year earlier. Most of  the swing in  the balance in  dollar terms has reflected a  contraction in  imports, which fell 35 percent from  their year-earlier level. A  sharp decline in  the volume of imports, due to  weak domestic demand, a real depreciation of  the won, and financing constraints, has  been

reinforced by  a  considerable fall in  the dollar price of  imported goods.

Korea has experienced substantial labor unrest during the past two  months, due in  part to a  marked rise in  unemployment and a limited social safety net. The  unemployment rate rose to 6.5 percent in  March compared with 2.1 percent in October. One  major federation of  Korean trade unions has demanded that a key labor reform approved by  the  Korean legislature in  February--which eased the ability of  employers to lay off workers in  the context of restructurings--be modified significantly. Employees at  the financially distressed Kia conglomerate went on  a  temporary strike in  April to  forestall the government from selling its majority stake in  Kia to  a  third party.

Financial market developments have been mixed during the past six  weeks. The  Korean won has remained basically stable at around 1400 won/dollar, supported by  the Korean government's success in raising $3.9 billion through issuing 5-  and 10-year international market bonds at  spreads about 350 basis points over comparablematurity U.S. Treasuries. However, the  Korean stock market has declined about 35 percent since the March FOMC meeting, returning to near its mid-December trough.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  the  ASEAN region, weakening domestic demand and tightening liquidity continued to  constrain economic activity. In  Indonesia, real year-over-year GDP growth slowed in  the fourth quarter of  1997 to  under 1.5 percent. Industrial production declined in  Malaysia and Thailand in  the early months of  1998, but Singapore showed signs of  a  rebound led by a  surge in  the output of  high-valued pharmaceuticals.

ECONOMIC

INDICATORS:

GROWTH

<!-- missing-text -->

Consumer prices accelerated in  Indonesia as spot food shortages and announcements of  impending withdrawals of subsidies triggered panic buying of  basic consumer goods, and the  weak currency kept import prices high. Recent increases in  fuel prices set off a  new round of  protests that have turned violent, with security forces firing on  student demonstrators and mobs attacking shops owned by  ethnic Chinese. These protests are roiling financial markets and heightening uncertainty about the economic situation.

<!-- missing-text -->

Trade balances have continued to  swing into surplus for most of  the  ASEAN countries. This primarily reflects the effects of weakened currencies and slowing growth discouraging imports, although export performance has begun to strengthen as  well.

<!-- missing-text -->

Implementation of  economic reforms varied across the ASEAN region. In  mid-April. Indonesia signed its third letter of  intent with the IMF, agreeing to  a  117-point program that focuses on monetary policy, resolution of  private external debt, banking reforms, and other structural reforms. Jakarta also agreed to weekly monitoring of  monetary indicators. On  April 22, the government announced it  had met the target date for the first round of  reforms, and on  May 4 the IMF  Executive Board voted to  release $1 billion of  the $10 billion credit. Contingent on  continued satisfactory implementation of  the program, the IMF will release another $1  billion in  June.

Elsewhere, Thailand announced a  15-point plan in  late April to address the continuing crisis in  the financial system. The plan includes raising the debt ceiling on  foreign borrowing by  the government, an  IMF recommendation, and loosening restrictions on joint ventures between local banks and foreign investors. In early April, the  Philippines submitted a  plan to  the IMF, under its $1.4 billion stand-by facility, to improve financial sector supervision. In response to  a  caution from  the IMF against bailing out insolvent firms. Prime Minister Mahathir reaffirmed his government's intention to assist firms harmed by  what he characterized as  foreign speculators' attack on  the ringgit.

In  Hong  Kong, economic activity has weakened significantly. We  estimate that output fell 6  percent in  the fourth quarter of  1997 (SAAR) from the  previous quarter. In  the  first quarter, the unemployment rate rose to  3.5 percent from 2.4 percent in  the previous quarter. Interest rates rose sharply in  mid-May amid concerns that a  weaker economy and renewed turmoil in Indonesia might make the  Hong Kong dollar vulnerable to  a  speculative attack.

__

On  May 14, the yield spread between Hong Kong government securities and comparable U.S. Treasuries was around 300 basis points at maturities of 1-10 years, up  about 100  basis points from the beginning of  the  month. Foreign exchange reserves were $97 billion at the end of  March, up  about $4  billion from  December.

In  China, real GDP growth slowed to  7.2 percent in the  first quarter over a  year ago, while consumer prices remained virtually unchanged in  April from a  year earlier. China's trade surplus increased in  the first four months of 1998. The  dollar value of exports was up  12 percent in  the first four months of  this year from year-earlier levels, and 8  percent in  April, significantly less than the  20 percent growth rate in  1997. The dollar value of  imports rose 3  percent in  the  first four months from a year earlier, equal to  the growth rate in  1997. Total reserves less gold were $144 billion in  March, up  about $1  billion from the  beginning of  the year.

Taiwan's industrial production decelerated in  the first quarter, as export growth slowed substantially. A  very small trade surplus in  the first four months of 1998 compares with a  surplus of $4.8 billion (AR)  in  the year-earlier period. Exports to  Asia fell sharply from year-ago levels, while exports to  the  United States and Europe rose slightly; imports fell 3  percent. Consumer price inflation rose above 2  percent (year-over-year) in  March and April. Inflation has been more evident in  wholesale prices, which rose at an  average rate of  about 5 percent (year-over-year) in  the first four months of  1998. International reserves were about $84 billion at the  end of  March, largely unchanged from the beginning of the year.

<!-- missing-text -->

In Mexico, economic activity remains strong but the pace of growth has slowed somewhat as a  result of  budget cuts in  January and March prompted by the decline in  oil prices. Growth of  industrial production slowed to 7.2 percent in  February from its year-earlier level, compared with a 7.6 percent rate in  January. On  the other hand, the  unemployment rate declined to  3.4 percent in  March from 3.6 percent in  January. The trade deficit widened to $7.2 billion (AR)  in  the first quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

The  CPI inflation rate fell to under 12  percent (AR)  in  April. The peso value of  the dollar has stabilized since the Bank of  Mexico tightened monetary policy in  mid-March. The 28-day cetes interest rate has declined to  17.4 percent in  May, below its mid-March high of 21.52 percent. Spreads on  Mexican Brady bonds, adjusted for

collateral, fell slightly from 479  basis points on  January 2  to about 430 basis points in  recent trading.

In  Brazil, economic activity has been sluggish. Industrial output of  consumer durables and capital goods rose somewhat in February, but to  a  level still about 10 percent below its peak in October 1997. The  unemployment rate reached 8.2 percent in  March, the  highest since 1984. Inflation was around 6 percent (AR)  in March.

Indications are that net capital inflows have been strong in recent months, prompting the central bank to  intervene to  mitigate upward pressures on  the currency. International reserves (liquidity concept) rose to  $75 billion in  mid-May from $52 billion at end1997. Events in  recent weeks, however, have cast a  pall on Brazilian stocks and Brady bonds. In  April, two close allies of President Cardoso, Brazil's communications minister and a  leader in Brazil's unruly lower house, died, fueling the perception that economic reforms would be  more difficult to pass through Congress. These perceptions were further heightened by  the  defeat (by  one vote) in  early May of  the government's social security reform proposal. (The  proposal is critical to  fiscal stability.)

In  early April, the  central bank  had reduced its overnight lending rate by about 5 percentage points over the  previous 6 weeks to 23 percent. Large net capital inflows plus concern over rising unemployment most likely motivated the interest rate reduction.

In  Argentina, economic activity continues to grow  at  a  healthy pace with low  inflation. Industrial production (SA)  in  March was up 6.4 percent over a  year ago. Consumer prices have been roughly flat over the past two  months, and the 12-month inflation rate in  April was slightly over 1  percent. A combination of  strong imports due to robust growth, a  fall in  commodity prices, and a  slowdown in  exports to  Brazil has led to  further deterioration of  the current account deficit, which widened to  about $15 billion (AR)  in  the fourth quarter of  1997. The recent widening of  the trade deficit has exceeded the IMF's target under the terms of  Argentina's Extended Fund Facility.

In  Venezuela, the recent slump in  oil prices, together with the accompanying tightening of  fiscal and  monetary policies, is putting considerable strain on  the economy. The unemployment rate rose by  a  percentage point in  the first quarter of  this year. Although quarterly data on  real GDP are  not available, the government has acknowledged that economic activity may  have contracted in  the first quarter. Inflation has  been rising recently, reaching almost 50 percent (AR)  in  April.

Falling oil prices have led to declines in  both exports and government revenues, causing international reserves (excluding gold) to fall 13 percent during January-March, and forcing the government to cut public spending. Despite this tightening, the fiscal situation has deteriorated and fears of  devaluation have grown. In order to  prevent a  large depreciation of  the bolivar and a  bigger

rundown of  international reserves, the government has raised interest rates substantially. The bolivar has depreciated some 6 percent through April this year but is still considered substantially overvalued.

In  Russia, recent data confirm a  slowing of  activity in  the first quarter, possibly reflecting the influence of  higher interest rates and shaken business confidence over this period arising from spillover to  Russian financial markets from  the  Asian financial crises. Real GDP in  the first quarter showed no  increase on  a  yearover-year basis after rising about 3/4 percent in  the previous quarter. Industrial output growth also slowed noticeably in  the first quarter. The inflation rate has continued to  moderate in recent months, moving down to  a  12-month rate of  8-1/2 percent in March.

So far in  the second quarter, interest rates have eased slightly on  balance, despite episodes of  downward pressure on  the ruble seemingly related to  concern over the uncertain political situation.

On  April 24, the Duma (parliament) voted to  accept Sergei Kiriyenko as Prime Minister. The Communist-dominated Duma had twice previously voted to  reject Kiriyenko, President Yeltsin's choice to replace the fired Viktor Chernomyrdin. However, the Duma backed down when faced with the certainty of  its dissolution and  new parliamentary elections if  it had voted against Kiriyenko a  third time. Kiriyenko's cabinet appointments suggest that the new government will be  at  least as supportive of  economic reform as its

predecessor. Probably the  most pressing problem facing the  new government is  to  hold down the  budget deficit (optimistically estimated to  be  about 5  percent of  GDP in  the recently passed 1998 budget) in  the face of  increased interest costs and falling revenue from the oil sector (which accounts for over one-third of  total government taxes).

Appendix: New  Exchange Rate Indices

The staff's multilateral trade weighted index of  the dollar's exchange value against the other G-10 currencies is about to  be retired. Prompted in part by  the expected creation of  the  euro on 1 January 1999, which will lead to  the extinction of  half of  the currencies included in  the G-10 index, and in  part by  increasing interest in  the currencies of  our developing and newly industrializing trading partners, the staff has developed some new exchange rate indices to  summarize and characterize the dollar's movements in  foreign exchange markets.

Three new indices of  the dollar's overall foreign exchange value have been developed: a  narrow nominal index, a  broad nominal index, and a broad real or  price-adjusted index.1 These indices include a  larger number of currencies than the G-10 index and have weights that vary over time. Furthermore, the weights are derived from  more detailed measures of trading patterns than those in  the G-10 index.

The  movements of  the narrow nominal and broad real indices are similar to  those of  the comparable G-10 indices, although the swings in the new  series are generally less extreme. In contrast, the broad nominal index has  moved quite differently due to  the presence in  the  index of  currencies of some high inflation countries. These currencies have experienced persistent depreciations against the dollar, a  feature which tends to  restrict the  usefulness of  the broad nominal index to  discussions of  shorter-term developments in foreign exchange markets because, over the longer-term, large nominal depreciations of a  few currencies swamp information on  the value of the dollar against other currencies.

The new indices employ a  common weighting scheme based on measures of the  competitiveness of  U.S. goods. Considerably more weight is given to  the Canadian dollar and the Japanese yen  than is

given by the G-10 index, 2 with an  offsetting decline in  the  weight assigned to  the euro-area currencies.

The narrow nominal index includes dollar exchange rates against the currencies of  Canada, the  EU-11 countries, Japan, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Australia, and Sweden--making it a 16-currency index until Europe's monetary union begins, at  which time it  will become a  7-currency index. The  broad index includes, along with the currencies in  the narrow index, four currencies from Latin America and nine from  Asia--making it a  29-currency index until European Monetary Union begins and a  20-currency index thereafter.

While we  expect that these new  indices will become the standard summary measures used in  presentations to  the Board and the FOMC on  the foreign exchange value of  the  dollar, other, speciallytailored exchange rate indices may also be  used from time to  time. Two  key exchange rate indices are likely candidates in  this regard-one currently used in  the nonagricultural export sector of  the staff's trade model and the other currently used in the non-oil import sector. Weights for these indices are shown in the two rightmost columns of  the preceding table. The average of  the weights for  these two indices form the basis for the weights in  the broad and narrow summary indices.

A  number of  factors went into the decisions on  which currencies to  include in  the indices. Aside from creating indices that will accommodate the introduction of the euro, our basic strategy was to  enlarge the currency coverage to  include the currencies of  other major U.S. trading partners. Currency selection for the broad indices was based largely on country trade shares, although, at  the  margin, other considerations also influenced our choices. The  foreign countries whose currencies are included in  the broad indices supplied more than 90 percent of  U.S. non-oil imports in 1997 and absorbed more than 85 percent of  U.S. nonagricultural exports in  that year. Those same countries were responsible for 70 percent of  aggregate world trade in 1996, measured as  the sum of multilateral exports and imports, and they generated a  bit  more than

half of  world GNP in  1995, measured on  the basis of  purchasing power parity exchange rates.

While the subset of  countries with currencies in  the narrow index provides significantly less coverage in  terms of  trade share and  productive capacity, the coverage is still substantial. Moreover, the  narrow nominal index was designed not only to  measure competitive pressures on  the dollar, particularly against the major industrial countries, but also to  serve as one gauge of  financial pressures on  the dollar. As  a  consequence, the index includes currencies traded in  deep and relatively liquid financial markets and excludes currencies with a  history of  high inflation relative to the  United States or  with limited liquidity and depth in  financial intermediation.

The weighting scheme is  based on  measures of  trade competitiveness, where the  weights capture the extent to  which U.S. goods compete with the goods produced in  foreign countries.

For the portion of  that competition which occurs in  the U.S. market, a  weight equal to a  country's share of  U.S. imports is used to  proxy for the degree of competition from that country. These weights are  the import sector weights mentioned earlier.

For the portion of  that competition which occurs in  foreign markets, we  use the export sector weights mentioned earlier. These

weights are made up of  two pieces, corresponding to  the fact that U.S. goods compete with the goods of  a  particular foreign country in that country's home market and in  third-country markets. One piece--which measures foreign home-market competition like that between U.S. and German goods in  Germany--is proxied by  the  U.S. export share to the  foreign country. A  second piece--which measures foreign third-market competition like that between U.S. and German goods in  Japan--is proxied by  the  U.S. export share to  the third country scaled by  the share of  the foreign country's goods in  the third country's imports. In this way, a  country will have a  high combined export weight if  it figures importantly as  a  direct destination for U.S. exports or is a  major exporter to other countries that take a  large share of  U.S. exports.

The  weight in  the summary index is then computed as  the simple average of  the bilateral import share weights and the combined export weights. Overall, we  believe that this weighting scheme is useful in  that it lends itself to a  number of  other purposes not detailed here, including the calculation of  summary exchange rate measures for other currencies and the calculation of  indices for other subsets of currency groupings.

Consistent with the shift away from fixed-weight indices in the United States, the  new exchange rate indices use  weights that vary over time. A  benefit of  this approach is that the exchange rate index can readily incorporate changes in the pattern of trade, such as the  expansion of  trade with China or  other Asian economies. In  addition, adjustable weights permit the recognition of  events such as the  accession of  a  second wave of  EU countries to  the European Monetary Union, which would affect the trade shares assigned to  currencies in  the indices.

Because the new  indices are intended to  be  proxies for competitiveness, the data used to  compute the  bilateral import and export shares for the  United States exclude U.S. military exports and trade in oil and agricultural commodities, which are less likely to  be  differentiated by  country of  destination or  origin and thus less likely to reflect differences in  competitiveness among countries. Comparably disaggregated trade data for other countries are  not as readily available. Therefore, the import and export shares used in  the calculation of  third-country competitiveness are

based on  aggregate bilateral merchandise imports and exports for each country pair. In addition, because of  the impending move into monetary union by  11 EU  countries, and the highly integrated trading relationships among the remaining member countries, intra-EU trade is excluded in  the calculations.

Because the  weights in  the  new  indices vary over time and because the data used to construct the  weights are released with a lag and are periodically revised, the new  indices will be  subject to revision. This is particularly true for index values in the current year and the  year immediately preceding the current year, although earlier historical values may  also be  revised from time to time.
