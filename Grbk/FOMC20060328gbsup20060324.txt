The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Sales and Prices of New and Existing Homes

Sales of new homes fell 11 percent in February to an annual rate of 1.08 million units; the sharp drop suggests that residential construction will decline in the coming months.  The stock of new homes for sale increased in February, and it represented 6.3 months of sales at February's unusually depressed pace of sales.  The months' supply of new homes has been trending upward since October 2004 and is now at a level not seen since the end of 1995.

At the same time, sales of existing homes turned up in February for the first time since last August.  Total sales rose 5.2 percent to an annual rate of 6.9 million units; sales of single-family homes increased 4.7 percent while sales of condos and co-ops were up 8.8 percent.  The inventory of homes for sale ticked down in February, but the months' supply of homes at February's sales pace remained elevated compared with its range of recent years.

The average sales price of new homes was about 3 percent higher in February than it was a year earlier, and the median price of new homes in February was 3 percent lower than a year earlier.  The Census Bureau began phasing in a new sampling frame in January 2005, and the sales prices of homes in the current sample may not be comparable to the previous sample.  Because the sample of homes sold in 2005 contained a mixture of homes drawn from both the old and new sampling frames, the year-to-year changes in the prices of new homes sold should be interpreted with caution.  That said, staff estimates of the magnitude of the bias suggest that new home prices have been decelerating in recent months.

The median sales price of existing homes sold was up 10.6 percent in February from a year earlier.  The median price of single-family homes climbed 11.7 percent.  Although the rate of increase of single-family home prices remained robust, the percent change over the twelve months ending in February was smaller than the twelve-month changes of the summer and fall.   The median price of condos and co-ops rose 3.5 percent from a year earlier, continuing a marked deceleration that began in the spring of 2005.

4½ percent last month, after having risen strongly on balance in December and January, leaving the January-February average level 2½ percent above the fourth-quarter average. Orders for communications equipment surged for a second month in February while orders for computers and peripherals retraced almost half of their January decline.

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft dropped 1 percent in February after having been unchanged in January.  Shipments of non-high-tech equipment fell 1½ percent last month-their first monthly decline since last July.  However, backlogs of unfilled orders widened slightly last month, and we continue to expect solid gains in shipments over the coming months.  Shipments of communications equipment moved up ¾ percent in February following very strong gains in the previous two months.  In contrast, shipments of computers and peripherals only inched up last month following a sharp decline in January.  The recent shipments and orders data for computers are consistent with anecdotal reports from the industry that the first quarter was weak.
