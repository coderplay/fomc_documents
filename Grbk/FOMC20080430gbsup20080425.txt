Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Sentiment

After having declined just a touch to 69.5 in March, the Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment plunged to 62.6 in April.  The decrease was slightly larger than had been reported in the preliminary estimate released in the middle of the month, implying that sentiment fell a bit further in the second half of the month.  Both the 'current conditions' and the 'expected conditions' components of the overall index decreased significantly between March and April.  Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months worsened considerably in April, and consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars also softened.  However, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for houses strengthened in April, largely because of increases in the number of households noting that prices and interest rates were low.

Since July, the level of sentiment has fallen precipitously; these declines reflect heightened concerns about the economy that can only partially be explained by the usual influences on sentiment, including inflation, the stock market, and employment conditions.  The index from the Reuters/Michigan survey now stands a touch below the nadir reached during the 1990-1991 recession.

Among households, the median of expected inflation over the next twelve months rose 1/2 percentage point to 4.8 percent in April, and the median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years rose to 3.2 percent, the highest level since the summer of 2006.

Sales of New Homes

New home sales continued to decline in March.  The number of new-home sales agreements sank 8½ percent in March to an annual rate of 526,000 units; sales in February were revised down a touch.  For the first quarter as a whole, sales came in at an average annual rate of 570,000 units, down 13 percent from the preceding quarter and 33 percent below their year-earlier level.  Inventories of new homes for sale moved down another 1 percent in March and are now 20 percent below their peak in the summer of 2006.  Even so, these inventories represented about 10¾ months' supply at March's slower sales pace-the highest reading since 1981.

The constant-quality price index for new homes-which controls for changes in readily measurable attributes such as home size and the geographic composition of sales-fell at

an annual rate of 9¾ percent in the first quarter, a somewhat larger drop than the 5 percent rate of decline recorded in the fourth quarter.

Shipments and Orders for Nondefense Capital Goods

Shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft increased 1.2 percent in March after having declined in the preceding two months; new orders, which also fell in January and February, were flat and point to weaker shipments in the near term.  Within the hightech category, both orders and shipments of computers and peripherals posted solid gains in March and were revised up in February.  However, although shipments of communications equipment stepped up in March, the rise reversed only a part of the declines posted in January and February, while orders dropped more than 3 percent. Outside of the high-tech sector, shipments increased somewhat last month but orders only edged up after having plunged in February.

The three-month moving average of the staff's constructed series on real adjusted durable goods orders was down 1 percent in March.  This series-which strips out nondefense aircraft, defense capital goods, and industries for which reported orders actually equal shipments-is one of the staff's indicators of near-term industrial production.
