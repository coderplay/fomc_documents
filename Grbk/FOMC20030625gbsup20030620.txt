Monthly Treasury Statement

The federal government recorded a $90 billion deficit last month, bringing the cumulative deficit for the year ending in May to $304 billion-up from a deficit of $155 billion over the preceding twelve months.

Outlays, adjusted for financial transactions and payment timing shifts, rose 6 percent in May over year-earlier levels, boosted again by a high level of defense spending.  Outlays for defense were a bit stronger in May than we had anticipated when putting together the June Greenbook forecast because of higher-than-expected personnel costs.  With two months of data in hand for the second quarter, overall real defense purchases seem to be on track to increase roughly $4 billion more than we had written down.  Outside of defense, spending in most other categories was quite subdued.  An exception was the 'other' category, which shot up because of  increases in foreign aid and in assistance to the airline companies that was included in the fiscal 2003 defense supplemental.

Receipts in May were just 1 percent above a year earlier.  Individual income and payroll taxes edged below the year-earlier level because this year had one fewer work day; even after adjusting for the number of work days, these collections posted a very meager gain.

International Developments

U.S. International Transactions

U.S. Current Account. The U.S. current account deficit reached $544 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate in 2003:Q1, $30 billion larger than in the fourth quarter of last year (revised).  The deficit on goods and services accounted for two-thirds of the increase.  Net outflows of unilateral transfers increased, and the surplus on net investment income fell slightly.

The deficit on goods and services widened $22 billion, s.a.a.r., in the first quarter as imports rose more than exports.  The value of imported goods rose 8.6 percent at an annual rate (mostly oil), and imported services rose 7 percent. Declines in payments for travel-related services were more than offset by increases in other categories of services.  Exports of goods rose 6 percent at an annual rate (mostly the value of industrial supplies), but services fell nearly 4 percent (a large decline in receipts from travel-related services was only partly offset by increases in other categories).

Net unilateral transfers were up nearly $7 billion annual rate in the first quarter, largely as a result of an increase in U.S. Government grants.

The surplus on net investment income declined slightly in the first quarter after having risen moderately (revised data) in the previous two quarters.  Income on U.S. direct investment assets abroad was little changed, whereas payments for direct investment assets in the United States rose.  However, the increase in direct investment income payments in the first quarter was largely offset by smaller net interest and dividend payments on other assets.

The data for the U.S. international transactions accounts beginning in 1992 have been revised to reflect improved estimating methodologies and newly available source data.  The revisions this year include a new methodology for estimating insurance services, the incorporation of results from the U.S. Treasury Department's Benchmark Survey of U.S. Portfolio Investment Abroad as of December 31, 2001, and the incorporation of results of the BEA's Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad for 1999.

As a result of these revisions, the current account balance for 2002 was strengthened (smaller deficit) by $23 billion.  The largest revisions were $16 billion in net services (primarily revised estimates for insurance services) and $8 billion in net investment income.

U.S. International Financial Transactions .  The balance of payments release on June 19th included new data for the first quarter of 2003 and revisions to quarterly data from 1998:Q1 through 2002:Q4.  The revisions contained no surprises.  Private inflows into U.S. securities were increased by $50 billion in 2002, the bulk of which was a $43 billion increase in foreign purchases of Treasury securities.  This reflected revised reporter data that we had already received and incorporated in the April Greenbook.  A change in the BEA's methodology reduced U.S. purchases of foreign bonds by about $12 billion per year from 1998 through 2002; in 2002, this increased net sales of foreign securities from $1 billion to $15 billion.  A new direct investment benchmark survey prompted minor changes; over the period from 1999 through 2002, revisions added about $20 billion to cumulative net direct investment inflows. Because each of these revisions increased net inflows into the United States and the current account was little changed, the statistical discrepancy was lowered: From 1998 to 2002, the cumulative discrepancy was revised from positive $210 billion to positive $78 billion, with most of the revisions occurring in the last three years.

Data for first-quarter portfolio flows were as expected with one exception.  The BEA estimates that private foreigners sold $2 billion in agency bonds in the

quarter, whereas we had estimated $22 billion in net purchases.   This 1 adjustment brings private net inflows into U.S. securities to $71 billion for the quarter, compared with the $95 billion we had previously reported.

As a result of the first sizable foreign takeover of a U.S. firm since 2001, direct investment inflows (line 7) increased to $26 billion in the first quarter.  In line with the amounts of recent years, direct investment outflows (line 6) totaled $29 billion in the quarter, with the strength entirely in reinvested earnings.

Net shipments of U.S. currency to foreigners (line 8) fell somewhat in the first quarter, and the capital account balance changed little.
