The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Consumer Sentiment

After having spiked sharply in January, the Michigan Survey Research Center's (SRC) index of consumer sentiment has dropped back noticeably, but to levels that remain above its long-run average and above its readings throughout last year.  According to the preliminary report for March, the index was just a touch lower in early March than in February.

The slight dip in the SRC index in early March was the result of a decrease in the 'expected conditions' component of the index that was mostly offset by an increase in the 'current conditions' component.  For 'expected conditions,' consumers' appraisals of expected business conditions fell, but their assessments of their expected personal financial situation improved slightly.  Regarding 'current conditions,' consumers' assessments of their current personal financial situation and of buying conditions for large household appliances rebounded a bit following last month's large drops.

Among those items not included in the overall index, expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months continued to deteriorate in early March.  In contrast, consumers' appraisals of buying conditions for cars and houses both improved.

In early March, the mean and median of expected inflation climbed to 3.7 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, the highest readings for both measures since last March.  In contrast, both the mean and median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years were unchanged at 3.3 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.

Federal Government Outlays and Receipts

Adjusting for the timing of outlay payments, the federal government recorded a deficit of $110 billion in February, about $13 billion larger than last year. 1 Adjusted receipts were about 5 percent lower than last year, reflecting a surge in individual income tax refunds stemming in large part from last summer's tax cuts.

Adjusted outlays were up about 5 percent over the twelve months ending in February, or about $9 billion.  Spending on income security was about $5 billion lower than last year, as a result of the tailing off of extended unemployment insurance benefits and an anomalous reduction in refundable

EITC payments. 2 Spending on agriculture and net interest was also lower than last year, while spending on Medicare was up sharply.

Defense spending was little changed from its January level and was about 20 percent higher than a year earlier, marking a moderate step-up from the plateau in defense spending recorded from last spring through the end of the year.  February's level spending came in higher than we had assumed in the Greenbook, and we have raised our projection of real NIPA defense spending in the first quarter by about $4 billion (annual rate).  This change boosts our projection of the first-quarter change in real defense spending by 4 percentage points and lowers the second-quarter change by a similar amount.

Inventory Investment

The book value of retail inventories increased at an annual rate of $5.1 billion in January following a $31.4 billion accumulation in the fourth quarter. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, retail inventories edged down slightly in January.  Sales at non-auto retailers were unchanged that month, and the inventory-sales ratio for the sector decreased to 1.37 months, a new low.

For the entire manufacturing and trade sector excluding motor vehicles and parts, book-value inventories increased at an annual rate of $13.6 billion in January, the fifth consecutive month of stockbuilding.  Nonetheless, sales in this broad category rose 0.5 percent, and the inventory-sales ratio ticked down to a new low of 1.26 months.

On balance, the inventory data for January were on the low side of our expectations.  Together with the information on federal spending, discussed above, our projection for real GDP in the first and second quarters is unchanged.

Erratum

The first sentence of the third paragraph on page I-2 of Greenbook, Part 1, Domestic Developments should read: 'Since the January Greenbook, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has increased about 2 percent.'

The International Economy

U.S. Current Account

The U.S. current account deficit was $510 billion (s.a.a.r.) in the fourth quarter of 2003, down $31 billion from the third quarter (revised).  The decline was driven by a sizable increase in the surplus on net investment income.  The deficit on goods and services and net outflows of unilateral transfers each registered small increases.

The deficit on goods and services widened $5 billion in the fourth quarter as a $61 billion increase in imports was nearly matched by a $56 billion increase in exports.  The value of imported goods rose $54 billion, largely reflecting strong increases in capital goods, automotive products, and consumer goods.  Imports of services rose $7 billion.  The value of exported goods increased $42 billion, with capital goods accounting for about half of the rise.  Exports of services moved up $14 billion.

The surplus on net investment income rose $38 billion in the fourth quarter as a $48 billion rise in receipts outweighed a $9 billion rise in payments.  The sizable increase in receipts was driven by a surge in earnings on U.S. direct investment assets held abroad; direct investment receipts rose uniformly across all major sectors and regions.  The modest rise in payments was mostly due to higher earnings on foreign portfolio holdings of U.S. assets.

Net unilateral transfers to foreigners rose $2 billion as higher private transfers offset lower government transfers.

Implications for the outlook. Receipts of investment income on U.S. direct investment assets held abroad came in notably higher in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated.  As a consequence, we have revised upward our projection for net investment income over the forecast period.  Compared with the March Greenbook, we have narrowed our projection for the U.S. current account deficit about $25 billion this year and $20 billion next year.  We continue to project that the current account deficit will edge above $600 billion at the end of 2005, equivalent to a bit less than 5 percent of GDP.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The March 12 balance of payments press release included new data for the fourth quarter of 2003.

U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) increased to $50 billion in the fourth quarter, owing to pickups in both reinvested earnings and new equity capital.  For the year 2003, direct investment outflows rose to $155 billion from $138 billion in 2002, an increase entirely attributable to reinvested earnings.  Foreign direct investment into the United States (line 7) rebounded to $23 billion in the fourth quarter following an anemic third quarter, resulting from a reversal of intra-company debt outflows, as both reinvested earnings and new equity investment were little changed in the quarter.  For the year, gains in reinvested earnings led to increased direct investment inflows of $42 billion.  During 2003, U.S. direct investment outflows exceeded foreign direct investment inflows by $73 billion.

The statistical discrepancy (last line) was negative $53 billion for the fourth quarter and negative $34 billion for the year.  A negative statistical discrepancy indicates some combination of over-recorded net capital inflows and underrecorded net exports.
