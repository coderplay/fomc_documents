value of the dollar will depreciate  at an average rate of 2 percent in 2001  and 2002.

Stronger-than-expected  export growth in recent months has led us to project narrower deficits for net exports  and the current account for this year than in the previous Greenbook.  In addition, we have extended this strength in projected exports through the end of the forecast period.  However, the higher path for the dollar implies  higher imports going forward than we forecast in September.  On balance, net exports continue to make a negative  arithmetic contribution  to growth, and the current  account deficit reaches nearly  5 percent of GDP by the end of 2002.

Potential risks to our outlook for foreign  activity include the possibilities  of a global slowdown in high-tech investment  spending  (discussed in the Domestic Developments  section above) and a worsening  of the financial situation in Argentina.  At the end of this section, we consider the implications for U.S. growth and inflation  of a decline  in investor confidence  in Argentina that spreads to the rest of Latin America.

Recent Developments

International  financial markets. Despite  a 25-basis-point tightening in the European Central Bank's policy rates on October 5,  the dollar reached new highs against the euro later in October.  The dollar also rose against a wide range of other industrial country and emerging market  currencies. Since the release  of weaker-than-expected  U.S. GDP data on October 27, the dollar has retreated. On balance, the dollar has appreciated  1 /2  percent in terms of our 1 broad index of trading-partner  currencies.
