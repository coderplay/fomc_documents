Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

On balance, the incoming data suggest that economic activity has continued to move up in recent months.  To be sure, the labor market weakened further in September, as job losses remained sizable.  Nonetheless, manufacturers increased production in September for a third consecutive month.  The gradual recovery in construction of single-family homes from its extremely low level earlier in the year has continued, accompanied by an increase in home sales.  Although consumer spending on motor vehicles plummeted in September after the expiration of the 'cash for clunkers' program, other household spending is estimated to have stepped up in August and September.  And, while business spending on nonresidential structures continued to decline, outlays for equipment and software appear to have stabilized after slumping earlier in the year.  Meanwhile, core consumer price inflation has remained subdued in recent months.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market weakened further in September, although the pace of deterioration in recent months has been considerably slower than in the first half of the year.  In September, private nonfarm payroll employment fell 210,000-about equal to the average monthly decline in the third quarter as a whole-and employment losses remained widespread across industries.  The average workweek for production and nonsupervisory workers ticked down to 33.0 hours in September, and aggregate hours worked for this group fell 0.5 percent.  While aggregate hours fell at an annual rate of 3 percent in the third quarter, the pace of decline was much slower than earlier in the year. 1

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up in September to 9.8 percent, and the labor force participation rate dropped to 65.2 percent.  The participation rate had changed little, on net, from the beginning of the recession through the second quarter of this year, but it has fallen about ¾ percentage point in recent months; this pronounced drop presumably reflects, at least in part, potential workers' responses to the scarcity of employment opportunities.  That said, the participation rate probably has received some

support over the past two years from the emergency unemployment compensation program and the influence of losses in household wealth on some individuals' labor market decisions.  Meanwhile, the fraction of employees working part time for economic reasons-another manifestation of the underutilization of labor-edged up in September.

Other indicators of labor demand have been mixed.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance moved a little lower in October but still are at a level consistent with additional declines in employment.  While the number of persons receiving unemployment insurance benefits through regular state programs continued to drift down, the total number of individuals receiving unemployment insurance-including extended and emergency benefits-remained extraordinarily high.  The layoff rate as measured from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) showed some improvement in August, but the hiring rate measured from the JOLTS remained low.  Furthermore, the most recent readings for other measures of job openings and labor market slack indicate continued weakness and showed no evidence of improvement.  Looking forward, the NFIB survey in September found that small firms pared back their expectations for hiring in coming months.  Likewise, household expectations of future labor market conditions retreated a bit in both the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers and the Conference Board survey in early October, but both measures remain above their lows from the beginning of the year.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) rose in September for the third consecutive month and increased at an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the third quarter as a whole.  More than onehalf of the gain in IP last quarter was directly attributable to a bounceback in motor vehicle assemblies and related parts production from exceptionally low levels earlier this year.  Even so, gains in production were widespread across the industrial sector:  The diffusion index of three-month changes in IP jumped in September to its highest level since 1997 and indicates that significantly more industries increased production last month, relative to three months earlier, than reduced it.  The rise last quarter in manufacturing output other than motor vehicles and related parts likely reflected a somewhat slower pace of inventory liquidation and a pickup in foreign demand, although there also was some indirect boost in demand for materials by the motor vehicle sector. However, it appears that domestic demand for U.S.-manufactured goods other than motor vehicles has been relatively flat recently.  Moreover, the degree of slack in the manufacturing sector remains substantial, as the factory operating rate of 67.5 percent in September was still only 2.4 percentage points above the post-1948 low recorded in June.

Production of light motor vehicles continued to move up last month and rose to an annual rate of 6.4 million units in the third quarter as a whole.   Despite the increase in motor 2 vehicle output, inventories fell sharply last quarter-in large part because of the boost to sales from the cash-for-clunkers program-and days' supply slid to just 50 days. Industry schedules currently call for assemblies to step up in the fourth quarter to a pace of 6.8 million units.  Elsewhere in the transportation sector, the production of civilian aircraft moved sideways, on balance, in recent months.  Production will likely move down somewhat over the next several months, as Boeing recently postponed the introduction of their updated 747-8 aircraft; the first deliveries of the new 787 airplanes, as well as the 747-8 aircraft, are not expected to raise output noticeably until late next year. 3

High-tech output rose at an annual rate of almost 11 percent in the third quarter after changing little in the second quarter.  The output of semiconductors increased smartly last quarter, reportedly reflecting inventory restocking and possibly some firming in demand for chips used in consumer PCs, cell phones, and TVs.  In contrast, computer production declined last quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the second quarter, partly a result of weak business demand for servers.  This decline in real production occurred despite an increase in unit shipments of PCs last quarter because the mix of PCs produced continued to shift toward lower-value machines.  The output of communications equipment moved up modestly in the third quarter after two consecutive quarterly declines.

Forward-looking indicators of high-tech production generally point to some additional improvement this quarter.  Intel is expecting a sharp increase in revenue in the fourth quarter-a positive indicator for the output of semiconductors-and orders for circuit boards suggest that output of those items in the coming months will be boosted by upstream demand from the producers of high-tech equipment and other electronic products.  While orders and shipments of semiconductor manufacturing equipment are well above the low levels seen during the second quarter, they remain subdued, suggesting that semiconductor manufacturers are still cautious about expanding capacity. For computers, a number of companies, including Dell and HP, have provided tentative signals that the market for their products has bottomed out and may begin expanding

soon.  With regard to communications equipment, AT&amp;T reported that it will ramp up equipment spending sharply this quarter in order to reach its annual capital spending target, and Verizon also indicated plans to increase its equipment spending.  Finally, the diffusion index of planned capital spending on high-tech equipment in the NABE's quarterly survey rose in the third quarter to a level that suggests a solid rebound in hightech spending in the next few quarters.

The output of energy increased in both August and September.  Drilling activity rose for a second consecutive month in September after plunging by more than one-half since late last year, and oil extraction moved up for a third consecutive month.  The boost to both extraction and drilling activity was likely spurred by recent increases in oil prices.

Outside of the transportation, high-technology, and energy sectors, output increased for the third consecutive month in September, bringing the increase for the third quarter as a whole to about 3½ percent.  The output of consumer goods edged up in the third quarter, construction supplies rose at a moderate pace, and the index for materials turned up noticeably.  The rise in the production of construction supplies likely reflects the upturn in housing starts and in state and local construction, while the increase in the output of materials was likely boosted, in part, by demand from the motor vehicle sector.  The production of business equipment was little changed during the third quarter after plummeting in the first half of the year.

Forward-looking indicators of manufacturing activity continue to suggest moderate gains in production.  The latest diffusion index of new orders from the national manufacturing ISM survey points to solid near-term gains in factory output, and readings on orders for October from the regional manufacturing surveys improved further, on balance, and are consistent with moderate increases in manufacturing production.  However, the staff's estimate of real adjusted durable goods orders in September was about flat, and the latest weekly frequency product data that are used to construct IP suggest that output in these industries will contribute little, on net, to the change in IP for October.

Motor Vehicles

Light vehicle sales surged in July and August in response to the cash-for-clunkers program, but then tumbled in September to an annual rate of 9.2 million units after the expiration of the program.  Many of the clunker-related vehicle purchases in July and August were probably pulled forward from sales that would have otherwise occurred in subsequent months, as has often been the case for previous large sales-incentive programs, and the steep drop in light vehicle sales in September was consistent with this

expectation.   Also, sales incentives were reduced in September, in part because some 4 incentives that had been offered in conjunction with the cash-for-clunkers rebates were trimmed.  Incentives in the first half of October were about unchanged, on average, from their September level.  The expiration of the cash-for-clunkers program and the reduction in other sales incentives seem to have damped households' car-buying attitudes as measured in the Reuters/Michigan survey for September, and these sentiments continued to be little changed in the preliminary October survey.

Consumer Spending

Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) appear to have increased at a solid pace in the third quarter.  Based on our analysis of monthly retail sales data, we estimate that real spending on goods other than motor vehicles increased further in September after rising sharply in August.  For the third quarter as a whole, real purchases of non-motorvehicle goods likely moved up at an annual rate of more than 4 percent, the largest quarterly increase for this category of spending in more than two years.  Moreover, these recent gains in household spending have been widespread across categories of consumer goods.  The latest readings on consumer spending for services, which lag the indicators of goods purchases by a month, also have stepped up; excluding the volatile energy component, real spending on services increased 0.2 percent in both July and August.

Despite the apparent resuscitation in consumer spending, households still face substantial headwinds.  Reflecting the ongoing weakness in the labor market, wages and salaries appear to have dropped further in the third quarter after having plunged in the first half of the year.  Although gains in equity prices likely led to a further recoupment of households' net worth in the third quarter, data indicate that, on net, households have lost wealth equivalent to more than 1½ years of income over the past two years and are likely still making corresponding adjustments to their spending.  Moreover, responses to the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices (SLOOS) suggest that many banking institutions continued to tighten consumer lending standards in the third quarter, although a considerable majority reported that such standards were roughly unchanged (see the appendix to 'Domestic Financial Developments').  Meanwhile, consumer sentiment as measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey was about unchanged, on net, in September and early October.  While consumer sentiment has moved up from its extremely depressed levels earlier in the year, it remains subdued, likely reflecting the continued strains on household balance sheets and incomes.

Housing

On balance, the incoming data on residential construction activity suggest that the gradual recovery that began earlier this year has been maintained in recent months. Although single-family housing starts were essentially flat at an annual rate of around 500,000 units in August and September, the level of starts remained significantly above the record low of 360,000 units in the first quarter of the year.  Adjusted permit issuance-which is often a useful indicator of the underlying pace of starts-has also been roughly constant in recent months and was only a bit below the rate of starts in September.  In the much smaller multifamily sector-where tight credit conditions have persisted and vacancies have remained elevated-starts plunged beginning in the middle of 2008 but have basically leveled off during the past several months.

The Census Bureau's measure of the number of new-home sales agreements rose to an annual rate of about 410,000 units in the third quarter following gains also in the preceding quarter.

.  Although sales levels are still modest, they have been ample enough, given the slow pace of construction, to reduce the overhang of unsold new single-family houses.  The stock of unsold new homes dropped further in September, and these inventories were around onehalf of their peak level in the summer of 2006; measured relative to the September pace of sales, the months' supply of new homes also remained lower than earlier in the year.

Sales of existing single-family homes jumped in the third quarter to an annual rate of 4.7 million units.  Meanwhile, pending home sales agreements through August suggest that resale activity will continue to rise in future months.   Although sales in the existing5 home market have been supported for much of the year by the large number of transactions involving bank-owned and other distressed properties, resale activity more recently appears to have been driven primarily by transactions of nondistressed properties.  Data from the National Association of Realtors suggest that distressed sales fell to about 30 percent of all sales transactions for existing homes in the period from May to September after reportedly accounting for more than 40 percent of sales between December and April.

House Price Expectations

The modest recovery in housing demand that appears to have emerged probably reflects, at least in part, improvements in housing affordability stemming from relatively low mortgage rates and house prices that still remain below year-earlier levels but that have been firming recently, apparently raising expectations of future gains.   Interest rates for 6 conforming 30 year fixed-rate mortgages remain very low by historical standards at about -5 percent.  In addition, although spreads between rates for jumbo and standard conforming loans are still high relative to pre-crisis levels, they have continued to fall recently despite the fact that the secondary market for private-label nonconforming mortgages remains closed.  As for house prices, the repeat-sales price index for existing single-family homes calculated by LoanPerformance increased for a fifth consecutive month in August and is now only 10 percent below its level a year earlier.  Moreover, the Reuters/Michigan survey's diffusion index for year-ahead house price expectations remained positive in early October, which indicates that the number of respondents who expect house prices to increase over the next 12 months exceeds the number of respondents who expect prices to decrease.

Equipment and Software

Real investment in equipment and software (E&amp;S) seems to have stabilized in the third quarter after falling steeply for more than a year.  Business purchases of motor vehicles appear to have increased, and purchases of high-tech equipment look to have continued their modest recovery.  More broadly, the pace of decline in nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft slowed substantially in the third quarter, while orders moved up in September to a level slightly above shipments, closing what had been a sizable gap.

Real business outlays on motor vehicles likely rose in the third quarter after declining steeply for an extended period.  Purchases of light vehicles by both daily rental companies and other businesses moved up last quarter, as did sales of medium and heavy trucks.  In response to a higher volume of freight deliveries, the pace of new truck orders has picked up noticeably, suggesting that sales should continue to increase through yearend.

Real spending on high-tech E&amp;S looks to have risen modestly in the third quarter.  Data on shipments indicate that real outlays on computers and peripheral equipment and on communications equipment increased at a solid pace last quarter, but company reports

Surveys of Business Conditions

<!-- missing-text -->

suggest that business purchases of software have shown some lingering weakness. Looking forward, the NABE index on capital spending plans over the next 12 months for computers and communications equipment bounced back noticeably from the low level seen since the end of last year, while orders for high-tech equipment stood somewhat above shipments in September.  Meanwhile, major providers of telecommunications services, which account for about one-fourth of spending on communications equipment, reported that capital expenditures will be ramping up this quarter.

Business investment in equipment outside of transportation and high tech looks to have bottomed out in the third quarter after falling steeply during the preceding three quarters. Although shipments of these capital goods, which account for one-half of total E&amp;S outlays, edged down, on net, in recent months, new orders jumped in September and the stock of unfilled orders increased for the first time in the past year, which could provide some impetus for shipments in future months.

The fundamental determinants of investment in E&amp;S have improved somewhat in recent months, but, on balance, they point to only sluggish gains over the next couple of quarters.  Business output appears to have turned up in the third quarter, and the user cost of capital has continued to fall in line with bond yields.  Although spreads of corporate bonds over Treasury securities are still somewhat elevated, they have decreased considerably from their extremely high levels at the end of last year and continue to edge lower, likely reflecting less uncertainty and better assessments of future profitability. Meanwhile, monthly surveys of business conditions and sentiment have recovered to levels suggesting a modest rise in business spending.  However, the net share of small businesses reporting increased difficulty in obtaining credit edged up in the September NFIB survey, and the October SLOOS reported that banks, on balance, continued to tighten standards on commercial and industrial loans to firms of all sizes over the past three months.

Nonresidential Construction

Conditions in the nonresidential construction sector have generally remained bleak. Recent data on nominal expenditures for nonresidential structures suggest that real construction outlays outside of the energy-related sectors declined sharply in the third quarter.  The weakness was widespread across categories and likely reflected the drag from rising vacancy rates and plunging property prices.  In addition, the architectural billings index in September remained at levels consistent with further declines in spending, and the nonresidential construction industry has continued to shed workers. Finally, the responses to the October SLOOS suggest that it remains extremely difficult for businesses to obtain financing for new construction projects.

Real spending on drilling and mining structures slumped in the first half of the year, and available indicators suggest that activity more recently has only edged up from a very low level.  The steep drop in energy prices in the second half of last year greatly weakened incentives for additional drilling activity, particularly in the natural gas sector, which accounts for most rigs in operation.  However, the rebound in oil prices this year seems to have led to an increase in oil drilling activity.

Business Inventories

The sharp cuts in production earlier this year markedly reduced business inventories. Real nonfarm inventories excluding motor vehicles fell at an annual rate of $115 billion in the second quarter, and the more recent book-value data for the manufacturing and trade sector suggest that inventories continued to fall at a similar pace in the third quarter. Although the measure of months' supply (excluding motor vehicles) implied by the bookvalue data has declined considerably in recent months, it remains somewhat elevated, especially for some categories of durable goods in manufacturing and wholesale trade. Similarly, the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventories continued to contract in the third quarter, but that months' supply for most major market groups (excluding motor vehicles) is still elevated even after the declines seen through September; progress in reducing months' supply has been most apparent for consumer goods.  In contrast, a relatively low net fraction of manufacturing supply managers surveyed by the ISM in September perceived their customers' inventories as being too high, which could suggest that purchasing managers in manufacturing may believe their customers will be doing some restocking in the coming months. 7

Federal Government Sector

The unified federal budget finished fiscal year 2009 in September with a deficit of $1.42 trillion, which is about 10 percent of GDP.  The budget deficit was almost $1 trillion wider than in fiscal 2008, primarily reflecting the budget costs of the fiscal stimulus and the financial stabilization programs and a recession-related increase in outlays and a decline in revenues.  The sizable jump in the budget deficit pushed up federal debt held by the public from 40 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2008 to 53 percent of GDP at the end of fiscal 2009.

Recent Federal Outlays and Receipts

(Billions of dollars except as noted; adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions)

- 1.  Includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and income security programs.
- ...  Not applicable.

For fiscal 2009 as a whole, outlays associated with the TARP and the conservatorship of the GSEs totaled about $260 billion.  But even excluding the costs of these financial stabilization programs, other federal spending was about 10 percent higher than that in the preceding fiscal year.  Spending under this year's fiscal stimulus bill amounted to about $110 billion, and transfer payments-particularly for unemployment insurance and other low-income support programs-were boosted by the weak conditions in the labor market.  In the period from July to September, defense spending rose solidly relative to the same period a year earlier; the level of spending points to a substantial increase in the NIPA measure of real defense purchases in the third quarter following a marked surge in the second quarter.

Receipts in fiscal 2009 were roughly 17 percent lower than in the preceding year.  The drop in revenues primarily reflected the effects of the recession as wages and salaries have waned, capital gains realizations have likely contracted, and profits have slumped. Also, this year's stimulus plan is estimated to have reduced tax receipts by more than $80 billion in fiscal 2009.   Summing these stimulus-related tax cuts with the stimulus 8 spending noted earlier shows that more than $190 billion in total stimulus funds had been distributed by September, about one-fourth of the total $787 billion stimulus package.

State and Local Government Sector

Purchases by state and local governments likely declined in real terms in the third quarter as governments took additional steps to address imbalances in their operating budgets. According to the latest labor market report, state and local employment fell 47,000 in September, and estimates for July and August were revised down to show a cumulative drop of 84,000 during those two months; payrolls at both the state and local levels have fallen sharply over the past three months after registering small declines during the first half of the year.  In addition to laying workers off, many governments have furloughed employees-an action that does not show up in the employment figures for the sector-to further reduce their compensation costs.  Meanwhile, real construction expenditures appear to have risen somewhat in July and August after increasing at an annual rate of 25 percent in the second quarter.  The upturn in real construction spending followed a steep drop in late 2008 and early 2009 and is likely attributable to a number of factors, including the availability of federal stimulus grants and the easing of credit conditions in the municipal bond market.  A moderation in construction costs is also helping states and localities make the most of the funding available for capital projects.

Prices

Consumer price inflation has remained subdued in recent months after decelerating noticeably over the past year.  Our translation of the recent readings on the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI) suggests that both the headline and core PCE price indexes edged up 0.1 percent in September.  Core PCE prices are estimated to have risen at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent over both the most recent 3- and 12-month periods.  Headline PCE prices declined ½ percent over the past 12 months, largely because of the plunge in energy prices at the end of 2008 and the decline in food prices over the past year, but they have risen 2 percent over the past three months as energy prices surged.  Meanwhile, survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations have stayed within the range seen in recent years.

Consumer energy prices rose last quarter, largely in response to the rebound in crude oil prices this year.  Prices paid by consumers for energy jumped 5 percent in August, and we estimate that they edged up another 0.7 percent in September.  Recent survey data point to gasoline prices stepping up in October, and prices of crude oil have moved up, on net, in recent weeks, portending some upward pressure to energy prices in the coming months.  After falling from an elevated level in the middle of last year, natural gas prices have, on balance, been roughly flat since this summer, but futures prices for natural gas currently tilt noticeably upward.

Consumer prices for food have remained soft.  After rising only 0.1 percent in August, food prices are estimated to have fallen 0.2 percent last month and to have declined 1.2 percent over the 12 months ending in September, primarily reflecting the weak economy and ample supplies.  Prices in farm commodity markets have been mixed recently:  Grain prices, on balance, have moved up since the time of the September Greenbook because of concerns about frost damage to crops that were planted late, but livestock prices have continued to move down over this period.

PCE prices excluding food and energy have continued to rise slowly in recent months. We estimate that core PCE prices increased 0.1 percent in September, the same pace as in the preceding two months.  While core nonmarket prices have turned up in the past two quarters after posting sizable declines earlier in the year, core market-based prices have risen more slowly.  In particular, prices for housing services and for many durable goods declined over the three-month period ending in September.

In the preliminary Reuters/Michigan survey for October, median year-ahead inflation expectations moved up to 2.8 percent, retracing their dip in September.  Median inflation expectations over the next 5 to 10 years edged up from 2.8 percent in September to

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Market expectations for the path of the federal funds rate and nominal Treasury yields were little changed over the intermeeting period.  Risk premiums on corporate bonds declined a bit further, and some spreads in money markets edged lower.  Stock prices were about unchanged and the equity premium remained wide.  Meanwhile, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses remained muted as C&amp;I loans continued to run off. In the household sector, the 30-year fixed rate for mortgages was little changed, while delinquency rates on prime and nonprime mortgages continued to rise.  Banks reported further tightening in lending standards and terms as well as weaker demand for most types of loans to businesses and households, on net, in the October Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Credit card ABS issuance stopped amid uncertainty about the FDIC's treatment of these securities in the event of a bank failure.  Amounts outstanding in most of the Federal Reserve's liquidity and credit facilities continued to decline.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

Policy rates implied by federal fund futures market quotes were little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.  Based on the staff's standard assumptions about term premiums, investors apparently continued to expect the federal funds rate to remain in the current target range until the second quarter of 2010 and to reach about 1¼ percent by the end of 2010.  The expected policy path moved down following the release of the September FOMC statement and some weaker-than-expected data releases, but increased amid speeches by Federal Reserve officials and better-than-expected earnings announcements.  Staff models indicate that term premiums on federal funds futures rates remain elevated, suggesting that investors may expect policy to tighten somewhat later than the second quarter of 2010.  According to the Desk's primary dealer survey, 14 of the 18 reporting primary dealers expect the first target rate increase to occur in or after the third quarter of 2010.

Intermediate- and longer-term nominal Treasury yields were little changed during the period.  Yields on TIPS declined noticeably, however, resulting in an increase in nearterm inflation compensation of 29 basis points.  Increases in oil prices may have boosted near-term inflation expectations, though staff models indicate that an increase in TIPS liquidity may have been a factor.  Five-year forward inflation compensation five years ahead was little changed.

Financial Institutions and Short-Term Funding Markets

Investor sentiment toward the banking sector deteriorated a bit over the intermeeting period.  While third-quarter earnings results at some large banks were boosted by revenues in investment banking and securities trading, market participants reportedly remained concerned about the earnings prospects for the banking sector in an environment of weak economic activity and rising loan losses.  On net, equity prices for large banks declined about 9 percent, while prices for regional and smaller banks fell about 4 percent over the period.  CDS spreads for large bank holding companies were about flat, but they widened for regional and smaller banking organizations.  According to the Federal Reserve's weekly bank balance sheet data, commercial banks added more than $13 billion to their allowances for loan and lease losses in the third quarter.

Conditions in short-term funding markets eased a bit further over the intermeeting period. One- and three-month Libor-OIS spreads remained around pre-crisis levels, while sixmonth spreads-still somewhat elevated by historical standards-continued to narrow. Spreads on A2/P2-rated commercial paper and AA-rated ABCP were little changed, on net, remaining at the low end of their ranges over the past two years.  Overall, year-end pressures in funding markets appear quite modest; however, there is some evidence of increased demand for Treasury securities that mature soon after the turn of the year, suggesting some flight-to-quality demands related to year-end.

Federal Reserve Purchase Programs and Facilities

Over the intermeeting period, total Federal Reserve assets edged up, as increases in securities outpaced declines in credit extensions under the credit and liquidity facilities. As of October 28, the Federal Reserve purchased a total of about $105 billion of longterm securities during the intermeeting period, bringing the System's cumulative purchases of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS to $298 billion, $140 billion, and $977 billion, respectively. 1

Usage of Federal Reserve credit facilities declined further over the intermeeting period. TAF auctions continued to be undersubscribed, and TAF credit extended dropped 29 percent over the intermeeting period.  Commercial paper held through the CPFF also decreased at the end of October when a substantial portion of the paper matured and was funded outside the program.  TALF credit outstanding moved sideways as modest new

The October 2 TALF subscription garnered $2.4 billion in loan requests backed by ABS (supporting seven ABS deals totaling approximately $6.5 billion).  The October 21 CMBS TALF subscription saw $2.1 billion in loan requests to finance legacy assets.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock-price indexes were about unchanged, on net, over the intermeeting period, despite an initial wave of third-quarter earnings reports that mostly beat analysts' forecasts.  The staff's estimate of the expected real equity return over the next 10 years for S&amp;P 500 firms was little changed at about its average levels during the recession of the early 1990s.  As a result, the gap between the expected return and the real 10-year Treasury yield-a gauge of the equity risk premium-remained elevated and in line with weak economic activity.  Option-implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index was little changed, on balance.

Over the intermeeting period, corporate bond yields fell a bit, while those on comparablematurity Treasury yields were about flat, leaving spreads on investment- and speculativegrade corporate bonds 12 and 44 basis points lower, respectively.  Corporate bond spreads are now comparable to average levels in the previous recession.  Estimates of bid-asked spreads for investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds-a measure of liquidity in the corporate bond market-remained steady at moderate levels.  Conditions in the leveraged loan market continued to improve, as average bid prices rose a bit further and bid-asked spreads narrowed.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

To date, about half of the firms in the S&amp;P 500 have reported third-quarter earnings, and thus far most reports have come in well above expectations.  On the basis of these reports and analysts' estimates for the rest, it appears that earnings per share among S&amp;P 500 firms in the third quarter were on par with second-quarter results, which had been boosted by some large one-time gains.  In addition, revisions to analysts' expectations of year-ahead earnings for nonfinancial S&amp;P 500 firms were a bit above zero, on balance, in mid-October, largely due to the stronger-than-expected earnings reports over the past few weeks.

Indicators of the credit quality of nonfinancial firms improved a bit in recent months. The aggregate ratio of debt to assets for nonfinancial corporations ticked lower in the second quarter, while the aggregate liquid asset ratio rose to around its peak level in

2004.  The pace of nonfinancial corporate ratings downgrades by Moody's moderated substantially in the third quarter, while the pace of upgrades ticked up.  The six-month trailing bond default rate for all U.S. firms edged down in September and is now below its peak level in the previous recession.  The year-ahead expected default frequency for nonfinancial firms from Moody's KMV inched down further in October to just below 2 percent, well off its peak level in March.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations has slowed somewhat in October, even as speculative-grade firms have continued to issue bonds at a robust pace.  Commercial paper outstanding turned positive, but the gains were not widespread across programs.  C&amp;I loans continued to contract significantly, albeit at a slower rate than in September.  All told, net debt financing by nonfinancial businesses is on pace to post a small gain in October.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms through seasoned and initial public offerings has been solid in October, though noticeably below its robust September pace. In the second quarter, equity retirements from estimated share repurchases slowed further, while retirements from cash-financed mergers remained low.  As a result, net equity issuance in the second quarter stayed positive.  In the third quarter and in early October, announcements of new share repurchase programs were sparse, likely due to corporations' continuing efforts to preserve liquidity.  By contrast, announcements of mergers and acquisitions rebounded, boosted by both strategic deals as well as acquirers' renewed interest in potential opportunities to restructure distressed companies.

Equity issuance by financial firms slowed in October from a solid September pace. Issuance of bonds by financial firms remained robust, with about 20 percent offered under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program.   Citigroup and GE Capital 2 accounted for all of the FDIC-guaranteed debt issuance.

Commercial Real Estate Finance

The commercial real estate sector remained strained.  Outstanding commercial mortgage debt decreased at an annual rate of nearly 3 percent in the second quarter and recent data

suggest another decline in the third quarter.  The dollar value of commercial real estate sales edged down in September as just under half of properties were sold at a nominal loss.  Commercial property prices decreased 3 percent in August, leaving the index at about its mid-2003 level and 41 percent below its peak.  Delinquency rates on securitized commercial mortgage pools increased in September to 4.3 percent, more than reversing the slight decrease in August.  Commercial mortgage CDS index prices for senior AAA pools were about flat, on net, but decreased for junior AAA and BBB-minus pools over the intermeeting period.  No CMBS has been issued this year, but other CRE sectors have seen some interest from investors.  Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have raised over $15 billion this year in equity and unsecured debt, reportedly to pursue bargains.

Household Finance

The average interest rate on 30-year conforming fixed-rate mortgages stayed near 5 percent over the intermeeting period; spreads between mortgage interest rates and 10-year Treasury yields were little changed.  Agency MBS yields were also about unchanged, on net, and issuance of MBS by the housing-related GSEs was strong again in August.  Anecdotal reports suggest that the tapering of Federal Reserve agency MBS purchase has, to date, placed only modest upward pressure on MBS yields.  No privatelabel MBS have been issued since the beginning of 2008.

According to the repeat-sales index from LoanPerformance (LP), house prices increased for the fifth consecutive month in August, rising 8.9 percent at an annual rate. Nonetheless, over the year ending in August, the LP index decreased 10 percent.  House price indexes from the Federal Housing Finance Agency and S&amp;P/Case-Shiller suggest similar year-over-year rates of decline.  Delinquency rates on prime and subprime mortgages continued to climb, and the delinquency rate for FHA-backed loans rose to nearly 8 percent in September.

Consumer credit contracted for the seventh consecutive month in August, reflecting declines in revolving and nonrevolving credit.  Consumer ABS issuance decreased in October for both TALF-eligible and non-TALF-eligible securities.  Issuance of credit card ABS is likely to be subdued until the FDIC clarifies how it would handle these securities in the event of a receivership of a sponsoring bank.   The number of credit card 3

offers sent to households by mail remained steady at low levels in August, but the interest rate offered on these credit card mailings edged up.  The latest readings on delinquency rates for consumer loans remained high by historical standards.

As in recent months, long-term mutual funds received sizable inflows in September, as continued outsized flows to hybrid and bond funds more than offset net redemptions of equity funds.  Money market mutual funds experienced further substantial net outflows last month, as yields on such funds remained extremely low.

Treasury and Agency Finance

Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury auctioned $190 billion of coupon-bearing securities, including $7 billion in TIPS.  The auctions were generally well received, although the 30-year bond elicited relatively less strong demand.  Demand for the reopened 10-year TIPS was strong, and the auction recorded the highest bid-to-cover ratio since the inception of the TIPS program.  Mutual fund flow data indicate that retail demand for TIPS has risen in recent months relative to its historical average.  Foreign demand at auctions of both nominal and TIPS securities strengthened.  As previously announced, the Treasury ran down the outstanding amount of short-term bills associated with its balances in the Supplementary Financing Program to about $15 billion; the reduction in bill supply was reportedly associated with some downward pressure on bill yields.

Treasury market functioning showed some further signs of improvement over the intermeeting period.  Average absolute fitting errors of the staff's nominal Treasury curve-a proxy for unexploited arbitrage opportunities in the nominal Treasury marketdeclined slightly over the intermeeting period.  On-the-run premiums on the 10-year Treasury note continued to decline, although they remained significantly above their precrisis levels.  Finally, fails-to-deliver in the Treasury market remained low.  Trading volumes in both nominal and TIPS markets increased but remained below those observed in previous years.

State and Local Government Finance

Conditions in the municipal bond market were little changed over the intermeeting period.  In October, gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds has continued at a robust pace, while short-term issuance moderated in line with typical seasonal patterns.

M2 Monetary Aggregate

(Based on seasonally adjusted data)

<!-- missing-text -->

Source: Federal Reserve.

Yields on long-term municipal bonds rose about 11 basis points over the intermeeting period, and the ratios of yields on long-term municipal bonds to comparable-maturity Treasury yields were unchanged on net.  Rating upgrades in the second quarter again outpaced downgrades, as rating agencies continued to change the rating scale for municipalities toward the more lenient scale used for corporate debt.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 expanded at a moderate 4 percent annual rate in September and has risen at an estimated 3 percent pace in October.  While liquid deposits grew rapidly over this period, small time deposits and retail money market mutual funds continued to contract. Meanwhile, currency growth averaged 3 percent in September and October amid moderate demand from abroad.  Growth in the monetary base averaged about 89 percent, primarily reflecting an increase in reserve balances due to additional purchases of longterm assets and the decline in the Treasury's Supplementary Financing Account.

The runoff in bank credit steepened in September as the decrease in core loans intensified to an 18 percent annual rate.  According to the latest Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices, standards and terms tightened further and demand continued to decline, on net, for most types of loans in the third quarter (see appendix to this section).  On the business side, C&amp;I loans dropped at a 32 percent pace, with maturities and steady paydowns reported across a wide variety of industries.  Commercial real estate loans also continued to decrease, reportedly due to widespread paydowns and chargeoffs.  Residential mortgage loans on banks' books also ran off more quickly, with substantial loan sales to the GSEs continuing to more than offset strong originations. Revolving home equity loans and consumer loans also contracted, even though commercial banks continued to bring credit card assets back onto their books.  The drop in total loans at large banks continued to substantially outpace the decline at smaller banks.  The allowance for loan and lease losses rose further at large banks in September, but it was about unchanged at small banks.

Fifteen depository institutions, with aggregate assets of $5.2 billion, failed over the intermeeting period.  Thus far in 2009, there have been 118 failures, the highest annual total since 1992.

Appendix

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices

The October 2009 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of and demand for loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  The survey also included three sets of special questions:  The first asked banks about the reasons for the decline in commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans over the first eight months of 2009, the second asked banks about the status of commercial real estate (CRE) loans on their books that were scheduled to mature by September of this year, and the third asked banks about potential changes in credit card lending due to implementation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (Credit CARD) Act.  This appendix is based on responses from 57 domestic banks and 23 U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. 1

In the October survey, domestic banks indicated that they continued to tighten standards and terms over the past three months on all major types of loans to businesses and households. However, the net percentages of banks that tightened standards and terms for most loan categories continued to decline from the peaks reached late last year.  The exceptions were prime residential mortgages and revolving home equity lines of credit, which registered little change in the net fractions of banks that had tightened standards.   A small net fraction of branches and 2 agencies of foreign banks eased standards on C&amp;I loans, while a significant net fraction continued to tighten standards on CRE loans.  Demand for most major categories of loans at domestic banks reportedly continued to weaken, on balance, over the past three months.  This weakening was somewhat less widespread than in the July survey for C&amp;I loans, CRE loans, and nontraditional mortgages; approximately the same for consumer loans; and significantly more widespread for home equity lines of credit.  However, banks reported stronger demand, on net, for prime residential real estate loans.  Demand for C&amp;I and CRE loans at foreign banks continued to weaken, on balance, but the weakening was somewhat less widespread than that in the July survey.

In response to a special question on the sources of the decline in C&amp;I lending this year, the two sources that domestic banks cited most often as being 'very' important were decreased originations of term loans and decreased draws on revolving credit lines.  In response to a second special question, banks indicated that, of the CRE loans on their books that were scheduled to

mature by September of this year, more loans had been extended than refinanced both for construction and land development loans and for loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate.  In response to special questions concerning the Credit CARD legislation passed in May 2009, the majority of banks reported that they had yet to fully comply with the new law.  Banks indicated that they expected to tighten many of the terms and conditions of credit card loans as a result of the legislation, with the notable exception of penalty fees and the length of the grace period for payments, which banks, on net, reported they would ease.

Lending to Businesses

Questions on commercial and industrial lending. The net fraction of banks that reported tightening standards on C&amp;I loans to firms of all sizes was about 15 percent, about one-half of the net fraction that reported doing so in the July survey and substantially below the peak of around 80 percent that was reported in the October 2008 survey.

The net fractions of domestic respondents that reported having tightened selected terms on C&amp;I loans remained fairly elevated, but generally continued to fall from the highs reported in late 2008.  Approximately 40 percent of banks, on net, reported increasing spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for large and middle-market firms and about 45 percent reported boosting such spreads on loans to small firms.  By comparison, about 60 percent and 65 percent of banks, on net, reported raising spreads for loans to large and middle-market firms and to small firms, respectively, in July.  Nearly 40 percent of respondents reported increasing the premiums charged on riskier loans to firms of all sizes.  By contrast, only between 5 and 20 percent of banks, on net, reported decreasing the maximum maturity of loans or credit lines, decreasing the maximum size of credit lines, and tightening terms on loan covenants for loans to firms of all sizes.  Indeed, some banks reported easing a few loan terms.

The predominant reasons cited for tightening credit standards or terms for C&amp;I loans were the same as those reported in the previous three surveys.  Respondents that tightened standards most commonly cited the reason as being a reduced tolerance for risk, followed by an economic outlook that was less favorable or more uncertain, and a worsening of industry-specific problems. Each of the six domestic banks that reported easing loan terms in the latest survey cited more aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for doing so.

Notable net fractions of domestic banks reported weaker demand for C&amp;I loans from firms of all sizes, though the weakening was less widespread than in the July survey.  In July, roughly 50 percent of domestic banks reported weaker demand for C&amp;I loans to firms of all sizes; that fraction fell to roughly 30 percent and to 35 percent for loans to larger and to smaller firms, respectively, in October.  The predominant reasons for reduced demand were similar to those cited in the July survey and included decreases in the need to finance investment in plant and equipment, inventories, accounts receivable, and merger and acquisition activity.

For the first time since the April 2007 survey, a positive net share of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported having eased standards for C&amp;I loans, though about 90 percent reported that their standards remained basically unchanged.  About 15 percent of foreign respondents, on net, reported narrower spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds and lower premiums charged on riskier loans.  Like the domestic banks, each of the five foreign banks that reported easing standards or terms cited more aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  Only about 5 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported a decrease in demand for C&amp;I loans.

Special Question on Commercial and Industrial Lending

The October survey included a special question on C&amp;I lending, motivated by the significant decline in C&amp;I loans outstanding over the first eight months of 2009.  The question focused on the possible sources of the contraction in C&amp;I lending, and it complements a special question in the July survey that asked banks to rank the relative importance of various supply and demand factors in explaining the decline in C&amp;I loans.  Domestic respondents to the July survey predominantly cited demand factors, including lower loan demand from creditworthy borrowers because their funding needs had declined, followed by a deterioration in the credit quality of potential borrowers.

Respondents to the October survey indicated that decreased originations of term loans and reduced draws on revolving credit lines were generally more important sources of declines than paydowns of outstanding C&amp;I loan balances.  More specifically, on a weighted basis, about 40 percent and 30 percent of banks, respectively, reported that decreased originations of term loans and decreased draws on revolving credit lines were 'very' important sources of the decline in C&amp;I loans this year.   About 15 percent of banks reported that paydowns of previous draws on 3 revolving credit lines were a 'very' important source of the decline.  Respondents also pointed to increased prepayments of term loans, paydowns of bridge loans, and increased loan write-downs as either 'very' or 'somewhat' important sources of the decline in C&amp;I loans this year.  In contrast, relatively few domestic banks, on a weighted basis, reported that increased sales or syndications of outstanding loans and increased incidence of term loans that matured and were not rolled over or extended were important factors.

Among the foreign respondents that indicated that C&amp;I lending had declined at their banks this year, about 50 percent, on a weighted basis, reported that decreased origination of term loans was a 'very' important source of the decline.   In weighted terms, about 30 percent and 15 percent of 4

foreign banks, respectively, also reported paydowns of bridge loans and paydowns of draws on revolving credit lines as being 'very' important.  More than one-half of the respondents, on a weighted basis, also reported an increased incidence of term loans not being rolled over or extended, and increased write-downs as 'very' or 'somewhat' important sources of the decline in C&amp;I loans.

Questions on commercial real estate lending. About 35 percent of domestic respondents reported tightening standards on CRE loans in the latest survey, a slightly smaller fraction than the 45 percent that reported having done so in July.  The net percentage of respondents that reported weaker demand for CRE loans remained high by historical standards at about 45 percent, but this fraction dropped almost 20 percentage points relative to July.  About 20 percent of foreign respondents, on net, reported tighter credit standards and weaker demand for CRE loans, down somewhat from the July survey.

Special Question on Commercial Real Estate Lending

The October survey included a special question on the status of CRE loans on banks' books that, at the beginning of 2009, were scheduled to mature by September of this year.  The question focused on construction and land development loans and loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate.  Among the domestic respondents that reported possessing such maturing CRE loans, about 85 percent, on a weighted basis, reported that they had extended more than one-fourth of them.   In contrast, weighted fractions of only about 15 percent and 25 percent of domestic banks 5 reported that they had refinanced more than one-fourth of maturing construction and land development loans and maturing loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential real estate, respectively.  In general, large banks tended to extend more of their maturing CRE loans than small banks.

Lending to Households

Questions on residential real estate lending. About 25 percent of banks, on net, reported in the latest survey that they had tightened standards on prime residential real estate loans over the past three months.  This figure is slightly higher than in the July survey but is still significantly below the peak of about 75 percent that was reported in July 2008.  For the third consecutive quarter, banks reported that demand for prime residential real estate loans strengthened on net.  About 30 percent of banks reported tightening standards on nontraditional mortgage loans, which represents a 15 percentage point decline in net tightening from the July survey.  Only about 5 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported weaker demand for nontraditional mortgages, the smallest net fraction reporting so since the survey began to include questions on the demand for nontraditional mortgages in April 2007.

The net percentage of respondents that tightened standards on revolving home equity lines of credit was about 30 percent, roughly the same as in the previous survey.  A net fraction of 30 percent of banks reported weaker demand for home equity lines of credit, compared with about 15 percent in the previous survey.

Question on consumer lending. About 15 percent of respondents reported tightening standards for credit card loans to individuals or households, down from the 35 percent that reported doing so in the previous survey and the smallest net percentage reported since April 2008.  Sizable net fractions of banks-between 30 and 40 percent-continued to report a tightening of various terms and conditions on credit card loans, including credit limits, interest rate spreads, minimum required credit scores, and willingness to grant loans to customers who do not meet credit-scoring thresholds.

About 15 percent of banks, on net, reported having tightened standards on consumer loans other than credit card loans, down from the 35 percent that reported having done so in the previous survey and the smallest net percentage of tightening recorded since January 2008.  With the exception of interest rate spreads, which nearly 35 percent of banks reported having widened, reports of tighter terms on other consumer loans were also less widespread.

For consumer loans of all types, 25 percent of banks reported weaker demand, roughly the same as in the July survey.

Special Question on the Credit CARD Act of 2009

The October survey included a special question on banks' expectations with regard to the effects of the Credit CARD Act of 2009.  Of the banks that make credit card loans, 75 percent did not expect to be compliant with the provisions of the legislation until February 2010, when most of the provisions will go into effect, while the rest were either already compliant or expected to be compliant by the end of this year.  Weighted by credit card loans booked in domestic offices, about 90 percent did not expect to be in compliance until February 2010. 6

As a result of the act, banks reported that they expect to tighten (or have already tightened) many terms on credit card loans for both prime and nonprime borrowers, although small fractions of banks reported, on net, that they expected to lengthen grace periods for prime borrowers and decrease penalty fees for both prime and nonprime borrowers.  The decrease in penalty fees is consistent with the provisions of the legislation that restrict the conditions under which banks may impose such fees.  When responses are weighted, significantly larger fractions of banks

reported easing penalty fees for both prime and nonprime borrowers.

For both prime and nonprime borrowers, majorities of respondents expected to increase interest rate spreads, raise minimum required credit scores, reduce credit limits, and reduce the extent to which loans will be granted to customers who do not meet credit-scoring thresholds. Expectations for considerable degrees of tightening were more common for loans to nonprime borrowers.  On a weighted basis, substantial majorities of respondents, on net, expected to increase interest rate spreads, raise minimum required credit scores, and reduce credit limits.

The survey also included two questions on interest rate practices for credit card loans. A net fraction of about 35 percent of banks expected to increase the use of risk-based pricing.  A similar fraction of banks expected to increase the use of variable interest rates and decrease the use of fixed interest rates, but when weighted by credit card loans outstanding, this fraction is about 75 percent.

Questions on existing credit lines. As in the July survey, sizable net fractions of domestic respondents reported decreasing the sizes of credit lines for existing customers on most types of accounts.  For certain loan categories, such as home equity lines of credit, commercial construction lines of credit, and lines of credit for financial firms, the net percentages of banks reporting such adjustments increased.

As in the July survey, considerable net fractions of foreign respondents reported decreasing the sizes of credit lines for existing customers on C&amp;I credit lines, commercial construction lines of credit, and lines of credit to financial firms.  Nevertheless, the net percentages of foreign banks reporting such changes edged down from their levels in the July survey.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit narrowed to $30.7 billion in August, from $31.9 billion in July, the result of a small increase in exports and a decrease in imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports of goods and services moved up 0.2 percent in August, following a robust 2.5 percent gain in July.  The August increase was primarily accounted for by an increase in exports of services, with exports of goods exhibiting only a very mild increase.  Among major categories, exports of aircraft showed a marked decline, with exports of computers and consumer goods recording more modest decreases.  In contrast, exports of automotive products and industrial supplies showed noteworthy increases. Higher automotive exports likely reflected the continuing recovery in U.S. automakers' production, while the increase in exports of industrial supplies reflected higher prices.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The average value of exports in July and August surged 19.2 percent at an annual rate, the first quarterly increase since the third quarter of 2008.  With the exception of aircraft, all major categories of exports rose.  About two thirds of the overall gain was accounted for by significant jumps in exports of automotive products and industrial supplies, with the increase in the latter partly reflecting higher prices.

The value of imports of goods and services decreased 0.6 percent in August, after rebounding strongly in June and July.  The August decrease was led by a decline in the value of oil imports, which wholly reflected lower volumes, as prices moved up.  Imports of aircraft and consumer goods also recorded notable decreases.  In contrast, imports of machinery, automotive products, and industrial supplies increased significantly.  As with exports, the increase in automotive imports continued to reflect, in part, a recovery in North American auto production, while the increase in imports of industrial supplies reflected higher prices.

The average value of imports in July and August rose 26.6 percent at an annual rate, interrupting a string of three consecutive quarterly declines.  Nearly all major categories rose.  Imports of automotive products and oil recorded the largest increases, although the increase in the value of oil imports reflected higher prices, as volumes remained essentially flat.  Imports of computers, machinery, industrial supplies, and services showed somewhat more moderate increases, while imports of aircraft registered a small decrease.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. Prices for imported core goods rose 0.7 percent in September, the largest increase since July 2008.  The increase largely reflected higher prices of materialintensive goods, and in particular, prices for non-fuel industrial supplies.  Prices for finished goods were essentially flat across all major subcategories.

In the third quarter, core import prices, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), increased 2¼ percent at an annual rate, primarily due to a more than 7 percent increase in prices of material intensive goods.  Prices of finished goods increased a modest ¼ percent, as lower prices for consumer goods largely offset higher prices for automotive products and capital goods.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Oil. Following a 1.6 percent increase in August, the Bureau of Labor Statistics price index of imported oil was flat in September, increasing only 0.1 percent.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude oil averaged just above $69 per barrel in September, not materially different from the previous month's average price.  In recent weeks, however, spot WTI has increased sharply, closing most recently on October 27 at $79.55 per barrel.  The upward movement in oil prices is surprising, although some analysts have pointed to a more positive assessment of global growth prospects as well as U.S. data pointing to a more rapid pace of inventory drawdown than had previously been expected.

Exports. Core exports prices fell 0.4 percent in September following a 0.8 percent increase in August.  The lower September prices primarily reflected a decline in the prices of exported agricultural products.  Prices for finished goods were flat.

In the third quarter, core export prices on a BLS basis increased 3¾ percent at an annual rate.  An 11½ percent increase in prices for industrial supplies contributed to the increase. Prices for exports of finished goods rose almost 2 percent, led by higher prices for consumer goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Since the previous Greenbook, we have received Treasury data on international financial transactions which indicate the recent trend of portfolio reallocations toward riskier securities continued in August.  Private foreign investors sold U.S. Treasury securities and purchased U.S. equities, and U.S. investors purchased a sizable amount of foreign equities.  Foreign official purchases of U.S. Treasury securities remained strong in August, although purchases were below the levels recorded at the height of the financial crisis.

Foreign official inflows in August (see line 1 of the table 'Summary of U.S. International Transactions'; see also the figure 'Foreign Official Financial Inflows through August 2009') eased a bit to $21 billion.

.  More recent custody data from the FRBNY

suggest that the pace of foreign official inflows into Treasury securities accelerated in September and October, consistent with reports of greater intervention activity by foreign monetary authorities.

Foreign private demand for U.S. securities remained weak in August, as private foreigners on net sold $16 billion in U.S. securities (line 4 of the table and the middleright panel of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through August 2009').  Foreign private investors purchased modest amounts of agency debt (line 4b) and corporate stocks (line 4d), but continued to sell U.S. corporate debt (line 4c).  In the years prior to the financial crisis, foreign investors had typically purchased a significant percentage of new issues of U.S. corporate debt.  Despite the pick-up in issuance of U.S. corporate debt in 2009, however, foreign investors have on net sold a significant amount of corporate bonds.  This lack of interest may reflect the larger share of recent issuance accounted for by nonfinancial firms, as foreign investors have tended to favor debt issued by financial firms.

Financial outflows associated with U.S. investors' net purchases of foreign securities slowed in August (line 5 and the bottom panels of the figure 'Private Securities Flows through August 2009').  Strong net purchases of foreign stocks by U.S. investors were offset by net sales of foreign bonds.

Central banks' outstanding drawings on the Federal Reserve swap lines declined further to $33 billion as of October 23, which reflects further normalization of the funding markets.  The official inflows associated with the unwinding of these swaps are included in line 2.  There were small net inflows associated with net private bank borrowing in August (line 3).

Foreign Financial Markets

The trade-weighted index of the exchange value of the dollar against the major foreign currencies has depreciated slightly on net since the September Greenbook.  Some further unwinding of the crisis-induced shift toward the dollar due to continued improvements in funding conditions and global economic outlook was subsequently reversed after the weaker-than-expected U.S. consumer confidence data revived concerns over the pace of an economic rebound.  The dollar depreciated 1 percent on balance against the euro and the Canadian dollar and 6 percent against the Australian dollar, but appreciated 1 percent against the yen and sterling.  Dollar weakness against the euro prompted President Trichet of the European Central Bank (ECB) to call for a strong dollar.  Despite interventions by several Asian and Latin American central banks to stem appreciation of their currencies, the exchange value of the dollar against the other important trading partners of the United States has decreased slightly, with the dollar down 4 and 5 percent against the Brazilian real and Russian ruble, respectively, and 2 percent against the Korean won.

Expected policy rates (from OIS forwards) 12 months hence rose broadly in most major industrial economies on the improved foreign economic outlook.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) became the first central bank among G-20 countries to hike rates since August 2008, raising its policy rate 25 basis points to 3.25 percent.  Further tightening by the RBA is expected in November and December.  Norges Bank also raised its policy rate 25 basis points to 1.5 percent.  Expected policy rates have also risen in other major foreign industrial economies, despite indications that central banks will continue to remain accommodative for some time.  The ECB left its policy rate unchanged at 1 percent, as expected.  Its second 12-month long-term refinancing operation was again conducted at a fixed rate of 1 percent, which temporarily dampened market expectations that the ECB will begin to hike rates within the next year.  The Bank of Canada kept its key policy rate unchanged and reiterated its intention to maintain its stance through mid2010.  The Bank of England kept its policy rate and its asset purchase program unchanged, as expected.  Although the October Monetary Policy Committee minutes were seen by participants as suggesting earlier rate increases than had been previously expected, as well as a diminished likelihood for an increase in asset purchases, the weaker-than-expected Q3 GDP data pared back such expectations.

Ten-year sovereign yields were little changed in Europe and increased 8 and 12 basis points in Japan and Canada, respectively.  Headline stock indexes fluctuated in a narrow range in most major industrial economies.  Equity prices in most major emerging market

economies rose 4 to 16 percent, but in China and South Korea they were little changed. CDS spreads on emerging market sovereign debt continued to decline.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

Incoming indicators for the third quarter have been positive, on balance, across the advanced foreign economies with the notable exception of the United Kingdom, where GDP unexpectedly contracted.  Purchasing managers indexes (PMIs) rose solidly in the third quarter, reaching levels consistent with a stabilization or moderate expansion of output, and flash PMIs continued to rise in the euro area in October.  Consumption spending, with the help of fiscal stimulus in many cases, appears to have risen over the third quarter.  Surveys suggest that consumer confidence also continued to climb, although it remains below pre-recession levels, in part because households remain concerned over labor market conditions.  Trade volumes are up from their early-year lows, and in some countries, the rebound in trade has been accompanied by an increase in production.  The production bounce has been especially pronounced in Japan.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation stayed negative in all major economies, with the exception of the United Kingdom, where it was 1.1 percent in September.  The European Central Bank (ECB), the Bank of Japan (BOJ), and the Bank of England (BOE) kept policy rates on hold and continued implementing their asset-purchase programs, but BOJ officials signaled an intention to let some credit-easing programs expire at the end of the year.

Incoming data for Japan suggest that external demand remained the main driver of the recovery in the third quarter.  Although both imports and exports remain well below 2008 levels, international trade surged in the third quarter with real exports and real imports rising at annual rates of 52 percent and 39 percent, respectively.  Domestic demand also improved in the third quarter.  With the help of government stimulus, consumption, which rose 3 percent in the second quarter, appears to have continued to rise in the third quarter.  Consumer confidence has risen back to levels last seen in the fourth quarter of 2007.

Industrial production rose in August for the sixth consecutive month, and machinery orders appear to have stabilized over the summer, suggesting that private investment might have leveled out after contracting sharply over the past year.  Recent indicators of business confidence, including the BOJ's Tankan index, show that pessimism among Japanese firms eased somewhat in the third quarter, although business sentiment remains near record lows.

The overall good news for the Japanese economy is moderated somewhat by data from the labor and housing markets.  Despite the recent downtick in the unemployment rate to 5.5 percent in August from 5.7 percent in July, the more reliable ratio of job openings to applicants (the number of officially posted job openings relative to the number of officially registered job seekers) held at a 46-year record low in August.  The housing

market also remains depressed, with housing starts dropping more than 9 percent in August from the previous month to a new series low.

On the consumer price front, 12-month headline inflation was unchanged in August at negative 2.2 percent, a record low.  Energy prices continued to put downward pressure on inflation, but they were not solely to blame.  Inflation excluding food and energy prices fell 0.9 percent over the 12 months ending in August.

The BOJ held its target for the overnight call rate at 0.1 percent over the intermeeting period but signaled that it intends to let some of its credit-easing programs expire at the end of the year, citing improved conditions in the markets for commercial paper and corporate bonds.  Newly appointed Prime Minister Hatoyama has promised to transform the economy into one where growth is generated by domestic spending rather than by exports alone.  In October, the administration unveiled a set of emergency measures intended to create 100,000 jobs by the end of the fiscal year.  The stimulus package focuses on easing regulatory hurdles and helping job-seekers find work in the agricultural and environmental sectors.

On balance, recent indicators for the euro area suggest a further improvement in economic conditions.  Measures of economic sentiment continued to improve and flash PMIs rose further in October, generally indicating expansion.  Industrial production, excluding construction, has been particularly strong, increasing 1 percent in August, the fourth consecutive monthly increase.  New industrial orders grew 2.0 percent in August. On a less positive note, in August, real retail sales declined 0.2 percent, and the unemployment rate edged up to 9.6 percent.  Exports fell about 6 percent in August, led by an almost 9 percent decline in manufactured products.  In addition, the pace of car registrations slowed from more than 12 percent in the second quarter to 1.4 percent in the third, reflecting the unwinding of schemes to support car sales.

Developments of credit to the nonfinancial sector have been mixed, with rising credit to the household sector and falling credit to nonfinancial corporations.  In September, loans to nonfinancial corporations fell 0.2 percent from the previous month, the fifth consecutive monthly decline.  Loans to households added to recent gains, increasing 0.3 percent from the previous month.

Twelve-month euro-area inflation was negative 0.3 percent in September, following negative 0.2 percent in August.  The downturn in energy prices (which fell 11 percent in September from a year earlier) has been an important factor in the decline of inflation. Excluding food and energy, September inflation was 1.2 percent.

The Governing Council of the ECB kept its benchmark policy rate unchanged at 1 percent at its October 8 meeting.  Since the ECB's record liquidity injection of €442 billion in one-year funds in June, the overnight EONIA rate has tended to be just above the 0.25 percent rate on the ECB's deposit facility.  The second one-year operation on September 30 elicited less interest, with allotments totaling €75 billion.  The ECB has continued to implement plans to buy €60 billion worth of covered bonds and had purchased about €20 billion by late October.

In the United Kingdom , real GDP contracted 1.6 percent in the third quarter according to the preliminary estimate, bringing the cumulative drop since the beginning of the recession to 6.0 percent.  The output of services industries fell 1.1 percent despite strong performance from retail sales during the quarter.  The output of manufacturing and construction industries is estimated to have fallen 0.9 percent and 4.7 percent, respectively.

<!-- missing-text -->

The moderation in the pace of GDP contraction was accompanied by tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market.  The Labor Force Survey measure of the unemployment rate was unchanged at 7.9 percent in the three months to August.  Short-term unemployment (durations 0 to 6 months) fell somewhat relative to the previous three months.  A similarly-sized increase in unemployment at longer durations suggests that finding new employment remains difficult.  Expenditures on machinery, equipment, and infrastructure appear especially weak.  According to the Bank of England (BOE) Agents' Summary of Business Conditions, investment intentions of manufacturing and services firms remained depressed in September.  New construction orders fell back in August.

Measures of credit to the nonfinancial sector continue to be weak.  Bank lending to private nonfinancial corporations fell 3.8 percent in the 12 months to August, a pace approaching the low observed in the wake of the early 1990s recession.  Net lending secured by dwellings was near its recent trough in August despite some improvement in

house purchases and prices since the beginning of the year.  House prices fell close to 20 percent between late summer 2007 and early spring 2009 but have since risen around 6 percent.  Housing equity withdrawal as a share of households' post-tax disposable income was negative 3 percent in the second quarter, compared with about 5 percent in 2007.

Price pressure remains subdued.  Headline inflation tumbled to 1.1 percent in September on a 12-month basis, its lowest reading since June 2003, as sharp increases in utility prices last year dropped out of the equation.  Producer input prices fell 6.5 percent over the same period, up from double-digit declines at the beginning of the summer.  In contrast, in August, the 12-month change in average weekly earnings excluding bonuses posted its first increase in a year.

At its October meeting, the BOE left its policy rate unchanged and maintained its current asset-purchase programs.  As of October 22, the BOE had acquired £170.6 billion in assets through the creation of bank reserves, the vast majority of which (£168.6 billion) were gilts.  The central bank is expected to complete its £175 billion asset-purchase program by the end of the month and decide on a further extension at the November meeting of its monetary policy committee.

Canadian indicators for the third quarter are positive, on balance.  After faltering early in the year, trade volumes have rebounded.  Over the three months ending in August, exports and imports increased at annual rates of 23 percent and 43 percent, respectively. Both exports and imports were supported by a surge in automotive trade.  Machinery and equipment imports were also up sharply.  Likely reflecting, in part, the strength in international trade, manufacturing shipments rose solidly.  The Canadian housing market is also rebounding forcefully.  Total housing starts rose more than 15 percent, not at an annual rate, in the third quarter.  Monthly GDP declined negligibly in July.

Canadian labor-market conditions showed modest improvement.  Total employment declined slightly in the third quarter as a whole, but rose modestly in both August and September.  The September gain was driven by a sharp increase in full-time employment; prior to the September release, almost all of the stability in Canadian employment was attributable to increases in part-time work.  With the increase in full-time employment, hours worked rose 1.6 percent in September, the first increase in three months.  The unemployment rate fell 0.3 percentage point to 8.4 percent, the first monthly decline since the beginning of the labor-market downturn in the fall of 2008.

Consumer prices fell 0.9 percent in the 12 months ending in September.  The decrease was due primarily to a decline in energy prices.  Inflation excluding food and energy was 0.9 percent, near its lowest level of the past several years.

The Bank of Canada kept its policy rate at 0.25 percent and has reiterated its intention, conditional on the outlook for inflation, to keep rates at this level until at least the end of the second quarter of 2010.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Data since the September Greenbook indicate that the economic recovery in the emerging market economies continued over the third quarter.  Domestic demand appears to be playing an important role in supporting recovery across Asia and parts of South America. China's economy continued to roar ahead, supported by accommodative policies, and growth was surprisingly strong in Korea and Singapore.  Ample government credit has supported demand in Brazil.  The Mexican economy showed signs of a revival in activity after a year of output contraction.  Inflation, although declining, remains a concern in Mexico and Brazil, but inflation pressures appear to be contained in Asia with the major exception of India.  Imports have generally continued to rise and there are firmer signs of export growth.

In China , the staff estimates that real GDP increased 9.8 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter, as activity continued to be supported by monetary and fiscal stimulus.  (The official, headline four-quarter growth rate was 8.9 percent.)  In September, industrial production was nearly 12 percent above its year-earlier level, and the official PMI reading remained solidly in the expansionary range.  Real retail sales growth remained strong, and fixed-asset investment was up more than 33 percent from September of last year.  Robust domestic demand has contributed to rising imports, which are now within 10 percent of their pre-crisis peak.  Exports have also increased, but in September, they remained 17 percent below their year-earlier levels.

In October, Premier Wen Jiabao explicitly stated that the recovery of the Chinese economy is on firm ground.  He stressed that in the coming months authorities will focus on striking the appropriate balance between maintaining growth, restructuring the economy, and guarding against inflation.  As in recent months, loan growth in September was around 1 percent on a month-over-month basis, considerably down from the pace in the first half of the year, but a level still supportive of economic growth; the value of outstanding loans was 34 percent higher than a year ago.  Food prices moved higher in the third quarter, pushing quarterly headline inflation up to 1.2 percent at an annual rate, whereas inflation measured on a four-quarter basis remained negative.

In India , recent indicators point to solid growth in the third quarter.  The pace of recovery of the manufacturing sector has been surprisingly swift, mostly driven by a sharp rise in the demand for investment goods and consumer durables, particularly autos. The merchandise trade deficit, which had narrowed sharply during the crisis, has widened during the past few months as the domestic-demand-led recovery has caused imports to grow faster than exports. However, weak credit demand raises some concerns that the recovery may prove to be tenuous.

Consumer price inflation spiked in July and August to just under 11 percent on a 12-month basis, while wholesale price inflation, which is more closely followed in India, turned positive in September after several months of falling prices.  The monsoon season was one of the driest in decades and put upward pressure on food prices in recent months. In late October, the central bank removed the extraordinary liquidity measures that had been provided during the crisis, while leaving its key policy rates unchanged.

In the newly industrialized economies ( NIEs), third-quarter Korean real GDP rose 12.3 percent, boosted by a sharp moderation in inventory drawdown.   Consumption and 1 fixed investment decelerated from the second quarter.  Preliminary data indicate that growth remained at a double-digit level in Singapore, reflecting strong exports and stabilizing domestic demand.  The trade surpluses in Singapore, Korea, and Taiwanwhich had risen sharply during the crisis because imports collapsed more sharply than exports-narrowed again in the third quarter as brisk domestic demand growth led imports to bounce back faster than exports.

Inflation has risen a little from low or negative rates in the region.  Inflationary pressures have not presented a threat in the near term, but the reduced degree of economic slack has led observers to believe that central banks in the region, particularly Korea, will tighten monetary policy in coming months.  Policymakers have also expressed concerns about potential asset bubbles and to date have addressed these concerns with prudential measures.

In the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN-4), economic recovery continued into the third quarter, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous quarter. 2 Within the region, the recovery of Thailand's economy appears the most tenuous. Domestic demand appears to be supporting growth in Indonesia.  In contrast, domestic demand was weak in Thailand as well as the Philippines, where remittances declined over the July-August period.  In Thailand and Malaysia, industrial production fell in August after several months of growth, and in each case, was about 12 percent below the peaks attained in early 2008.  Trade balances in the region were generally flat or deteriorated slightly, as the pace of recovery in imports exceeded the pace of recovery in exports.

Consumer prices increased on a monthly basis in August and September.  As a result, on a 12-month basis, inflation in Indonesia and the Philippines edged up, and in Thailand and Malaysia became less negative.  With inflation subdued, central banks maintained their policy rates unchanged.

In Mexico , data suggest that activity began to revive in the third quarter following four quarters of decline in real GDP.  Industrial production was up, on balance, over the JulyAugust period, boosted by auto production for the export market.  Accordingly, overall exports were up in the third quarter through August.  In September, the manufacturing PMI continued to climb and moved into the expansion range.  Although business confidence has picked up, consumer confidence remained weak.

Weak domestic activity has helped mitigate inflationary pressures in recent months, bringing 12-month headline and core inflation down to just below 5 percent.  However, inflation remains above the 2 to 4 percent inflation target range.  Balancing concerns about inflation against the still-fragile state of the economy, the Bank of Mexico kept its policy rate on hold at its mid-October meeting.  In early September, the Calderon government introduced a bill that envisions far-reaching reforms to public finances. However, the lower house unexpectedly watered down the tax provisions considerably, fueling concern that Mexico's government would continue to be heavily dependent on oil revenues amid a trend of declining oil production.  That development fueled speculation that Mexico's credit risk rating will be reduced.  In response, the Senate, which had been expected to accept the lower house provisions, is now expected to review the bill and has until the end of October to decide on the tax provisions.

In Brazil , data releases indicate that the recovery continued in the third quarter, supported by higher commodity prices and expansionary fiscal policies.  The manufacturing PMI continued to climb through September and remained in the range indicating expansion.  Industrial production climbed further through August, but was still 10 percent below its September 2008 peak.  Production was supported by strong domestic demand, particularly for autos and appliances, which have been boosted by temporary government tax incentives.  Domestic demand also continued to be supported by rapid loan growth, particularly government-directed credit.  The trade surplus narrowed in the third quarter, as exports expanded at a slower pace than imports.

Headline and core inflation both fell in September, coming in at 4.3 percent and 5 percent, respectively, on a 12-month basis.  At its October 21 meeting, the central bank of Brazil held its policy rate at 8¾ percent, where it has been since last July.  However, there has been considerable speculation in recent weeks that soon the central bank will raise reserve requirements to tighten credit conditions and that the central bank will raise its policy rate in early 2010.

Strong net capital inflows continued through late October, fueling upward pressures on the currency.  In late October, as a result of official purchases of foreign exchange to stem the appreciation of the real , international reserves reached a record high of $230 billion.  The government imposed a 2-percent tax on portfolio capital inflows to stem currency appreciation.  Analysts have questioned how effective the tax will be in the longer term in curbing capital inflows and whether the move will hinder financial sector development.

In Russia , economic activity began to rebound in the third quarter following three quarters of decline.  Industrial production was up 22 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Retail sales were flat in the third quarter, but consumer confidence has shown improvement in recent months.  The unemployment rate ticked down in September, to a seasonally-adjusted 8 percent, from 9 percent in May. Consumer prices rose just 0.3 percent in September bringing headline consumer price inflation down to 10.7 percent on a 12-month basis, the lowest in two years.  Higher oil prices have supported a strong ruble.  The central bank of Russia has allowed some currency appreciation but also has been accumulating reserves over the past few months.
