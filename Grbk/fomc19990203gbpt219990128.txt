January  Senior oan Officer  pinion  Survey L O on Bank Lending Practices

The January 1999 Senior oan Officer pinion  Survey  on Bank Lending  Practices L O focused  primarily  n changes  over  the  past hree onths in  the  supply  and demand o t m for  bank  loans o  businesses  nd households.' dditional  uestions  oncerned  the t a A q c rapid  growth  in  securities    banks  in  the  fourth  uarter  f  1998 and developments n at q o i the  market  for  syndicated  ommercial  and industrial  ans. c lo

The survey  results  uggest hat he  broad  tightening   business ending tandards  y s t t of l s b domestic  banks  observed  in  the  September  and November  surveys as  largely  rawn h d to  a close;  owever,  citing  ontinued oncern  over  the  economic outlook,  ignificant, h c c s though  smaller,  ractions  f articipants  dicated  hat hey  had firmed  terms  on loans f o p in t t to  large nd middle-market usinesses  nd standards  nd terms  on commercial  real a b a a estate  oans.  The share  of  branches nd agencies f  foreign  anks that eported l a o b r tightening  ending  standards  nd  terms  on business  oans as large nd  down  only  a l a l w a little  om November; for  commercial  real state  oans, he  share  of  branches fr e l t and agencies eporting  ighter  tandards  nd terms  rose  from the  November  survey. r t s a Some  respondents,  ainly  domestic, ndicated  hat emand  for  commercial m i t d and industrial ans ad increased. lo h

The survey  found little  idence  of  substantial  anges  in  lending ractices th ev ch p wi respect  o  households.  Several anks  said hat hey  were more willing  o  make t b t t t consumer installment ans,  hile  modest percentages  aid  that hey  had tightened lo w s t standards n credit  ards.  Standards nd terms  on other onsumer  loans ere o c a c w reportedly  ittle  anged. l ch

In  responses o  the  additional estions, nks  that ad increased  heir  oldings  f t qu ba h t h o securities    the  fourth uarter  f  1998 said hat hey  had done so in  part ecause  of in q o t t b more attractive  elds,  desire o  increase  he  duration  f  their  ecurities  rtfolios, yi a t t o s po and a willingness  o  boost  leverage.  Many  respondents  eported  ome deterioration t r s in  the  condition  f  the  market  for yndicated  oans--for ample,  its  apacity  o o s l ex c t absorb  new  credits  ithout ignificant  dification  f  terms--relative  six  months w s mo o to ago,  although ome judged  the  market  to  have  improved. Many  participants  o s wh originate ese  loans eported hat hey  had increased  he  use  of  "flexible icing" th r t t t pr during  the  syndication riod. pe 2

Lending to  Businesses

On net, nly  7 percent f  domestic  respondents  eported  ightening  ending tandards o o r t l s for  commercial  and industrial  ans  to  large nd middle-market irms,  nd a mere lo a f a 4 percent,  n net, eported  ightening nding tandards  or  small  firms.  (In  the o r t le s f

November  survey  37 percent nd 15 percent eported  ightening andards  or  larger a r t st f and small  firms  respectively.)    contrast,   percent,  n net, f  the  branches  and By 56 o o agencies f  foreign anks  reported  ightening andards  or  these oans  in  the  past o b t st f l three onths,  down  only  a bit rom November. m f

Domestic respondents  ontinued o  report  tightening  f  business oan  terms,  ut c t a o l b these  reports  ere not  so widespread  as  in  November.  For  example,  31 percent,  n w o net, eported  idening  loan  spreads,  own  from 47 percent,  n  net, n  November. r w d o i The most important easons  given  for  tightening re a less avorable,   more r we f or uncertain, onomic outlook,   worsening  of  industry-specific  blems, nd ec a pro a decreased  liquidity    the  secondary oan  market. in l 3 Reports  of  tightening re much we more widespread  at  the  branches nd  agencies f  foreign  anks  than  at  domestic a o b banks.

In  view  of  the eneral ightening  f  lending erms  in  recent onths,  banks  were g t o t m asked  a special  uestion bout  the  share  of  their  utstanding  evolving  oan q a o r l commitments and other ormal  lending rrangements n which they  would tighten f a o terms--including  es  and spreads ver  base  rates--if   commitments were maturing fe o the and being  repriced  t  the  time  of  the  survey.  Seventy-seven  ercent f omestic a p o d banks  reported  hat hey  would tighten  erms  for  less han  a fifth  f  these t t t t o commitments. By contrast, er  half f  the  branches  and agencies f  foreign anks-ov o o b which have  been tightening  redit  tandards  nd terms  much  more than  domestic c s a banks  for  several  onths--would  tighten  n 80 percent  r  more of  their  utstanding m o o o commitments.

Twenty percent f  domestic  respondents,  net, eported ncreased  emand for o on r i d commercial  and industrial  ans  from large nd middle-market irms  over  the lo a f previous hree onths,  while  11 percent eported  ncreased  emand from small  firms. t m r i d The most important eason  given  for he  increase  n  demand, by a substantial  rgin, r t i ma was shifting  ustomer  borrowing  from other ources hat ad become less ttractive. c s t h a About 9 percent f  foreign  espondents,  net, eported tronger  oan  demand. o r on r s l

About 15 percent  of  domestic  respondents,  net, eported  ightened  tandards  n on r t s o commercial  real  estate  oans,  own from about  46  percent n  November; similarly, l d i fewer  banks  tightened  erms  on these oans  than  in  the  previous  urvey.  By  contrast, t l s 57 percent f  the  foreign espondents  ightened  tandards  n these oans,  p from o r t s o l u 44 percent n  November.  The percentage f  foreign anks  tightening rms  on i o b te commercial  real state  oans  also  increased  rom the  November  survey.  The primary e l f reasons iven  by domestic  banks  for  tightening re disruptions   the  commercial g we in mortgage-backed ecurities  rket,  less avorable,   more uncertain, onomic s ma a f or ec

outlook,  nd increased oncern  about  the  reliability  take-out  inancing.  oreign a c of f F respondents  ited hese easons  and a worsening  of  the  condition  r  outlook or  the c t r o f commercial  real state  arkets,  reduced  tolerance  or  risk,  nd  a deterioration e m a f a in their  arent ank's urrent r  expected  capital  osition.  bout 30 percent f  the p b c o p A o domestic  and 23 percent f  the  foreign  espondents  eported  n increase  n  demand o r r a i for  commercial  real state  oans.  The most important eason iven  by domestic e l r g banks  for  the  increased emand  was a shift  n  customer  borrowing  from lenders d i having  difficulty  curitizing  mmercial  mortgages.  The branches nd agencies f se co a o foreign anks  reported ustomer  financing  eeds  as  the  most important  eason  for he b c n r t reported ncrease n  demand. i i

Loan  Syndication

In  response o  special  uestions, lf  f  the  domestic anks  and two-thirds  f  the t q ha o b o branches  and agencies eported  hat he  condition  f  the  syndicated  oan  market--as r t t o l measured,  for  example, by its apacity  o  absorb  new credits  ithout ignificant c t w s modification  f  terms--is rse now than o wo it was six  months ago,  suggesting  hat t conditions  n  this arket  may not  have completely ecovered rom the  turmoil f  fall i m r f o 1998. However, a significant  rcentage f  respondents  ound this arket  not  to pe o f m have changed  or  even  to  have  improved  over  this  eriod.  Among p those  domestic  and foreign espondents  hat riginate  yndicated  oans  and perceive he  market  to  have r t o s l t deteriorated, re as  been  an increased  se  of  "flexible icing"  uring  the the h u pr d syndication  eriod o  raise  he  likelihood  f  full ubscription. ere  was much  less p t t o s Th evidence  that omestic  respondents  ave  trimmed originations    response o  changes d h in t in  the  market  for yndicated  oans,  r  that oans  on banks' ooks  have  grown faster s l o l b than  they  otherwise ould have  because  banks  held  a larger  hare f  its riginations. w s o o Branches  and agencies,  owever,  did  report aving  reduced  originations    their  oans h h of l because  of  problems  in  the  syndications rket. ma

Lending to Households

About 14 percent f  banks  reported  ncreased  illingness   extend  consumer o i w to installment ans,  p slightly om the  previous urvey.  No banks  reported lo u fr s a decreased illingness  o  extend  these redits.  even percent,  n net, eported  aving w t c S o r h tightened  tandards  n credit-card  ans, hile  standards  or ther onsumer loans s o lo w f o c were eased  by one  bank,  on net.  A  few  banks  reported  aising  preads   bit n credit r s a o cards  and other  consumer loans.  Three quarters  f  respondents  eported  nchanged o r u consumer loan  demand, while  the  remaining espondents howed a small  increase,  n r s o net.  Credit tandards  or  mortgage  loans  were little  anged,  and 10  percent  f s f ch o respondents,  n net, eported  ncreased  emand  for ome  mortgages, own o r i d h d substantially m more than  50 percent n  the  November  survey  and the  smallest fro i increase  eported ince id-1997. r s m 4
