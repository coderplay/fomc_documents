Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. trade deficit in goods  and  services narrowed  to $28.3 billion in May from $32.0 billion  in April (revised).  For April  and May  combined, the trade deficit was $362 billion at an annual  rate,  $18  billion smaller  than in the first quarter.

(Billions  of dollars,  seasonally  adjusted)

The value of exports increased about  1 percent in May,  following  sharp declines in both March  and April.  For April  and May combined, the value of exports  fell 11  percent  at  an annual rate  from the first quarter level,  following a smaller decrease  in the first quarter.  Almost all of the April-May  decline was in exported capital  goods (mainly computers,  semiconductors,  and other machinery)  and industrial  supplies.  There  were small increases  in exports of automotive products  to Canada and consumer  goods.

The value of imports plummeted  2.4 percent  in May, following  a similarly  sized decline in  April.  All major categories  of imports fell, excluding  oil, which was about unchanged. For April and May combined, the value of imports  fell 13 percent  at  an annual rate  from the first quarter  level, roughly  double the rate of decrease  in the first quarter.  While  much of the decline was in computers, semiconductors,  and other machinery, imports in nearly all other major trade categories  decreased  as well.  Imports  of automotive  products, however, moved up  somewhat,  primarily from Canada and Mexico in response  rising U.S. vehicle sales.

Data for U.S.  trade in June will be released  on August  17  and will be reported in the Greenbook supplement.

U.S.  net acquisitions  of foreign  securities  (line 5)  were higher in the second quarter  than in recent  quarters,  due in large part to stock  swaps, with some $22 billion accounted  for by the  purchase  of Voicestream Wireless by Deutsche Telekom in June.  However, net acquisitions  of foreign equities  exclusive of stock  swaps were also relatively high in the first two quarters  of this year.  U.S. investors appear to have reacquired their appetite for Japanese  equities, purchasing $7  billion  and $10  billion in  the first two  quarters, respectively,  after being net sellers in  2000.

Measured  foreign official  assets held  in the United  States  (line  1) fell by $33 billion in the  quarter, with  the largest decreases recorded  by China ($19 billion) and Japan  ($8  billion), while net gains  were recorded by Argentina  ($4 billion) and Russia ($3 billion).  The Chinese  official outflow is likely overstated, however:  in the past many Chinese official inflows  appear to have been recorded instead as  private inflows  in the transactions  data', and Chinese private inflows for the quarter were  measured  at $13  billion a huge  sum relative to estimated private holdings.  There  were no reported foreign exchange market interventions by Japan.  Partial data from the FRBNY  show that between  end-June  and earlyAugust total  foreign  official holdings were virtually unchanged  and Japanese foreign  official holdings fell an additional  $4 billion.

The U.S. banking  sector (line 3)  recorded  a modest net inflow of $6  billion in the second quarter. Of note are significant revisions to the first quarter banking sector data, where an originally-reported  outflow  of $108  billion that was  used by the BEA to compute the first quarter balance  of payments position has been reduced to an  outflow of $51  billion.

Spillovers from Argentina's problems  to other emerging markets  over the  period were largely limited to Brazil,  which  saw the exchange value of its currency fall 7 percent against the dollar and  its EMBI+ spread widen  80 basis points.  A new $15 billion standby  agreement  reached with the IMF on August  3  helped restore a measure  of investor confidence  and  stabilize financial  market prices  in Brazil. Financial markets  in Mexico  were only  slightly affected  by the turmoil in Argentine  financial  markets. The earnings  outlook for many companies  located in East  Asia suffered from the global  slump in  demand for high-tech  sector products,  and their  share prices  declined broadly.  The removal  from office of President Wahid  of Indonesia  in mid-July and the attendant  non-violent resolution  of long-simmering political  uncertainty contributed  to a 30 percent rally of the rupiah's exchange  value against  the  dollar over the intermeeting period, but did not appear  to provide  a boost to prices  of Indonesian  financial assets.

The Desk did not intervene  during the period for the accounts  of the System or Treasury.
