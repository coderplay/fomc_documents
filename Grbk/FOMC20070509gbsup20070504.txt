Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

The employment report for April provides further evidence that labor market demand has moderated over the past several months.  Private nonfarm payrolls rose 63,000 last month from February and March levels that were slightly lower than originally estimated.  The three-month moving average of the change in private payrolls was 92,000 in April, down from 181,000 in the three months ending in January.

The construction industry shed 11,000 jobs in April, with sectors associated with both residential and nonresidential construction posting small losses.  Manufacturing employment fell 19,000 last month, similar to declines in recent months, with about half the decrease occurring among motor vehicle and parts manufacturers.  Retailers eliminated 26,000 jobs last month primarily as a result of cutbacks at general merchandise stores, which had seen large gains in March.  Employment also declined, on balance, in the financial activities industry-with at least half the loss occurring in real estate credit.  Most other industries added jobs in line with their recent trends in April, while health-care providers added an above-average number of jobs.

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers ticked down 0.1 hour to 33.8 hours in April.  The aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers declined 0.4 percent last month, partially unwinding the outsized increase in March. After incorporating the revised information on hours worked in the first quarter, we now estimate that productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of close to 2 percent last quarter.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls rose 0.2 percent in April following a slightly larger increase in March.  For the twelve months ending in April, average hourly earnings rose 3.7 percent, compared with an increase of 3.8 percent over the previous twelve months.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate edged up to 4.5 percent last month-in the middle of the narrow range it has occupied since September.  The labor force participation rate dipped to 66.0 percent.
