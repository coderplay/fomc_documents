RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS

Economic activity appears to  have risen substantially further this quarter, paced by  brisk growth in consumer spending and a large gain in  business fixed investment. Overall manufacturing output accelerated over the July-August period, lifting capacity utilization, and brisk hiring has maintained a  taut labor market. Nonetheless, inflation has remained subdued.

Labor Market Developments

Labor demand continued to grow strongly this summer. Net of the direct effects of  the UPS strike estimated by  the BLS, private nonfarm payrolls expanded slightly more than 200,000 per month on average during July and August, in line with the pace over the first half of  the year. Aggregate weekly hours of  production or nonsupervisory workers for the first two months of  the third quarter averaged nearly 2  percent above their second-quarter level at an 1 annual rate.

Among the major sectors, factory payrolls rose considerably last month, 47,000, of  which 10,000 reflected the return of striking workers in  the auto and steel industries. After adjustment for the UPS strike, employment in the private service-producing sector grew 80,000 in  August, after a surge of 295,000 in July. Payroll growth during August in  the services industries and retail trade--the two main engines of job growth during the current expansion--was modest. However, the slowing followed sharp rises in July, and smoothing through the two months gives a  picture of robust job growth so far in  the third quarter.

The household survey continues to point to tight labor markets. Although the unemployment rate edged up 0.1 percentage point in August, to 4.9 percent, it was still very low  by  the standards of the recent decades. The labor force participation rate held steady for the fourth straight month at 67.1 percent, slightly below its historical high of 67.3 percent reached in  March.

Aggregate  Hours  of  Production  or Nonsupervisory  Workers

Solid labor demand and tight labor supply are also evident in other indicators of  labor market activity. Initial claims for unemployment insurance remain near their lowest level of the current expansion. The Conference Board's Index of  Help Wanted Advertising held steady in July at just a  shade below the historical high reached in February. Similarly, the Manpower, Inc., Survey of  Net Hiring Strength for the fourth quarter points to strong labor demand. This index is better as an  indicator of employment growth in  the quarter in  which the survey was taken (in this case, the third quarter) than as a  leading indicator. The surveys of individuals also suggest a  tight labor market; indeed, in the Conference Board's Survey of  Consumer Confidence, a  record number of respondents reported that jobs are plentiful.

Despite the consistent picture of apparent pressures in the job market, recent data on  average hourly earnings have revealed no further wage acceleration. After having risen only 0.1 percent in July, average hourly earnings increased 0.4 percent in  August. 2 On a  twelve-month basis, average hourly earnings were up 3.7 percent--within the range prevailing for some months now.

The recent UPS settlement provides for wage gains that average 3  percent per year over the life of  the contract for full-time workers, who make up  about 40 percent of  UPS's union employees. Wage gains for part-time workers will depend on  tenure. Part-time workers with at least five years of tenure will receive wage gains averaging nearly 8  percent per year. Those with less tenure will receive smaller increases. Given the high turnover of  UPS's parttime workforce, we  expect that, on  average, the wage increases for UPS's part-time workforce will be in the area of 2  to 3  percent. Unrelated to  wages, the Teamsters won concessions on  two of  the key issues in  the strike: the creation of 10,000 full-time jobs by combining part-time positions and the continuation of  the system of Teamster-run pension plans. However, the company prevailed in its demand for a  five-year contract. All told, on  this analysis, the settlement does not appear to signal an important departure from prevailing labor cost trends.

LABOR PRODUCTIVITY AND  COSTS (Percent change from  preceding period at compound annual rate; based on seasonally adjusted data)

Output per hour of  all persons in the nonfarm business sector is now  estimated to have advanced 2.7 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, up from the 1.4 percent rate of increase in  the first quarter. Output per hour of  all employees in the nonfinancial corporate sector rose 3.2 percent annual rate in  the second quarter, bringing the increase over the past year to 2.4 percent. Largely because of last quarter's surge in productivity, unit labor costs in the nonfarm business sector increased just 0.5 percent at  an  annual rate in the second quarter and were unchanged in  the nonfinancial corporate sector. Over the past four quarters, unit labor costs rose 2.2 percent in  the nonfarm business sector and 1.1 percent in the nonfinancial corporate sector.

Industrial Production

Industrial production grew 0.7 percent in  August. In  the manufacturing sector, output rose a  robust 1  percent, boosted by  the direct and indirect effects of a  sharp bounceback in  motor vehicle assemblies and large increases in  computers, semiconductors, commercial aircraft, and primary metals. In addition, the output of nondurables, which had been weak in  the first half of  the year, rebounded in  July and posted a  further increase in August. The factory operating rate rose to 83.1 percent in  August, the highest level since the spring of 1995. Outside of  manufacturing, the output of  utilities and mines (mainly coal) dropped noticeably as a result of  this summer's unseasonably cool temperatures.

With regard to  the data for prior months, growth in manufacturing output for June and July was revised up 0.1 and 0.4 percentage point respectively. For the second quarter, industrial production is now estimated to have risen 4.3 percent and appears to  be on  track for a  bigger gain in the third quarter. Looking ahead, data on orders and other indicators of  future production continue to be  upbeat (chart).

Motor vehicle assemblies rose to 12.3 million units at an annual rate in  August, following a  month plagued by  start-up problems for new  models and a  strike. At the end of  August, days' supply of light trucks remained a  touch on  the high side, while days' supply of autos was a  bit lean. Motor vehicle assemblies are scheduled to increase 650,000 units in  September, but weekly data suggest a  smaller, 250,000 unit increase. The makers

initial schedules for the fourth quarter, at a  12-1/2 million unit rate, are similar to  the pace of  the past couple of  months and seem to anticipate a  continuation of the recent pace of  motor vehicle sales.

Outside of  motor vehicles, the production of consumer durable goods fell back 0.6 percent in  August, reversing a  small part of the surge over the preceding few months. Business equipment continued to grow briskly, with strong gains registered in  all major categories. In particular, production of transit equipment rose especially rapidly, in  large part because of  a  continued ramp-up in 4 production at Boeing. Construction supplies increased 0.4 percent, thereby making up about a  third of their drop in July, and the production of  materials grew strongly again, with notable strength in semiconductors and metals.

Sales of Light Motor Vehicles

Cutting through the monthly noise, the underlying pace of sales of light motor vehicles has remained at about 15 million units over the past few years. After adjustment for the extended reporting periods by most firms, sales in  August were near that rate.

While overall sales have held steady at a  high level in the 1997 model year, the mix of sales has changed (chart). Notably, domestic firms have lost market share, in  part because foreign firms, particularly Japanese manufacturers, have pursued aggressive pricing strategies made possible by cost-cutting measures and favorable exchange rate movements. The Big Three have responded by maintaining incentives in the relatively high range that has prevailed since early 1995.

Another major development over the past year has been a  series of strikes, primarily at  General Motors. The strikes at  General Motors have caused periodic supply shortages, leading the company to delay fleet sales in order to  better serve the retail market. With its most recent strike settled in late July and start-up problems largely resolved, model availability at General Motors improved noticeably in  August. Not surprisingly, the company's fleet sales

(confidential) surged last month, making up for most of  the shortfalls earlier in the year (chart). Although weakness in retail sales in  August may have allowed General Motors to close more of  the gap in fleet sales than it had anticipated, we expect that the company will hold fleet sales a  bit above trend through the end of the year in order to fully recoup earlier shortfalls.

The near-term outlook for sales remains quite positive. The preliminary September results from the Michigan survey indicated that consumers' attitudes toward buying conditions for cars are favorable, largely a  reflection of  the view that "times are good." Pricing, from the consumers view, also remains attractive. On comparably equipped vehicles, prices announced by the Big  Three for the 1998 models have been little changed; price increases on foreign-nameplate models have been modest. In addition, initial industry plans for incentives in  the fourth quarter, while down from the level of  the current quarter, remain relatively high. Personal Income and Consumption

Consumer spending grew at  a  healthy rate in  August after having picked up smartly in June and July. Available indicators suggest that spending is continuing to grow in September. Moreover, nothing would seem to be in  the way of  further significant gains: Income and job growth are solid; consumer confidence is high; and households have experienced large gains in  net  worth.

According to the advance report, an upward-revised gain of 0.9 percent in total nominal retail sales in  July was followed by an increase of 0.4 percent in  August. Spending in the retail control category, which excludes sales at automotive dealers and building material and supply stores, rose 0.3 percent last month after having increased 1/2 percent per month in June and July. Gains were especially large at general merchandise and apparel stores, a reading consistent with anecdotal reports of strong back-to-school sales last month; durable goods stores also registered strong growth. The August retail sales report, together with available information on prices, suggests that real PCE for goods excluding motor vehicles in July and August was about 1 percent higher than the average level in  the second quarter (not at an  annual rate).

Real spending on services rose 0.4 percent in  July, the latest month for which data are available. Expenditures on energy services rose 1.1 percent in  July (on a  seasonally adjusted basis), following an unusually cool June. According to  national weather data,

temperatures in July and August were somewhat below normal, while September temperatures have been normal; these data suggest that energy spending will be little changed in  August and rise in September. Spending on  non-energy services increased 0.4 percent in July, with most categories of services registering solid growth.

Estimates of  personal income are available only through July, when real disposable personal income edged down 0.1 percent. Income was held down by  the decline in  the average workweek and the nearly flat average hourly earnings reported in  the July employment release. Aggregate hours and average hourly earnings both rose in August, suggesting that private wage and salary disbursements will show a  sizable gain for the month.

Readings of sentiment for August and early September continued to show that consumers have highly favorable views of  economic conditions. The Conference Board index moved back up  in  August to  a level just below June's 28-year high. The Michigan SRC index, which slipped a  bit last month, reversed much of  its decline in  early September and returned to its historical high recorded in  July. Overall, both the Conference Board and Michigan surveys show consumers to  be highly optimistic about business conditions and labor market prospects. In addition, measures of  inflation expectations have tended to edge down over the past year.

Housing Markets

The drop in  housing starts last month was somewhat surprising, given indicators of demand. Starts of single-family units declined in  August to a  1.07 million unit annual rate, compared with the average pace of 1.14 million units over the first seven months of the year. Adjusted permits for these units, which we  view as a better indicator of  the underlying trend in  construction, also declined in  August but by  less than starts. 6

Indicators of  housing demand have remained upbeat: Income and employment have continued to show healthy gains, mortgage rates are relatively low, and consumer assessments of  homebuying conditions are quite positive. Indeed, the recent trends in sales are favorable. The average level of  new home sales in  June and July was 7-1/2 percent higher than that over 1996 as a  whole, and sales of existing homes have been running ahead of the record-setting 1996 pace. Among the  more timely indicators of  activity, builders'

ratings of  new-home sales improved further in  both August and September, and applications for mortgages to finance home purchases have continued to run at  a  relatively high level in recent weeks.

Multifamily starts were at a  291,000 unit annual rate in August, compared with an  average pace of  319,000 units during the first seven months of  this year. Permits for these units also declined last month but less than starts. The level of  multifamily starts was low relative to permits in  August, suggesting that multifamily starts likely will rebound some in September.

Business Fixed Investment

Outlays for producers' durable equipment are continuing to grow rapidly. Shipments and orders of  nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft have posted exceptional gains in recent months. In addition, outlays for nonresidential structures show signs of recovering from the declines of the past two quarters.

The boom in expenditures on producers' durable equipment continues to be led by  office and computing equipment. These outlays advanced at an annual rate of 46 percent in  the second quarter and do not appear to  have slowed since: Nominal shipments of office and computing equipment in July were 6  percent above their second-quarter average level. In  addition, the price of  computing equipment has been falling even faster than usual--the PPI for computers dropped 2.8 percent (monthly rate) in  August, a  decline likely reflecting price cuts for Intel microprocessors. Anecdotal reports from industry sources suggest the possibility of  further large price cuts on personal computers in  the coming quarters.

Shipments of communications equipment rose 2.9 percent in  July to a  level 6  percent above the second-quarter average. Smoothing over the recent zigs and zags, the orders picture for communications equipment also looks healthy.

The current-quarter outlook for producers' durable equipment outside the high-tech sector is also positive, For transportation equipment, sales of  heavy trucks picked up  in July, and fleet sales of  light vehicles recoverd from their low levels of earlier this year. Although Boeing will not fully meet its announced delivery schedule for September, aircraft production has risen rapidly this quarter, and domestic deliveries are likely to post a  large gain over the quarter as a  whole.

high-tech and transportation equipment advanced 0.7 percent in July, and the high level of orders points to further growth.

Real expenditures on nonresidential structures appear to  be rebounding somewhat in  the current quarter after moderate declines in  the first two quarters of  this year. The value of  construction put in  place rose in July for the third month in a  row and now stands 2-3/4 percent above its second-quarter average. Looking forward, although construction contracts have been moving sideways in recent months, low  vacancy rates, rising prices for commercial real estate, and widespread availability of  financing through REITs suggest that conditions for further gains in  nonresidential construction are good.

Business Inventories

After a  sharp run-up in the second quarter, investment in business inventories slowed in July. For manufacturing and trade excluding motor vehicles, inventories rose at an  annual rate of $26 billion (book value) in  July, considerably below the secondquarter pace of $49 billion, as the June bulge in accumulation at wholesalers was partially reversed.

In  manufacturing, inventories increased at a  $26 billion annual rate in  July, an advance similar to the second-quarter pace. As in recent quarters, a  sizable portion of the accumulation was in  stocks of  nondefense capital goods--especially aircraft and parts, computer and office equipment, and communications equipment--where shipments and orders have increased notably and production has been brisk.

Aside from capital goods, stocks of  non-auto consumer goods-household durables, and home goods and apparel--also expanded substantially in July after a  moderate increase in the second quarter. However, given the pickup in non-auto retail sales in  July and August and the expected strength in consumer spending in coming months, the recent accumulation of  consumer goods inventories was probably intentional. For  most industries and market groupings in manufacturing, inventory-shipments ratios in July remained around the lower end of  their recent ranges.

Wholesale inventories declined in July after a  massive buildup in  June. The July drawdown was largely in durable stocks and in many cases coincided with very strong wholesale shipments in that month. For instance, stocks held by  distributors of  machinery fell $10 billion in  book-value terms, while shipments of  wholesale machinery surged 3  percent. In  the wholesale sector as a  whole, stocks appear to be  well in line relative to sales.

In retail trade, investment in  non-auto inventories picked up somewhat in July from the preceding two months but remained generally moderate. Notably, sales at stores selling general merchandise, apparel, and furnishings (GAF) have been quite brisk since late spring, and the inventory-sales ratio fell in July to the lowest level in recent years.

Federal Sector

News on the deficit front continues to  be good. With data for eleven months of  the fiscal year (October 1996 to August 1997) now complete, the unified deficit is down $62 billion from the same period last year, adjusted for shifts in  payment timing and excluding deposit insurance and proceeds from spectrum auctions. The drop in the deficit is a  result of  strong receipts (up 8-1/2 percent), most notably from personal income and social insurance taxes (up 9-1/4 percent). Adjusted outlays have grown 3-1/4 percent so far this fiscal year, 1  percentage point faster than they did over the first eleven months of fiscal 1996. The acceleration has been concentrated in two areas: defense spending, which has edged up after several years of  declines, and the "other" spending category, principally nondefense discretionary spending,

which is up  $8 billion this year after having declined $13.5 billion last year. The slowdown in spending for health care programs has continued into this year.

The Office of  Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office released revised budget projections for fiscal 19972007 earlier this month. The estimates are in close agreement, projecting deficits of  about $35 billion and $55 billion for fiscal years 1997 and 1998 and surpluses beginning in  fiscal 2002. These budget projections are much more favorable than those made earlier this year. The improvement results in part from the recently passed reconciliation legislation and from a  substantial upward revision to the CBO's estimates of taxable incomes that now closely aligns their forecast with that of  OMB. In  addition, both agencies have lowered their deficit estimates for technical reasons, mainly to reflect the windfall in  tax receipts this year. Information on the sources of the windfall remains limited, but both OMB and CBO assume that only a  portion of  it is permanent.

The economic assumptions underlying the OMB and CBO  budget projections are very similar. Both expect real GDP growth to slow to the area of 2  percent in 1998-2000, which allows unemployment to rise back toward their estimates of the NAIRU.9 Over the longer run, both agencies expect real GDP to grow at  about its potential rate, and the unemployment rate to hold steady. They expect inflation to be  about 2-1/2 percent per year as  measured by  the GDP price index and 2-1/2 to 3  percent per year as measured by  the CPI. Both agencies forecast the rate on ten-year Treasury notes to fall to the neighborhood of 5-1/2 percent by  the year 2000 in part because of  the reduction in  the budget deficit.

Although none of the thirteen regular appropriations bills for fiscal 1998 have been signed into law, most analysts expect most of the bills to  be in place before the end of the fiscal year on September 30. With the current Budget Resolution calling for roughly $20 billion more in  new  budget authority than was legislated last year, appropriations have not been seriously hindered for lack of  money. However, progress has been slowed by  disagreements over a few  policy issues, including the methodology for the 2000 census.

pay increases for members of  the Congress, and a  pilot program of school vouchers for the District of  Columbia. A  short stopgap spending bill is expected, if necessary, to fund programs without completed appropriations.

State and Local Governments

As reported by  the BLS, state and local employment has soared in recent months, with job gains averaging 82,000 per month from May through August. Much of  this rise, which compares with an average monthly increase of 17,000 over the two years ended May, was at local educational establishments. Although we  anticipated some pickup in school-system hiring this year, the recent acceleration in local educational employment is probably an artifact of  difficulties with the seasonal adjustment procedure. Notably, analysts at BLS are testing alternatives that they hope to put in  place next March. Above-trend increases during the previous two summers were followed by large declines in  September, and we  would not be surprised to see a  similar pattern this year.10 Real state and local construction spending has trended down since last winter after having risen moderately, on  net, over the preceding two quarters.

According to preliminary findings by  the National Conference of State Legislatures, the aggregate general fund balance for fiscal 1997, which ended in June for most states, was 7.3 percent of general fund spending, the highest ratio since 1980, when it stood at 9.0 percent. With forty-seven states reporting, none showed a deficit.11 Despite having underpredicted their revenues in  each of  the past four years, states remain conservative in  their expectations for the coming year and are forecasting year-end balances to fall to 5.2 percent of spending in fiscal 1998, a  ratio still quite high by  historical standards. Uses of the  unexpected revenues this year went to rainy day funds, one-time outlays, capital projects, and debt reduction, among other things. As in  the two prior years, states enacted tax cuts during fiscal year 1997, but the reduction was smaller than in either 1995 or 1996.

Prices

The news on  inflation continues to  be  very favorable. The consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in  August, the same pace as in

July. On a  twelve-month change basis, the CPI has remained in the neighborhood of 2-1/4 percent since May, down from nearly 3  percent in  August of  last year.

The CPI for energy advanced 1.7 percent in  August, pushed up  by a  5.4 percent increase in gasoline prices. The price of gasoline jumped because a  surprisingly strong late summer driving season pushed up demand for gasoline and some minor refinery disruptions held down supply. As these factors unwind, price pressures are likely to ease. Indeed, recent survey data point to  a  considerably smaller increase in  retail gasoline prices in September. In contrast to gasoline, heating oil prices moved down 0.7 percent further in  August. As refiners expanded gasoline production to meet strong demand over the summer, they also boosted output of  heating oil, and--in contrast to recent years--stocks are now ample.

Retail food prices advanced 0.4 percent in  August. The volatile index for fruit and vegetables jumped 2.8 percent, while other food prices were up only 0.1 percent. Relative to a  year earlier, consumer food prices were up 2-1/2 percent, about 1  percentage point less than in the preceding twelve months.

For items other than food and energy, consumer prices increased just 0.1 percent in  August and registered a  modest twelve-month change of 2-1/4 percent--a deceleration of  about 1/4 percentage point from the year-earlier pace. Prices of goods other than food and energy, which have been damped noticeably by  the appreciation of the dollar over the past few  years, decelerated slightly more than those of "core" services. Among goods, the flat price of  new  motor vehicles and the decline in  the index for used cars have been particularly notably, accounting for about two-thirds of the 0.3 percentage point deceleration in the core CPI over the past twelve months.

Turning to the details of  the August rise in  the core CPI, the 1  percent drop in  apparel prices reflected the slower-than-usual 12 introduction of higher-priced fall and  winter merchandise.12 By contrast, tobacco prices moved up in  August in response to  increases

In early September, tobacco companies announced wholesale price hikes for cigarettes, which are expected to  boost retail tobacco prices further.13 Prices of services excluding food and energy rose only 0.2 percent in  August--a shade less than in recent months--as airfares tumbled. More recently, however, airlines have posted fare increases, which are likely to  be picked up in  the September CPI. 1 4

Other broad measures confirm the recent quiescence of inflation, but none shows the deceleration apparent in the CPI over the past year. Among other expenditure price measures, core PCE prices accelerated 1/4 percentage point over the past four quarters, in  contrast to the small deceleration in the core CPI. However, this follows a  sharp deceleration in core PCE prices over the preceding year: over the past several years, these measures have shown similar amounts of  deceleration. Measures of product prices show low and stable inflation over the past four quarters. Meanwhile, inflation expectations as measured by  the Michigan index have moved a  bit lower over the past year.

The PPI for capital goods also has been restrained recently, remaining flat last month after having edged lower in July. In August, computer prices fell considerably as the latest round of price cutting by  chipmaker Intel began feeding through to computer prices. At earlier stages of  processing, prices have remained relatively subdued. The PPI for intermediate materials other than food and energy picked up a  little over the past month but still barely registered an increase over the past year. For crude materials less food and energy, prices rose in  August; however, since the mid-August pricing date for the PPI, the Journal of Commerce and KR-CRB industrial price indexes have moved lower.

Agricultural Production, Inventories, and Prices

According to the  Agriculture Department's latest assessment, farm supply prospects changed little during the month of  August. Based on survey evidence that was collected around the start of September, the agency nudged down its 1997 production forecast for wheat but held its forecasts for corn and soybeans essentially unchanged. Changes for other crops were mixed; for example, cotton prospects improved noticeably as a result of  favorable weather in Texas and some other states, but tobacco and peanuts were hurt to some extent by  dry weather in the Southeast. Production prospects for livestock were raised slightly, as downward revisions to the USDA's current-year forecasts for pork and poultry were more than offset by  upward revisions for beef and milk. Summation of these various pieces of  physical product data suggests that real aggregate farm output is headed for a  moderate increase this year.15 By  our calculations, increases of  the past two years have essentially reversed a 1995 decline, returning total farm output to about its 1994 record high. 1 6

Inventories of farm crops have increased a  bit from the lows of late 1995 and early 1996, and the levels of  production and consumption being predicted by  the USDA appear likely to result in further moderate accumulation of these inventories over the coming year. In dollar terms, buildups that are predicted for soybeans and wheat should more than offset an  anticipated reduction for corn, stocks of  which are expected to remain fairly low both in  absolute terms and relative to  expected levels of  usage. In  the livestock sector, inventories of cattle appear to  be  headed for a  second year of  decline in 1997, but growth in the number of  hogs and pigs appears to  be picking up.17

With production having expanded during the past two years and inventories of farm crops not quite so tight as they were in late 1995 and the first half of 1996, farm prices have fallen back from the peaks of a  year ago. According to the USDA, the index of prices received by farmers in  August 1997 was about 8-1/2 percent below the level of a  year earlier; the index had gone up about 15 percent over the preceding twelve months. Prices of crude foods in  the PPI have displayed an  even bigger swing, falling 14 percent during the most recent twelve months after a  rise of about more than 20 percent from August 1995 to August 1996. Futures prices as of mid-September suggest that declines in crude food prices should persist on  a  yearto-year basis at least into the early part of 1998 but at  a  slower rate than over the past year. El  Nino--the weather disturbance in the Pacific that is attracting so  much attention in  the popular press--does not yet appear to  have had much impact on prices in  the futures markets. The price of the December 1997 contract for corn has changed little, on net, since last spring, when evidence of  a new  El Nino first began to appear; and the prices of  late 1997 contracts for wheat and soybeans have declined.

compared to estimates that we are deriving from physical product data. In the past, current-year estimates of farm inventory accumulation in the national accounts often have been revised by sizable amounts in the following year in conjunction with annual benchmark revisions.

1997

Yields on  intermediateand long-term securities moved higher after the August FOMC meeting. News pointing to relatively robust economic growth, along with the minutes of the July meeting that suggested a  fairly strong bias toward tightening by  the FOMC, led market participants to see somewhat higher odds on tighter monetary policy over the intermediate term. The rate increases were subsequently reversed, however, as data for August implied some moderation in  growth and surprisingly tame inflation. On  balance, yields on Treasury notes and bonds are down between 5 and 15 basis points since the last FOMC meeting.

Money market rates show  mixed changes, with private rates holding steady while the three-month Treasury bill yield dropped 24 basis points. The Treasury has not gone as far as  market participants had expected in  boosting the issuance of three-month bills, and the relatively tight supply has helped push down yields on  these issues.

Stock markets remained volatile over the intermeeting period. Prices of  the larger-capitalization stocks had fluctuated below July peaks until quite recently, when the Dow Industrials and S&amp;P 500 stocks rallied strongly as bond yields fell. Meanwhile, the NASDAQ and Amex composite indexes posted new  highs in  September; and prices of  small-capitalization stocks soared, pushing the Russell 2000 index up nearly 10 percent to a record high.

Borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses has remained strong in the third quarter. Issuance of corporate bonds has been brisk, though down some from the surge in July, and growth of  bank loans to businesses has jumped to double digits. In  the household sector, growth of consumer credit perked up in July from June, but yearover-year increases have been trending down, and consumer lending by banks remained damped in August and early September. Mortgage debt indicators point to continued moderate growth in the third quarter. Federal borrowing has been light as the Treasury has chosen to finance the federal deficit for the third quarter largely by  drawing down its sizable midyear cash balance. Relative to the past few years, state and local governments have increased their net issuance of long-term debt to fund new capital outlays. M2 posted a rapid advance in  August, about double the  pace in  June and July; the acceleration owed largely to  heavy inflows to retail money market

funds that likely were diverted from equity mutual funds when stock prices slumped in mid-August.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of bonds by  nonfinancial corporations slowed to a  $16 billion rate in  August, below the record pace in  the June-July period but still above the average rate earlier in  the year (table). Data for the first three weeks of September suggest that issuance has remained near the pace of  August. Offerings of investment-grade securities continued to be  bolstered by  funding for several large mergers and acquisitions. Also, some proceeds from recent bond offerings were used to pay down short-term debt, which sharply slowed the growth in outstanding commercial paper in  August after two months of rapid expansion. But nonfinancial commercial paper resumed its growth in September as companies financed merger activities and corporate tax payments.

Speculative-grade bond issuers--mainly in  the high-technology, telecommunications, and oil sectors--continued to take advantage of relatively favorable interest rates to finance capital expenditures. As a  result, junk bond issuance has accounted for nearly half of total nonfinancial bond volume, somewhat above the high share recorded in the late 1980s (chart, bottom left). Meanwhile, strong investor demand has held spreads in the junk bond market near historic lows. Inflows to junk bond mutual funds have remained strong. Also, junk bonds' appeal to  more conservative types of institutional lenders has grown through repackaging into collateralized bond obligations.

Recent data continue to paint a  rosy picture for overall business credit quality. The dollar value of  Moody's downgrades in July and August was small and about matched upgrades. Moreover, Moody's listing of companies currently under review is very short, implying little further net change in ratings over the next few months. No defaults of junk bonds were reported in  August (chart, bottom right), keeping the default rate over the past few  months near the lowest level in  almost a  decade. Business failures have risen this year, but they remain well below the pre-199 4 rate. Over the past several months, failures were lifted by  bankruptcies of some firms in the retail sector. These bankruptcies were not a surprise, however, as the companies, which included Montgomery Ward and Levitz Furniture, had been having difficulties for several years.

Gross equity issuance in  August was less than $3  billion, but the summer lull in issuance appears to have ended in recent weeks. In  August and the first half of September, first-day returns to IPOs were the highest in over a  year, and fewer new issues, on net, sold at a  discount to their filing prices (chart, upper left). Strong demand for new  issues encouraged additional firms to file registration statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission in  August, thereby boosting the inventory of prospective equity issues for the fall.

Overall, nonfinancial corporations continue to retire a  greater volume of equity than they issue, as mergers and share repurchases remain brisk. The total dollar amount of equity retired through mergers likely will fall short of last year's near-record volume but only because some of this year's largest deals have been structured as stock swaps that result in no retirement of equity (chart, top right). Recent announcements by  corporations point to a  heavy volume of share repurchases through the rest of  this year (chart, lower left).

After soaring to record highs in  early August, the S&amp;P 500 index fell sharply and finished the month down 6  percent--its largest monthly drop in seven years. Investors were perhaps a  bit skittish after the large July gains in  stock prices pushed the expected earnings yield on  S&amp;P stocks further below the thirty-year bond yield (chart, lower right). Shares of large multinational corporations were especially vulnerable amid growing concerns that their third-quarter earnings would be  limited by  weaker sales abroad, owing to  the strengthened dollar and currency devaluations in Southeast Asia. Subsequently, in September, prices recovered the lost ground as  bond yields fell, and the S&amp;P is now  up nearly 5  percent for the intermeeting period.

Meanwhile, shares of  smaller companies have fared consistently well since mid-August. The Russell 2000 index of smaller capitalization firms has risen almost 10 percent over the intermeeting period, and the Amex, NASDAQ, and Russell 2000 indexes posted successive new  record highs. Still, small-capitalization stocks have risen less, on  balance, this year than largecapitalization stocks.

annual rate in July, the rise followed much slower growth in previous months (table), and bank data suggest growth remained sluggish in  August and early September. Expansion of  mortgage debt also slowed in the second quarter, but more recent indications point to a  return to the moderate pace of earlier in  the year.

Interest rates on  new mortgage loans have declined about 15 basis points, on net, since the August FOMC meeting. With mortgage rates around 7-1/2 percent on  average in  recent months, many households apparently have found it  desirable to  finance a  home purchase. For instance, the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) index of applications for home purchase loans remains near its highest level (chart, upper panel), while the refinancing index has remained noticeably below its recent peak (lower panel). The MBA purchase index may overstate somewhat the current level of  home sales, because lower long-term mortgage rates in recent months have led to an  increase in  the fixed-rate share of  total loan originations. Compared with other lenders, mortgage banking firms originate a  higher proportion of  fixed-rate loans and are somewhat overweighted in  the MBA survey. However, MBA  staff believe that any overstatement is not large enough to  be  materially misleading.

The latest information on  household credit quality suggests that the deterioration of  the past couple of  years may be abating. According to  the MBA  loan delinquency survey, mortgage delinquencies fell in the second quarter by about the same amount that they had risen in  the previous two quarters, putting the mortgage delinquency rate near its average of the past five years (chart, upper panel). Also, Call Report data indicate that the already low percentage of problem real estate loans at banks declined in  the second quarter. The net charge-off rate for all real estate loans at  banks also remained extremely low.

Problems with consumer loans seem to  be stabilizing, though the picture is still mixed. According to Call Report data, the steady uptrend in  bank delinquencies on  closed-end consumer loans, such as auto loans, appears to have leveled off in the first half of 1997, although the comparable ABA series continued to rise (chart, middle panel). At the captive auto finance companies, the delinquency rate edged lower in  the second quarter from a  historical high, then dropped sharply further in July. Call Report data indicate that the delinquency rate on  bank credit cards was about unchanged in the

first half of the year, a  reading broadly consistent with data from the American Bankers Association (ABA) (chart, lower panel). Government Finance

Treasury borrowing from the public in the third quarter should total only about $7 billion (table, top panel), and the Treasury's $51 billion midyear cash balance likely will be drawn down to less than half that size at this quarter's end. Recent marketable borrowing needs have been more than met with coupon issues-including five-year indexed notes auctioned in July. Weekly bill auctions have been trimmed by $1  billion, and with essentially no new  net issuance, the relative "shortage" of bills continues-keeping bill rates low relative to other yields.

The rally in  bond markets earlier in  the quarter spurred a pickup in advance refundings of municipal bonds in July and August. Some of the proceeds from these issues were placed in nonmarketable Treasury issues (SLGS). Municipalities wishing to  defease outstanding and noncallable bonds could also meet their need for Treasuries in  the strips market, where gross purchases increased to more than $4 billion in  August, double the pace of earlier months this year.

Government-sponsored enterprises have continued to  tap global markets for funds. For example, the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) has recently issued $750 million in global bonds denominated in  Australian dollars, and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) announced that it plans to create an  overseas investment fund aimed at  making its mortgage-backed securities more attractive to  European institutional investors.

The Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae) was converted to a  private holding company (SLM Holding Corporation) in August. SLM is a  private corporation, not a  government-sponsored enterprise, and Sallie Mae has now become a  wholly owned subsidiary of  the holding company. Sallie Mae, as a  separate entity, will be dissolved by September 30, 2008.

Gross issuance of long-term municipal debt totaled $15 billion in  August, a  bit below its July and second-quarter pace (table). As in  July, total offerings were bolstered in  August by a  hefty volume of refunding issues. Yields on tax-exempt bonds fell in  August to about 30 basis points below levels of  last spring, and lately they have edged even lower, creating conditions that might stimulate additional refunding volume.

For the year, issuance of long-term municipal securities is up nearly 10 percent relative to the same period in 1996. Although refundings have been strong recently, much of the year-to-date rise reflects financing of  new capital outlays. Retirement of outstanding debt has declined substantially in 1997 because the bulge in advance-refunded obligations was largely worked down in 1996. In  dollar terms, net issuance of  long-term municipal debt has totaled $24 billion for the first eight months of this year, compared with only $1  billion for the same period of last year.

Bank Credit

Bank credit decelerated in August because of a  drop in security holdings (table). The weakness was mainly in  U.S. government securities. Total loan growth was up in  August, to a  7  percent annual pace. Lending to businesses was brisk and probably reflected borrowing to finance mergers and acquisitions and possibly some inventories. Loan growth in  early September appears to have slowed, especially for business loans.

Results for the August Survey of  Terms of Business Lending (STBL) showed spreads on loans larger than $1  million rising 10 basis points and those on loans of $1  million or less falling a bit (chart). Although average spreads have trended down since the end of the recession, there has been a  noticeable uptick of spreads on large loans since the middle of 1996. This movement is at odds with reports in the financial press of continued erosion in spreads

and with results from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicating spreads on  loans to large borrowers have narrowed over this period. Merger and acquisition activity, particularly involving less than mega-sized firms, has heated up lately, and because these mergers more often tend to be  bank-financed, such a shift toward these generally riskier loans might explain the increases in large-loan spreads reported in recent STBLs.

Meanwhile, real estate loans grew moderately in  August as home equity loans decelerated slightly. The growth of consumer loans at banks, even after adjusting for securitizations, was subdued at a meager 2  percent annual rate. The latest sluggishness in  consumer loans seems to reflect the overall reduction in demand for credit by households rather than tightening of  terms or further shifts toward home equity loans.

Data from the June 1997 Call Report (chart) indicate that charge-offs of consumer loans continued to climb, although other loan quality measures seem to  be improving. Business loan quality continues to  be good, with charge-offs low and delinquencies edging off further. Indeed, with little change in the provisioning for loan losses in recent quarters and a  continuation of solid net interest margins, the net income of  banks remained robust in  the second quarter at about 1-1/4 percent of average total assets.

Mutual Funds and Monetary Aggregates

Net sales of stock mutual funds are estimated to have slowed to $13-1/2 billion in  August, about half the exceptionally large volume recorded in  July and considerably below the second-quarter pace (table). Data for September suggest that net sales of stock funds have picked up, with growth funds leading the way, although the overall rate may not reach that recorded early in the summer. Net sales of  bond funds remained strong in August but appear to  have slowed in September.

Sizable declines in the stock market in mid-August raised questions among some analysts about the ability of  stock mutual funds to  withstand a  high volume of redemptions. Mutual funds can satisfy redemptions by selling off liquid assets or by tapping an established line of credit. Industry contacts report that lines of credit with banks--especially committed lines--have become more common in  recent years and are often arranged with a  lead bank and shared with several other banks through participation agreements. The typical size of a  committed line of credit is reported to  be on

As of  August, liquid assets of stock funds totaled $128 billion, or 5-1/2 percent of total assets--a liquidity ratio that, while low by  historical standards, still exceeds all previous net redemption experiences. In the October 1987 stock market crash, for example, net redemptions for the month amounted to 4  percent of total assets. Thus, in the aggregate, the industry appears to  have satisfactory access to liquidity, although individual funds could still experience some difficulties in  meeting their redemption requests.

The acceleration of  the monetary aggregates in  August reflects both a  surge in demand deposits, which tend to be  volatile, and shifts in  portfolio preferences of retail investors. The main story for M2  was the acceleration in growth in  retail money market mutual fund assets, which soared up at an  annual rate of 33 percent in August: the mid-August decline in stock prices and heightened volatility likely induced some investors to redirect money away from equity stock mutual funds. The non-M2 components of  M3 decelerated last month to  about half of July's torrid pace but growth remained robust at a 17 percent annual rate. As a  result, M3 grew faster than M2 and moved further above its annual range.

Canada. Healthy increases were also recorded for exports to Western Europe and developing countries in  Asia. Real imports grew at a  19 percent annual rate in  the first half of 1997, with increases spread among all major trade categories.

Oil Imports and Prices

The quantity of oil imported during 1997-Q2 was sharply higher than rates recorded during 1997-Q1 and also well above rates recorded last year. Imports in  July were 2  percent above 1997-Q2 rates. Imports were driven by  extremely strong consumption in the second quarter--up three percent from rates observed a  year ago--and a  building of oil stocks. Inventory accumulation induced the rise in imports in  July as oil consumption slowed from its strong secondquarter pace. Preliminary Department of  Energy statistics indicate that oil imports remained strong in  August due to high consumption demand.

The price of imported oil which peaked at $22 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 1996 fell to $18 per barrel by  the second quarter of 1997. Deliveries of  oil from Iraq and mild weather that lowered the demand for heating oil allowed firms to rebuild inventories from near historic lows and removed the upward pressure on prices that had characterized the market for the past year. Import prices declined slightly in  June and July and rose 2.2 percent in  August.

The price of spot WTI rose $0.30 per barrel in  August and averaged $19.93 per barrel, reflecting the delays in Iraq's shipments under U.N. supervision and the interruption of exports from Colombia due to repeated bombing of  the oil pipeline by terrorists. Prices have been moving in  the $19-20 per barrel range in September.

Prices of Non-oil Imports and Exports

Prices of  U.S. non-oil imports declined slightly in July and August after recording little change in the previous two months. This decline was primarily the result of lower computer prices, and to a  lesser degree, lower prices for all other major end-use categories with the exception of automotive products and industrial supplies. For July-August combined, the decline was 1.3 percent at an  annual rate, less than decreases recorded in  the previous two quarters.

Prices of exports increased slightly in  August, following three months of decline. This increase was primarily the result of higher agricultural export prices, and to a  lesser degree, higher prices for exported consumer goods. For July-August combined, the decline in prices of  exports was attributable to agricultural products. Prices of  nonagricultural goods rose marginally. U.S. Current Account through  1997-Q2

The U.S. current account deficit narrowed $4  billion SAAR in the second quarter. A  smaller deficit for net goods and services (a jump in  exports exceeded the growth of imports) was partly offset by larger net unilateral transfers and net investment income payments.

The increase in  net investment income payments was entirely in portfolio transactions as payments rose about twice as much as receipts. Net receipts from direct investment leveled off in the second quarter after declining in  the first quarter from the very strong fourth-quarter rate. Receipts from U.S. direct investment abroad and payments on foreign direct investment in the United

States both increased. Receipts from abroad increased strongly in manufacturing and other industries as a  result of robust foreign demand. Payments continued their strong rebound from the downturn in 1996-Q4; they now stand 29 percent higher than the level in the second quarter of 1996.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreigners continued to  acquire U.S. securities at a rapid pace in July. (See line 4  of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table.) Foreign purchases of  U.S. bonds (other than Treasuries) picked up a  bit from June and remain on a path to  match last year's record total (line 4b). Foreign purchases of  U.S. equities also picked up in  July (line 4c). Net equity purchases have been running at  a  very high rate throughout the year, with the total through July reaching $44 billion. This compares with net purchases of $12 billion for all of 1996. As with the other securities, foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries remained robust in  July and here again the trend for this year points to a total near last year's record.

Foreign official reserves in  the United States were little changed in  July (line 1), as a  modest reduction in G-10 reserves was offset by  an increase in reserve holdings of  Brazil and Mexico. Partial data for August from FRBNY indicate a $13 billion increase in official reserves in  the United States, with developing countries in  Asia accounting for most of  the increase. Even with this latest increase, foreign official inflows have been small since the first quarter of  this year, and the total through August is likely to be on the order of $30 billion. This is in sharp contrast to last year when official reserve accumulation averaged more than $30 billion per quarter. The slowing from last year is primarily attributable to developing countries in  Asia. This group increased official reserves in the United States significantly last year and reduced them this year. Several of  these countries drew down their dollar reserves in  efforts to support their currencies this year. In addition, China shifted a substantial portion of its dollar reserves to custodians outside of  the United States. Reserve accumulation by developed countries has been only slightly slower than last year, while developing countries in  Latin America have increased reserves in the United States at a rate roughly equal to that of last year.

U.S. net purchases of foreign securities remained strong in July, bringing the total for the first seven months of  this year to $57 billion (line 5). This is similar to last year's record-setting pace.

U.S. banks recorded large net outflows in July (line 3), reflecting in large part increased lending to  unaffiliated foreigners in  offshore financial centers. On  a  monthly-average basis, U.S. banks increased their net claims on foreign affiliates in  both July and August, with most of the increase attributable to foreign-based banks in  the United States. (See lines 1  and lb of the International Banking Data table.)

In  addition, recently released balance of payments data for the second quarter show significant outflows associated with transactions between banks outside the United States and U.S. nonbank residents. Credit extended to  U.S. nonbanks declined by several billion dollars in the second quarter and Eurodollar deposits of  U.S. nonbanks increased by $15 billion (lines 4  and 5  of the Banking table). These transactions account for roughly half of the "other" outflow shown on  line 9  of the Summary table.

The balance of  payments data also show a  continuation of robust direct investment capital flows both into and out of  the United States (lines 6  and 7  of the Summary table). Of  the direct investment outflows, roughly half was directed toward Western Europe. Foreign direct investment inflows into the United States were swelled by  substantial lending by  foreign companies (largely banks) to their U.S. finance affiliates.

The statistical discrepancy in the second quarter was $-17 billion--the same sign and slightly larger than that recorded in  the first quarter.

Foreign Exchange Markets

In  the period since the August FOMC meeting, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has exhibited divergent trends against the major currencies. Against the mark, the dollar has declined 2-3/4 percent, amid market commentary that the Bundesbank will tighten at least once more before the middle of  next year. In contrast, the dollar has risen 1-1/2 percent against the yen. on a continuing flow of data showing weak economic conditions in Japan.

may  also have weighed on the yen, eroding the price competitiveness of Japanese exports. Furthermore, the financial turmoil in the region may also have raised concerns about Japanese investments in those countries.

These differing patterns against the mark and yen correspond to similarly divergent movements in  the weighted average indices of the dollar's foreign exchange value against the 18 currencies of industrial and developing countries used in  our model forecasts. The index with multilateral (global) trade weights, used in  our forecasts of U.S. exports, has declined 1-3/4 percent on  balance since the August FOMC meeting. Over the same period, however, the index with U.S. import weights, used in our forecasts of  U.S. import prices, has declined only 1/4 percent. 1

The shift in  view on  Bundesbank tightening was supported by data released during the period that showed an acceleration in the pace of economic activity in Germany and a  creeping higher of consumer price inflation. Bundesbank President Tietmeyer noted publicly the possibility of  tightening before the decision on  EMU membership is made in  the spring of 1998. In addition, the Bundesbank altered its standing practice of  announcing a  week or two in  advance the rate at which its fixed-rate RP operations would be conducted. Instead, it  has chosen to  wait until immediately before its weekly RP operations to announce the terms on which they would be done, setting the stage for a  quick rate hike.

Movements in the prices of  three-month euromark futures contracts are consistent with an increase in expectations for a tightening by  the Bundesbank in  the first part of  next year, with rates up  about 10 basis points on the  March and June contracts for 1998. Expectations for a  hike in rates before the end of  this year, however, do not appear to  have changed significantly during the intermeeting period; the three-month interest rate is little changed at nearly 25 basis points above the Bundesbank's current RP rate.

The  yield on  the bellwether bond declined modestly--in line with the decline in  the comparable U.S. Treasury security yield.

EMU optimism continued to rise during the period, as favorable budget news in Italy helped to  diminish further any expectations that the start of  monetary union would be  delayed for some or all countries. In  addition, an announcement following the September meeting of  EU finance ministers and central bank governors seemed to inspire further confidence that monetary union would begin on  time. The  ministers and governors agreed that the bilateral conversion rates of the currencies taking part in the monetary union would be revealed at  the time the initial membership is announced next spring. European asset markets seemed to reflect that confidence. Long-term interest rates in Italy and Spain declined 54 and 41 basis points, respectively, during the period, narrowing their spreads with the comparable German rate by  roughly one-half. The French franc firmed about 1/4 percent against the mark, bringing it closer to its bilateral central rate against the mark--the exchange rate at which many believe the franc and mark will be locked upon entry into monetary union. The Irish pound, which has been trading well above its central parities with the other prospective EMU currencies, declined 2  percent against the  mark during the period.

The souring of  the outlook for economic activity in  Japan over the past 5  weeks has prompted a  decline of 16 basis points in  the Japanese government bond yield to a record low. Equity prices also slid further, with the Topix index declining 4-1/2 percent on balance over the period. The three-month interest rate in Japan was little changed, however, reflecting the unchanged prospects for an easing of  monetary policy.

The term structure of interest rates in  the United Kingdom has turned from flat to inverted during the intermeeting period, with the three-month rate up 6  basis points and the ten-year yield down 39. Signs that economic activity in  the United Kingdom is slowing and expectations the Bank of  England's Monetary Policy Committee may nonetheless tighten once more have contributed to  the yield curve movement.

In other currency developments, the dollar has depreciated more than 5-1/2 percent against the Norwegian krone and the Swedish krona and declined 3-1/2 percent against the Swiss franc. In large

part,  these currencies  have firmed  against the dollar  along with the mark and  other European currencies. The  Scandinavian currencies rose  further on the back of  above-trend growth in Norway and Sweden and  large  external  surpluses. In addition,  concerns  have arisen  in market commentary that political  changes will prompt a shift toward more expansionary fiscal  policies and  possibly tighter monetary policies,  although interest  rates  in these  countries  do  not  seem to be  registering such concerns. The Swiss  franc moved higher in reaction to  signs  that economic  activity in Switzerland is  picking up and  to  remarks  from Swiss National Bank President Meyer indicating that inflationary pressures may be building.

Several  southeast Asian currencies have continued to depreciate during the period. The Thai  baht and Malaysian ringgit have depreciated  another 9-1/2  percent  and 8-1/4 percent, respectively, against the  dollar, while the Philippine  peso slid another  7-3/4  percent. In  contrast, the  Indonesian  rupiah moved down only 1-7/8  percent,  reflecting a judgement by the market that the  response of  Indonesian authorities to  the fundamental economic imbalances that prompted these market  pressures has been more appropriate than that  in other  countries. Developments  in these countries are discussed more thoroughly elsewhere in  Section  IV.

The Desk did not  intervene in the  foreign exchange market during the intermeeting period.

Developments  in Foreign  Industrial Countries

Although the pattern of quarter-to-quarter growth has been disrupted by  special factors  in  some countries,  second-quarter GDP data confirm that  growth in the  first half of the year  solidified in most major industrial countries. Expansions  in Canada and the United Kingdom continued at healthy paces. Growth  in Germany, France,  and  Italy picked up,  indicating that modest  recoveries  are underway amid  signs that  domestic demand may be firming. Available third-quarter  data  suggest  that  the  stronger performance has extended  into the  current quarter  in all  five  countries. In contrast, an unexpectedly sharp contraction of Japanese domestic demand  in the  second  quarter, along with further weak data  from the

current quarter, has renewed worries about prospects in Japan for sustained recovery.

Inflation rates remain low, although concerns have heightened in some countries as the pace of recovery has quickened. In Germany, consumer-price inflation has continued to edge up and in August exceeded 2  percent for the first time in almost 2-1/2 years. However, rates of inflation are near 1-1/2 percent in other major industrial countries.

Individual country notes. In Japan, second-quarter GDP was surprisingly weak, falling 11.2 percent (SAAR) from its level in the first quarter. Consumption plunged 21 percent, reversing the surge of expenditures before the April hike in the consumption tax. Private investment also declined sharply, with plant and equipment investment falling after posting increases in the previous nine quarters. Public investment, however, rebounded somewhat from sharp

<!-- missing-text -->

drops registered in the previous two quarters, offsetting a  decline in government consumption. External demand made a  strong positive contribution to growth. Exports grew robustly, reflecting the competitive level of  the yen; imports contracted.

Economic indicators for the third quarter suggest some improvement, although domestic demand appears to have remained weak. In July, industrial production was up a  revised 1.7 percent, with the government projecting a  0.6 percent increase for the third

quarter as a  whole. However, July retail sales and household expenditures were essentially unchanged from second-quarter levels, and housing starts declined sharply. Labor-market conditions were little changed in July, with the unemployment rate and the offersto-applicants ratio remaining at  second-quarter levels. In contrast, machinery orders continue to be strong, with overall orders rising by 0.6 percent and private orders rising by 5.9 percent. Consumer-price inflation remains subdued.

Third-quarter external trade data suggest a  continuation of second-quarter trends. Exports remain strong, and there is little evidence of a  rebound in imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

- 3. Percent change from  previous year.

Real GDP in Germany advanced 4.1 percent (SAAR) in  the second quarter, up from 1.2 percent growth in the first quarter, owing to a surge in  exports. Domestic demand contributed little to growth, as a  rebound in private consumption expenditure from its laggard firstquarter pace and modest growth in government and investment spending were largely offset by a  drawdown in inventories. (Inventories are a  residual in  the national income accounts and can  be subject to substantial revision.) Investment on  machinery and equipment, which had registered respectable growth rates in  the fourth quarter of 1996 and the first quarter of  this year, advanced at  a  sluggish

pace. Exports, aided by  the decline in the  mark, rose more than 15 percent at an  annual rate in  the second quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

Data for the current quarter suggest that the expansion has continued. Industrial production and manufacturing orders continued to increase strongly, and the IFO business climate survey, an indicator of  current and expected conditions in industry, rose significantly further. Conditions in the labor market remain stagnant, however, with the all-German unemployment rate at 11.6 percent in  August. The rise in  unemployment reflects to some extent the termination of government subsidized work programs and weakness in the construction sector in  the eastern states, where the unemployment rate rose to 18.8 percent in  August. Inflation at the consumer level has risen in recent months, registering 2.1 percent in  all-Germany over the year to  August and a  preliminary 1.8 percent in  the western states over the year to September. This acceleration in prices owes in part to rising import prices. An additional factor pushing up  prices at  the consumer level has been a  change in the share of  medical prescription costs paid by  consumers, which increased in  July and will affect the year/year measure of inflation until July 1998.

In  France, real GDP rose 4  percent (SAAR) in the second quarter, after posting a  subdued 1  percent increase in the first quarter. Net exports and inventories underpinned the robust secondquarter expansion. Consumption declined, owing to continued effects

<!-- missing-text -->

from last-year's government-sponsored car-purchase incentive scheme and a  late start to  the summer sales season. The slight increase in investment reflected uncertainty about the outcome of the recent parliamentary elections and the outlook for a  sustained expansion in final domestic demand. Favorable calendar effects accounted for about 1  percentage point of the  measured GDP growth.

Net exports and consumption are expected to support continued expansion in the current quarter. Consumption of  manufactured products rose about 3  percent in July-August relative to the second quarter. The rebound in consumer spending, which was anticipated, reflects in part the 4-percent hike in  the minimum wage and the rise in  back-to-school allowances. Business confidence in  July remained firm; foreign demand continued to  boost production expectations, and inventories were judged be about normal. At just under its post-war high, unemployment edged down slightly in  July. Consumer-price inflation accelerated in  August owing to  increased energy, food, and government-controlled prices. However, inflation in  manufactured goods and services remained subdued.

On September 24, the French government presented its 1998 budget package to the National Assembly. The package is designed to reduce the general government deficit to  3  percent of GDP in 1998 from a  targeted 3-1/4 percent in 1997. The central government deficit is projected to decline 1/4 percentage point of GDP to

3.1 percent of GDP. The social security budget, to  be presented on October 8, is projected to register a  small deficit in 1998, while local authorities/other administrations accounts should continue to record a  surplus. The budget is based on  an official forecast of 3  percent growth in real GDP growth. The 1998 budget does not include "exceptional" transfers such as transfer of  France Telecom pension assets that was included in this year's budget.

Real GDP in  the United Kingdom expanded 4  percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. Consumption expenditures and fixed investment were especially strong. Net exports subtracted from growth, as imports grew more rapidly than exports.

<!-- missing-text -->

Recent indicators suggest that economic activity continued to expand at  a  robust pace in the third quarter, although more forwardlooking indicators point to a  slowing in  the pace of activity ahead. Industrial production increased further in  July, reflecting strong domestic demand. According to the Purchasing Managers Survey, manufacturing industries expanded further in  August, but the rate of growth slowed sharply, and new  export orders declined for the second consecutive month. Retail sales for July and August were up 1.7 percent from the average volume in  the second quarter. Household spending has been boosted in recent months by "windfall gains" of shares that consumers have received as several building societies have converted into or merged with commercial banks. Current estimates suggest that about 16.5 percent of  the expected windfall

gains in 1997 will be  spent this year, amounting to about 1  percent of  total consumer spending.

Retail prices excluding mortgage interest payments rose 2.8 percent over the year to  August, somewhat above the government's inflation target of 2-1/2 percent for underlying inflation. However, much of  the recent change in inflation reflects special factors, such as the petrol tax imposed in  the July budget. Annual nominal earnings growth remains moderate. When earnings are adjusted for the impact of  bonuses, the rate of growth in  underlying earnings has been largely unchanged at slightly under 4-1/2 percent since early this year. The official claimant unemployment rate dropped further in  August to 5.3 percent, the lowest rate since August 1980. The unemployment rate derived from the Labor Force Survey for the March-May period was 7.2 percent, its lowest reading since the Spring 1990 survey.

In Italy, real GDP rose a  provisional 6  percent (SAAR) in the second quarter. Final figures and details on  the composition of second-quarter growth will be  available at the end of September. The accelerated pace of growth in  the second quarter is attributable in part to a  greater number of  working days than in  the first quarter, to  higher net exports, and to strong industrial production.

The government's highly successful tax incentive scheme continued to provide stimulus to Italian auto manufacturing.

Third-quarter indicators are limited, but available data suggest further expansion. In  July, new car registrations leapt for the sixth consecutive month, with growth in  auto sales averaging close to 40 percent higher than in  July 1996. Consumer confidence, which rose significantly in the first quarter and remained relatively flat in the second quarter, rose in July and August.

<!-- missing-text -->

Italian inflation remains at record low levels. In  September, the consumer price index was up  a  preliminary 1.4 percent on  a  12month basis. Although short-term price movements suggest that the deceleration in inflation has come to an end, a  significant pick-up in CPI inflation is not likely in  the near term.

The rift on  welfare reform between the center-left coalition and the Communists remains wide. As part of  his 1998 budget, Prime Minister Prodi hopes to include cuts in  health care spending and pensions, which the Communists adamantly oppose. The 1998 budget proposal, which will outline the extent of  intended reforms, will be presented to the parliament by  the end of September. Under Italian law, the parliament is required to approve the budget by  the end of December.

The Canadian economy expanded strongly in the second quarter, as real GDP rose 4.9 percent (SAAR). Growth was boosted by  a  rise in domestic demand of  nearly 7-1/2 percent, while strong growth in imports exerted some drag on  the economy. Consumption continued to grow at a  rapid pace, despite the very low level of  the savings rate; the ratio of  personal savings to disposable income is now below 1  percent.

<!-- missing-text -->

Preliminary indicators for the third quarter point to continued expansion. Employment, which rose substantially in the second quarter, edged up in  July and expanded more rapidly in August. Despite the increase, the unemployment rate remained at 9 percent in  August, as rapid labor force growth offset greater demand for labor. Consumer prices rose 1.8 percent over the year to August, up  a  bit from the second-quarter average.

Economic Situation in  Other Countries

In the major Latin American and Asian countries growth has remained steady in recent months, although there is some evidence of a  slight slowdown in  Taiwan. Inflation rates in  these countries have been low to  moderate with no general signs of  an increase. External balances in  most Latin American countries and Taiwan have deteriorated. By  contrast, in  Korea the trade deficit has decreased and in  China the trade surplus has increased.

Financial markets have remained volatile in  many of the ASEAN countries and their currencies have been depreciating against the dollar. Policy responses to the currency turmoil in these countries have been varied.

Individual country notes. On  August 20, the IMF approved a stand-by credit for Thailand, authorizing drawings of  up  to about $4  billion over the next three years to support the government's economic program. The stand-by credit is equivalent to  505 percent of  Thailand's quota. Thailand has also received pledges of financial support totaling $13.2 billion from other Asian countries, Australia, and other multilateral agencies. [Pledges were received from Japan ($4 billion), Australia, China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore ($1 billion each), Indonesia, Korea, and Brunei ($0.5 billion each), the World Bank ($1.5 billion), and Asian Development Bank ($1.2 billion).]

As part of  the improved public disclosure of  key economic information envisaged under the IMF program, Bank of  Thailand (BOT) Governor Chaiyawat announced that the bank's foreign exchange obligations arising from forward contracts over the next 12 months amounted to $23.4 billion. On September 15, the BOT stated that reserves stood at $25.9 billion as of  August 29.

The Thai government has not developed a  clear strategy for restructuring the 58 suspended finance companies. Restrictions have been placed on  foreign ownership. Suspended finance companies are continuing to operate and the period for determining the disposition of  these companies has been lengthened. Debate in Parliamenover a new constitution is also standing in  the way of  progress on financial sector reform.

Progress toward adjustment in  other ASEAN countries has been mixed. In the Philippines, the central bank appears to  be  adhering more closely to its stated intent of letting the peso seek its value freely by  refraining from direct intervention. In Malaysia, the Prime Minister has made several pronouncements that have whipsawed the financial markets. The government also announced measures to keep current account deficits in check by  tightening its fiscal policy through the postponement of infrastructure projects and by imposing some restrictions on capital goods imports. In Indonesia, the government has announced steps to restructure the banking sector by  promoting mergers or acquisitions of ailing banks with healthy ones, and promising to liquidate banks where needed. Other announced measures included limits on forward contracts with foreign counterparties, taxes on  some imported goods, and elimination of the limit on foreign acquisition of  shares for future initial public offerings.

The financial markets of  many ASEAN members have remained volatile. From July 1  to September 23, the exchange rates of  ASEAN members have depreciated against the dollar by  a  little over 5  percent in Singapore, over 50  percent in  Thailand, about 20 percent in Indonesia and Malaysia, and over 25 percent in the Philippines. These depreciations have occurred despite substantial increases in overnight interest rates and the imposition of capital controls, although in  Malaysia and the Philippines, interest rates appear to be  back to their July 1  levels.

The health of  the financial sector in Korea continues to be a source of concern. On September 5, the Bank of  Korea (BOK) decided to provide $1.1 billion in special loans to  Korea First Bank--the second-largest of six  major city banks--and a  similar amount to financially troubled merchant banks to ease their liquidity problems. The BOK also announced on September 5  that foreign exchange reserves fell to $31.1 billion at  the end of  August from $33.7 billion in July. The slide in reserves is reportedly due to BOK's provision of  foreign currency-denominated loans to domestic financial institutions to ease the difficulties they have been facing in  borrowing overseas.

There has been some pressure on  the Korean won in the wake of the currency crises in  ASEAN countries and the bankruptcy of  the

conglomerates. The won depreciated by  nearly 2-1/2 percent between July 1  and September 23 and has moved down over 8  percent since the start of  the year. The stock market has declined by  about 8  percent since July 1. Overnight interest rates stood at nearly 13-1/2 percent on September 23, about 200 basis points above their July 1 level, whereas the yield on three-year corporate bonds, a  benchmark long-term interest rate, has edged up  by  about 75 basis points.

<!-- missing-text -->

Korea's trade deficit in July was $0.3 billion, compared with $1.8 billion in the same month last year; the current account deficit was $1 billion, compared with $2.3 billion a  year ago. Industrial production grew by  about 8  percent from year-earlier levels. Inflation remained moderate in  August.

In Taiwan, second-quarter real GDP registered a sizeable increase over its year-earlier level, but the staff estimates that growth at a  seasonally adjusted annual rate was only 4.2 percent in the second quarter, the slowest rate since 1991. This weakness appears to reflect in  part the temporary effects of bad weather and an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in  hogs. Strong import growth contributed to a  narrowing of  Taiwan's trade surplus in the first eight months of 1997, compared with the comparable period last year. Exports rose 5  percent over this period, while imports rose 10 percent. Foreign-exchange reserves fell about $1 billion in  July from June, though they are still up about $1 billion from the beginning of 1997.

<!-- missing-text -->

In  China,growth remained steady, inflation continued to moderate, and the trade surplus continued to grow in  the first eight months of 1997. During this period, surging exports led to a  trade surplus of $25 billion, compared with a  surplus of $5  billion in  the year-earlier period. The value of  exports rose 24 percent while the value of imports rose 2  percent from the year-earlier period.

International reserves have risen steadily. In  July 1997, reserves reached $128 billion, up $21 billion for the year.

Mexico's economy continued to show strength in the second quarter, with both real GDP and industrial production rising to  well above their year-earlier levels. The increase in second-quarter GDP was led by  exports and fixed investment, as in  prior quarters, but the rate of recovery of  private consumption picked up as well. To a certain extent, the second-quarter data overstate the improvement in economic activity, as there were more working days than usual in  the second quarter of this year because Easter Week fell early. However, the underlying movement in  the economy remains positive, as evidenced by  the continued high growth of  industrial production in July, the fall in  the unemployment rate over the past few  months, and the sustained rapid expansion of imports. The trade deficit was

$18 million in  July. This marks the first time since January 1995 that the trade balance moved into deficit and reflects the real appreciation of the peso as well as rising domestic spending. The current account deficit expanded strongly in the second quarter as well. Monthly consumer price inflation remained just below 1 percent for the fourth consecutive month in  August, reflecting both seasonal factors and the continued stability of the peso.

On September 22 the Bank of  Mexico announced that, in a departure from recent policy, when conditions were appropriate, it would provide sufficient liquidity to  the money market to  move the reserve accounts of commercial banks with the Bank of Mexico into surplus. The move was prompted by  concerns that a  uniformly tight monetary policy might keep interest rates excessively high at times, thereby encouraging capital inflows, a  real appreciation of  the peso, and a  widening of  external imbalances. The Bank indicated that it  would not necessarily loosen monetary conditions immediately, but that it would do  so in  the event that interest rates became inconsistent with the exchange rate, that inflation fell more quickly than anticipated, that the exchange rate appreciated unsustainably, or that interest rates increased due to disorderly money market conditions.

In  Argentina, growth in economic activity continues to  be strong. Led by  investment, real GDP in the second quarter registered another substantial year-over-year gain, dispelling some earlier anticipation that the pace of growth might slow somewhat.

Despite high growth, inflation was very low, and the 12-month inflation rate remained under 1  percent. The expansion has led to strong growth in imports, especially those of capital goods. With exports cooling off, the trade deficit through July this year has widened by roughly $1.6 billion, compared with the same period last year.

The two leading opposition parties have formed an alliance and are likely to  provide a  strong challenge to the Peronists in upcoming congressional elections in October. The opposition is focusing on voter concerns about unemployment and corruption, creating pressures for the government to ease fiscal austerity just before the elections.

The long-awaited Brady debt buyback by  Argentina occurred in September. The Argentine government issued $2.25 billion worth of a 30-year global bond at  a  spread of 305 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries and retired $3  billion of  Brady debt. The net present value savings were $242 million.

In Brazil, real GDP grew at  an annual rate of 13.9 percent in the second quarter, after declining in  the first quarter. Growth was led by strong performance in  the agricultural and industrial sectors. Weak consumer demand in recent weeks and apparently unsold inventories put downward pressures on  prices. The CPI was nearly unchanged in August and the 12-month inflation rate was 4.3 percent, the lowest in 40 years.

The currency turmoil in Southeast Asia has renewed concerns about Brazil's external balance. The cumulative trade deficit through August stood at  nearly $6  billion, compared with a  deficit of $5.5 billion for 1996 as a  whole, and the real exchange rate is roughly 25 percent higher than it was three years ago. Concern about the Brazilian outlook has contributed to the 20 percent fall in  the Bovespa stock price index since early July. Over a  three-day period in late August, the central bank intervened to counter downward pressures on  the real. High domestic interest rates have also helped defend the real, but short-term rates have fallen slightly in recent weeks; the rate on one-month CDs was recently 20.5 percent, down from 22 percent in early August. Despite pressures against the real, on  balance, international reserves have risen from $60 billion at  the end of July to $62 billion at the end of  August. Net capital flows have been boosted by  foreign purchases of recently privatized firms.

The government has also responded to concerns about the possibility of  a  devaluation by  issuing more dollar-indexed bonds. Issuing dollar-indexed bonds serves as a  signal of  the government's determination not to devalue by  making it  more costly should it  do so. Dollar-indexed bonds have been issued regularly by  the Treasury, and since early 1997, the central bank has issued these also. The stock of  dollar-indexed debt has risen from about $6 billion at the end of 1995 to  an estimated $19 billion in  midSeptember 1997. Recently, the  maturity of  these bonds has predominantly been two to three years. The latest issue on

September 17 is a  two-year bond, which was priced at about 430 basis points above comparable U.S. Treasuries.

In  Venezuela, there is evidence of  a  pick-up in economic activity. While estimates of GDP growth differ, according to  the central bank, whose data are considered the most accurate, the economy grew by  4  percent in  the first half of  this year, with the non-oil sector growing by  2  percent and the oil sector growing by roughly 9  percent. As expected, inflation has picked up, with the August increase reflecting the highest monthly rise in  consumer prices since October 1996. The increase in  economic activity has widened the non-oil trade deficit considerably, but strong oil exports have kept the cumulative trade surplus high.

In September, Venezuela issued some $4 billion of 30-year global bonds at a spread of 325 basis points over comparable U.S. Treasuries. The issue was in  connection with a  debt swap and Venezuela retired $4.4 billion in Brady bonds, with net present value savings estimated at $385 million.

In Russia, recent data continue to present a  relatively favorable picture. After years of decline, output appears to  be increasing slightly this year. Official figures show real GDP in August up slightly from its year-earlier level, and industrial production showed an  even stronger gain. In  August, the 12-month CPI inflation rate remained unchanged at slightly below 15 percent. The ruble-dollar exchange rate has remained well within the corridor set by  the central bank.

The pace of  privatization has accelerated recently, and the competitiveness of  these transactions has increased. The sale of  a

minority share in Svyazinvest, the Russian telecommunications conglomerate, to the highest bidder represented an  important break with earlier, less transparent share transfers. Plans have been announced to  accelerate privatization further next year with the goal of  privatizing 37 firms, including oil companies Rosneft and Lukoil, as well as the oil pipeline company, Transneft.

On September 17, Russia signed an agreement to join the Paris Club of creditor countries, and also indicated that it plans to close a  debt-rescheduling deal with its commercial creditors soon.
