Nevertheless,  veral t s in c p h se major  central  anks  have  raised  hort-term tes  ince he ebruary OMC b s ra s t F F meeting,  oughly atching  the ncrease  n he nited  States,   an  effort r m i i t U in to contain  nflationary  essures.  he aggregate  oreign  xchange  value f he i pr T f e o t dollar  as  changed  little  nce  he ebruary OMC h si t F F meeting,  ith  a  small mount w a of  appreciation  lative  he  industrial  untry urrencies ughly ffsetting re tot co c ro o some depreciation rsus he urrencies  f ur  other  mportant  rading  artners. ve t c o o i t p

The negative c to i d

contribution  of  real net exports to  GDP growth is thus anticipated to shrink to zero by the end of 2001.

We have raised our forecast for oil prices in this Greenbook  in response to both higher-than-expected  spot prices and a dicier outlook for OPEC production. However,  the effect of the higher projected oil prices  on the outlook for foreign growth is largely outweighed by indications that near-term  momentum continues to exceed our prior expectations.  As a result, our forecast for foreign  economic activity is actually a bit higher than that in the January Greenbook.

Recent Developments

International financial markets. Since the February FOMC meeting, the nominal exchange  value of the dollar has appreciated  about 1/2 percent, on balance,  in terms of the major currencies  index. The largest  appreciation  has come against the British pound, with  smaller gains registered against the euro and the Canadian  dollar.  In contrast, the dollar has dropped against the yen, despite intervention  by Japanese  authorities late in the period to weaken their currency.  The dollar has also declined against the currencies  of other important trading partners, particularly the Mexican peso.

A number of foreign central banks raised policy rates immediately after the February FOMC meeting.  All of the major industrial  country central banks with the exception of the Bank of Japan moved to tighten,  and several developing country central banks also followed the U.S. rate hike.  Nevertheless,  ten-year government bond yields in continental  Europe have edged lower  and have fallen significantly in both Canada and the United Kingdom since the February FOMC meeting.  Meanwhile,  favorable reviews by rating agencies led to a substantial decline in bond yields for Mexico and Brazil.  A surge in telecommunications stocks lifted continental European equity prices over the past month.  In contrast, Japanese bond and stock prices have declined  a bit.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent information has highlighted the continued dichotomy between the resurgent Canadian  and European  economies and the sputtering Japanese economy.  Although recent employment data suggest that Canadian growth has slowed to a more sustainable pace after a gain of nearly 5 percent last year, the rate  of growth  remains well above that of estimated potential. In the euro  area, recent confidence measures  suggest that activity continues to expand at a robust pace this year.  The latest GDP data also indicate

that  he xpansion as  become more broadly  ased, ith  growth  in ermany and t e h b w G Italy  icking p  markedly  since  he iddle  of ast  ear.  In  the nited ingdom, p u t m l y U K domestic  demand growth  shows  little  gn f lackening, though   substantial si o s al a appreciation  he  pound against  he uro  over he ast ear as  contributed    a oft t e t p y h to recent  ecline  n xports. d i e
