beginning of the intermeeting  period.  The dollar changed little,  on balance, relative  to the currencies  of our other important  trading partners.

Money-market interest rates eased a bit in most foreign industrial  economies with the peaceful passage of the century date change,  although they rose slightly in the United Kingdom in response to a 25-basis  point increase in the Bank  of England's policy rate.  Expectations  that continued robust growth would lead to further monetary  tightening caused  long-term bond yields to back up significantly  in all major industrial countries except Japan, where they have declined  slightly over the intermeeting  period.  Notwithstanding higher  longterm interest rates, most equity price indexes have picked up as well.  In emerging market economies, financial conditions  have remained stable;  while spreads  on sovereign bonds have been mixed, equity prices  generally registered strong gains.

. The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System  or the Treasury.

Economic  activity abroad. Recent indicators point to continued robust expansion into the fourth quarter for most foreign industrial economies. Strong data on industrial  production,  new orders,  and economic  sentiment suggest that the pace of growth in the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada remained brisk.  In Japan,  the economy  appears to have  expanded  a bit after contracting in the third quarter, but household demand remains  weak.  Headline  measures  of inflation have continued to move upward in most industrial countries in response to higher oil prices,  although core inflation has  generally remained  subdued; indeed, inflation  rates remain below the target ceilings established  by the central banks of the euro area, the United Kingdom, and Canada.  In Japan, though, consumer prices continue to trend somewhat lower and wholesale  prices are falling more substantially.

Economic activity in the developing economies appears to have continued to pick up in recent months,  although the pace of recovery  has varied widely.  In Latin America, Mexican  output surged further in the third quarter, largely  driven by the strong U.S. economy, while Argentina's recovery became more firmly established. However, Brazilian growth  has slowed somewhat, and Venezuela's economy is only beginning to bottom out of its steep recession. Recent data suggest that Korea  maintained its remarkable pace of expansion into the fourth quarter, while growth in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan also appears  to have been brisk;  the growth picture in the ASEAN economies has been more mixed. Inflation  remains relatively  subdued in the developing  economies,  although the
