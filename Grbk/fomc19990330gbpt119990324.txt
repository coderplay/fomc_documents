SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

Domestic Developments

The economy has  continued o  exhibit  emarkable ynamism, generating  efty t r d h gains  in  employment and  income. We  have  tacked  about  3/4  percentage  oint p onto  our  previous orecast  f irst-quarter  l f o f rea GDP growth,  and the  evident momentum of  domestic emand has  led  us  to  elevate  ur  projection r d o fo output  growth  over  the  near erm  a  bit s  well. t a

Until he  last  eek,  it  ooked  like e would have  to  carry hose pward t w l w t u revisions  urther  nto he  projection riod,  s  the  stock arket  was f i t pe a m threatening ce again  to  shoot ell  above  the  path  anticipated    our on w in previous orecast.  ut while  that  hreat  ertainly nnot e said o  have f B t c ca b t evaporated,  he all-off    share  prices  ince he ow  Industrials  uched  the t f in s t D to 10,000  level  as  given  us  at east    temporary eprieve.    number of  factors h l a r A reportedly  ave  played  a  role n  the arket's  esitation,   one of  them  is h i m h but the  sense hat aluations e  stretched  nd  that  arnings  xpectations ve t v ar a e e ha been  excessively  ptimistic.  his, f  course,  as  been  the asic remise  of o T o h b p our  stock arket  view. m

Absent  a substantial  rther  dvance  in  share rices,  do not  see  the  driver fu a p we that an sustain  he  kind  of rowth  of  domestic emand that  e have c t g d w observed  over  the  past ew years.  Thus,  while  we have  raised  ur  forecast f o of real DP  growth  this  ear o  3 percent  n  reflection  he  stronger  irst-half G y t i oft f picture,  continue o  foresee   substantial  ackening  n  the  pace  of we t a sl i expansion  in  2000--to bout -1/4 ercent. a 2 p

These growth  rates,  oming on top  of he  upside  surprise  f he  fourth c t o t quarter,  mply  that he  level f conomic activity  igher hroughout 999 i t o e ish t 1 and 2000 than  in  the  last  reenbook. All  else qual,  his  ight  have  led  us G e t m to  elevate  ur  inflation  recast    little.  t,  all lse as  not  been  equal.  For o fo a Bu e h one thing,  he  recent  trong erformance f  productivity  s  prompted  a  slight t s p o ha change  in  our  projection  f utput er  hour  that as  about  offset  he  effect  f o o p h t o the  higher DP  path  on the  unemployment rate. n  addition, cent  ews on G I re n wages and consumer  prices  as  been  even  more favorable  han  we had h t anticipated,  d  the  appreciation   the  dollar  n foreign  xchange  markets an of o e should  put  a  damper on  non-oil mport rices. oreover,  an apparent i p M widening  of  profit  argins  over  the  past ouple f  quarters  uggests  hat m c o s t firms ave a  bit ore of  a  cushion o  absorb  any  cost ncreases  n  the  coming h m t i i months. Under the  circumstances, e  outlook or nflation    the  near  term th f i in actually  ooks  a  tad ore favorable  han  it id  earlier. l m t d

That said,  y the atter rt f  the  this  ear  and  in  2000,  the  rebound  in  oil b l pa o y prices nd pressures  n labor upplies  re  likely  o  induce  an appreciable a o s a t pickup  in  inflation.  th the obless  ate dging  lower  in  the  next  several Wi j r e months and  remaining  at  or  below  the  current  evel ntil  ate  n  the  projection l u l i

period,  e expect  to  see  core  CPI inflation  ving up  just  ver  2 percent  n w mo o i the  latest elve  months to  2-1/2 ercent n  2000.  Owing  to  the  rebound  in tw p i oil  prices, e  overall  PI accelerates om about  1-1/2  percent  o  2-1/2 th C fr t percent. oreover,  the  trend oward  higher nflation uld be  expected o M t i wo t persist  nto 001. i 2

Key  Background  Factors

Although  that  rospective  eterioration    the  inflation end ould suggest p d of tr w that aintenance  of  the  present  ominal  federal  unds ate ill ltimately m n f r w u be destabilizing, have retained  or  the  time  being  the  assumption hat  t ill we f t i w remain  close o  4-3/4 ercent t  least  ell  into ext  year.  This  is ot  greatly t p a w n n at  odds  with  what  appears o  be the  prevailing pectation   the  fixedt ex in income markets:  Forward  rates how no evidence f  any anticipation    a s o of Fed move this  ear  and  indicate at arket  participants  e  looking or nly y th m ar f o a slight  irming n  2000. Our forecast  as  long-term  ates dging  up a  little f i h r e over  the  coming year, ith  spreads f ields  n corporate  onds  over  those w o y o b on Treasuries  ot  narrowing  much  more in  an environment f eaker n o w economic growth  and  rising  redit  isk. c r

The backup of  interest  tes n  recent  onths obviously  as  some negative ra i m h implications r  spending,  ut  we  see  more considerable nancial straint fo b fi re on aggregate  emand growth  being  exerted ver  the  forecast  eriod y a  leveling d o p b out  in  share rices. bviously,  he  market  will  continue  o  fluctuate,  t  it s p O t t bu i our  baseline  rojection at  t ill luctuate nerally  round  the  average  level p th i w f ge a of  the  current  uarter--roughly  ,500  on the ilshire 000--rather an q 11 W 5 th extending he  steep ull ptrend  or  falling   a  sharply ower  level nd t b u to l a staying  here. hose are, owever,  definite sks  n  the  outlook,  isks  hat  e t T h ri i r t w address hrough odel-based  simulations  ater.  he upside  risk  an  be seen t m l T c as  arising  imply  out  of he  internal mentum s t mo of  a  market  that  as h repeatedly  hown it an slough  off ad  news--and  in  which investors,  bued s c b im with  the otion hat  igh  returns  re  guaranteed  o  those ho  stay n  for he n t h a t w i t long  haul, ee  any dip  as  a  buying  opportunity.  hat  sentiment ay be s T m especially fficult    overcome as  long  as  monetary  policy s xpected o di to i e t remain  "friendly"   the  market, s  commentators  often ut  it. he downside to a p T risk s  that,  f ur  projection   declining  rofits oves  correct, vestors ll i i o of p pr in wi at  some point sk  where the  "beef"  s  in  the  stocks or hich they  have  been a i f w paying  extraordinary ice-earnings  ltiples. pr mu

Our forecast  ay  constitute  somewhat awkward middle  ground, ut  we m a b believe t epresents    reasonable  alancing  f  the  risks  n  the  stock arket i r a b o i m outlook.

The dollar  as  appreciated  uring he  intermeeting riod gainst  he  euro  and h d t pe a t especially e  yen.

Foreign  GDP  growth  prospects  ow  look  a  bit ess loomy. Overall oreign n l g f economic growth,  which  was about  1/2  percent ast  ear, s xpected o  rise  o l y i e t t 2-1/2 ercent n  2000. We  still pect  that razil's nancial oubles  ill p i ex B fi tr w lead  to  a  significant  cession  n  that  ountry,  ut  the  financial illovers re i c b sp to other ountries  hus  far ave  been  considerably  ess evere han  we had c t h l s t anticipated  rlier.  ost important  or he  United  States, xico has  been ea M f t Me relatively  affected; deed, n  contrast   our  January  projection   declining un in i o of GDP  this ear,  e now expect hat exico will chieve  modest  growth  both y w t M a this  ear  and  next.  In  Canada, DP y G growth  in  the  final  uarter  f ast  ear q o l y came in  above  our  expectations--no  ubt  owing in  part o  the  strong  .S. do t U economy--and  we have  revised p our  growth  projection r  this  ear  as  well. u fo y For  areas utside f  the  Americas, e have made only  small  changes  to  our o o w growth  forecasts, --for tter  r  worse--developments  eem to  have  been as be o s tracking  retty  losely  o  our  expectations. p c t

The same might  be said or il rices,  hich,  as  predicted, ve  turned p f o p w ha u sharply,  ith  the  spot rice f TI  crude  now back  above $15  per arrel. w p o W b Key to  the  outlook rom  here  is  the  degree  to  which the  oil-exporting f countries  an  implement  the  production  uts hey  agreed  upon  in  recent  ays. c c t d We  are  assuming  that,  lthough here ill e some cheating  n the  agreement, a t w b o WTI  spot  prices  ill rend pward,  reaching  17  per  barrel  y the  end of w t u $ b 2000--about .50 to  $1  above  the  path  in  the ast  reenbook. $ l G

We  have  not  changed  our  basic iscal  olicy ssumptions,  nd policy  s f p a a i assumed to  remain  essentially  utral  n  terms  of  impetus o  demand. ne i t However, given  the  stronger  conomy  and some technical  djustments  o  our e a t revenue  forecast, r  projection  ow calls  or nified  udget  surpluses  f ou n f u b o about  $122 billion   FY1999  and $169 billion   FY2000--both  roughly in in $25 billion  igher han  in  our  last  rojection. h t p

Recent Developments  and Outlook for  the  Current  Quarter

With almost  uniformly trong ncoming  data  on domestic  spending, e now s i w project  hat eal DP  will ise  t  an annual  rate f  about  3-1/2 ercent n  the t r G r a o p i current  uarter. his  is  well  below the  6 percent  ace  of  the  fourth  uarter, q T p q which was boosted  substantially a post-strike  bound  in  motor  vehicle b re production. roduction  orker  hours  have  risen  ppreciably  hus ar n  1999 P w a t f i on the  strength  f  increases  n  private  ayrolls  veraging ore than  200,000 o i p a m per  month,  and  low initial  aims or nemployment insurance  enefits cl f u b suggest hat iring  as  remained  brisk  n  March. t h h i

Private omestic  final  urchases  ave  been  tremendously trong gain  this d p h s a quarter,  aced  by  household  demands.  We  now think hat onsumption p t c expenditures  ill ise t  a  6 percent nnual  rate--well  ove  last  ear's  ace. w r a a ab y p Retail ales oared  in  January  and  February, nd service  utlays ere  up s s a o w sharply n  January.

We  expect  net  exports  o  more than  reverse  heir  urprising urth-quarter t t s fo bulge.  Although  we have  only  a few hard  data  to  go on,  the  widening  of he t trade eficit  n  January  obviously upports  his  xpectation.  y our d i s t e B reckoning,  xports lone ight  slice  early  1  percentage oint rom  final  ales e a m n p f s this uarter,  fter  aving  contributed  percentage  oints  n  the  fourth uarter. q a h 2 p i q This  drag  is empered  a bit y  a projected  lowdown in  import rowth, hich t b s g w also  was unusually  igh  late ast  ear. h l y

We  suspect hat he  boom  in  final  ales ay have  surprised  usinesses  n t t s m b i a number of  sectors.  s a result, ventory  ccumulation  ay  be  on  the  slim A in a m side  in  the  current  uarter.  he January ook-value ata, ur  only  semi-firm q T b d o evidence  at he  moment, show that tocks t  manufacturing  nd non-auto t s a a trade stablishments  re essentially  at.  ertainly, e  surprising lume of e we fl C th vo motor  vehicle ales  ught  to  result  n  only  a  small  inventory  uild n hat s o i b i t area.

On the age side,  verage p t p y w a hourly arnings ncreases  ave  been more moderate  in  recent onths. e i h m

The Outlook for  Economic  Activity  eyond  the  Current  Quarter B Given the  continued tunning erformance  of  the  economy,  there s  strong s p i a temptation  erely  to  predict  ore of he  same--4  percent eal DP  growth m m t r G and  sustained  ow inflation.  wever, while  we have  made some notable l Ho adjustments  n  our  forecast   light  f ecent evelopments,  e believe  t i in o r d w i sensible  o  stick  ith  the  basic lements f ur  previous,  ess  pbeat  story. t w e o o l u As noted  earlier,  e  recent esitation    the  stock arket  may be  some th h of m tentative nfirmation  f  our  thinking  hat aluation  ill rovide ome co o t v w p s restraint   equity rices. nd without  continuation   huge increases  n on p A a of i share  prices,  emand should ise  ore moderately--especially  en  that  he d r m giv t stocks f  consumer durables,  ouses, nd  business quipment  already o h a e increasing  apidly  t  current  evels  f xpenditure.  n the  supply  side, r a l o e O despite  rounds  for ome greater  ptimism  about  productivity  ends, g s o tr it appears  unlikely  hat  he  labor arket  can accommodate continued   percent t t m 4 GDP  growth  without he  emergence  of ore bottlenecks  nd increasing  ost t m a c pressures.

Of course,   bigger 2K  impetus his  ear  would mean a  bigger rag  on  the a Y t y d other ide f  January  1, 000. But  the  major  element  in  our  story f  further s o 2 o moderation n  PCE  growth  next  year  is  downturn  in  the  wealth-income atio i a r and a slackening  n  growth  of abor ncome associated  ith  the  general i l i w deceleration   activity. r projection  alls  or CE  growth  of  2-3/4 ercent of Ou c f P p in  2000.

On a seasonally  djusted  asis,  e expect  starts   drop  off ppreciably  his a b w to a t spring nd  to  run  closer  o  the  1.6  million  ark  by  this  ummer.  A  further a t m s moderate  decline  s rojected  or 000 as  income continues  o  decelerate d i p f 2 t an the  impetus  from  the  stock arket  wanes. The level f esidential  ilding m o r bu will emain  quite ubstantial, ugh.  Mortgage  interest  tes  ave  remained r s tho ra h rather  igh  relative   Treasury ields,  nd  we expect  a significant  rrowing h to y a na over  the  next ear.  Consequently,  espite  ising  eal ouse  prices,   see y d r r h we home affordability aining  supportive  f  demand in  the  single-family rem o sector.

Business  fixed investment. n  contrast  o  household pending, usiness I t s b investment as  shown some signs f  deceleration,  beit  rom extremely apid h o al f r growth  rates. e  expect  growth  in  real FI,  which  was 12 percent n  1998, W B i to  run  at bout  half  hat  ate n oth  1999 and  2000. The reasons or he a t r i b f t slowing  are  the  same as  in  previous  orecasts:  rowth of he  capital  tock s f G t s i already uite apid t  the resent  evel f  investment;  n  significant  rts  f q r a p l o i pa o the  manufacturing ector,  apacity  tilization   dropped  to  distinctly  bpar s c u has su levels  nd  profitability    suffered  aterially.   continuing  ecline  n a has m A d i

The anticipated  deration  in  capital  pending  is ost  marked with  respect  o mo s m t equipment.

Spending  on nonresidential  ructures  s  been  one of he  few areas f st ha t o weakness in  final  emand, and we see  little  tion  rom  this ector  oing d ac f s g forward.  There  are  many cross-currents.  ong  the  major  components,  both Am the  industrial  d retail gments  of  the  market  are  characterized   elements an se by of  excess apacity,  nd the  new contracts  or onstruction ve  been  falling. c a f c ha On the  other and,  the arket  for  office  pace  looks uite ealthy n the h m s q h o whole,  and  we  also ould  expect o  see  increases  n  building  y public w t i b utilities.

Monetary  and Credit  Flows

Growth of  the  aggregate  ebt  of  domestic onfinancial ctors  as  slowed  in d n se h the  current  uarter,   somewhere around  5-1/2  percent  t  an  annual  rate q to a versus -1/4  percent n average  in  1998. But,  while  slowing as  been  evident 6 o h in  all he  major  sectors, e  pace  of  borrowing as  remained  quite igh  for t th h h businesses  nd households. a

In  the  business  ector, ere as  been  a considerable winding  of  the s th h un tensions  hat fflicted  e  credit  arkets  last  all, d  firms ave  been  able  to t a th m f an h return o  the  securities  rkets oth  for ew funds  and  to  repay  bank  loans. t ma b n Among households,  redit  upply  conditions  ever  became a  major  issue,  ut c s n b the  improvement  in  asset-backed curities  rkets  undoubtedly as se ma h benefitted rrowers.  And borrowers ave been  in  abundance: Consumer bo h credit  urged  in  January,  ikely  eflecting  portantly  he  burst f  spending  on s l r im t o autos  and  other ig-ticket  rables,  hile  mortgage  borrowing  likely  as b du w h remained  sizable  ue  to  heavy  home purchases nd  cash-out efinancings. d a r Meanwhile,  state  nd local  overnment  borrowing  has  been  moderate, nd  the a g a federal  overnment  has  run  off  significant  ount of  debt  on a seasonally g a am adjusted  asis. b

We  expect hat orrowing  will low a bit urther  ver  the  course  of his  ear, t b s f o t y especially   the  private  ectors.  verall ebt  growth  is  projected  o un in s O d t r about  5 percent or he  year.  An expected urther  eceleration    2000 f t f d in

reflects e  growing  federal  udget  surplus nd diminishing  redit  emands th b a c d from households nd  businesses. a

For  the  year,  he a b t growth  of usiness  ector  ebt  is xpected o  be down about  2 percentage b s d e t points rom the  9-1/4 ercent ise n  1998.

Household  debt  is xpected  to  grow 8-1/4 ercent ver  1999 and  7-1/4 e p o percent n  2000,  outpacing  he  expansion n  other ectors.  he reduction  n i t i s T i borrowing  this  ear  is rojected  o  occur  entirely   the  mortgage  market, y p t in reflecting  e  drop-off  n  housing ctivity d less quity xtraction rough th i a an e e th refinancings.  owever, in  2000,  a slowing  in  consumer  debt  growth  should H contribute   well  to  the  moderation n  household orrowing, s  spending-as i b a especially  consumer  durables--decelerates  siderably.  ousehold  debt on con H has  increased  ubstantially ative   income  in  recent ears,  nd  we expect s rel to y a the  steep ptrend o  continue. o date,  he  burden  of  servicing ose  debts u t T t th has  been  moderated  by  declining  nterest tes  nd  the  ability   households i ra a of to  lengthen aturities  substituting  rtgages  for  consumer  loans.  As with m by mo the  business  ector, e  slackening  n  the  pace  of  economic  expansion s th i probably  will ring ith  it ome deterioration    credit  uality  n  mortgage b w s in q i and consumer  loan  portfolios--but, n,  e are  not  talking  bout  anything agai w a remotely  resembling ecessionary  conomic conditions, d  the  deterioration r e an in  debt  repayment  performance s nlikely  o  be  so  great s  to  precipitate i u t a a major  shift  n  lender ehavior. i b

However, despite  he  substantial  owth  and n t gr unemployment effects  f  this  lternative, e  CPI inflation    only  a little o a cor is lower  next  year  in his  cenario. his  results om  a particular  ature  f he t s T fr fe o t FRB/US  model. In  this odel,  expectations  f  inflation  e  relatively  ow  to m o ar sl respond  to  fluctuations    resource tilization t  re  not  accompanied  by in u tha a changes  in  monetary  policy--in rt ecause  people  have  come to  expect hat pa b t monetary  policy ill ove  to  prevent  change in  inflation.  re we to w m a We extend  the  simulation  eyond  2000,  though,  more substantial  fect  n b a ef o

The third lternative  ssumes that  the  ratio f  stock  market wealth  to  income a a o does not  decline ext  year  but  holds  steady  throughout  the  projection.  his n T might be viewed as,  in  a sense,  a more  "neutral" ssumption  than  is  our a baseline.  In  this ase, DP c G growth in  2000 is ust  little  gher, nd the j a hi a unemployment  rate  a bit ower,  relative  o  the  baseline. l t

Finally,  he  fourth  alternative   more  optimistic  till:  t alls or  the  Wilshire t is s I c f 5000 index  to  rise o  15,000--roughly 0  percent  higher  than  today's lose--by t 3 c the  end of  2000.

GDP t growth is considerably igher,  nd the  unemployment  rate  considerably ower,  than  in h a l the  constant ealth-to-income  ratio  cenario.  Again,  though,  it as a very w s h small  effect n the  inflation te  through  2000 given  the  way  expectations  re o ra a determined  in  this odel. m

CBO's March 1999 baseline surplus estimates are $111 billion in  FY99 and $133 billion in  FY2000. Budget receipts, outlays, and surplus/deficit include corresponding social security (OASDI) categories. The  OASDI surplus is excluded from the on-budget deficit and  shown separately as  off-budget, as classified under current law. The Postal Service deficit is included in  off-budget outlays beginning in  FY90.
