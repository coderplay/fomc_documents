Key Background Factors

The stock arket  has  been  extremely  olatile  er  the ntermeeting riod. s m v ov i pe A this reenbook  was being  put o  bed, road  indexes f quity  rices  ere  down G t b o e p w more than  10  percent  ince he une  Greenbook,  and  swings  of   or  3  percent s t J 2 within  a  day  were  not ncommon.
