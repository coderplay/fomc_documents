Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Retail Sales and Consumer Sentiment

Total nominal retail sales rose 0.3 percent in August; sales in the retail control group of stores fell 0.3 percent in August after posting a robust gain of 0.7 percent in July that was larger than previously estimated.  A drop in gasoline prices contributed to the decline in nominal retail control spending in August.  In addition, sales fell back at nonstore retailers and were little changed at clothing outlets and at food and food services establishments.  Among outlets excluded from the retail control category, sales at building material and supply stores fell, but sales at motor vehicles and parts dealers perked up in August.

The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment in early September remained close to the low level reached in August.  This month's preliminary figure reflected a small increase in the 'expected conditions' component of the overall index and essentially no change in the 'current conditions' component.  Among those items not included in the overall sentiment index, consumers' expectations about the change in unemployment over the next twelve months improved slightly in early September. Households' appraisals of buying conditions for cars strengthened but their views on buying conditions for houses remained low.  Inflation expectations were little changed: The median of expected inflation over the next twelve months edged down to 3.1 percent in September, and the median of expected inflation over the next five to ten years ticked up to 3.0 percent.

Industrial Production

Total industrial production (IP) rose 0.2 percent in August, after averaging gains of 0.5 percent in June and July.  A surge in electricity generation last month, as temperatures swung from a mild July to a very warm August, boosted the output of electric utilities and contributed about 0.5 percentage point to the rate of change in total IP last month. Following large gains in both June and July, manufacturing output decreased 0.3 percent in August; the annualized rate of change for the most recent three months was nearly 5 percent.  Mining output fell 0.6 percent because of decreases in the extraction of crude oil and natural gas.

The utilization rate for total industry was unchanged in August, at 82.2 percent.  The factory operating rate decreased 0.3 percent, to 80.7 percent, a rate that is about 1 percentage point above its 1972-2006 average but 0.4 percentage point below its recent

peak registered in August of last year.  By stage of processing, utilization rates moved down in both the crude and the finished stages, while utilization in the primary and semifinished stage rose.  The utilization rate for the crude stage-which includes oil and gas extraction-was 89.6 percent in August, and the July reading of 89.9 was the highest level since early 1998.  Utilization rates for the other stages of processing were about 1 percentage point above their long-run averages.

Light motor vehicle assemblies declined more than 400,000 units (annual rate) in August, to 10.7 million units.  The decrease in assemblies and the associated pullback in the production of motor vehicle parts subtracted more than 0.1 percentage point from the change in total IP.  Current assembly schedules suggest that about one-half of the August decline will be made up in September.  Medium and heavy truck assemblies fell in August to their lowest level in more than four years, and the IP index for medium and heavy trucks was nearly 60 percent below its recent peak in July 2006.

High-tech output rose a relatively modest 0.8 percent in August, but production gains in June and July were revised up considerably, and the annualized rate of increase in the most recent three months was a very solid 30 percent.  Although semiconductors decelerated in August, production had surged in the preceding two months, with gains widespread across chip types.  Downstream from semiconductors, the production of computers and peripherals rose tepidly in August, which continued a series of modest gains that followed robust increases in PC output in the first part of the year; the earlier strength resulted from consumer PC sales spurred by the release of Microsoft Vista. Conversely, communications equipment production has averaged increases of 1½ percent in the last three months, after a weak second quarter.

Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products, IP declined 0.2 percent in August.  Among final products, both durable consumer goods and nondurable consumer goods fell 0.3 percent; production of durables was restrained by decreases in furniture and carpeting while declines among nondurables were widespread. Business equipment also declined 0.3 percent, as an increase in civilian aircraft was more than offset by broadly based decreases in industrial and other equipment, where output had popped up in July.

Both construction supplies and business supplies were little changed in August for a second consecutive month.  Within construction supplies, continued increases in products associated with nonresidential construction offset declines in supplies more likely used in residential construction.  Materials output was also flat in August, after a sizable increase

in July, with both durable and nondurable materials little changed from their monthearlier levels.

Business Inventories

The book value of retail inventories, excluding motor vehicles and parts, rose at a modest rate for a second month in July. Combined with the inventory figures for manufacturing and wholesale trade, book-value inventories in the entire manufacturing and trade sector, excluding motor vehicles and parts, rose at an annual rate of $38 billion in July; this pace of inventory investment represents a sizable step-down from the second-quarter accumulation.  The book-value inventory-sales ratio in this category edged down to 1.20 in July.

Federal Government

According to the Monthly Treasury Statement, the federal government recorded a deficit (adjusted for routine payment timing shifts and financial transactions) in August of $70 billion-a little wider than in the same month last year and consistent with the staff's expectation.  Although the deficit has leveled off over the past four months, the adjusted deficit for the twelve months ending in August was $185 billion, about $85 billion less than its level in the year-earlier period.

Receipts in August were 4 percent above their level a year earlier and continued to decelerate from the brisk pace seen in recent years.  Individual income and payroll tax revenues, which made up the bulk of receipts in August, were 6½ percent above their year-earlier level.  In contrast, the small amount of corporate tax payments typically made in August was lower than its level a year earlier.

Outlays in August were up 5 percent from their year-earlier level, consistent with the slower pace of spending over the past year.  Defense spending in August was 2½ percent above its year-earlier level and was in line with the staff's expectation.

The International Economy

Prices of Internationally Trade Goods

Non-oil imports. In August, prices of U.S. imports of core goods rose 0.2 percent, the same rate recorded in July.  Higher prices for material-intensive goods led the way. Prices for imported foods jumped, albeit not as much as in July, and a decline in prices for building materials offset increases in other categories of nonfuel industrial supplies. Prices for imported finished goods rose 0.2 percent for the second straight month, with prices for all of the major categories of finished goods rising by approximately the same amount.  Prices for imported computers and semiconductors were both up for the month, while prices for imported natural gas plunged.

The average level of core import prices in July and August was 3 percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter average.  Prices for material-intensive goods were up 5½ percent, lifted by higher prices for foods, whereas prices for finished goods increased 2 percent.  Prices for semiconductors were up after a steep second-quarter decline, and prices for imported natural gas fell more than 40 percent at an annual rate from the second-quarter average.

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil fell 1¼ percent in August, following a 6½ percent increase in July.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil closed at a new record nominal high of $80.09 per barrel on September 13.  In recent days, the spot price of WTI has moved higher on reports of a third straight week of larger-than-expected U.S. inventory draws, a pipeline bombing in Mexico, and Hurricane activity that materialized late in the week and led to disruptions in Gulf refining activity.

Exports. Prices of U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.2 percent in August; prices for July were revised down significantly and are now reported to have fallen slightly.  Prices for agricultural exports jumped for the third consecutive month, although prices for exported grains, which had been surging in recent months, fell.  Meat prices continued to soar. Prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies inched up after a steep decline in July; prices for exported metals fell, but this was largely offset by higher prices for chemical exports.  Prices for exported finished goods decelerated in August and rose only slightly. Prices for exported computers and semiconductors moved down slightly.

The average level of core export prices in July and August was 2 percent at an annual rate above the second-quarter average.  Prices for agricultural products were up more than

15 percent over the second-quarter average, while prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies were down, and the rate of deflation for computer export prices slowed.

U.S. Current Account

The U.S. current account deficit was $763 billion (a.r.) in the second quarter of 2007, $25 billion narrower than in the first quarter (revised).  About $18 billion of the narrowing was due to decreased net unilateral transfers to foreigners, primarily those associated with military and other U.S. Government grants.  The remaining $8 billion of the narrowing was the result of increased net investment income.  There were increases in all categories of income payments and receipts, including interest, dividend, and direct investment income, but receipts moved up more than payments.  On net there was little movement in the trade balance on goods and services. While the surplus on services increased, this was offset by an increase in the deficit on goods.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

The second-quarter balance of payments data include preliminary estimates for direct investment flows and the BEA's figures for foreign securities transactions.  The new data report inflows through foreign acquisitions of U.S. securities to be $229 billion in the second quarter (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions Table), compared with $206 billion estimated in the Greenbook.  The difference reflects

adjustment factors applied by BEA that differ from their usual methodology.  The largest adjustment is to agency bonds (line 4b), with net purchases of nearly $29 billion, up $14 billion from the Greenbook estimate.  There are also upward adjustments to Treasury securities (line 4a), corporate bonds (line 4c), and corporate stocks (line 4d).

Preliminary data for U.S. direct investment abroad (line 6) indicate a slight decline in net outflows to $72 billion in the second quarter.  Inter-company debt investment and net equity capital investment abroad slowed, but were partially offset by a pickup in reinvested earnings.  Direct investment into the United States (line 7) surged in the second quarter to $74 billion.  The increase was mostly accounted for by a shift from a decrease to an increase in net inter-company debt investment in the United States and a pickup in net equity capital investment in the United States.  Reinvested earnings also increased.

The statistical discrepancy (the last line of the table) in the second quarter is positive $40 billion, indicating some combination of over-reporting of the current account deficit or under-reporting of net financial inflows.
