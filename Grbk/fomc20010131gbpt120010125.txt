International  Developments

In late December, the more negative outlook for high-tech  industries contributed to equity price declines in that sector for most countries,  particularly  in emerging Asia.  Federal  Reserve action  on January 3, however,  sparked a rebound in both technology-heavy  and emerging-market  stock indexes.  Broad equity  price indexes  of most foreign industrial countries  went up in January, but were little changed  over the intermeeting  period,  while Japanese equities fell  about 5 percent. Since the December FOMC meeting, long-term  rates have changed little in the euro area  and have fallen 25 basis points in Japan.

On January 23,  the Bank of Canada lowered its key policy rate 25 basis points, to 5.75 percent,  citing an unexpectedly  abrupt deterioration  in the outlook for the U.S. economy  as the primary justification  for its  action. The European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan,  and the Bank of England  kept policy rates unchanged during the period.

. The Desk did not intervene  during the period for the  accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Economic activity abroad.  In the foreign industrial  countries, recent indicators suggest that growth moderated in the third and fourth quarters  and point to further  slowing in  the first quarter  of this year.  The Japanese  economy  seems to have  entered  another period  of stagnation, with both the all-industries  index of output  and indicators  of household  demand below their third-quarter levels on average  in October  and November.  Even business investment spending  seems to be losing  steam, as both orders and shipments of machinery  have slowed in recent months following a robust expansion earlier  last year.  In the euro area, fourth-quarter  growth is estimated to have  softened to an annual rate of 2 percent,  as consumer spending continued  to be disappointing.  However, forward-looking  indicators  have been mixed;  business confidence  indicators  are down from levels reached in the first half of last year, but have stabilized while consumer confidence has improved.  An ongoing  inventory correction  and weaker exports to the United States have lowered  Canadian real GDP growth, which  is estimated to have  fallen to 3  percent in  the fourth  quarter compared with growth of about 5 percent during the first three quarters of 2000.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area  was 2.6 percent  in December, well above the European Central  Bank's 2 percent  target ceiling, while  core inflation  was  1.4 percent. Canadian consumer price  inflation breached  the ceiling  of the Bank of Canada's 1 to 3 percent  inflation band, and core  inflation also moved  up, to  1.9 percent. In  the United Kingdom, retail price inflation  remained below the target rate of 2.5 percent, while in Japan consumer price deflation  remained near  1 percent.
