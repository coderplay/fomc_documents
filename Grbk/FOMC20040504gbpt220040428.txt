Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

The economy appears to have expanded robustly again in the first quarter. Available data are consistent with another quarter of solid growth in consumer spending, and activity in the housing sector has remained high.  Outlays for equipment and software have continued to increase at a vigorous pace even as spending on nonresidential structures have continued to fall.  Output in the industrial sector expanded solidly in the first quarter.  In the labor market, the overall employment picture brightened somewhat in March.  Core consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in March; the twelve-month change in the core CPI was 1.6 percent, about the same rate of change as a year earlier.

Labor Market Developments

The labor market has shown additional signs of recovery since the last Greenbook.  Private payroll employment climbed 277,000 in March, with gains spread widely across industries.  Construction employment rose smartly, retail trade employment increased beyond the effect of the end of the supermarket strikes in California, and employment in both business and nonbusiness services expanded briskly.  For the first quarter as a whole, the average monthly gain in private payrolls was 161,000, well above the fourth-quarter average of 58,000. However, the average workweek of production or nonsupervisory workers slipped 0.1 hour in March to 33.7 hours, the level that has persisted on average since early 2003.  Thus, despite the pickup in payroll employment, aggregate hours increased at an annual rate of just 1-1/2 percent in the first quarter, slightly below the 2 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

The unemployment rate was 5.7 percent in March, more than 1/2 percentage point below its peak in June 2003.  However, the decline in the unemployment rate since last summer likely overstates the reduction in labor market slack because the labor force participation rate has also fallen to the unexpectedly low level of 65.9 percent.  The employment-population ratio combines movements in the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate; at 62.1 percent, this ratio remains below its level for most of 2003.  In addition, the fraction of persons working part-time for economic reasons in March was close to the recent high from the middle of last year.

The sluggishness of the labor market's recovery through the beginning of this year appears to have been attributable to anemic hiring rather than to continued high rates of separations.  Although initial claims for unemployment insurance changed little in the past two months, they had fallen substantially since the spring of last year, suggesting that discharges had declined.  This assessment is supported by data from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS), which show that the rate of separations moved down considerably between late

2001 and February of this year.   Meanwhile, both the hiring rate and the rate of 1 job openings, as measured by JOLTS, remained near their cyclical lows in February.  And although insured unemployment is down, recipients still appear to be exhausting their benefits in large numbers rather than entering employment more quickly.

However, the sizable gain in payroll employment in March suggests that the hiring rate may now be picking up.  Other labor market indicators also point to near-term improvement in hiring conditions.  Manpower Inc.'s survey of firms' hiring plans for the second quarter reached its highest level since 2000; the National Federation of Independent Businesses has reported a net improvement in hiring plans over the past year; and hiring plans in the National Association of Business Economists (NABE) survey, which had stepped up in the second half of last year, improved further in the most recent surveys.  In addition, households' perceptions of current employment conditions, as measured by the Conference Board, improved in April to the highest level since mid-2002. Nevertheless, households are less optimistic now about the future of the labor market than they were at the end of last year.  Both the Michigan survey and the Conference Board reported that, in April, households' expectations of labor market conditions remained below their year-end levels.

Industrial Production

Although a weather-related decline in utilities production helped push total industrial production down 0.2 percent in March, the pace of expansion quickened for the first quarter as a whole.   Total IP rose at an annual rate of 2 6.6 percent in the first quarter, 1 percentage point faster than in the fourth quarter of 2003.

Manufacturing output climbed 5.9 percent last quarter, with gains again spread widely across both industry and market groups.  The factory operating rate edged up to 75 percent in the first quarter-a level that remains 5 percentage points below its 1972-2003 average.  Motor vehicle assemblies were 12.2 million units (annual rate) in March, about 1/2 million units slower than in February but still enough to leave first-quarter assemblies about 200,000 units above the fourth-quarter pace.  Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing IP rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent last quarter.

Production in the high-tech sector of manufacturing rose at an annual rate of 30 percent in the first quarter.  Semiconductor production chalked up a gain of 48 percent, and computer production rose 29 percent; in contrast, IP for communications equipment barely edged up in the first quarter and was little changed from year-ago levels.

Outside of energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech, production at all stages of processing rose in the first quarter.  The output of finished products, led by a surge in the production of business equipment, moved up at an annual rate of 3-1/2 percent.  Production at the earlier stages of processing-primary and semifinished-rose 4-1/2 percent, continuing a trend that began in the middle of last year.  Indexes for both durable and nondurable materials moved up smartly again, as did those for business and construction supplies.

Available weekly physical product data are up slightly, on balance, thus far in April.  Motor vehicle assemblies are scheduled to edge up in April to an annual rate of 12.4 million units, and production through the first half of the month is running a bit above schedules.  Electricity generation has also edged up. However, output in other manufacturing industries for which we have weekly physical product data-principally, crude oil and refinery products, iron and steel, appliances, meat products, and lumber and plywood-has slipped a bit so far this month.

The forward-looking indicators of near-term production point to continued expansion in the industrial sector in the coming months.  The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) diffusion index of new orders remained high in March, and the index for new export orders rose significantly.  More recently, the Philadelphia Fed's new orders index ticked up in April and continued to indicate expansion, and the ISM Semiannual Forecast reported that prospects for

manufacturing in the remainder of 2004 are bright.  The staff's series for real adjusted durable goods orders increased 3.3 percent in March, and its firstquarter average moved up 6-1/2 percent.  In addition, estimates from the Board staff's flow-of-goods system indicate that IP inventories are low in the majority of industries.  Given continued strong demand, the current low level of inventories could provide further impetus to near-term production.

- 2. Primary metals; most fabricated metals; most stone, clay, and glass products;

household appliances; scientific instruments; and miscellaneous durable goods.

In the high-tech sector, orders and shipments of equipment for manufacturing semiconductors remained high in March, suggesting that chipmakers are expanding productive capacity.  In addition, Intel's revenue guidance for the second quarter of 2004 points to another respectable increase in semiconductor production.   For computers and communications equipment, server sales were 3 especially strong in the first quarter, and CIO Magazine diffusion indexes for planned spending on computer hardware and data-networking equipment were up.  Furthermore, a majority of respondents in the NABE Industry Survey for April expect their firms to increase spending for these types of equipment over the coming year.

II-11

Motor Vehicles

Sales of light vehicles firmed in March after some softening in the first two months of the year, and our industry contacts expect sales in April to improve a bit further.  Thus far, the pickup has not been driven by rising sales incentives: The average value of incentives that consumers received ticked down in early April.   Nonetheless, attitudes toward car-buying continue to be favorable, 4 according to the Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment.

Sales of domestically produced light trucks and automobiles slowed in the first quarter.  With the pace of assemblies up and sales down, days' supply of light trucks ended the quarter at an uncomfortably high level.  Accordingly, manufacturers have scheduled fewer assemblies of light trucks for the second quarter than in the first quarter.  In contrast, stocks of automobiles ended the quarter in line with historical norms.

Consumer Spending

Real consumer spending appears to have increased in the first quarter at a pace similar to the gain in the second half of last year.  Spending is being supported by expanding wealth, rising wages and salaries, and the continuing effects of last year's tax cut.

Nominal spending in the retail control category of goods-which excludes auto dealers and building material and supply stores-is now estimated to have increased 0.6 percent in February and March after having moved up 1.6 percent in January.   After accounting for price changes, we estimate that real spending 5 in the retail control category rose at an annual rate of 6.8 percent in the first quarter.  Although, as noted above, spending on motor vehicles dropped back in the first quarter, spending on other goods remained robust.  Real expenditures on services rose 0.5 percent in January largely on the strength of brokerage and energy services, and they rose 0.3 percent in February (the latest available data) on broad-based gains.  Thus, services appear on track for a solid increase for the quarter as a whole.

The major determinants of consumption look fairly strong.  Equity values and prices of owner-occupied real estate have increased significantly over the past year, lifting the ratio of household net worth to disposable income.  Nominal

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

disposable income was boosted in February by an increase in tax refunds and a decline in final tax payments as well as by solid gains in wages and salaries. Real disposable personal income was 1.0 percent (not an annual rate) higher in February than the fourth-quarter average despite a run-up in energy prices.   The personal saving rate in February, at 1.9 percent, was a bit below its average level in 2003. 6

Consumer confidence was roughly stable in March and April.  Both the Michigan Survey Research Center's index of consumer sentiment and the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence remained well above their lows in early 2003, in keeping with improved fundamentals.

Housing Markets

Housing construction rebounded in March after having slowed in January and February; some of this swing appears to reflect atypical weather patterns. Unusually wet weather in February slowed single-family starts to an annual rate of 1.52 million units, but unseasonably warm and dry weather last month helped boost starts to a rate of 1.60 million units.  Issuance of new permits (adjusted for activity in areas where permits are not required) is less sensitive to unusual weather and was between 1.54 million and 1.56 million units in each month of the first quarter, indicating that the underlying pace of single-family construction has remained consistently high.  In the multifamily sector, starts ran up to an annual rate of 408,000 units in March and averaged 383,000 units for the first quarter as a whole.  Starts were elevated relative to permits in March, and the vacancy rate for multifamily units reached a record high 11.4 percent in the first quarter, suggesting that the recent pace of construction in this sector probably will not be sustained.

Sales of new homes jumped nearly 9 percent in March to a record 1.23 million units and were up 4 percent for the first quarter as a whole.  Sales of existing homes bounced back 5-3/4 percent in March to the second highest figure on record, but were nevertheless down 1-1/2 percent for the quarter.  Housing market indicators suggest that the demand for housing will continue to hold up well in the near term. The average rate for thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages in the first three weeks of April was 5.87 percent, 40 basis points above the nearrecord low in March; over the same period, the average rate for adjustable-rate mortgages rose about 1/4 percentage point.  Still, the levels of mortgage rates

remain low.  The four-week moving average of purchase applications from the Mortgage Bankers Association moved to a new high in early April, and attitudes toward homebuying, as measured in the preliminary Michigan survey, were near the upper end of their range over the past year.

Home prices continued to rise rapidly.  In the first quarter, the median price for new homes was 9.8 percent higher than the year-ago level, and the constantquality price index for new homes-which controls for changes in geographic composition, home size, and other amenities-increased 5.8 percent over the same period, which is toward the upper end of the distribution of price increases over the past several years.  In the much larger market for existing homes, the median price in the first quarter was 6.5 percent higher than a year earlier.

Business Fixed Investment

Equipment and software. Real outlays for equipment and software appear to have expanded at a vigorous clip in the first quarter, with the exception of spending on transportation equipment.  The fundamentals underlying business investment remain favorable:  Business output is rising briskly, corporate cash flows are showing sizable gains, and the user cost of capital remains low, in part because of the partial-expensing tax incentive.  In addition, according to anecdotal reports from industry contacts and surveys of business persons, confidence in the durability of the economic expansion is growing.

Nominal shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose at an annual rate of 12.3 percent in the first quarter after a similar increase in the fourth quarter.  In the high-tech sector, shipments of computers and peripherals fell 3.9 percent in the first quarter, while shipments of communications equipment moved up 9.8 percent.  Outside the high-tech categories, shipments were up 16.2 percent, continuing the impressive growth seen in this category since the middle of last year.  Revenue reports from Microsoft and other major software vendors indicate that business purchases of software increased at a moderate pace in the first quarter.

The average level of new orders for communications equipment over the past twelve months exceeded the average level of shipments, suggesting that demand has firmed somewhat in this beleaguered category.  Outside of high-tech, new orders for capital equipment surged 4.4 percent (not at an annual rate) in March, pushing the level of orders significantly above the level of shipments.

Business spending on transportation equipment seems to have declined, on balance, in the first quarter after an outsized jump in the fourth quarter.  A drop in spending on light vehicles more than offset strong demand for medium and heavy trucks, which sold at an annual rate of a little over 400,000 units for the fourth straight month.  Truck orders also have remained robust, and backlogs

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

have continued to climb from a low point reached in early 2003.  Truck demand is reportedly being supported by investment tax incentives as well as by generally greater demand for trucking services.  In addition, industry contacts indicate that replacement demand has been strong.  Nominal shipments of aircraft moved up in the first two months of the year, and real investment in aircraft appears to have firmed since its low last summer.

Nonresidential construction. Real business investment in structures appears to have weakened further in the first quarter.  Nominal spending on commercial and health care structures-a large sector that includes offices and other commercial buildings-was 3-1/2 percent (not an annual rate) lower in February than its fourth-quarter average.  Nominal outlays for manufacturing facilities were 5 percent lower in February than in the fourth quarter, and investment in other types of nonresidential structures was down 2-1/2 percent.   On a more positive note, nominal expenditures 7 for power and communication structures were 9-1/2 percent higher in February than the fourth-quarter average, and spending in the drilling and mining category has likely increased in the past few months because of a rise in the number of natural gas rigs in operation.

Other indicators of market conditions for nonresidential structures remain weak.  The vacancy rate for industrial buildings set another new high in the first quarter, while the vacancy rate for office properties remained quite elevated.  According to the latest available data, rents for retail properties edged up in the fourth quarter, but warehouse rents were flat, and rents for office space continued to decline.

Business Inventories

Book-value inventory investment has moved up since the start of the year. Excluding motor vehicles and parts, the manufacturing and trade sector added inventories at an annual rate of $18 billion in January and $72 billion in February.  However, the sharp rise in the prices of materials in these months suggests that the pickup in book-value stocks likely overstates the accumulation of real inventories.   Moreover, because of strong growth in sales and 8 shipments, inventory-sales ratios remain near historical lows in most industries.

In March, days' supply in the Board staff's flow-of-goods system ticked up, reversing February's decline, but nevertheless remained low by historical standards.  Excluding motor vehicles and parts, the inventory-consumption ratio has, on balance, continued to trend down since the end of 2001.  The only

<!-- missing-text -->

industries with elevated days' supply levels are paper and communications equipment.

Government Sector

Federal. Incoming budget data remain consistent with a substantial widening of the federal deficit this year.  Although tax collections have firmed somewhat in February and March, this increase in revenues has been more than matched by a pickup in spending.

Federal unified budget outlays rose 8 percent in February and March relative to a year earlier, about 1 percentage point faster than the twelve-month changes recorded in 2003.  The acceleration reflects the waning effects of lower interest rates on the rise in debt-service costs and a pickup in the pace of spending on Medicaid and Medicare.  Medicaid payments are being elevated by the temporary increase in the federal match rate that was enacted last year, and Medicare outlays are being lifted, in part, by last year's legislation that increased payment rates to certain health care providers.  Budget outlays are also being boosted by continued rapid increases in defense spending.  Indeed, the incoming data indicate that real defense expenditures in the NIPA accounts rose at an annual rate of 15 percent in the first quarter.

Receipts in February and March came in 7-1/2 percent above a year earlier, as gains in both corporate and personal taxable income apparently more than offset the effects of last year's tax cut legislation.  Nevertheless, last year's legislation has led to a noticeable step-up in refunds and a reduction in final settlements. Data through mid-April show refunds running 9 percent above year-ago levels. In addition, daily data for April on nonwithheld income taxes and social insurance collections, which are largely final settlements, suggest that payments are running roughly 8 percent below last year.

State and local governments. Indicators of state and local spending in the first quarter have been mixed.  Employment jumped 32,000 in March after little change, on balance, over the first two months of the quarter.  In contrast, construction spending has moved down for five consecutive months, and the February level stood nearly 6 percent below the high recorded last September.

With the economy expanding and revenues strengthening, the states, as a group, appear to be facing fewer budgetary difficulties than in recent years.  According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, states expect that ending balances for the current fiscal year as a percentage of general fund expenditures will rise for the first time since 2000; both rainy day funds and cash on hand are projected to increase.  Reflecting this improvement, credit rating agencies have raised state ratings:  For example, Standard &amp; Poor's has assigned 41 states a stable outlook, compared with 34 last year; and 7 states have a negative outlook,

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

compared with 13 last year.  With the end of fiscal 2004 just a little more than two months away, most states are working to nail down their 2005 general fund budgets.  Despite the recent fiscal strengthening, budgetary pressures still prevail in some states, where legislators are negotiating another round of provisions, including further spending reductions, tax hikes, and funds transfers, to cover prospective shortfalls.

Prices

A surge in energy prices helped push up consumer price inflation in the first quarter.  Still, the cumulative increase in the consumer price index during the twelve months ending in March, at 1.7 percent, was more than 1 percentage point lower than in the preceding year.  Excluding food and energy, inflation also moved up in the early part of this year after very low readings in late 2003; over the twelve months ending in March, the core CPI rose 1.6 percent, similar to the increase a year earlier.

The run-up in consumer energy prices since the beginning of the year has been driven by rising crude oil costs and strong demand for gasoline.  The energy component of the CPI rose 1.9 percent in March, as another sharp increase in gasoline prices was only partially offset by declines in prices of natural gas and electricity.  Survey data for April point to a modest further increase in retail gasoline prices, not seasonally adjusted, although less than the seasonal norm. Moreover, the upward pressures on wholesale prices seem to have eased: Inventories of gasoline have risen, on balance, from their trough in mid-March, and wholesale margins have fallen noticeably in recent weeks.  The March drop in residential natural gas prices is not likely to be repeated in April:  Demand for gas from electric utilities has pushed up spot gas prices despite a small recovery in natural gas inventories.

Consumer prices for food rose 0.2 percent in March, matching February's increase.  Although retail prices for beef fell again last month, trade reports note a strong rebound in wholesale prices for beef, suggesting that consumer demand for beef has held up much better than some observers had feared in the wake of the mad cow disease incident.  Price increases for a variety of other food items stepped up in the first quarter, most notably fats and oils and cereal and bakery products-likely reflecting robust global demand for crops and poor harvests in the Southern Hemisphere-and food away from home.  Over the twelve months ending in March, food prices rose 3.2 percent, a pickup of nearly 2 percentage points from the preceding year.

Excluding food and energy, the CPI rose 0.4 percent in March.  This jump, which was the largest monthly increase in more than two years, likely overstates the trend in inflation.  Some of the noteworthy price increases in March followed unusually low readings in the same categories in previous months and probably will not be repeated; examples include a jump of 3.8 percent in the

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

volatile category of lodging away from home and a sharp upturn of 0.9 percent in prices for apparel after four consecutive months of decline.  Nevertheless, prices for a wide range of goods and services-including autos and medical services-have recently risen faster than in 2003, bringing the twelve-month change in the core CPI back up from the very low readings seen late last year.

Translation of the available price data into an estimate of core PCE prices points to an increase of about 0.2 percent in March, which would put the twelve-month change in core PCE prices in March at 1.4 percent, the same rate of increase as over the preceding year.

Prices for capital equipment as measured in the producer price index rose 0.3 percent in March after having been flat in February.  These prices have fluctuated in recent months, largely mirroring monthly swings in prices for new cars and trucks.  For the twelve months ending in March, prices for capital equipment rose 0.9 percent, a pickup of a little more than 1/2 percentage point from the preceding year.

Industrial commodity prices as measured by the Journal of Commerce index are up almost 12 percent (not at an annual rate) so far this year after a surge of more than 20 percent in 2003.  The 18 percent decline in prices for scrap steel since the last Greenbook reversed only one-third of the run-up earlier in the year. Moreover, demand for other commodities appears to have remained robust, with further increases in prices for forest products, some metals, and most agricultural commodities.  At later stages of production, price increases have been more modest.  In the first three months of the year, producer prices for intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose at an annual rate of 8.9 percent, while producer prices for core finished goods rose 2.1 percent.

Median year-ahead expected inflation as measured by the Michigan Survey rose to 3.0 percent in early April, likely reflecting the run-up in energy prices.  In contrast, the preliminary report on median expectations over a five- to ten-year horizon dropped to 2.5 percent, well below the readings over the past couple of years.

2004

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Data on economic activity and prices received over the intermeeting period were generally stronger than expected, leading investors to anticipate a tighter stance of monetary policy.  Treasury coupon yields climbed as much as 80 basis points, reflecting mainly an increase in real interest rates. Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about in line with those on Treasuries, while yields on speculative-grade bonds increased more modestly, narrowing their risk spreads. Despite the rise in interest rates, broad equity-market indexes moved higher, as reported and expected earnings continued to strengthen.  Business borrowing picked up in the first quarter, but it appears to have slackened somewhat in recent weeks in response to the rise in rates.  Household borrowing is estimated to have remained robust in the first quarter.

Policy Expectations and Treasury Yields

Stronger-than-expected macroeconomic data released during the intermeeting period, particularly the employment report in early April, led market participants to expect that policy tightening will begin sooner than previously anticipated. Quotes on federal funds futures indicate that investors have now fully priced in a rate hike of 25 basis points by the August FOMC meeting and place significant odds on rates rising a total of 50 basis points or more by November.  Similarly, recent surveys indicate that a significant fraction of the primary dealers anticipate a rate hike at the August meeting and expect the federal funds rate to be 50 to 100 basis points higher by year-end.  These surveys also suggest that market participants generally expect the Committee will view inflation risks as balanced at the upcoming meeting and will drop or modify its reference to 'patience' in removing policy accommodation.

In addition to the expectation of an earlier tightening move, the trajectory of futures rates through the middle of 2006 has steepened, implying that investors anticipate that policy tightening will proceed at a faster pace once it commences. The upward revisions to the expected policy path since the last FOMC meeting showed through to Treasury yields, which rose, on balance, 70 to 80 basis points across the two- to ten-year curve.  Yields on inflation-indexed Treasury securities climbed slightly less-about 50 to 60 basis points-pointing to a small increase in inflation compensation.

Stock Prices and Corporate Risk Spreads

Broad equity-price indexes rose about 3 percent, on net, over the intermeeting period in response to strong earnings reports and positive economic news.  The stock market rise was tempered somewhat by the upward shift in interest rates, which caused stock prices in some interest-sensitive sectors-such as banks and brokerage firms, utilities, and REITs-to fall.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

The forward earnings-price ratio for the S&amp;P 500 was virtually unchanged over the intermeeting period, and its spread over a long-run Treasury yield-a rough measure of the equity premium-narrowed a little.  Implied volatility of both the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 declined slightly, leaving both measures at their lowest levels since the late 1990s.

While risk spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds were nearly unchanged, spreads on speculative-grade bonds declined about 65 basis points, reversing the run-up that had occurred over the previous intermeeting period.  Risk spreads on commercial paper remained quite low.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

With nearly 300 of the S&amp;P 500 firms having reported for the first quarter, earnings per share for the S&amp;P 500 appears to have increased almost 25 percent from its year-ago level.  Market analysts continue to revise up their twelve-month forward-earnings forecasts, with the revisions index rising to a very high level in April.  Expectations for long-term earnings growth inched up further in March and April, continuing the turnaround that began in late 2003 and ending the three-year slide in analysts' views on long-term prospects.

Corporate credit quality continued to improve over the intermeeting period. Bond downgrades, measured as the share of the par value of outstanding bonds, declined further in the first quarter and were almost matched by bond upgrades. With no defaults registered in February and defaults in March low, the six-month moving average of the realized bond default rate dropped further. The KMV expected year-ahead default rate based on firm-specific measures declined a shade in both February and March.

Business Finance

Gross issuance of investment-grade bonds by nonfinancial corporations spiked in March, as firms apparently responded to the lower yields that followed the employment report released on March 5 th .  With the recent backup in yields, offerings by these firms have slowed considerably in April.  In contrast, speculative-grade issuance has remained robust in March and April, with the proceeds largely being used to repay other debt.  Outstanding commercial paper and C&amp;I loans fell in March; however, over the first few weeks of April, both have registered small increases.  The recent uptick in C&amp;I loans is consistent with reports from the April Senior Loan Officer Survey that banks have eased C&amp;I loan standards on net and that demand for these loans has picked up. Overall, net debt financing was about zero in March but appears to have increased thus far in April.

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial firms moved up in March on the strength of a couple of large seasoned equity offerings that were reportedly related to acquisitions and capital expenditures.  So far in April, gross issuance has waned, reflecting a slowdown in seasoned offerings and a continued sluggish pace of initial public offerings.  Total equity issuance by nonfinancial firms continues to be outweighed by equity retirements.  Many firms are maintaining their use of share repurchases as a way to distribute strong earnings to shareholders.  Although equity retirements from cash mergers remain subdued, they are expected to increase given the pickup in announcements of new M&amp;A deals so far this year.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial mortgage debt growth moved up in the first quarter to an estimated 10 percent pace, as both CMBS issuance and real estate lending by banks were strong.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages at banks and insurers remained low through the end of 2003, and CMBS delinquencies-which had moved higher through late last year-have flattened over the past several months.  CMBS yields rose over the intermeeting period, with spreads little changed.  However, REIT equity prices have tumbled about 12 percent since the March FOMC meeting, in response to recent increases in interest rates and perhaps to concerns expressed by some investors that commercial real estate may be overvalued.

Household Finance

Interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed about 50 basis points over the intermeeting period.  Refinancing applications have declined in April as rates have increased, although refinancing originations, which lag applications, have not yet fallen off.  Originations for home purchases have continued to rise. Home mortgage debt is estimated to have grown at a rapid pace of 10-3/4 percent in the first quarter.

Consumer credit expanded at an estimated 4-1/2 percent rate in the first quarter, a little above the previous quarter's pace.  On the whole, indicators of consumer credit quality have shown some improvement this year.  Delinquencies on credit cards in securitized pools have declined, household bankruptcy filings have moved down to slightly below their year-ago levels, and delinquencies on auto loans at captive finance companies have remained low.

Although data on household assets in the first quarter are still incomplete, the modest rise in stock prices together with a larger estimated increase in disposable income suggest that the ratio of household assets to income most

likely ticked down but remained above the year-ago level.   Through April, 1 incoming mutual fund data indicate that households have continued to invest heavily in equity mutual funds.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross municipal bond issuance bounced back in March, as states and municipalities ramped up their borrowing for transportation projects and health care facilities.  In addition, the volume of advance refunding issues posted a particularly large gain in March, in response to the dip in yields.  Gross issuance has been lower in April, with new capital issuance weakening a little and advance refunding issues falling off noticeably.

Yields on longer-term general obligation municipal bonds rose in line with comparable Treasuries over the intermeeting period, leaving the muni-to-Treasury yield ratio unchanged on net.  The risk spread between AAA-rated and BBB-rated revenue bonds remained volatile over the period but posted little net change and remained well below the high of last year.  In a reversal of a two-year trend, upgrades of municipal bonds have outpaced downgrades since early February.  As a result, municipal bond upgrades and downgrades are nearly balanced thus far this year.

Treasury Finance

Net issuance of marketable debt by the Treasury surged to $146 billion in the first quarter-the largest quarterly total on record.  Moreover, incoming tax receipts in April have been somewhat lighter than the Treasury expected, pushing up the government's anticipated financing needs in the second quarter. Over the intermeeting period, the Treasury conducted auctions of two- and five-year nominal notes and a ten-year inflation-indexed note.  Investor demand at the auctions was mixed.

Investors continued to focus on the participation of foreign official institutions in the Treasury market.  Indirect bidding at Treasury auctions, which includes bidding by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on behalf of foreign institutions, remained strong.  However, in light of the sharp fall-off in Japanese currency intervention, market chatter centered on whether the pace of foreign official purchases would decline going forward.

Agency Finance

Net borrowing by the housing GSEs continued to be quite light.  For the most part, investors seemed unmoved by the ongoing debate over regulatory reform

and the questions raised about Fannie Mae's accounting practices.  Yield spreads on most Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt securities narrowed a touch, on balance, over the intermeeting period, but equity prices for the two GSEs moved down.

The Senate Banking Committee approved a bill that would create a new regulator for the housing GSEs that would have the ability to place those entities into receivership if they were to become financially distressed.  However, the current bill would require that the Congress not object to such an action.  The current version of the bill is unlikely to be enacted, in part because the Administration opposes this provision.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 continued to recover from its extraordinary weakness in late 2003, growing about 9 percent in March and April. Mortgage refinancing appears to have boosted M2 growth in both months. Liquid deposits have again driven most of the advance in M2, although growth in currency has moved closer to its long-term trend in April after a weak first quarter.

Bank loans increased smartly in March and April; the growth was led primarily by increases in residential and commercial real estate lending.  The April Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey reported a noticeable pickup in demand for commercial real estate loans compared with three months earlier but indicated that demand for residential loans had weakened a little.

First-quarter earnings reports by several large bank holding companies show continued strong profitability.  In particular, loss provisions shrank with improvements in credit quality, while non-interest income expanded, reflecting in part increased fees from trading and asset management.

Appendix

April 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey

The April 2004 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  In addition, the survey contained a series of questions on residential real estate loans and a question on changes in banks' pricing and investment behavior in light of declining net interest margins.  Responses were received from fifty-two domestic and nineteen foreign banking institutions.

Both domestic banks and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks indicated that they had eased lending standards and terms for C&amp;I loans over the past three months. Domestic banks also eased lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the same period, while standards at foreign institutions were little changed.  The share of domestic banks reporting stronger demand for C&amp;I loans in the April survey was notably larger than in the January survey.  Demand for commercial real estate loans at domestic banks also strengthened on net.  By contrast, foreign institutions reported weaker C&amp;I loan demand, on net, and indicated that demand for commercial real estate loans had not changed.

In the April survey, a small net fraction of domestic banks reported having eased lending standards on residential real estate loans, but standards and terms for consumer loans were generally unchanged.  On net, demand for residential real estate loans was little changed, while demand for consumer loans had strengthened.

Lending to Businesses

Both domestic and foreign banks reported having eased lending standards on C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  About 20 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had eased standards for large and middle-market firms, the largest share doing so since the beginning of the 1990s, and a similar fraction noted having eased standards for small firms.  The net share of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having eased lending standards for C&amp;I loans jumped to 32 percent in the April survey, up from 10 percent in the January survey.

Both domestic and foreign institutions also indicated that they had eased many terms on C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  On net, almost 40 percent of domestic banks reported having narrowed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for large and middle-market borrowers in April, up from 27 percent in the previous survey, and 26 percent had done so for small firms.  About 37 percent of foreign institutions indicated that they had reduced spreads on their C&amp;I loans, up notably from 14 percent in January.  Survey respondents, on net, continued to report having eased terms on credit lines, both by increasing the maximum size of these lines and by reducing their cost.  Furthermore, about one-fourth of both domestic and foreign banks said that they had eased loan covenants over the past three months.

More than 80 percent of the banks that reported having eased standards and terms on C&amp;I loans in the April survey cited more aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done so, roughly the same percentage as in the previous survey.  Domestic banks that had eased standards and

terms also pointed to a more favorable economic outlook and improvements in industry-specific problems, as well as an increased tolerance for risk.  The few domestic banks that had tightened standards or terms generally cited a less favorable economic outlook or a reduced tolerance for risk.

C&amp;I loan demand. On net, 29 percent of domestic banks reported in the April survey that the demand for C&amp;I loans from large and middle-market borrowers had increased, the largest share doing so since 1998.  About 40 percent reported stronger demand from small firms.  Furthermore, about half of domestic respondents noted increased inquiries from potential business borrowers.  Domestic banks that had experienced an increase in demand pointed to greater customer financing needs for inventories and accounts receivable as well as for investment in plant and equipment.  By contrast, foreign banks, on net, reported decreased demand for C&amp;I loans and indicated that customer borrowing had shifted to other banks or nonbank lenders and that customers' internally generated funds had increased.

Commercial real estate lending. In the April survey, 10 percent of domestic banks, on net, said that they had eased lending standards on commercial real estate loans, up a bit from the previous survey.  The percentage of domestic banks reporting increased demand for these loans also increased in the current survey, rising to 23 percent, up from 16 percent in January.  At foreign institutions, both commercial real estate lending standards and loan demand were reportedly unchanged on net.

Lending to Households

In the April survey, demand for residential real estate loans was little changed on net. Lending standards for residential real estate loans had been eased over the past three months by about 10 percent of respondents, on net, up somewhat from the previous survey.

The April survey asked banks about house price appreciation over the past year in the markets they served.  The responses were fairly diverse: About one-fourth of the respondents indicated that the average rate of increase had been less than 5 percent, around half of them reported that the growth rate had been between 5 percent and 10 percent, and the rest pointed to home price appreciation of more than 10 percent. Regarding the future, the banks expected price increases to moderate: About 60 percent of the banks expected home prices to grow less than 5 percent over the next year in the markets they serve, and almost all the rest expected appreciation of 5 percent to 10 percent.

The April survey also contained several questions about loan-to-value ratios for residential mortgage loans.  Banks reported that about 85 percent of the first-lien mortgages that they originated over the past year had loan-to-value ratios below 90 percent, and only 2 percent had ratios of 100 percent or more.  About 80 percent of the volume of second-lien mortgages and home equity loans that respondents had originated over the past year were to customers with a ratio of total mortgage debt to home value below 90 percent.  Only 5 percent were to customers with indebtedness ratios of 100 percent or more.  Banks that had originated loans in areas where home prices had been rising relatively quickly tended to have originated more loans,

III-A-3

especially second-lien and home equity loans, with lower loan-to-value ratios than banks that operated in markets with slower appreciation.  Indeed, at banks serving markets in which home prices rose 5 percent or less, 8 percent of second-lien mortgage and home equity loan originations were to borrowers with ratios of total mortgage debt to home value of 100 percent or more and 74 percent of originations were to borrowers with ratios of 90 percent or less.  By comparison, at banks originating loans in areas where homes had appreciated between 10 percent and 20 percent, these shares were 1 percent and 88 percent respectively.

In April, banks continued to indicate, on net, that they had become more willing to make consumer installment loans, although they reported that lending standards and most lending terms for consumer loans were basically unchanged.  Banks did, however, report having reduced the extent to which consumer loans other than credit card loans were granted to customers who did not meet credit-scoring thresholds.  Of the respondents, 22 percent reported that demand for consumer loans of all types had strengthened over the past three months.  By contrast, in the January survey, 13 percent of respondents, on net, indicated that demand had weakened.

Net Interest Margins

Special questions in the April survey asked banks how they had changed their investment and pricing behavior in response to the historically low level of short-term interest rates and to resulting pressure on their net interest margins.  On net, domestic banks indicated that these factors had not led them to change their desired levels of either credit risk or interest rate risk.  However, 21 percent of domestic banks, on net, indicated that they had increased fees charged to borrowers and depositors.  About 20 percent of foreign banks, on net, reported that they had taken on more credit risk.

U.S. International Transactions

Trade in Goods and Services

The U.S. international trade deficit in February narrowed from January's record high to $42.1 billion, its lowest level since November of last year.

<!-- missing-text -->

The value of exports of goods and services increased 4 percent in February, as services receipts rose 1.4 percent and exports of goods rose 5.1 percent from January levels.  The rise in exported goods was widespread across major categories of goods, with the largest increases in industrial supplies, aircraft, and other capital goods.  At an annual rate, the average for January and February of the value of exported goods and services was about 4 percent above the average for the fourth quarter of last year.  The increase was concentrated in industrial supplies and other capital goods, although exports of automotive products and consumer goods also rose.  Exports of agricultural goods, in contrast, fell, reflecting declines in exports of meats, partly owing to foreign bans on the import of U.S. beef, and soybeans.

The value of imports of goods and services rose 1.6 percent in February. Services payments rose 1.3 percent, and imports of goods increased 1.7 percent from January levels.  Within goods, imports of industrial supplies rose sharply; imports of automotive products also contributed to the overall increase.  Imports of aircraft, computers, and consumer goods, however, fell.  Oil imports rose 3.8 percent, with increases in both volume and price.  At an annual rate, the average for January and February of the value of imported goods and services was about 9 percent above the average for the fourth quarter of last year, a much slower pace than the 17 percent fourth-quarter rise.  The increase was driven

<!-- missing-text -->

largely by increases in imports of oil, industrial supplies, and other capital goods.  Imports of aircraft, automotive products, and consumer goods fell.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In March, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods rose 0.2 and 0.3 percent, respectively.  After a 1.7 percent increase in February, the price index for industrial supplies excluding oil rose another 1.1 percent in March, reflecting further price increases for building materials and unfinished metals.  Prices for foods, feeds and beverages rose 0.8 percent in March, largely because of higher prices for imported seafood.  Prices of capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and automotive products both edged up 0.1 percent.  Prices for consumer goods were unchanged.  Prices for computers and semiconductors fell 0.4 and 0.1 percent, respectively.  The average level of imported core goods prices in the first quarter was about 7¼ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level of last year; this is the largest percentage increase on a quarterly basis since the fourth quarter of 1988.  Much of this increase was concentrated in the commodity-intensive categories of industrial supplies and foods, feeds and beverages.

Oil. The BLS price of imported oil rose 6.1 percent in March, similar to the increase in the spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil, which averaged $36.75 per barrel.  After falling to less than $35 per barrel at the beginning of April, the spot price of WTI rebounded and has averaged about $36.60 per barrel so far this month.  Oil prices remained elevated because of strong oil demand, fueled by the recovery in world economic activity, OPEC's decision to cut its production target by 1 million barrels per day, and geopolitical concerns regarding Iraq and Venezuela.

Exports. In March, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods both increased 0.9 percent.  The price index for agricultural products rose 3.3 percent, reflecting higher prices for soybeans and corn.  Higher prices for exported metals and chemicals contributed to the 1.7 percent increase in nonagricultural industrial supplies.  The price indexes for all other categories of core goods were basically unchanged.  Prices of exported computers and semiconductors rose 0.8 and 0.6 percent, respectively.  The average level of exported core goods prices in the first quarter was about 8½ percent at an annual rate above the fourth-quarter level of last year, the highest pace of increase since the first quarter of 1995.  Nearly all of the increase reflected higher prices for agricultural products and industrial supplies.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign net purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) continued at a strong pace in February. Inflows into Treasury securities (line 4a) and corporate bonds (4c) accelerated

from already strong flows in January.  Foreign demand for agency securities (line 4b) appears to have recovered from last year's dip: private net purchases totaled about $30 billion in the first two months of 2004, compared with net sales of $48 billion last year.  Foreign purchases of equities (line 4d) slowed somewhat from January's vigorous pace to $5 billion.  A little over half of the inflow into equities in February reflected a merger-related stock swap.  These swaps are not directly captured in the monthly TIC data and are often overlooked in press reports.

Net foreign official inflows (line 1) were $30 billion in February, a bit of an easing from the remarkable $48 billion recorded in January, but well above the average monthly inflow in 2003.   Net foreign official inflows are on track to register a record increase in the first quarter, as partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicate that foreign official reserves in custody there increased by another $18 billion during March.  The majority of foreign official inflows continue to come from Japan.  FRBNY custody data indicate that Japanese inflows, which were especially large in the first half of March, remained strong through mid-April.  Foreign official demand for agency securities also appears to have recovered this year, as official net purchases of agencies totaled $10 billion in January and February, compared with $25 billion for all of 2003.

U.S. investors made modest net purchases of foreign securities in February (line 5), following sizable purchases in January.  As in January, net purchases of foreign equities (line 5b) more than offset net sales of foreign debt (line 5a).  In both months U.S. residents' equity purchases were concentrated in Japan.

The highly volatile banking sector (line 3) saw a net outflow in February, reversing much of the inflow recorded in January.  As is typical for the banking data, much of the monthly swing reflected a shifting of inter-bank funding positions, primarily against affiliated offices in Caribbean banking centers.

Foreign Financial Markets

The exchange value of the dollar, as measured by the major currencies index, rose 1¾ percent on net over the intermeeting period.  The index declined in the first two weeks following the March FOMC meeting but rose in early April. Market participants attributed the dollar's gain in April to releases of stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data, particularly the March employment report, and to speculation that the FOMC may tighten policy sooner than had previously been anticipated.

<!-- missing-text -->

The dollar appreciated 3 percent on net against the euro and 2½ percent against the Canadian dollar over the intermeeting period.  In contrast, the dollar depreciated almost 1 percent against the yen in highly volatile trading.  The dollar depreciated 6 percent against the yen in the first two weeks following the March FOMC meeting.  The dollar's movement against the yen appeared to coincide with a Nikkei news report that the Bank of Japan was 'weighing an exit strategy for its yen-weakening market interventions.'  The Japanese monetary authorities have, in fact, not intervened in the currency market since March 16.  Since early April, the dollar has almost fully rebounded from its earlier decline against the yen.

Long-term benchmark yields moved up 23 to 51 basis points in major foreign industrial countries, less than the 63-basis-point rise in the ten-year Treasury yield.  Much of the change occurred in early April following the March U.S. employment report.  Interest rates at the three-month tenor moved little over the intermeeting period in the major industrial countries, except in Canada and the United Kingdom.  The Bank of Canada cut its policy rate 25 basis points on April 13.  Although the policy decision had been anticipated, market participants interpreted the accompanying statement as being more bullish than had been expected, and medium- and long-term Canadian interest rates rose following the decision.  The Bank of England left its monetary policy stance unchanged, surprising some market participants who were expecting a 25-basispoint tightening.  Market participants are currently pricing in a 25-basis-point increase at the next meeting of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on May 6.  As had been widely expected, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan left their respective monetary policy stances unchanged during the intermeeting period.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Since the March FOMC meeting, broad share price indexes in most major industrial economies have risen 1 to 7 percent, with the Japanese market registering the largest gain.  Better-than-expected Japanese economic data were cited as factors supporting the gain in the Japanese equity market.

Over the intermeeting period, the dollar gained ½ percent on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The Mexican peso depreciated 3 percent against the dollar; Mexican share prices rose 8¼ percent.  The central bank of Mexico unexpectedly tightened its policy stance on April 27, citing declines in the 28-day Cetes rate after the bank left policy unchanged at its previous biweekly policy-setting meeting on April 23. The bank noted that a decrease in rates was incompatible with its stated goals for inflation.  The Brazilian central bank cut its policy rate 25 basis points twice over the intermeeting period.  Brazil's EMBI+ spread over Treasuries rose about 80 basis points, in part on concerns about the Brazilian government's

ability to achieve fiscal austerity.  The Brazilian real was little changed on net against the dollar.  The exchange value of the dollar against the currencies of the emerging Asian economies has changed little on net since the March FOMC meeting.

.  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Indicators for the first quarter suggest continued growth in the industrial countries, but at a more moderate rate than that of late last year.  In Japan, strong exports and a marked increase in business sentiment point toward continued growth, although recent readings on several other indicators have been somewhat less buoyant.  In Canada, growth appears to have slowed from the brisk inventory-led pace of the fourth quarter, notwithstanding some firming in consumer expenditures, while evidence points to still sluggish growth in the euro area.  In the United Kingdom, the preliminary GDP release for the first quarter showed growth softening a bit from its rapid fourth-quarter pace, but housing prices have continued to move up.

Consumer price inflation remained low.  Twelve-month headline inflation in Canada fell under the 1 percent lower bound of the Bank of Canada's inflation target band in February and March.  Inflation in the euro area remained below the ECB's 2 percent ceiling in March, while in the United Kingdom inflation slipped further below the Bank of England's 2 percent inflation target.  Slight CPI deflation persisted in Japan.

In early April, the Bank of Canada eased monetary policy for the third time this year, citing the need to support aggregate demand.

In Japan , indicators suggest that the economy continued to expand in the first quarter, albeit at a more moderate pace than last year.  Real exports rose 2.2 percent for the quarter, while real imports increased slightly.  Household expenditures posted solid gains in January and February on average, and new car registrations jumped during the first quarter.  Industrial production edged up in March, bringing average production for the first quarter 0.3 percent above the fourth-quarter level.  The broader all-industries index of output was flat in January and February on average compared with the fourth-quarter, as services sector output edged down.  Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business fixed investment, declined sharply in January and rebounded only moderately in February following hefty increases late last year

Recent readings on labor market conditions have been mixed.  In February, the unemployment rate remained at 5 percent.  The job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of employment, was unchanged, but remained at a ten-year high.  Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) rose 0.1 percent in March from the previous month but were down 0.1 percent from a year earlier.  Wholesale prices were up 0.2 percent in March compared with the same month a year ago, the first increase on a twelve-month basis since July 2000.  Average nationwide land prices were

down 5.6 percent in January from a year ago, though prices in parts of Tokyo have stopped falling.

The Bank of Japan's Tankan index of business conditions rose in March, with the level of the aggregate diffusion index for business sentiment among firms of all sizes and across all industries increasing to -5 from -11 in December.  The closely-watched index for large manufacturers improved to 12 from 7 in December.  The strengthening in the aggregate index in March was broadly based, with increases for both manufacturers and non-manufacturers across all firm sizes, suggesting that economic recovery is gradually spreading from export-related industries to other sectors.

In the euro area , economic indicators for the first quarter were mixed, indicative of continued sluggish growth.  Industrial production in January and February was on average slightly below the fourth-quarter level.  German

industrial production unexpectedly posted its first drop in five months in February, whereas French industrial production rose 0.8 percent after falling 0.5 percent the previous month.  The volume of retail trade in the euro area fell by 0.8 percent in February, partially reversing a sharp increase in January.  The purchasing manager's index (PMI) for the euro-area manufacturing sector rose in March, while the PMI for services fell.

Survey measures for April point towards increased optimism in the second quarter.  The German IFO business climate index rose in April, reversing most of its March decline. The Belgian business confidence index rose in both months. An evaluation of the IFO responses received before and after the March 11 terrorist attack in Madrid did not reveal any differences.  Italian consumer confidence had declined in the days of polling that took place immediately after the Madrid bombing, but in April the index rebounded to levels close to those prior to the attack.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation rose slightly in March to 1.7 percent, remaining below the ECB's 2 percent target ceiling.  Core inflation, excluding energy, food, alcohol, and tobacco was 1.8 percent in March.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom expanded 2.6 percent in the first quarter according to the preliminary estimate, with a wide divergence in performance across sectors.  Industrial production is estimated to have fallen around 2 percent, with only energy output rising slightly.  However, service sector output climbed more than 3 percent.  In particular, output of the retail services and the hotels and restaurants sectors grew strongly.  April's industrial survey, suggests expansion in the manufacturing sector, though the survey and actual data have diverged in recent months.  Business confidence fell in April, but remained relatively high.

According to the two leading private surveys, housing price inflation has picked up in recent months, with the average twelve-month rise at around 18 percent in March.  Household net mortgage and consumer borrowing in February remained elevated.

The labor market continued to be tight, as both the official-claims-based and the labor-force-survey measures of the unemployment rate remained near their lowest points since 1975.  The twelve-month CPI inflation rate slipped further to 1.1 percent in March and is well below the Bank of England's 2 percent target.

The government released a new budget plan on March 17, leaving unchanged the projection for Public Sector Net Borrowing (PSNB) for 2003-04 at £37½ billion (almost 3½ percent of GDP) and revising up slightly the projection for 2004-05 and 2005-06 to £33 billion and £31 billion (2.8 and 2.5 percent of GDP, respectively).  The government reaffirmed its expectation that real GDP will expand 3 to 3½ percent in both 2004 and 2005.

In Canada , a sharp gain in retail sales in January and February indicates that domestic demand firmed in the first quarter.  However, a corresponding decline in February wholesale trade implies that retailers are running down the substantial inventories accumulated at the end of last year, suggesting that inventories are likely to make a negative contribution to growth.

Other indicators for the first quarter were mixed.  Housing starts decreased 3 percent in the first quarter, as colder-than-usual weather depressed construction in January and February; however, starts bounced back to their second-highest level in 16 years in March.  Employment fell in both February and March, leading to a small increase in the unemployment rate.  While both exports and imports increased in February, following declines in January.

In March, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation remained at 0.7 percent, as energy base effects had a substantial negative impact.  Twelvemonth core inflation, excluding food, energy, and indirect taxes, edged up to 1.1 percent.

On April 13, the Bank of Canada lowered the targeted overnight rate (its key policy rate) and the Bank Rate 25 basis points each, to 2 percent and 2¼ percent, respectively.  The Bank stated that it expected output to return to its potential level by the third quarter of 2005 and inflation to reach the 2 percent mid-point of the Bank's 1 to 3 percent target band by the end of 2005.

The government released a new budget on March 23, outlining a small increase in spending, primarily directed towards increased transfers to provinces and municipalities, but maintaining projected budget surpluses over the next three years.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Economic activity across the developing countries continues to be boosted by strong export performance, reflecting rising global high-tech demand, strength in the United States and China, and-in some cases-higher commodity prices.  In Asia, output has soared as a result of booming exports, although domestic demand continues to lag outside of China.  In Latin America, economic conditions have been mixed.  While, in Mexico, recovery appears to be taking hold, the economic situation is more tenuous in Brazil, and political tensions still afflict Venezuela.  For both regions, inflation remains generally modest.

Chinese real GDP surged more than 15 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter, according to staff estimates, with domestic investment increasing over 40 percent.  This strong performance has fueled concerns there may be excessive investment in some sectors, and the government has raised bank reserve requirements twice since mid-March.  Growth in lending has hovered around 20 percent on a twelve-month basis, down slightly from the peak reached late last summer when the first reserve requirement increase was implemented.  Exports have also steamed ahead, up 34 percent in the first quarter (four-quarter change), while imports rose more than 40 percent over the same period.  The trade balance showed a small surplus on a seasonally adjusted basis, but an $8 billion deficit on a non-seasonally adjusted basis.  The latter figure has been used by Chinese authorities to bolster their case against any near-term changes to the country's exchange rate regime.

Some analysts fear that the Chinese authorities are losing control of the money supply and inflation, in part because of difficulties in sterilizing massive foreign exchange inflows that have averaged more than $10 billion a month for well over a year.  In addition, some indices of raw materials prices have registered significant increases.  Consumer prices in the first quarter, however, rose a relatively modest 2.8 percent on a twelve-month basis; non-food prices remained flat, while food prices were up about 8 percent.  Overall producer price increases have also been mild.  In mid-April, Chinese authorities reported that there were several suspected cases of SARS in China.  So far, this outbreak appears minor and to be under control.

Recent data from Hong Kong indicate continuing strong growth.  Booming tourism has boosted retail sales considerably and improved consumer confidence.  In addition, after falling for most of the last five years, property prices have now risen for six consecutive months.  Exports and imports are up, supported by trade with China.  The unemployment rate declined to 7.2 percent and is now below the rate that prevailed before the SARS epidemic.  Consumer prices have risen on average over the last two quarters, although twelve-month changes have continued to show deflation.

Taiwan's economy is growing rapidly.  Recent data show that industrial production picked up again in February and March after falling in January. High-tech production has surged in recent months, despite gyrations in other sectors.  Driven by demand from China and the strong global market for high-tech goods, trade has been booming; exports, new orders for exports, and imports reached new highs in March.  The unemployment rate fell to 4½ percent in March, its lowest level since the end of the previous high-tech boom in mid-2001.  Consumer prices have turned positive with twelve-month inflation close to 1 percent in March.  The contested mid-March re-election of President Chen appears to be having little economic effect.

Data for Korea since the last Greenbook have been generally strong.  Output surged 11.3 percent in the fourth quarter, and previous quarters were revised up. Fourth-quarter performance across sectors was unbalanced, however, with exports soaring while private consumption fell almost 2 percent.  This uneven growth has continued into the first quarter.  The trade surplus was $40 billion at an annual rate in the first quarter, almost double the 2003 average, spurred by recovery in the high-tech sector and trade with China.  Exports helped boost average industrial production in January and February to 3.8 percent above the previous quarter.  On the other hand, retail sales and confidence indicators remained well off their mid-2002 peaks.  In March, the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.4 percent, and twelve-month inflation edged down to 3.1 percent.

On March 12, Korea's parliament impeached President Roh for allegedly violating electoral laws by making statements in support of the Uri Party, made

up of his core supporters.  He was then automatically suspended from office for up to six months pending a ruling by Korea's Constitutional Court.  Backlash against the impeachment resulted in a strong victory for the Uri Party in Korea's April 15 parliamentary elections.  This victory is expected by some to speed the court's decision on the validity of the impeachment and, should the ruling be in his favor, to help remove congressional obstacles to the reform agenda of President Roh.

The ASEAN economies have continued to grow strongly.  Despite recent monthly declines in some countries, industrial production has posted significant gains across the region, largely driven by buoyant global high-tech demand.  In Malaysia, where production declined in February, the January-February average was up about 5 percent over the fourth-quarter average.  Similarly, in Singapore, despite a sharp decline in March, production was up more than 7 percent on average in the first quarter.  Export growth generally remains robust in these countries.  Imports have been increasing sharply as well, resulting in roughly stable trade balances in Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines, and declining balances most recently in Singapore and Thailand.  Inflation has picked up slightly in across most of the region, but remains well-contained.

In Mexico, recent data suggest that economic growth may be moderating somewhat after a robust fourth quarter.  Overall economic activity, a monthly proxy for real GDP, declined in both January and February, although other indicators show more strength.  Industrial production slipped a bit in February but remained above the fourth-quarter average.  Exports increased rapidly in the first quarter, indicating that demand from the United States continues to buoy the Mexican economy.  Mexican consumer spending has begun to be a source of strength as well; retail sales rose in January and February to an average level 1.4 percent above the fourth-quarter average.  In addition, although the unemployment rate remains elevated, manufacturing employment has stabilized after more than three years of declines and consumer sentiment turned up in March.

The Bank of Mexico raised the Corto on April 27, after market interest rates fell more than desired by the central bank following its April 23 decision to leave policy unchanged.  On net, three-month interest rates have declined 50 basis points since mid-March, to about 6 percent, reflecting reduced market expectations about the pace of future monetary tightening.  Mexican twelvemonth consumer price inflation eased to 4.2 percent in March, as food prices fell back after surging in previous months.

In Brazil , recent indicators-including a major revision to the industrial production series-suggest that growth slowed in the first quarter.  A bright spot, however, has been the continued good performance in the external sector, supported by higher world commodity prices and the competitive level of the exchange rate.  Inflation declined in March to under 6 percent on a twelvemonth basis, within this year's target range of 5½ percent, plus or minus 2½ percent.

Doubts regarding the government's commitment to fiscal and other economic reforms have grown in the face of political pressures to raise the minimum wage substantially and dissent within President Lula's party.  The Brazilian central bank reduced its policy rate 25 basis points at each of its mid-March and mid-April meetings. The Selic is now at 16 percent.

Recent data indicate continuing economic recovery in Argentina .  Real GDP jumped over 10 percent at an annual rate in the fourth quarter, supported by strong exports and rising consumer demand.  Industrial production rose 1.3 percent in March and was up over 15 percent from its year-earlier level, on the back of large gains in the printing, automobile, and mineral product industries.  However, the country is now facing electricity shortages--utility price controls, as well as general economic disruption, over the past few years have limited investment in the energy sector.  Argentina has continued to run sizable trade surpluses, reflecting rapid growth of agricultural exports.  Twelvemonth consumer price inflation remained low in March, at 2.3 percent.

After last-minute negotiations, Argentina made a $3 billion debt payment to the IMF in early March.  Subsequently, on March 22, the IMF Board unanimously approved the second performance review of Argentina's three-year standby program.  The Argentine authorities now appear to be somewhat more committed to making progress on debt restructuring.  In particular, the government has appointed six investment banks as advisors to assist in the restructuring and recently met with creditor groups.

In Venezuela, the little economic news available since the last Greenbook suggests activity remains depressed, following last year's rebound from devastating strikes.  Oil production is still believed to be about 15 percent below pre-strike levels.  Furthermore, observers are concerned about the ability of the government-owned oil company (stripped by Chavez of much of its professional workforce) to sustain current production levels.  Political stalemate continues between President Chavez and the opposition.  In particular, the dispute continues over whether the opposition has enough valid signatures to initiate a recall referendum.  Political interference by Chavez in this process has made analysts skeptical that a referendum will be held this year.
