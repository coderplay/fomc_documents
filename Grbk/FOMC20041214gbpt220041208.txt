Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Overview

Economic activity continues to expand at a moderate rate.  Real consumer spending excluding motor vehicles has increased at a solid pace in recent months, and shipments of capital goods have remained on a steep uptrend.  Taken together, the employment gains in October and November indicate that the labor market continues to improve gradually, and manufacturing production has-aside from hurricane-induced volatility-expanded at a modest pace in recent months.  Core consumer price inflation remains subdued, but overall consumer price inflation has been boosted by higher energy price inflation.

Labor Market Developments

After posting a robust gain of 279,000 in October, private nonfarm payroll employment rose 104,000 last month.  Smoothing through the recent swings, the three-month moving average of monthly employment changes has moved up since the middle of the year and currently stands at 160,000.

By industry, employment in retail trade turned down in November, as seasonal hiring was relatively weak.  In contrast, construction employment rose again last month after an outsized increase in October, when hiring was boosted by hurricane-related repair work. Employment in professional and business services, nonbusiness services, and financial services also experienced solid gains in the past two months, while manufacturing jobs edged down.

Despite continued growth in employment, aggregate hours of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls fell 0.2 percent in November, as the workweek edged down 0.1 hour, to 33.7 hours.  Aggregate hours last month stood 0.3 percent above their third-quarter average.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate ticked down to 5.4 percent last month, while the labor force participation rate moved up 0.2 percentage point, to 66.1 percent. The employment-population ratio, which combines these two series, rose 0.2 percentage point in November, to 62.5 percent, a level still well below its peak in 2000 and a bit below its average level in the mid-1990s.  The number of persons working part-time for economic reasons as a share of total employment fell in November but remained close to the highs reached last year.  Although these indicators improved last month, they still suggest that some measurable slack remains in the labor market.

Labor Output per Hour

<!-- missing-text -->

Layoffs appear to have changed little of late.  The four-week moving average of initial claims for unemployment insurance remained near 340,000 in recent weeks, close to the narrow range that has prevailed since the spring.  In addition, layoff announcements have been relatively flat, on balance, in recent months.

Hiring indicators have been mixed in recent months.  The exhaustion rate-the share of individuals who exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits without finding a jobhas been trending down this year, while the job openings rate published by the BLS has continued to move up, on net.  In contrast, the BLS hires rate has moved sideways in the past few months after some improvement earlier in the year, and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported that, after some tightening early this year, vacancies have not recently become appreciably harder to fill.  Finally, the NFIB index of hiring plans and the Conference Board's measure of individuals' perceptions of jobs also have both been flat recently.

The staff estimates that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 1.4 percent in the third quarter, about 0.4 percentage point less than the published figure.   Over the four quarters ending last quarter, productivity advanced about 1 3 percent, a considerable step-down from its elevated, 5¼ percent pace over the comparable period four quarters earlier.  In the nonfinancial corporate sector, output per

hour rose about 3 percent over the most recent four quarters, down noticeably from the 6¼ percent increase posted over the previous four-quarter period.

Industrial Production

After smoothing through the effects of weather-related disruptions, activity in the industrial sector has advanced at a moderate pace in recent months.  From July to October, industrial production (IP) moved up, on average, 0.4 percent per month. 2 Production worker hours for November, coupled with the physical product data in hand, suggest that production expanded a little more slowly last month.  Although many manufacturing industries are still operating below capacity, the overall factory operating rate continued to rebound; with the increase anticipated in November, it will have returned to about the level observed in early 2001. 3

According to Ward's latest estimates, motor vehicle assemblies held steady in November at an annual rate of 12 million units.  Schedules currently call for production to move up a bit further in December and again in the first quarter of next year.  Given the current inventory situation, the scheduled production increase is a little puzzling, and an underbuild in the first quarter of next year would be neither surprising nor unusual.

The production of high-tech goods advanced at a below-par pace in the third quarter, with semiconductor production having been particularly lackluster last quarter.  Further, semiconductor output increased only 1 percent in October, a pace well below the average monthly increase of about 3 percent recorded over the past ten years.  Accordingly, capacity utilization at semiconductor-making plants slipped further, to 74 percent in October, a level more than 20 percentage points below the recent peak in February. Much of the slowdown likely reflected efforts by Intel and others to work down an undesired buildup of inventories that began last spring.  However, Intel has reported a noticeable acceleration in demand and a significant reduction in inventories this quarter, both of which bode well for production in coming months.

Apart from semiconductors, the rise in production of high-tech equipment has been uneven.  The production of communications equipment posted a small gain in October after having jumped at an annual rate of 23½ percent in the third quarter.  Moreover, available indicators suggest a guarded near-term outlook, with contacts at Cisco and elsewhere in the industry reporting that firms are not yet investing heavily in nextgeneration communications technologies.  Meanwhile, the output of computer equipment has recorded only modest gains in recent months, although Gartner's latest forecast of unit PC sales suggests that production may now be accelerating a little.

In the energy sector, production at utilities increased 0.7 percent in October after a weather-related jump of 5.3 percent in September.  However, weekly electricity generation data suggest that output at utilities fell in November.  Mining activity-which was pulled down in September by hurricane-related shutdowns at oil rigs and refineriesrebounded somewhat in October.  Available data suggest a further advance in November, though damage to pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico is expected to continue to restrain mining output for several more months.

The output of business equipment expanded at a solid pace in October, continuing the robust gains seen over the last three quarters.  The October rise owed largely to gains in industrial and other machinery.  In addition, materials output continued to advance in

October.  The production of construction and business supplies also rose briskly, and the available data for November suggest that output in these categories was well maintained last month.

On balance, forward-looking indicators suggest that manufacturing activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace in the near term.  The Institute for Supply Management's diffusion index of new orders rose to 61.5 in November, a level consistent with ongoing gains in manufacturing output.  The diffusion indexes of new orders published by the Federal Reserve Banks also remain elevated.  Moreover, announced layoffs within the manufacturing sector returned to the low end of the range that has prevailed since the beginning of the year.  In contrast, the three-month moving-average of the staff's series on real adjusted durable goods orders, which rose only 0.2 percent in October, points to smaller increases in production in coming months than would be suggested by the other indicators.

Motor Vehicles

Sales of new motor vehicles dropped to an annual rate of 16.3 million units in November, down from 16.9 million units in October and 17.5 million units in September. Automakers had boosted incentives significantly in late September to help clear out 2004-model vehicles.  Since then, however, as more 2005-model vehicles have entered the sales mix, the average incentive per light vehicle sold has fallen by about $550.  This decline in average incentives, combined with high gasoline prices, caused consumers' perceptions of motor vehicle buying conditions to deteriorate sharply in November, according to the Michigan Survey Research Center.

Looking ahead, some industry analysts have speculated that elevated inventories of light vehicles will prompt the automakers to launch a new round of incentives in December rather than cut back on production.  If this were to occur, sales could surge near the close of the year.

Consumer Spending

Real PCE grew at a robust annual rate of 5 percent in the third quarter, pushed up by a surge in motor vehicles purchases and solid gains in other categories.  Excluding motor vehicles, real PCE appears to be growing at a decent pace in the current quarter as well, with this component of consumption up 0.4 percent in October.  Real spending for durable goods excluding motor vehicles inched up in October, while real expenditures for nondurable goods rose at a moderate rate.  At the same time, expenditures on services

continued to increase briskly.  More recently, anecdotal evidence and weekly data on chain store sales suggest that the holiday shopping season got off to a somewhat disappointing start.

Real disposable income advanced just 0.2 percent in October.  Although nominal wages and salaries posted another sizable increase, real earnings were held back by a jump in energy prices.  Rent and proprietors' income, which had been restrained in the third quarter by uninsured losses from the hurricanes, rebounded strongly in October. Nevertheless, the personal saving rate fell to 0.2 percent in October, down from its meager 0.5 percent level in the third quarter.   The drop in the saving rate probably 4 reflects, at least in part, the rise in the ratio of household wealth to income since the beginning of the year.  And recent increases in stock prices and ongoing gains in house prices have likely provided continuing support to consumption spending this quarter.

The Michigan SRC's index of consumer sentiment edged up in November, lifted by a slightly more favorable outlook for current and expected conditions.  Although the Conference Board's index of consumer confidence has drifted downward recently, both sentiment measures remain roughly consistent with solid spending gains.

Housing Markets

Starts of single-family homes rebounded to an annual rate of 1.65 million units in October, a bit above the third-quarter average.  However, the signal about housing activity from the October data on permits was not as strong:  The number of permits issued-after adjusting for activity in areas where they are not required-slipped in October and was noticeably below the level of starts.  Multifamily starts climbed to an annual rate of 382,000 units in October, also above the third-quarter average.

Home sales remained near record levels in October, and recent indicators suggest that demand will remain at an elevated level in the near term.  Mortgage rates remain quite low by historical standards.  In addition, although the four-week moving average of the Mortgage Bankers Association index of mortgage applications for home purchasewhich trended up from July to early November-has edged down recently, it remains at a very high level.  In contrast, the Michigan Survey's index of homebuying sentiment has drifted lower, on balance, in recent months.

Home prices continue to rise rapidly and by one prominent measure have accelerated sharply of late.  The repeat-transactions price index for existing homes, which partly controls for the composition of homes sold, soared 13 percent in the third quarter from a year earlier, more than twice as much as the comparable reading from last year.  The repeat-transactions price index is based both on actual prices of existing homes that are sold and on the appraised values of homes for which the primary mortgage is refinanced. 5 A version of the index that excludes the appraised values from refinancings-which are not sales prices-was up 10¼ percent in the third quarter from a year earlier and shows a smoother acceleration in recent years.  Nevertheless, both indexes indicate that home prices have increased significantly in recent years, with the cumulative increases since the early 1990s being broadly similar.  For new homes, the constant-quality price indexwhich controls for changes in the geographic composition of sales, home size, and a few other readily measurable attributes-moved up 6¼ percent in the third quarter from a year earlier.

Equipment and Software

Real outlays for equipment and software are estimated to have advanced at a brisk annual rate of 17¼ percent in the third quarter.  The growth of investment spending appears to have slowed in the current quarter, but the gains in most categories remain quite robust; shipments of nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft rose considerably in October. In addition, the underlying fundamentals remain sound.  Growth of business output has been solid, the user cost of capital has remained low-held down by low interest rates and, through year-end, by the partial-expensing tax provision-and the corporate sector retains an ample stock of liquid assets.  Anecdotal reports are also consistent with ongoing expansion in business spending.

Spending on high-tech gear appears poised to post a solid rise in the current quarter, after a more modest gain in the third quarter.  Although nominal shipments of domestically produced communications equipment have been relatively flat, on net, in recent months, shipments of computers jumped at a monthly rate of more than 8 percent in October on top of a nearly 3 percent increase in September. 6

Business investment in transportation equipment-which rose smartly in the previous two quarters-is likely to be held down this quarter by a retreat in spending for light vehicles.  In contrast, medium and heavy truck sales rose in October to an annual rate of more than 450,000 units, and orders continue to run well ahead of sales; sales have moved up notably since the beginning of this year as demand for freight services has remained elevated.  Although real business spending on aircraft remains well below its peak of a few years ago, October data on nominal shipments of aircraft by domestic producers suggest continued firming in this component of investment.

Outside of the high-tech and transportation sectors, spending appears to have continued to expand at a robust pace, with real investment in this category having jumped 19½ percent in the third quarter after a sizable gain in the first half of the year.  In addition, nominal shipments moved up a good bit further in October.  Some portion of the recent strength appears likely to reflect the incentive to invest before the partialexpensing tax provision expires at the end of this year.  As noted in the November Greenbook, investment in the types of equipment in this category benefits especially from the tax incentive because the associated equipment tends to depreciate slowly.

Nonresidential Construction

Real outlays on nonresidential structures were about flat, on net, during the first three quarters of the year, and nominal spending slipped a bit in October.   Nevertheless, other 7 indicators of market conditions show, on balance, some signs of improvement.  For retail buildings, property values and rents have been rising, and vacancy rates have remained low; for warehouses, property values also have been appreciating, and rents recently turned up.  In contrast, office rents have generally been declining for four years, and the vacancy rate, although down a bit recently, remains high.  The vacancy rate for industrial structures also remains high by historical standards.  Investment in drilling and mining structures has ramped up in recent quarters in response to elevated prices for natural gas. The number of rigs drilling for natural gas moved up further in the past few months, suggesting that investment continued to increase at the end of the year.

Business Inventories

Real nonfarm inventories excluding finished motor vehicles expanded at an annual rate of about $52 billion in the third quarter.  The scant data we have for October are largely confined to the manufacturing sector and suggest that inventories were accumulating at a moderate pace early this quarter.  In particular, the book value of manufacturers' inventories rose at an annual rate of about $26 billion in October, led by another sizable rise in inventories at primary metals producers and a resumption of stockbuilding by computer manufacturers.  However, manufacturers' shipments also rose, and the inventory-shipments ratio held steady.

Data from the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system indicate that inventories increased in October after having declined in September and that overall days' supply of inventories edged down further.  Nonetheless, inventories are estimated to have remained elevated relative to consumption for a few products, including motor vehicles, semiconductors, paper, and chemicals excluding pharmaceuticals.

Federal Government Sector

After a series of continuing resolutions, the Congress recently completed its work on regular budget appropriations for fiscal 2005, passing an omnibus spending bill covering most discretionary outlays.  The omnibus package excluded appropriations for defense and homeland security, which had been enacted earlier.  Budget authority for the areas covered by the omnibus bill is slated to increase about 1 percent from the level in fiscal 2004, which would keep funding for all discretionary categories at the level proposed by the President early this year.

After adjusting for shifts in the timing of payments, the federal government posted a deficit of $63 billion in October, about the same as the deficit a year earlier.  On an adjusted basis, both outlays and receipts were close to their year-earlier levels.  Daily data through November point to a lull in the pace of military spending in the fourth quarter after a year of rapid growth.

State and Local Governments

Recent indicators are consistent with a moderate strengthening of spending by state and local governments.  Employment rose 5,000 in November after even larger gains in the preceding two months.  Nominal outlays for construction projects rose at a solid monthly rate of 1½ percent in October, pushing the level of outlays back into the elevated range seen earlier in the year.  The level of activity had dipped in August and September,

particularly for highway construction; it was likely held down, in part, by the hurricanes that hit the southeastern states in those months.

The fiscal stance of state governments continues to show signs of improvement.  A recent survey by the National Conference of State Legislatures on budget conditions through the first four months of the fiscal year indicates that revenue inflows are continuing to strengthen, a reading consistent with other reports.   In particular, almost all the states 8 reported that revenues for fiscal 2005 are coming in at or above target, and only a handful of states are reporting shortfalls in their general fund budgets.  However, the states continue to face pressures from Medicaid, the expiration of temporary tax increases, and the need to restore depleted reserve funds, and consequently many state governments are concerned that fiscal difficulties could reemerge in fiscal 2006.

Prices

Overall consumer prices jumped 0.6 percent in October, as hurricane damage contributed to higher prices of food and energy.  October's increase boosted the twelve-month change in the CPI to 3¼ percent, up from 2 percent in the year-earlier period.  In contrast, core consumer prices continued to increase at a more modest rate; the core CPI rose 0.2 percent in October, leaving the twelve-month change at 2 percent, about ¾ percentage point more than in the preceding year. 9 The core PCE price index increased 1½ percent during the twelve months ending in October, only ¼ percentage point more than in the preceding year.  In part, the smaller acceleration in core PCE prices reflects differences in measured medical services inflation and a deceleration in nonmarket prices that are included in the PCE index but not in the CPI. 10

Consumer energy prices moved up 4.2 percent in October, more than reversing the declines of the previous three months.  The October increase was driven in large part by refinery outages and a surge in the prices of petroleum and petroleum products associated with production losses in the wake of Hurricane Ivan.  Gasoline inventories, which were plentiful before the storm, fell to normal levels, and wholesale markups jumped in

October.  Survey data suggest that retail gasoline prices declined in November, likely in response to the $5 to $6 per barrel fall in spot prices of crude oil between late October and mid-November.  In the past week, gasoline margins have spiked again as a further large fall in crude oil prices has not yet been passed through to retail prices.  Retail prices of heating oil, which account for only a small part of energy costs, were more severely affected than were gasoline prices by the hurricane-related outages because heating oil inventories were thinner than gasoline inventories before the storm.

Consumer prices for natural gas increased 0.6 percent in October, likely because of increased demand owing to substitution away from high-priced fuel oil.  However, in early to mid-November, with gas storage caverns near capacity, spot prices for natural gas fell, reversing the previous month's rise.  Although these prices have moved up again recently, the ample supplies suggest that prices of residential natural gas this winter are unlikely to spike as they did in February 2003.

Consumer food prices increased 0.6 percent in October, as damage to fruit and vegetable crops from the four hurricanes that hit Florida in August and September boosted prices for these items.  The effects of the hurricanes were most pronounced for tomatoes and citrus, for which prices jumped 25 percent and 11 percent, respectively.  These prices should drop during the next few months as California citrus and Florida tomato crops become available.  Over the twelve months ending in October, food prices rose 3½ percent, an acceleration of ½ percentage point from a year earlier.

As indicated previously, the twelve-month change in the core CPI has picked up about ¾ percentage point over the past year.  This acceleration reflects a flattening of core goods prices after a decline of 2½ percent in the year-earlier period.  In contrast, the rate of increase in core services prices was little changed from a year ago.

According to the Michigan Survey, median expectations for inflation over the coming year returned to 2.8 percent in November, reversing the October uptick.  Median expectations for inflation over the next five to ten years edged down a tenth, to 2.7 percent, and remained within the narrow range reported over the past several years.

Price inflation for capital equipment has continued to trend upward since hitting a bottom in 2002.  In October, the PPI for capital equipment moved up 0.4 percent for the second consecutive month.  Over the past twelve months, capital equipment prices have risen

about 2 percent, compared with an increase of only ½ percent during the year-earlier period.  The pickup has been widespread across most types of capital equipment.

Prices continue to rise rapidly at earlier stages of processing.  Over the twelve months ending in October, the PPI for intermediate materials excluding food and energy rose 7¾ percent.  Nevertheless, the most recent reading, a 0.3 percent increase in October, was a step down from jumps of 0.7 percent in September and 1 percent in August.  The recent increases in prices at this stage of processing seem broadly consistent with movements in energy costs, capacity utilization, and prices of imported materials and supplies. Meanwhile, the index for core crude materials climbed 5½ percent in October, boosted by a run-up in metals prices.  Since the November Greenbook, the Journal of Commerce metals index has fallen 0.7 percent.  The CRB spot industrials index (which excludes energy) has risen 2.9 percent over this period.

Labor Costs

Average hourly earnings growth rose 0.1 percent in November and about 2½ percent over the past twelve months, a pickup of ¼ percentage point from the year-earlier period. Measures of overall compensation showed moderate increases over the year ending in the third quarter of 2004; compensation per hour -as reported in the BLS Productivity and Costs release -was up 4 percent, and the employment cost index was up 3¾ percent. 11 The markup of prices over unit labor costs remained somewhat elevated for both the nonfarm business sector and the nonfinancial corporate sector.

The incoming information on benefits pertains mainly to health insurance costs, which appear to be decelerating after the outsized increases of the past few years.  As noted in the November Greenbook, the twelve-month change in the health insurance component of the ECI, which was running about 10 percent in 2002 and 2003, dropped to 7¼ percent in September.  The results of the major surveys of employer-sponsored health plans spanned a wide range in 2004:  The latest survey from Mercer Human Resources Consulting showed premiums rising only 7½ percent this year, while other prominent surveys reported advances of more than 10 percent.  In general, however, the surveys confirmed that increases in health insurance costs in 2004 were smaller than those in 2003, and they point to a further moderation in 2005.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview 1

Expectations for the path of monetary policy over the next several quarters edged a bit higher over the intermeeting period in response to comments by Fed officials that pointed to higher rates and to some worries about greater near-term inflationary pressure.  Shortterm Treasury yields rose somewhat, but ten-year Treasury yields were unchanged on net. Corporate bond spreads narrowed a bit further, and stock prices posted a moderate gain. Total net business borrowing has picked up in recent months, and household debt growth remained brisk last quarter.

Policy Expectations and Interest Rates

The decision by the FOMC to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at the November meeting had been widely anticipated and the accompanying statement was in line with expectations.  Despite the weaker-than-expected employment report released on December 3, investors still expect a firmer pace of tightening over coming months owing to higher-than-expected inflation data, remarks by the Chairman providing what was viewed to be an unusually stark warning of future rate increases, the ongoing depreciation of the dollar, and perhaps the beneficial effects of the drop in oil prices for economic growth.  Current quotes on federal funds futures suggest that investors are nearly certain of a quarter-point tightening at the December meeting and expect tightening at two out of the first three meetings in 2005.

The upward revision in policy expectations showed through to short- and intermediateterm Treasury yields, with two- and five-year yields up about 15 and 10 basis points, respectively, over the period.  Ten-year Treasury yields finished the period unchanged; yields had risen earlier in the period on speculation about official intervention in support of the dollar and reports that foreign official institutions were contemplating paring their holdings of Treasuries, but then had dropped sharply on the latest employment report. TIPS yields edged a bit lower, implying about a 10 basis point rise in inflation compensation over the next five years.  Market participants pointed to higher-than-

expected inflation releases and dollar depreciation as factors contributing to the rise.  In contrast, inflation compensation five to ten years ahead was little changed.

Corporate Yields and Risk Spreads

Spreads on investment-grade and speculative-grade corporate bonds edged down about 5 to 10 basis points over the intermeeting period.  A decomposition of the high-yield spread into the compensation for expected losses and the implied risk premium suggests that the compensation for risk has shrunk notably in the past couple of quarters and now has moved back down to the range of low values reached in the mid 1990s.  The spread of lower-quality commercial paper over top-rated CP issues rose only slightly as the maturity date of thirty-day issues crossed year-end, indicating that expectations of yearend pressures remain muted.

Stock Prices, Corporate Earnings, and Credit Quality

Building on the sizable gains logged between the close of last month's Greenbook and the FOMC meeting, broad stock price indexes rose another 1 to 2 percent over the intermeeting period, in part from lower oil prices.  Implied volatility on both the Nasdaq 100 and S&amp;P 500 remained low.  The gap between the twelve-month forward earningsprice ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and the synthetic long-run real Treasury yield, a rough measure of the equity premium, remained at a level close to its average over the past two decades.

November's spate of third-quarter earnings reports from retailers essentially met investor expectations and brought the reporting season to a close.  S&amp;P 500 operating earnings per share came in about 15 percent above results from four quarters earlier, implying a slight quarter-to-quarter gain.  Absent hurricane effects, the four-quarter rise would have been a couple of percentage points higher.  Analysts continued to trim forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms outside the energy sector, consistent with the typical pattern of downward adjustments during periods of moderate economic growth.

The preliminary estimate of third-quarter NIPA profits, a broader measure of profitability, showed an 8½ percent gain over the past year.  Excluding the BEA's estimate of hurricane-related losses, NIPA profits increased 15 percent over the prior year, including a considerable rise between the second and third quarters.

Nonfinancial corporate bonds experienced a sizable net rating downgrade in October, but more than half of the debt downgraded resulted from one large merger-the debt-

financed acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless by Cingular-and the pace of downgrades appears to have dropped back in November.  Other indicators suggest that nonfinancial firms continue to be in solid financial condition.  Nonfinancial corporations continued to build on their already hefty cash positions last quarter.  In addition, Call Report data for the third quarter showed a further decline in the delinquency rate on C&amp;I loans, and the six-month trailing default rate on corporate bonds remained extremely low in October. The expected year-ahead default rate derived from Moody's KMV Corporation ticked down in October and likely has declined further since then in response to the rise in equity prices over November and early December.

Business Finance

Bank C&amp;I lending was positive again in November, and gross issuance of bonds by nonfinancial corporations firmed to its strongest monthly pace since March.  Borrowing in the speculative-grade category was particularly robust.  Low rates evidently continue to be a major factor, as the most popular use of proceeds reportedly was to pay down existing debt.  In the commercial paper market, much of the merger-related bridge financing that had boosted October issuance was paid down in November, as we had anticipated.  On balance, during October and November combined, net borrowing through bank loans, commercial paper, and bonds picked up from the third-quarter pace.

Gross public equity issuance continued at a moderate rate in November; initial public offerings have continued around the stronger pace since midyear, while seasoned offerings remain off the earlier elevated pace observed when some firms were issuing equity to improve their balance sheets.  Equity retirements from both cash mergers and share repurchases accelerated markedly in the third quarter, placing net equity issuance even further in negative territory.  Retirements likely will remain high in the current quarter, in part because of Cingular's acquisition of AT&amp;T Wireless.  Moreover, the anticipated repatriation of profits earned overseas in response to the corporate tax law passed in October could well provide firms with cash to keep equity retirements elevated over the next few quarters.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial real estate debt expanded at an annual rate of 11 percent in the third quarter, and strong CMBS issuance in October and November points to rapid debt growth again this quarter.  The spreads of investment-grade CMBS yields to comparable-maturity Treasuries have remained low.  The various measures of commercial mortgage

delinquency rates have either fallen this year or held at a low level, indicating that credit quality in this sector continues to be sound.

Household Finance

In the third quarter, household mortgage debt expanded at an annual rate of 11 percent. With interest rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages remaining low, mortgage debt growth is expected to stay strong in the current quarter.  Consumer credit increased at an annual rate of 6 percent in the third quarter but slowed a bit to a 4 percent pace in October.

Although household debt has continued to expand more rapidly than disposable income, a downdrift in other household obligations has kept the financial obligations ratio about unchanged on net this year.  The ratio remains 1/2 percentage point below the peak reached two years ago.  Meanwhile, measures of household credit quality have continued to improve.  Delinquencies on credit card loans, consumer loans, and residential mortgages at commercial banks all declined in the third quarter, and those on auto loans at captive finance companies edged down in October.  Household bankruptcy filings over the year to date are 5 percent below the comparable period from last year, although this year's filing rate remains high compared with earlier years.

A rapid rise in existing home prices in the third quarter more than offset a dip in the Wilshire 5000 stock price index, contributing to an uptick in the ratio of household assets to disposable income.  The gains in stock prices registered so far this quarter portend another increase in this ratio.  Mutual fund flows picked up in November, a move roughly consistent with their historical relationship to asset returns.

Treasury and Agency Finance

The statutory debt ceiling was raised in mid-November.  Market participants had anticipated this outcome, and the Treasury's financing maneuvers during the preceding four weeks to fund government operations had little effect on yields.  November's auction of ten-year notes was met with strong demand, and indirect bidders took up 40 percent of the issues, suggesting continued strong interest from foreign official institutions.

With regard to the GSEs, Fannie Mae's stock price moved down in the wake of the presidential election-suggesting continued close scrutiny of its operations-and fell again after the company failed to produce a third-quarter accounting statement.

However, the price rebounded sharply on news of an increase in the conforming loan limit to $359,650 in 2005.  Spreads on agency senior debt have declined as GSE debt issuance has slowed in response to more limited growth of their mortgage portfolios.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds slowed some in November from its robust pace in October to a rate below the average for the year to date.  A decline in refunding issues can be traced-at least in part-to the Treasury's decision in mid-October to halt its SLGS program to avoid violating the debt ceiling.  The SLGSs window reopened in November, which could spur refundings in the near term.  Short-term municipal debt offerings were relatively low last month, as is consistent with a broader trend of reduced reliance on short-term borrowing due to the improved budget situations in many states. The credit quality of municipal bonds continued to improve, with bond upgrades far outpacing downgrades in recent months.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 accelerated in November, but the average pace of M2 growth in recent months has been relatively slow.  In the quarter to date, M2 has grown at around a 4½ percent annual rate-about as one would expect in light of the moderate growth in nominal income, higher stock prices, and increases in M2 opportunity cost associated with the recent monetary policy tightenings.

The growth of bank credit rebounded in November, with both securities and loans registering notable gains.  Banks posted strong profits again in the third quarter, and asset quality continued to improve.  Preliminary data from the November Survey of Terms of Business Lending suggest that spreads on C&amp;I loans rose from recent lows, partly because of wide spreads on a few large loans, some to finance acquisitions.

In September, the value of exports of goods and services increased 0.8 percent, matching August's upwardly revised pace.  Exports of goods increased 1.4 percent, with a particularly strong contribution from agricultural goods.  Exports of capital goods moved up as well, as both computers and semiconductors recovered from a weak August. Services exports declined slightly, largely on account of a drop in travel-related services. Exports of goods and services in the third quarter climbed 8.4 percent at an annual rate. The increase was widespread, except for agricultural products, semiconductors, and telecommunications equipment, all of which fell, on average, in the third quarter from the second quarter.

The value of imported goods fell 0.8 percent in September, retracing some of August's 2.6 percent gain.  Imports of goods declined 0.4 percent, due to a fall in the value of imported oil; non-oil imports were little changed.  Imports of capital goods rose as increases in aircraft and other capital goods offset declines in high-tech goods.  Imports of consumer goods fell for the fifth month in a row, led by a marked decline in pharmaceuticals.  Services imports receded nearly 3 percent, as royalty and license fees retreated from their elevated August level.  For the third quarter as a whole, imports of goods and services expanded 10.7 percent at an annual rate.  Gains were widespread, with a few exceptions, notably consumer goods.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In October, the prices of U.S. imports of non-oil goods and of core goods fell 0.2 and 0.1 percent, respectively.  Prices for industrial supplies declined 1.1 percent, mostly from lower prices for building materials.  For foods, feeds and beverages, prices declined 0.6 percent.  With the start of the new model year, prices for automotive products rose 0.4 percent.  Prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semi-conductors) edged up 0.1 percent.  Prices for imported consumer goods, which have not increased since February 2004, were unchanged in October.  Import prices of computers continued to decline, whereas prices for semiconductors edged up.

For the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of imported core goods increased 2.1 percent at an annual rate, in part due to a rise in prices of non-oil industrial supplies.

Oil. Oil prices have been extremely volatile recently.  The BLS price of imported oil rose 11.7 percent in October.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI), a light, low-sulfur crude oil, averaged about $53 per barrel for the month, a nominal record, and $7 per barrel more than in September.  The rise in the spot price was largely due to hurricane damage to U.S. oil production and pipeline infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico, which disproportionately affected the supply of low-sulfur crude.  Since October, the spot price of WTI has fallen sharply, due in part to rising oil inventories and the return of some Gulf of Mexico production.  The spot price closed at $41.47 per barrel on December 7.  The prices of more sulfurous grades of crude oil, which did not increase as rapidly as WTI in October, have not fallen as much recently.  The price of imported oil tends to move more closely with the prices of higher sulfur crude oils than with WTI.

Exports. In October, the prices of U.S. exports of total goods and of core goods both increased 0.7 percent.  Much of October's increase was due to a 2.5 percent rise in industrial supplies that reflected higher prices for chemicals and fuels.  The prices of agricultural exports fell 1.3 percent and, since peaking in May, have declined 13 percent. In October, export prices of capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) and automotive products increased 0.4 and 0.2 percent, respectively.  Prices for consumer goods fell 0.1 percent.  As with imports, export prices of computers continued to decline, and prices for semiconductors rose.

In the third quarter, on a NIPA basis, the prices of exported core goods increased 1¾ percent at an annual rate.  A sharp decline in prices of exported agricultural products offset much of the moderate increase in prices of industrial supplies and smaller increases in some other categories.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Private foreign purchases of U.S. securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) continued strong at $35 billion in October.  For the first ten months of the year, private inflows into U.S. securities amounted to $395 billion, above the $373 inflows recorded for all of 2003.

Private foreign investors' purchases of bonds continued at their robust level in October, with purchases of agency bonds (line 4b) near $16 billion and corporate debt (line 4c) at about $15 billion.  After two months of consecutive net sales, private foreign investors purchased almost $5 billion in U.S. equities (line 4d).  For Treasuries (line 4a), the strength in private foreign purchases of the past few years that accelerated in the first half of this year has evaporated; following $96 billion in net purchases in the first half of the year, net inflows totaled only $6 billion in the July-October period.

Net foreign official inflows (line 1) moderated to about $17 billion in October, with a small outflow from China and sizable inflows from Norway and Russia.  For the first ten months of the year, foreign official inflows were $282 billion, exceeding the $245 billion recorded for the year 2003.  Partial data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) report a large increase in official reserve assets in November,

U.S. investors made large net purchases of foreign securities (line 5) in October, following small net sales in September.  U.S. investors primarily acquired foreign stocks (line 5a), but also made modest purchases of foreign bonds (line 5a).  A series break in reported net purchases of foreign bonds makes it difficult to compare current transactions in foreign bonds with the reported sales recorded in previous quarters.

The volatile banking sector (line 3) recorded an outflow of $22 billion in October, bringing the cumulative outflow for 2004 to $57 billion.

Foreign Financial Markets

The trade-weighted index of the nominal exchange value of the dollar against the major currencies declined 1¼ percent on net since the November FOMC meeting.  The index would have fallen 2½ percent but for a large jump very late in the period.  This decline came despite generally stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data and weaker-thanexpected economic data in Europe and Japan.  Market participants attributed the dollar's decline to concern over the financing of the U.S. current account deficit.  Remarks made in the middle of November by Treasury Secretary Snow and Chairman Greenspan were generally interpreted as indicating official tolerance for a decline in the dollar.  News reports suggested that the central banks of Russia and China may replace (or may have already replaced) some of their dollar-denominated assets with euros.  The dollar depreciated 4 percent on net against sterling and 2½ percent against the yen and the euro. In contrast, the dollar appreciated about 2¼ percent against the Canadian dollar, in part on the release of the weaker-than-expected Canadian employment report for November.

Recent differences in economic performance between the United States and other industrial countries were clearly evident in interest rate developments. Whereas longterm Treasury yields were down 5 basis points over the intermeeting period, comparable

yields on other countries' government bonds generally declined 15 to 30 basis points.

Changes in short-term interest rates also reflected the differences in economic performance, with the yield on the U.S. three-month Treasury bill rising 16 basis points versus declines or little change on net in yields of comparable European and Canadian sovereign debts.  As had been widely expected, the European Central Bank, the Bank of Japan, and the Bank of Canada left their respective monetary policy stances unchanged during the intermeeting period.

Since the November FOMC meeting, broad share price indexes in most major industrial economies have changed little on net, as lower oil prices offset the effects of disappointing economic news and currency appreciations.

The dollar declined 1½ percent on a trade-weighted basis against the currencies of our other important trading partners over the intermeeting period, led by a 4¾ percent depreciation against the Korean won.  The Bank of Korea cut its key policy interest rate 25 basis points, to 3.25 percent, in a move that market participants interpreted as, in part, aiming at limiting the won's appreciation against the dollar.  In addition, Korean monetary authorities were active in currency markets in an attempt to slow the won's

appreciation.  The Bank of Korea reported that its foreign exchange reserves increased $14 billion in November to a total of $193 billion.  Speculation about how and when China may abandon the renminbi's peg to the dollar was a focus of market participants' discussions during the period.  The one-year-ahead exchange rate implied by renminbi non-deliverable forward contracts appreciated slightly against the dollar over the intermeeting period to a level of 5 percent above the spot value, reflecting the growing probability assigned by the market to a change in the exchange rate regime within a year .

In Latin America, the Brazilian real appreciated almost 2 percent against the dollar, Brazil's EMBI+ spread over Treasuries declined about 40 basis points, and Brazilian equity prices rose 5¼ percent.  These developments reflected indications of continued

robust economic growth and an improving fiscal outlook in Brazil.  The central bank of Brazil raised its key policy rate 50 basis points, to 17.25 percent, citing inflationary pressures.  The Bank of Mexico tightened its monetary policy stance by raising the corto from 57 million pesos to 63 million pesos, also citing inflationary pressures.  The Mexican peso appreciated about 1¼ percent against the dollar and the Mexican equity index rose 3 percent.

Developments in Foreign Industrial Countries

Growth in most of the major foreign industrial countries slowed in the third quarter, with a downturn in external demand an important contributor.  Japanese GDP posted a small increase, as business investment moderated.  In the euro area, GDP decelerated despite a strong advance in domestic demand (including inventories).  Third-quarter GDP growth in the United Kingdom was half that of the second quarter, with business investment and inventory accumulation making negative contributions.  Canadian GDP growth also slowed, as a steep decline in net exports offset solid underlying domestic demand.  Data for the fourth quarter suggest further slowing of activity in the major foreign industrial countries, except in the United Kingdom, where survey evidence points to an improvement in business activity.  Early indicators suggest that the fourth quarter got off to a weak start in Japan and the euro area.  Labor markets in the foreign industrial economies have been mixed on balance during the past few months.  Unemployment rates have held steady in the euro area and the United Kingdom, but have recently turned up in Japan and Canada.

Headline rates of consumer price inflation eased in the third quarter before edging up slightly in October in the United Kingdom and Canada.  Inflation remains above the ECB ceiling rate in the euro area, while core consumer prices continue to fall moderately in Japan.

In Japan , newly published chain-weighted national accounts data show that Japanese real GDP edged up 0.2 percent at an annual rate in the third quarter.  Growth in personal consumption slowed a bit to 0.9 percent.  Business fixed investment rose 4.3 percent, while government investment dropped about 8 percent.  Export growth slowed markedly and imports jumped.  As a result, net exports subtracted 0.4 percentage point from growth, marking the first negative contribution from external demand in two years.  The GDP deflator fell 1.2 percent below its year-earlier level.  The new data also show a 0.6 percent contraction in real GDP in the second quarter, resulting from a plunge in government investment, which subtracted 3.7 percentage points from growth .

Indicators suggest continued anemic activity at the start of the fourth quarter.  Industrial production dropped 1.6 percent in October, depressed by ongoing weakness in electronics-related sectors.  Household expenditures in October were 0.6 percent below their third-quarter average.  Real exports rose 2.5 percent in October, about the same pace as the rise in imports.  Core machinery orders, a leading indicator of business investment,

fell 1.9 percent in September, leaving orders for the third quarter down 8.4 percent from the second quarter.

<!-- missing-text -->

Labor market conditions were mixed. The unemployment rate ticked up to 4.7 percent in October, as employment fell.  However, the job-offers-to-applicants ratio, a leading indicator of employment, rose to an eleven-year high.  Nominal wages continued to fall through October.

Core consumer goods prices in the Tokyo area (which exclude fresh food but include energy) ticked down in November from the previous month and were down 0.3 percent from a year earlier.  In contrast, the headline rate of inflation was boosted to 0.7 percent by spikes in food prices following a series of typhoons and an earthquake in October. Higher commodity prices helped to push wholesale prices up in October to a level 1.9 percent above a year ago, the largest twelve-month increase since 1990.

Euro-area GDP grew 1.2 percent in the third quarter, down from an average rate of 2.3 percent in the first half of the year.  Final domestic demand contributed 1.6 percentage points to growth, as private consumption and especially investment continued to rise. The negative contribution from net exports was a sizable 2.6 percentage points, as imports outpaced exports.  The decline in net exports was roughly offset by a surge in inventories.

The economic slowdown was concentrated in the two largest member countries, France and Germany.  French GDP rose only 0.3 percent in the third quarter, its weakest performance since the second quarter of 2003.  Final domestic demand fell as both private consumption and investment declined.  Without a sizable build in inventories, French GDP would have contracted 2.4 percent.  German GDP growth was also primarily attributable to inventory accumulation.  Final domestic demand grew 1.6 percent, while net exports made a sizable negative contribution.

The few available indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued weakness.  Survey data have generally been downbeat.  According to the European Commission (EC), euro-

area economic sentiment fell in November to a four-month low.  Among the components of the sentiment index, confidence in the services sector dropped.  In contrast, confidence in both the consumer and construction sectors edged up.  After moving up modestly in October, the German IFO survey resumed its downward trend in November.

Labor market conditions remained weak in the euro area, with the unemployment rate unchanged at 8.9 percent in October.  The German unemployment rate edged up in November for the second consecutive month.  The EC survey indicates that neither firms nor consumers expect the labor market to improve over the next twelve months.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation in the euro area receded to 2.2 percent in November, after surging to 2.4 percent in October.  The ECB measure of twelve-month core inflation, excluding energy and unprocessed foods, dipped to 2.0 percent in October, its lowest reading since January.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom rose 1.8 percent in the third quarter, up slightly from the preliminary estimate but down from growth rates earlier this year.  Private consumption continued to expand at a moderate pace, and government spending rose strongly.  These increases were partially offset by the first dip in fixed investment since the first quarter of 2003 and a negative contribution to growth from inventories.

On balance, indicators for the fourth quarter hint at a pick-up in activity.  Industrial production in October continued to slide, but November's manufacturing PMI continued to improve.  Although business confidence dipped in November after a relatively strong reading in October, it has been especially volatile of late.  Both consumer confidence and the services PMI edged up further in November.  Retail sales slipped in October, and the two leading surveys of retail sales for November were mixed, with the two surveys pointing in opposite directions.

Over the four months ending in November, housing price growth has been muted, according to an average of the two leading private indexes.  Household net mortgage borrowing eased in October, after several months of steeper declines, remaining near levels seen during the first half of 2003.

The labor market continued to be tight, as the official-claims-based measure of the unemployment rate remained near its lowest point since 1975, and the labor-force-survey

measure hit an all-time low.  The twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation edged up to 1.2 percent in October, still well below the Bank of England's 2 percent target.

On December 2, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown presented the government's Pre-Budget Report to Parliament.  While Brown reported that Public Sector Net Borrowing (PSNB) in the fiscal year 2003-2004 was £1.5 billion less than the £37.5 billion projected in March's budget, he raised the forecast for 2004-05 £1 billion to £34 billion (2.9 percent of GDP) and upped the 2005-06 forecast £2 billion to £33 billion (2.7 percent of GDP).  The government kept its real GDP growth forecast for 2005 at 3-3.5 percent.

In Canada , real GDP growth moderated to 3.2 percent in the third quarter . Growth was bolstered by strong advances in the manufacturing, wholesale, and retail sectors.  Final domestic demand growth firmed to 3.3 percent, led by consumption and business investment.  In contrast, net exports declined sharply as imports surged for the second consecutive quarter and exports fell.  The pullback in exports was widespread, with energy and automotive products the main sources of weakness.  The negative contribution to GDP growth from net exports was largely offset by a surge in inventories, however.

Indicators for the fourth quarter suggest continued moderation of production.  The composite index of leading indicators rose again in October, its ninth monthly rise this year, but more gradually than the year-to-date average.  The number of building permits

issued in October increased for the first time in four months, due entirely to a gain in residential permits.  Consistent with this, housing starts rose in November for the first time in four months, leaving housing starts so far in the fourth quarter moderately below their strong third-quarter average. The purchasing manager's index also rose in November.

In November, total employment was virtually unchanged, a disappointing outcome following two months of strong job gains.  The labor market has been quite volatile so far in the second half of the year, following a solid second quarter.  The unemployment rate moved up to 7.3 percent in November as the labor force continued to expand.

In October, the twelve-month rate of headline CPI inflation jumped to 2.3 percent, after registering just under 2 percent the previous two months, as gasoline prices spiked up following four months of decline.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, excluding food, energy, and indirect taxes, however, inched below 1 percent in October.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Real GDP growth moderated in the third quarter on average in Latin America and emerging Asia, despite a rebound in China.  More recent data releases have been mixed. Consumer price inflation in many emerging market economies remains elevated relative to 2003 levels, partly due to higher oil prices.

The latest indicators for China have been mixed but are generally consistent with some deceleration in the Chinese economy in the fourth quarter.  Staff estimates indicate that investment contracted slightly in October, the third monthly contraction since administrative measures aimed at slowing investment were put in place in April.  Growth in industrial production and lending were up a touch in October, but remained well below growth recorded before April's tightening.  Among the indicators, imports appear to be the outlier.  After slowing for several months, imports of both final and intermediate goods rose sharply in October.  The rise in imports swamped that of exports, shrinking the trade surplus, although it remains sizeable nonetheless.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation slowed significantly in October to 4.3 percent, as the past year's food price increases have started to unwind.  Non-food prices edged up further to 1 percent above their year-earlier levels.

Real GDP in Hong Kong grew at a surprisingly strong rate of almost 8 percent in the third quarter.  Services exports led the way, rising at an annual rate of more than 30 percent in the quarter.  Personal consumption, which soared in the second quarter, contracted some in the third quarter, but remained well above its first-quarter level.  The unemployment rate fell slightly in October.  The merchandise trade deficit shrank in

October, as exports rose to a new record high.  The twelve-month change in the CPI fell back in October, although the month-to-month change stayed positive.

Real GDP in Taiwan grew 4.5 percent in the third quarter, and second-quarter growth was revised upward from a small decline to very modest growth.  Personal consumption rebounded in the third quarter, as consumer confidence returned with the resolution of uncertainty surrounding the Taiwanese presidential election.  Industrial production fell in October.  Production of high-tech goods has now fallen for three consecutive months, but new orders for these goods, which have been sluggish, rose in October.  Taiwan registered trade deficits in October and November, as exports slumped and imports continued to rise.  Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent in November from a year earlier.

Data for indicate that economic performance remains sluggish.  Real GDP rose

Korea 2.6 percent in the third quarter, following an equally lackluster second quarter, with declines in both consumption and investment and only a small increase in exports. Industrial production dropped nearly 1 percent in October, with losses concentrated in industries servicing domestic consumption.  The October trade surplus narrowed from its high September level, held down by rising imports of oil and travel-related services. Twelve-month consumer price inflation declined to 3.3 percent in November, reflecting declines in agricultural prices.  Partly in response to the ongoing weakness, as well as to counter upward pressure on the currency, the Bank of Korea lowered its target interest rate for the second time since August.  The government is also discussing further stimulus measures.

In the ASEAN region, third-quarter real GDP growth declined in Indonesia and Malaysia, became negative in Singapore, but was surprisingly strong in Thailand and the Philippines.  Monthly indicators and anecdotal evidence indicate that the adverse effects of high oil prices and less rapid expansion in global demand for high-tech products have weighed on activity in parts of the region.  October industrial production declined 1.2 percent in Malaysia, and was flat in Thailand.  In Singapore, however, the volatile industrial production index rose sharply in October after declines in the previous two months, and the October PMI was up.  Indonesia, Malaysia, and Singapore continued to record sizeable trade surpluses.

Across the region, consumer price inflation continues to remain elevated relative to rates during 2003, likely due to the effects of the higher world and domestic prices of fuel. Although governments in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand subsidize domestic energy prices to varying extents, the Malaysian and Thai governments have lately allowed some increases in domestic prices of fuels.

In Mexico , GDP growth slowed to a 2.6 percent pace in the third quarter, about half that in the previous three quarters.  The impetus for growth has shifted somewhat, with U.S. demand for Mexican products moderating and Mexican domestic demand remaining robust.  Following rapid first-half growth, manufacturing exports stagnated in the third quarter and declined in October to their lowest level since January.  In contrast, indicators of consumption and investment spending have remained strong.  Retail sales rose at an 11 percent annual rate in the third quarter, and construction activity was robust.  In addition, high oil revenues have financed increased government spending, providing a significant stimulus to the economy.

The Bank of Mexico tightened policy for the eighth time this year on November 26, saying that it aimed to prevent this year's rise in inflation from feeding into higher inflation expectations and wage increases.  The 28-day CETES rate has risen 240 basis points on net since end-2003 to 8.3 percent.  The Mexican Congress in mid-November approved a budget bill for 2005 with a deficit target of 0.2 percent of GDP, only slightly lower than the 2004 target, despite the higher oil price assumption built into the budget.

In Brazil , real GDP growth slowed to 4.2 percent in the third quarter, while second quarter growth was revised down to 5.5 percent.  Third-quarter growth was led by a 12 percent rise (annual rate) in industrial output.  On the demand side, investment grew 30 percent, the most rapid rate in ten years, while private consumption continued to exhibit robust growth.  In contrast to the previous two quarters, the external sector made a negative arithmetic contribution to growth, as real import growth rose sharply while real export growth declined.  Monthly indicators have given hints that economic activity slowed further more recently.  Industrial output growth paused in September, and vehicle production and sales declined in October.  Brazil continued to post sizeable trade surpluses and is on track for a record trade surplus for the year.

Inflation rose in October, pressured by hikes in domestic prices of fuel, raising twelvemonth inflation to nearly 7 percent.  Concern over the effects of rises in fuel prices on inflation and inflation expectations prompted the central bank in mid-November to raise its policy rate another 50 basis points to 17.25 percent.  The increase was the third in three months and brought the cumulative rate hike since September to 125 basis points. Given the overall good economic and fiscal performance over the past year, officials have indicated that Brazil will probably not renew its IMF program when it expires in March 2005.

In Argentina , the economic recovery appears to have continued in the third quarter. Industrial production grew 2 percent in the third quarter, after contracting in the previous quarter.  However, October industrial production was flat.  The trade surplus was nearly $14 billion in October; nominal exports this year have been supported by higher commodities prices.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation has risen in recent months and was 5.5 percent for November.

In late November, the bank managing the Argentine government's proposed bond exchange in the United States withdrew from the deal, and Italian regulators delayed the launch of the debt exchange in Italy until at least mid-December.  In light of these events, the Argentine government rescheduled the launch date from late November to midJanuary.  Also in late November, the Argentine Congress approved the government's budget for 2005.  The budget aims for a federal primary surplus of 3.2 percent of GDP and a consolidated primary surplus of 3.6 percent, below the 4 percent that has been demanded by the IMF.

In Venezuela , real GDP declined nearly 1 percent in the third quarter according to staff estimates, after soaring in the previous two quarters.  On December 3, Finance Minister Tobias Nobrega announced that the bolivar would be devalued nearly 11 percent effective January 1, but retracted that statement later in the day.  Two days later, President Chavez replaced Nobrega with Nelson Merentes.  Capital controls are expected to limit speculative behavior that would otherwise erode central bank international reserves, which stand at $23 billion.  The bolivar was pegged to the dollar in early 2003 in a bid to reduce inflation.  Inflation has since fallen, but remains high, nearly 20 percent for the twelve months through November.  Oil production is still estimated to be below the level prevailing before the national strikes of 2002.

In Russia , data releases were mixed.  In October, although industrial production and construction continued to contract, there were hints of improvement in business fixed investment.  The trade surplus widened further in September.  Consumer price inflation continued to rise in November, reflecting higher food prices.

The tax dispute between the Russian government and the Russian oil company Yukos intensified in recent weeks, as authorities raised their tax claims on Yukos to around $25 billion and set the auction of Yuganskneftegaz, Yukos' main production facility, for December 19, and as top company officials fled Russia.  Gazprom, the natural gas monopoly in Russia with close ties to the government, is widely expected to bid for the facility.  To forestall future government intervention in remaining Yukos assets, an extraordinary shareholders' meeting will be held on December 20 to consider whether Yukos should be put into formal bankruptcy proceedings and possibly even liquidated. Yukos currently produces 1.75 million b/d of oil (Yuganskneftegaz produces 1 million b/d), and analysts are concerned that production could decline in the near future due to a lack of funds for maintenance.
