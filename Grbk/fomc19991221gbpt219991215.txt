Mexican  and Brazilian equity prices surged  9 and  11  percent, respectively,  but Argentine  share  prices declined almost four percent.  Equity prices  in most Asian economies  advanced during the period, with Korean  stocks  a notable exception.

On December  3 and 10,  in  order to provide  additional  dollar liquidity to the Brazilian  money market over the century date  change, Brazil's central bank auctioned a total of $1.3  billion  of U.S. dollar repurchase agreements  for delivery  on December  29, with  $800  million to be repurchased  on January  5  and $500 million on January  10.

In other actions  by foreign central  banks, the Bank of Canada raised its Bank rate 25  basis points, to 5 percent,  and its overnight target  rate  a like amount to 4.75 percent,  immediately following  the FOMC's November decision. On November 23,  the central  bank of Ecuador nearly doubled its interbank lending rate to  160 percent  from 90 percent in  an effort to  support the sucre. On December 9, the Turkish central  bank announced a new  crawling exchange rate peg,  devised in  conjunction with  an IMF program.  The new peg is designed  to reduce gradually  inflation expectations  over a period of 18  months,  at which time the plan calls for the Turkish  lira to float within  widening  trading bands. Turkish  equity and bond prices immediately  rose following the announcement.

The price of gold has fallen  3.8 percent since the last FOMC meeting, to  $280 per ounce.  The commodity's sharpest fall  during the period occurred after the Dutch  central bank  announced  on December  6 that it would sell  300 tons of its gold holdings over the next five years.  These prospective  sales  fall within the scope of the  arrangement  announced on  September 26 by the European Central Bank and  14 national  central banks, including  the Netherlands  Bank.  The participating  parties  agreed  to limit their gold sales to 2,000 tons  over five  years. Together with previously  announced  plans of the Bank of England and the Swiss National  Bank, the Dutch plan  means that  1,965 tons  of the 2,000 tons have  been accounted for.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts  of the System or the Treasury.

Developments  in Foreign Industrial Countries

Data released  since  the November Greenbook  generally suggest  expanding real economic  activity in the  foreign  industrial countries.  In the  euro area, growth picked  up sharply in the third  quarter and most forward-looking  indicators suggest  further strength.  In  the United  Kingdom  and Canada, the expansion  of real economic  activity  in the third quarter exceeded  the strong second-quarter rate. In  contrast, Japanese  economic  activity in  the third quarter  stalled following the  surge in GDP in the first half of 1999.

Inflation remains quiescent  in  the foreign  industrial  countries,  although  higher oil prices continue to put upward pressure on headline  inflation.  Euro-area harmonized  CPI inflation  continued to climb in  October but, at  1.4 percent, remained comfortably below the 2 percent ceiling set by the ECB.  Canadian core inflation  has nudged up recently, but is still below  the  midpoint of the Bank of Canada's 1 percent to 3 percent target.  U.K.  inflation remains close to 2 percent. Japanese  core consumer prices remained flat in November, while wholesale  prices continued to decline.

In Japan, real GDP fell  3.8 percent  (SAAR)  during the third quarter, after rising in  the first two  quarters  of 1999.  Domestic demand  led the way down, shaving 5.3  percentage points off growth,  while net exports  added  1.4 percentage points to growth. Private consumption  and all types of investment (private  residential and non-residential  and public)  fell.  Revisions  to  earlier quarters' GDP growth were substantial,  including a downward  revision from 8 percent  to 6.3 percent for the first quarter  and  upward revision  from 0.4 percent  to 3.9 percent  for the second quarter.

The decline  in third-quarter real GDP was  surprising  in light of relatively  strong production  indicators.  Although  industrial production  fell 2.3  percent (SA) in October from the previous  month, this was  due largely  to a variation in the number  of working  days in  the month  and  followed an increase  of 4 percent in the  third quarter  from its level  in the  second quarter. MITI is expecting  a rebound in industrial  production of a  hefty 5  percent in November.  The BoJ's December Tankan improved to -26  from -32 in September, indicating improved business  sentiment for the fourth  consecutive  quarter.

The  Japanese  unemployment rate in  October remained  steady  at 4.6 percent, while the offers-to-applicants  ratio (the number of officially posted job openings relative  to the number  of officially registered job seekers) rose to 0.48,  a bit above the record low of 0.46 in August.  Demand indicators  for the fourth quarter  are scant, but those that are available paint a pessimistic  picture. Housing  starts and new car registrations  were each down  10 percent in October from the previous month,  perhaps  as a result of employment  concerns.  The

November Tokyo core  CPI was nearly nchanged  (SA)  from  the revious  onth u p m and  was down 0.3  percent  NSA) from  a  year  earlier. (

Economic  Situation in Other Countries

In Latin America,  the Mexican  economy  continues to grow  at a strong pace, while in Argentina the  latest industrial  production  data provide further evidence of a nascent recovery. The picture  in Brazil  appears more mixed, as economic activity weakened  in the third quarter,  although there  are  signs of modest improvement  so far in the fourth  quarter.  Inflation  rates  continue to edge  down across the region,  with the exception of Brazil,  where upward  pressure on prices may be increasing.

In  developing Asia, recent  indicators  suggest  that China, Hong Kong and Korea continue to recover at  a robust pace, while economic  activity in Taiwan  appears to have rebounded  from the September earthquake. In  contrast, growth  in  the ASEAN region slowed significantly,  albeit from  an unsustainable  pace. Deflation appears  to be easing in China  and Hong  Kong,  and inflation rates remain  low elsewhere in  the region,  although there are  signs that  strong growth in Korea may be putting  some upward pressure  on prices.

In Brazil,  real  GDP fell  almost  1 percent (SAAR)  in the third quarter, following two quarters  of growth. The decline was led by a fall  in manufacturing  output, which was partly offset by growth in mining  and services. Industrial  production data for October  were more promising,  showing a monthly rise of 1.6 percent (SA).  Brazil's trade performance  continues  to disappoint;  available  information through  October  suggests that while export  volumes have  grown modestly in recent months,  export prices  have remained weak.

Consumer prices rose  about 1 percent  (SA) in both  October and November from the previous month, bringing the 12-month  rate of inflation  to nearly 9 percent in November.  The steep monthly rises were largely due to sharp increases  in food and  energy prices. Analysts now expect  12-month inflation  to hit 9 percent  in December, which  would surpass the midpoint of the government's inflation target range  of 6 percent to  10 percent.

In November,  the Brazilian  central bank's monetary policy committee  decided to keep unchanged  its target overnight interest  rate at  19 percent  and to drop the downward  "tilt"  it had introduced  at its  early October  meeting, citing concerns over the likely impact on  inflation of increases  in  government-controlled  prices in  2000. The real appreciated  somewhat over recent  weeks,  strengthening  from about  1.94 per dollar  in early November to roughly  1.85 per dollar on December  15,

While  further ogress  n fiscal  eform  is eeded, n  November Congress pr o r n i approved  a  reform  aimed  at tabilizing   deficit   the ocial  ecurity  ystem s the of s s s for  private rkers  at  1 ercent f DP  in  coming  years. razil's  vernment  is wo p o G B go on track  o  meet  the ear-end iscal rgets t n  its  MF program. t y f ta se i I
