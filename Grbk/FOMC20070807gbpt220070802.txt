Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Domestic Nonfinancial Developments

Real GDP increased at an annual rate of 2 percent, on average, over the first half of the year; and, the drag from housing and the recent turbulence in financial markets notwithstanding, the available indicators taken as a whole are consistent with economic activity posting further moderate gains in the near term.  In particular, employment and real income have been growing solidly, on balance, so far this year, indicators of household and business sentiment remain supportive, and inventories appear to be reasonably well aligned with final demand.  Top-line inflation receded in June, while core inflation rose at about its average pace over the past year.

Labor Market Developments

Labor demand has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Private payroll employment rose 92,000 in June and was led by gains in the education and health services and in the leisure and hospitality industries.  Construction employment also rose in June despite the ongoing contraction of activity in that sector, a continuation of the anomalous pattern observed since early 2007.  For the second quarter as a whole, private payrolls increased an average of 115,000 employees per month, the same rate as in the first quarter. Reflecting the growth in payroll employment, as well as a small lengthening of the workweek, aggregate hours of private production or nonsupervisory workers rose at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in the second quarter.

In the household survey, the unemployment rate held steady at 4.5 percent in June and has been largely unchanged for nine months.  The labor force participation rate edged up to 66.1 percent in June.  The participation rate had increased between early 2005 and the end of 2006; since then it has been moving down, on average, although it is still above the level observed in early 2005.

Other gauges of labor demand have remained in a range consistent with continued moderate employment growth.  Indicators of layoffs-such as initial claims for unemployment insurance, the short-term job losers rate from the household survey, the layoff and discharge rate from the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, and announcements of downsizing plans-all suggest that job losses have been relatively subdued recently.  On the hiring side, most measures of hiring plans, job openings, and job availability, although off a bit from recent peaks, remain at relatively high levels by historical standards.

The staff estimates that productivity in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in the second quarter after a 0.7 percent rate of increase in the first quarter. The staff also estimates that over the past four quarters, productivity rose only 0.7 percent, 0.9 percentage point lower than the increase over the preceding four quarters.

Note. Staff estimates.

Industrial Production

Industrial production (IP) increased at a moderate pace in the second quarter after little change, on net, over the previous two quarters.  A smaller drag from inventory liquidation and a modest improvement in net trade appear to have been the primary contributors to IP growth in the second quarter after subtracting from growth in the previous quarter.  Manufacturing IP appears poised to post solid gains in the near term, as days' supply of inventories are now at comfortable levels in most industries and indicators of activity, including the available weekly data for July, have shown continued strength.

Manufacturing production popped up 0.6 percent in June after no change in May; for the second quarter as a whole, output increased at an annual rate of nearly 3½ percent.  The factory operating rate rose in June to 80.3 percent, slightly above its 1972-2006 average but below its recent peak last August.

After dropping for six consecutive quarters, the output of motor vehicles and parts jumped at an annual rate of 13.3 percent in the second quarter.  Light vehicle assemblies rebounded from a very low first-quarter pace, while assemblies of medium and heavy trucks plunged further in the second quarter in the wake of new Environmental Protection

Agency (EPA) regulations on truck engines.  With inventories of domestic light vehicles fairly well aligned with sales at the end of the second quarter, production schedules for the third quarter call for the pace of assemblies to step up again.  However, these plans may prove too aggressive if demand does not pick up when the new 2008 model-year vehicles are introduced this fall.

Output in high-tech industries recorded another comparatively lackluster gain, on balance, in the second quarter.  The output of computers decelerated to a more moderate pace after a first-quarter surge in production related to the retail release of Microsoft's new Vista operating system.  Gains in production of communications equipment also slowed appreciably last quarter after stepping up sharply in the first quarter.  The output of semiconductors, which fell at the beginning of the year, rose only modestly in the second quarter.  Chip production was likely restrained by softer demand from downstream industries and by the manufacturers' efforts to reduce their bloated inventories.  Stocks still appear somewhat elevated, and revenue guidance from Intel is consistent with only moderate increases in the output of microprocessors in the third quarter.  Among other near-term indicators, National Association for Business Economics (NABE) and CIO magazine surveys of business plans for future spending on high-tech equipment improved somewhat in the second quarter.

Excluding energy, motor vehicles and parts, and high-tech products, output increased 0.4 percent in June and was up at an annual rate of 2.7 percent in the second quarter. After a series of declines, output of durable consumer goods rose at a 2.7 percent pace, boosted by a rebound in the production of appliances, furniture, carpeting goods, and home improvement products.  The production of business equipment moved up moderately in the second quarter and was supported by continued strength in commercial aircraft production.  The output of construction supplies rose at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the second quarter after declining for three consecutive quarters; increases in the output of supplies typically associated with nonresidential construction appear to account for the second-quarter gain, while supplies associated with residential construction continued to move down.  The output of industrial materials moved up at a steady pace, aided by a rebound in demand from downstream industries such as motor vehicles, other consumer durables, and nonresidential construction, as well as by the return of days' supply to its trend.

Indicators of near-term manufacturing activity point to continued production gains in the next few months.  In particular, a three-month moving average of the staff's measure of

real adjusted durable goods orders increased in June.  The new orders diffusion index from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and an average of the new orders indexes from the various regional surveys both declined in July after moving up in the second quarter, but their levels remained consistent with moderate increases in manufacturing output.  Finally, the available weekly data for July show solid gains in production for light motor vehicles, steel products, and crude oil.  The increase in total IP, however, appears to have been restrained by a decline in output at utilities.

Motor Vehicles

Demand for light motor vehicles has softened considerably in recent months.  After maintaining a moderate annual rate of about 16.4 million units in the first five months of the year, sales in June and July averaged just 15.4 million units, their slowest two-month pace in almost two years.

. 1 Consumers' anxiety about rising fuel prices and disappointment with the level of incentives being offered also appear to have played a role in restraining demand.  So far this year, the sales decline has been concentrated in light trucks, a move that was felt primarily by domestic producers.

The near-term indicators of vehicle demand suggest that sales should improve a bit from their recent pace but remain tepid.  Consumers' perceptions of car-buying conditions in the Reuters/University of Michigan survey recovered somewhat in July, although they remained at the low end of readings taken over the past year.  The modest improvement in July mostly reflected a decline in the number of survey respondents who cited high gasoline prices as the reason that car-buying conditions were poor.  Data from J.D. Power and Associates show that the average value of incentives for light vehicle purchases has changed little in recent months.  At the end of July, however, General Motors introduced several new zero-percent financing programs in an effort to boost sagging demand, a move that in the past has induced similar programs at the other large firms.

Consumer Spending

The pace of consumer spending slowed considerably in the second quarter.  The step-down came on the heels of a surge in purchases around the turn of the year, and at a time when a jump in energy prices was eroding the purchasing power of household income gains.  Goods purchases, in particular, decelerated sharply as motor vehicle purchases dropped in the second quarter and real spending on other goods was subdued. Although increases in outlays on services slowed some last quarter as well, they are estimated to have continued advancing at a moderate pace.

Although the spike in energy prices damped real income growth in the second quarter, solid gains in wages and salaries and earlier increases in the stock market have generally been supportive of consumer expenditures.  Real income growth was quite robust in the previous two quarters, and, despite the continued softness in house prices, household wealth moved markedly higher in the second quarter-mostly on the strength of the stock market, although equity prices have moved sharply lower more recently.  Because the growth of outlays surpassed the change in disposable income in the second quarter, the personal saving rate fell to 0.6 percent.

Apart from sales of motor vehicles, other available indicators of spending in the third quarter are limited but seem to be a bit more upbeat.  In particular, the latest readings on consumer sentiment and weekly data on chain store sales both point to a pickup in outlays early in the third quarter.  In addition, weekly data on the volume of gasoline sales show an increase for July.

Housing

The housing sector remains very weak.  Demand has been further restrained of late by higher interest rates-since mid-April, rates on thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen about 50 basis points-and by increasingly tight lending standards in the subprime market.  New home sales were down 11 percent and existing home sales down 6½ percent in the second quarter from their average levels in the second half of last year. With production flat despite the slower pace of demand, the inventory situation has shown little improvement, on balance, since the end of last year.

Most forward-looking indicators of housing demand-most notably, the index of pending home sales-have deteriorated, on balance, in the past few months.  One exception is the four-week moving average of the mortgage purchase index, which has risen considerably,

on net, since mid-April.  However, the rise in this index may be somewhat misleading because of distortions related to the recent developments in subprime mortgage markets. 2

Despite the apparent falloff in demand, new housing production has moved sideways this year.  Single-family starts held steady in June at an annual rate of 1.15 million units.  In contrast, adjusted permit issuance slipped further to an annual rate of 1.05 million units. Starts generally have tracked higher than permits since early 2006, and builders have evidently made up the shortfall by drawing down the sizable backlog of unused permits that had accumulated over the course of the housing boom.  Historically, such gaps have led starts to adjust toward permits.  Moreover, inventories of unsold new homes remain stubbornly elevated relative to sales-about 50 percent higher than the upper bound of the fairly tight range of months' supply values recorded between 1997 and 2005.   All 3 told, these indicators suggest that single-family construction will likely decline further in the coming months.  Multifamily starts in June were at an annual rate of 316,000 units, in line with readings seen so far this year and at the low end of the relatively narrow range the values have occupied for the past ten years or so.

The latest readings on house prices have continued to show some deceleration.  In the first quarter, the purchase-only version of the repeat price index for existing homes calculated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) was 3 percent higher than its level a year earlier, a considerably smaller increase than the 10 percent appreciation posted over the preceding four-quarter period.  The ten-city version of the Case-Shiller repeat-price index has decelerated even more noticeably and has shown negative year-over-year rates of change for every month this year through May. 4 Estimates of the average price of existing homes sold-which are available on a more timely basis than the other measures but are not quality adjusted-showed the price

little changed in June relative to its level twelve months earlier.  Similarly, the constantquality price index for new homes-which adjusts for the geographic composition of sales, square footage, and other readily measurable attributes-was just 0.6 percent higher in the second quarter than four quarters earlier, down from the 3.9 percent appreciation posted in the preceding year.   Although the quarterly data can be quite 5 erratic, quality-adjusted prices fell at an annual rate of 9¼ percent during the second quarter-the first decline in this index during the current housing downturn.

Equipment and Software

Real business outlays for equipment and software (E&amp;S) excluding transportation equipment posted a solid increase in the second quarter after having been flat, on net, in the preceding two quarters.  Smoothing through the ups and downs, the recent pace has been modest and roughly consistent with the lackluster performance of the fundamental determinants of real E&amp;S spending.  Business output growth has stepped down somewhat since early last year, and while the user cost of high-tech capital has continued to decline, the trajectory is not particularly impressive by historical standards.  Moreover, although firms retain ample cash in reserve to finance investment, credit costs for lower-grade borrowers have increased.

Real business outlays for high-tech E&amp;S decelerated in the second quarter after a brisk first-quarter increase.  Expenditures on computers and software rose at an annual rate of around 5½ percent last quarter after a very rapid Vista-influenced gain in the first quarter. Similarly, outlays on communications gear posted a solid 11 percent gain in the second quarter, on top of a much larger gain in the first quarter.  However, guidance from telecommunications service providers suggests only modest growth in spending on communications equipment for 2007 as a whole.

Business outlays on transportation equipment dropped at an annual rate of more than 28 percent in the second quarter, the third consecutive quarterly decline.  Business-sector spending for motor vehicles fell,

to a slump in freight shipping volumes attributable to the slowdown in construction activity.  New orders for medium and heavy trucks, meanwhile, edged up in the second quarter but remained at low levels.  Domestic spending on aircraft spiked up in the first quarter from a very low level and stayed at that level in the second quarter.

Real spending on equipment other than high-tech and transportation surged at an annual rate of about 12 percent in the second quarter.  The second-quarter increase recouped more than half of the steep decline in spending recorded over the prior three quarters, and the rebound was led by higher spending on industrial machinery.  Outlays for mining, oilfield and gas-field equipment and for agricultural machinery also contributed to the second-quarter increase.

Looking ahead, surveys of business conditions, such as the ISM's monthly index and some regional indexes, have picked up considerably since earlier in the year and are consistent with solid growth in the near term.  The most recent reading on the capital spending diffusion index derived from the NABE survey picked up as well.  On the side of restraint, orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft edged down in May and were flat in June.

Nonresidential Construction

Real spending on construction of nonresidential buildings has moved up smartly this year, and fundamentals in this sector remain solid.  On the basis of available data, the staff estimates that spending on nonresidential structures excluding drilling and mining surged at an annual rate of more than 20 percent in the second quarter.   In particular, 6 vacancy rates, although up somewhat in recent quarters, are still relatively low by historical standards.  Moreover, the three-month moving average of the diffusion index for architectural billings, which has some signal content for spending six months hence, points to continued gains in the coming quarters, albeit at a somewhat slower pace than seen so far this year.

According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA), activity in the drilling and mining segment jumped at an annual rate of 48 percent in the second quarter.  This increase appears to be at odds with the data on the number of rigs in operation, which suggest that

drilling activity has been flat, on balance, so far this year.   Moreover, anecdotal reports 7 in the most recent Beige Book suggest that incentives for further expansion of drilling for natural gas have been damped considerably by recent price declines and by persistently high inventories.

Business Inventories

Businesses have made considerable progress bringing inventories more into line with sales.  We estimate that real nonfarm inventory investment excluding motor vehicles increased at an annual rate of $9 billion in the second quarter, considerably below the pace in the second half of last year.   Furthermore, the ratio of manufacturing and trade 8 book-value inventories relative to sales, excluding motor vehicles, ticked down again in May.  Similarly, the staff's flow-of-goods inventory system suggests that inventories in June were well aligned with absorption of final and intermediate goods.  In July, the number of purchasing managers who viewed their customers' inventories as 'too high' slightly exceeded the number who saw them as 'too low.'

Federal Government Sector

With receipts growing about in line with nominal income and increases in outlays slowing appreciably, the federal budget deficit has narrowed.  Over the twelve months ending in June, the cumulative deficit (adjusted for payment-timing shifts and financial transactions) was $173 billion, about 1¼ percent of nominal GDP and almost $90 billion less than in the twelve months ending in June 2006. 9

The growth of tax receipts has stepped down markedly of late from the exceptionally strong gains seen in recent years.  In June, corporate revenues were only 2 percent higher than their level a year earlier, reflecting the slowing growth of profits.  Individual income

and payroll tax payments in June were up 6¼ percent from their level a year earlier, compared with a 8¼ percent increase during the twelve months ending in June.

The deceleration in federal outlays was more pronounced than that in receipts.  Total spending in June was barely above its level in June 2006.  Spending for defense and the major transfer programs grew more slowly in June than their average monthly pace over the past year, and net interest payments in June declined a bit from their year-earlier level.

As measured in the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), total real federal purchases rose briskly in the second quarter and contributed nearly ½ percentage point to the rate of growth in real GDP.  The rise in total federal purchases primarily reflected a bounceback in defense purchases; nondefense purchases edged up only a bit.

State and Local Government Sector

Healthy fiscal positions have contributed to solid increases in expenditures by state and local governments so far this year.  State and local employment increased an average of 34,000 per month in the second quarter, significantly above the monthly average of 22,000 between 1997 and 2006.  Construction expenditures have been climbing relatively rapidly for more than a year, and real investment in structures is estimated to have risen at a brisk annual rate of 7½ percent in the second quarter.  Overall, the staff estimates that real purchases by state and local governments advanced at an annual rate of 3¼ percent in the second quarter. 10

While state governments are believed to have ended the recent fiscal year in June with substantial cash reserves, revenues began slowing last year, and the Census Bureau's Quarterly Summary of State and Local Tax Revenue suggests that revenues continued to decelerate to a more moderate pace in the first quarter of 2007.  In addition, recent anecdotal reports point to emerging concern by some state governments about their future fiscal positions.  In particular, several large states, including California, Illinois, and Pennsylvania, have struggled to enact budgets for the current fiscal year, which began on July 1.  Meanwhile, other states, including Maryland, are looking for ways to reduce expenditures below their planned levels in order to avert deficits in the near future.

Prices

Headline consumer price inflation slowed in June as energy prices flattened out after having increased rapidly over the preceding three months.  Despite June's favorable outcome, total PCE prices were up at an annual rate of about 4 percent over the first half of this year, compared with 2¼ percent over the twelve months of 2006.  Outside of food and energy, however, core inflation slowed in the first half of this year from last year's upward revised pace.  Resource utilization still appears to be relatively tight, but long-run inflation expectations have remained within the range that has prevailed during much of the past few years.

Excluding food and energy, PCE prices rose 0.1 percent in June.  Prices of core goods fell 0.2 percent, bringing the decrease in the first six months of this year to an annual rate of ¾ percent, a faster rate of decline than occurred in 2006.  After rising modestly last year, apparel prices fell sharply in the first half of this year and more than accounted for the overall deceleration in core goods prices.  Prices of core services rose 0.3 percent in June and were boosted by higher prices of housing services, particularly lodging away from home, which posted a sizable increase for the third consecutive month.  Over the first half of this year, prices of core services rose at an annual rate of about 3 percent. This pace was ¼ percentage point lower than its rate in 2006, reflecting a sizable deceleration in owners' equivalent rent.

Energy prices declined 0.6 percent in June after a rise of 15 percent (not at an annual rate) over the previous three months.  This substantial run-up in energy prices followed very large declines late last year; on balance, energy prices were up 4½ percent over the twelve months ending in June after rising more than 24 percent during the comparable period twelve months earlier.  Gasoline prices fell 1 percent in June and appear to have declined again in July despite marked increases in crude oil input costs over the same period.  Increased production at gasoline refineries has boosted inventories, and gasoline margins, while still elevated, have fallen well below their recent peak in May.

Food prices posted another large increase in June and continued to show signs of the pass-through of high corn prices, which have been boosted by strong demand for ethanol. In the first half of this year, the PCE price index for food and beverages has increased at an annual rate of 5¾ percent, a sizable step-up from the 2 percent increase in 2006. While this pickup has been widespread, price increases for meats, poultry, eggs, and dairy, for which corn is the main feedstuff, have been particularly large this year.  That said, recent rains and USDA reports predicting a bumper harvest have pushed corn prices

down considerably in recent weeks.  Spot prices for slaughter-ready cattle, for which corn is the major feed source, have also dropped below their recent highs, and spot prices for poultry have merely flattened out in recent weeks.

Broader measures of inflation have slowed relative to the pace of the past few years.  In the second quarter, the four-quarter change in the GDP price index was 2.7 percent, down ¾ percentage point from the increase over the preceding four-quarter period.  GDP prices excluding food and energy have decelerated by a similar amount over this period.  This slowdown reflects both a small deceleration in core PCE prices over this period and a considerable step-down in price increases for construction.

As measured by the Reuters/Michigan survey, the median expectation for year-ahead inflation increased to 3.4 percent in June and remained at that rate in July despite declines in gasoline prices in both months.  The median expectation for inflation over the next five to ten years moved back up to 3.1 percent, near the top of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past few years.  Inflation compensation from TIPS five-to-ten years ahead has changed little since the last FOMC meeting and remains at about its average level over the past couple of years.

Strong global demand and rising energy prices have continued to push up the prices of goods at earlier stages of processing this year.  These prices have some, albeit small, predictive content for finished goods prices.  The PPI for core intermediate materials increased 0.4 percent in both May and June and rose at an annual rate of 4½ percent in the first half of this year, about the same as the pace over 2005 and 2006.  Commodity prices have continued to move higher since the June Greenbook and are up considerably from their levels a year earlier.  The Journal of Commerce index of industrial materials has risen about 2¾ percent since the June Greenbook, boosted in part by its energy components, and the Commodity Research Bureau's index of industrial spot prices, which includes excludes energy, was up 2 percent over the same period.

Labor Costs

The employment cost index for hourly compensation of private industry workers rose at an annual rate of 3½ percent in the three months ending in June, compared with an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first quarter of this year.  This pickup reflected a modest rebound in employer contributions to retirement and savings plans after a very large drop in the preceding three months.  The twelve-month change in private-industry hourly compensation was 3.1 percent in June, up about ¼ percentage point from the increase

over the preceding year.  The acceleration is the result of a faster increase in wages and salaries-3¼ percent over the twelve months ending in June, compared with 2¾ percent over the year-earlier period.  ECI benefits increased at about the same rate in both periods; in the most recent twelve-month period, a marked deceleration in retirement and savings contributions was offset by a sizable acceleration in nonproduction bonuses.

Using the most recent NIPA data, the staff estimates that compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second quarter and was up 5¼ percent from four quarters earlier.  This four-quarter change is noticeably above the downward-revised gain of 3¾ percent posted over the preceding four quarters. Combined with a deceleration in output per hour over the past year, the compensation data imply that unit labor costs have continued to trend up, with the latest four-quarter change at 4½ percent.  As a result, the markup of nonfarm business prices over unit labor costs has fallen back somewhat from its peak last year, but it remains well above its longrun average.

Annual Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts

The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPA), released on July 27, affected data back to the beginning of 2004.  This year's revision mainly reflected the incorporation by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of more-comprehensive source data. The four-quarter change in real GDP was revised down 0.3 percentage point in 2004, 0.2 percentage point in 2005, and 0.5 percentage point in 2006.

Downward revisions were fairly widespread by expenditure category and did not noticeably alter the contour of real GDP over the revision period.  Real personal consumption expenditures (PCE) are now estimated to have risen 0.3 percentage point per year more slowly during the 2004-06 period, and that change made the largest contribution to the overall revision to real GDP.  New information from annual Census surveys also showed that outlays by state and local governments increased noticeably more slowly than previously estimated in all three years.  Elsewhere, the revisions included lower estimates of spending for residential investment in 2005 and for equipment and software and business inventories in 2006.

The BEA's changes to its price indexes were generally small.  Core PCE inflation was revised up 0.1 percentage point in both 2005 and 2006, with market-based core PCE inflation up 0.1 percentage point in 2006 only.  However, the increase in overall GDP prices revised up by a larger amount because of a sizable upward revision to residential construction prices in 2005.

On the income side of the accounts, the average increase in gross domestic income was revised down by about the same amount as GDP; the increase in GDI is still reported to have exceeded the increase in GDP by an average of 0.3 percentage point per year over the 2004-06 period.  Real disposable personal income is now estimated to have risen considerably faster because higher estimates of personal interest and dividend income (derived from Internal Revenue Service data) more than offset a downward revision to employee compensation.  This higher income, together with the downward revisions to PCE, led the personal saving rate to be revised up 1¾ percentage points, to 1.1 percent by the first quarter of 2007.  Corporate profits were revised up in 2004 and 2005 but were revised down considerably in 2006; as a result, corporate profits as a share of GNP are now reported to have increased only modestly last year (and to have declined in the fourth quarter).  Much of last year's downward revision to profits stemmed from a revision to the capital consumption adjustment-that is, to new BEA estimates indicating that economic depreciation had revised up relative to companies' reported depreciation.  In addition, data from firms' financial reports indicated a much flatter trajectory for book profits over 2006 and into the first quarter of 2007 than previously estimated.

The annual NIPA revision also provided information about the magnitude of upcoming revisions to measures of productivity and compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector.  We now

estimate that output per hour in the nonfarm business sector rose at an annual rate of about 1-3/4 percent during 2004 and 2005 and about 1 percent in 2006; these estimates for 2005 and 2006 are 0.4 percentage point and 0.7 percentage point, respectively, lower than reported earlier. In addition, we estimate that increases in compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector will be revised down through 2006, though by less than productivity.  The quarterly pattern of increases in compensation per hour now appears to be somewhat smoother than in the data as currently published, but it remains highly erratic.

Domestic Financial Developments

Overview

Mounting concerns about subprime mortgage performance and credit risk more broadly reverberated in financial markets during the intermeeting period.  The value of securities tied to subprime mortgages plunged, and issuance of such securities slowed sharply. Risk spreads on corporate bonds widened notably, although business credit quality has yet to show any deterioration.  A number of planned issues of speculative-grade bonds and leveraged loans, intended predominantly to finance leveraged buyouts (LBOs), were postponed or restructured, but issuance of investment-grade corporate bonds appeared little affected.  Broad equity-price indexes fell, on net, over the period despite solid second-quarter earnings reports.  Expectations for the federal funds rate and yields on Treasury securities declined considerably even though incoming economic data were generally seen as mixed.

Policy Expectations and Interest Rates

Market participants largely anticipated the FOMC's decision at its June meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged.  However, the accompanying statement expressed greater concern about inflation than investors reportedly had foreseen and caused the expected path for policy to edge higher.  In addition, policy expectations were boosted a bit by some favorable economic news early in the intermeeting period. However, money market futures rates declined a little in the wake of the Chairman's semiannual testimony to Congress, as investors reportedly focused on the downward revision to the Committee's central tendency forecast for real GDP growth.  Rates fell further amid growing apprehension about the risk to economic growth associated with the difficulties in the subprime mortgage market and the market for low-rated corporate credits.  Federal funds futures currently imply a small probability of a rate cut at the August FOMC meeting and roughly a 40 percent chance of an easing by the September meeting.  Further out, investors have marked down their policy expectations even more and now appear to expect about 70 basis points of easing by the end of 2008, up from about 30 basis points at the time of the last FOMC meeting.  By contrast, primary dealers in the Desk's survey put lower odds on the prospects for near-term policy easing than do futures market participants:  Dealers reported that they placed virtually no odds on a rate cut at the August meeting and expect only about 15 basis points of easing between now and the end of next year.  Measures of policy uncertainty derived from options on Eurodollar futures climbed notably over the intermeeting period, and the implied distribution of the federal funds rate became more skewed toward lower rates.

Credit Default Swap Spread

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

On balance, two- and ten-year nominal Treasury yields fell 35 and 30 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period, in part because of the decline in the expected path of the funds rate.  A decline in estimated term premiums and a notable increase in swap spreads since the June meeting are consistent with reports that safe-haven demands also contributed to the decline in Treasury yields.  Yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities declined somewhat less than their nominal counterparts, thereby leaving inflation compensation a bit lower on net.

Stock Prices and Corporate Interest Rates

Broad stock price indexes declined about 3 percent, on net, since the June meeting despite generally solid second-quarter earnings reports.  Share prices of financial firms fell 9 percent, partly reflecting concerns about exposures to subprime mortgages and about the effect of a potential slowdown in merger activity on operating profitability. Share prices for retailers dropped 5 percent on a number of warnings that sales in the second quarter were lower than expected.  Amid declining share prices and Treasury yields, the spread between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio for S&amp;P 500 firms and a real long-run Treasury yield-a rough gauge of the equity risk premium-widened somewhat.  Implied volatility on the S&amp;P 500 index jumped to the top of its range over the past few years.

Conditions in corporate credit markets tightened substantially over the intermeeting period.  Spreads on a traded index comprising 100 of the most liquid speculative-grade credit default swaps (CDS) rose about 185 basis points, as investors pulled back from riskier assets.  Spreads on CDS were also reportedly boosted by a flood of hedging demands from institutions that had committed to underwriting LBOs.  Spreads on speculative-grade bonds increased about 110 basis points since the June meeting and now stand about 150 basis points above their lows in mid-June.  Investment-grade bond spreads rose about 30 basis points.  Speculative-grade and investment-grade bond spreads are now at the top of their ranges over the past four years but are still below their peaks in 2002.  Because Treasury yields declined notably since the June meeting, investmentgrade yields are about unchanged despite the rise in spreads.  Liquidity in the CDS and corporate bond markets appeared to remain adequate.

Corporate Earnings and Credit Quality

Second-quarter earnings reports have generally been solid.  However, most homebuilders disclosed substantial second-quarter losses, which stemmed in part from falling land prices, and several financial firms reported losses on assets related to subprime mortgages.  With about three-quarters of reports in hand and analysts' estimates for the rest, the staff projects that earnings per share for S&amp;P 500 firms will come in about 7 percent above year-earlier levels.  As usual, most announcements exceeded analysts' forecasts.  Regarding the near-term outlook, the revision index of analysts' forecasts of year-ahead earnings for S&amp;P 500 firms was near zero in July.

Although some of our indicators are a bit stale, corporate credit quality appears to have remained strong overall.  Liquidity of nonfinancial corporate balance sheets stayed high by historical standards in the first quarter, and leverage for that sector remained low. Rating downgrades on corporate bonds continued to be modest in the second quarter, and the realized six-month trailing bond default rate hovered near zero in June.  KMV's aggregate year-ahead expected bond default rate stayed near record lows in June; although we anticipate some increase in July because of the decline in stock prices and the rise in volatility, the near-term outlook for corporate credit quality implied by the KMV measure almost surely remains favorable.

Business Finance

The influence of tighter financial conditions in corporate credit markets has been concentrated in financings slated for LBOs.  Continuing the trend that began in late June, a number of high-yield bond and leveraged loan issues intended to finance LBOs were delayed or restructured over the intermeeting period.  Issuance of high-yield bonds slowed but did not stop in July.  Leveraged loan issuance also fell considerably, as investors have become uncertain about the valuation of securities issued by structured entities (such as collateralized loan obligations and collateralized debt obligations), the primary buyers of leveraged loans in recent years.  Investment-grade bond issuance appeared little affected, although one investment-grade firm postponed a deal scheduled to come to market on July 26, a day of particularly high volatility in financial markets. Commercial paper outstanding posted a modest gain in July.  C&amp;I loan growth through mid-July picked up from an already solid clip.  According to industry reports, underwriting banks have been forced to keep on their balance sheets loans that they were

unable to place with investors.  Overall, net debt financing stepped down in July from its torrid second-quarter pace but remained moderate. 1

Gross public equity issuance by nonfinancial corporations also fell off in July, in line with typical seasonal patterns.  Private equity issuance is estimated to have picked up in the second quarter on the strength of LBOs.  Even so, net equity issuance continued to be deeply negative, as share repurchases and retirements from cash-financed mergers and acquisitions both held at near-record paces.  In July, tighter financial conditions for speculative-grade firms weighed on merger and acquisition activity, particularly LBOs, portending a slowdown in retirements, and to a lesser extent, private issuance.

Commercial Real Estate

Commercial mortgage debt is estimated to have expanded briskly again in the second quarter, and the issuance calendar for commercial-mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) suggests solid growth early in the third quarter.

Spreads of rates on investment-grade CMBS over those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities have risen sharply over the intermeeting period, and the spread on the BBBrated tranche now stands at its highest level since the fall of 1998.  CMBS spreads rose earlier this year as demand fell from the sponsors of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  Over the past couple of months, spreads have been volatile but trended up sharply as investors and rating agencies became increasingly concerned about the higher leverage on recently securitized mortgages.  The most recent spike in late July may reflect increased anxiety about structured products in general.

The delinquency rate on CMBS ticked down in June to the lowest level recorded for this series.  Delinquency rates on commercial mortgages held at life insurance companies remained negligible in the first quarter, whereas the delinquency rate on commercial mortgages held at commercial banks rose a bit because of deterioration in the performance of loans for multifamily properties and for construction and land development.  Although the vacancy rate on commercial properties edged up in the second quarter, it remained at a relatively low level, consistent with the moderate gains in rents.  Increases in commercial property prices relative to operating income in the second quarter led to another decline in the ratio of net operating income to property prices, an indicator of the rate of return on commercial real estate.  As a result, the spread of this

ratio over the real perpetuity Treasury yield, a rough measure of the risk premium on commercial real estate assets, narrowed somewhat in the second quarter to its lowest level since 1991, reflecting continued strong demand for commercial real estate properties.

Household Finance

Over the intermeeting period, interest rates on both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages for prime borrowers ticked down.  Mortgage debt growth is likely to have slowed further in the second quarter because of the decline in home-price growth over the past year.  Consumer credit expanded moderately through the year ending in May.

Delinquency rates on consumer loans and prime mortgages-which account for the vast majority of total household debt-remained low through May.  Nevertheless, according to the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, a number of banks tightened standards for prime mortgages over the past three months.  The delinquency rate on subprime variablerate mortgages topped 13 percent in June, more than double the low in mid-2005. 2

Issuance of subprime-mortgage-backed securities (subprime MBS) has been negligible in July, as underwriters had difficulties placing these securities with investors.  Demand from CDOs was reported to be particularly weak, possibly reflecting investor uncertainty about the ratings that MBS-backed tranches of CDOs would receive.  Originations of subprime mortgages may have been held down by a further tightening of credit standards on nontraditional and subprime mortgage products, consistent with responses to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey.  Spreads on new issues of subprime MBS over libor climbed further over the intermeeting period after downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's of MBS backed by subprime mortgages originated in the first half of 2006. Standard &amp; Poor's also downgraded some CDOs backed by subprime MBS, including some AAA-rated tranches.  Severe liquidity problems at a few large nonprime mortgage lenders contributed to the general sense of investor angst about the mortgage market.

The OFHEO purchase-only index of home prices rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, and the available monthly indicators point to little change in that index in

the second quarter.  Futures quotes on the S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home-price index continue to indicate that home prices in ten of the largest metropolitan markets are expected to decline modestly over the next few quarters.

Given the rise in stock prices in the second quarter and our expectation of essentially flat house prices, we estimate that household net worth relative to disposable income increased last quarter, reversing the decline posted in the first quarter.  Net flows to longterm mutual funds were robust in June and July, propelled by strong inflows to both international equity and bond funds, while domestic equity funds continued to have net outflows.

Treasury and Agency Finance

Treasury security auctions during the intermeeting period were well received, according to bid-to-cover ratios.  Demand from foreign investors appeared to stay strong:  The sixmonth trailing averages of indirect bidding ratios remained robust, and foreign custody holdings at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York edged a bit higher.

Despite the strains in credit markets, Treasury market liquidity remained ample.  Trading volume for on-the-run issues was near record highs.  Bid-ask spreads widened slightly, on balance, but were within historical norms.

Yield spreads on debt issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over comparable Treasury securities moved to their widest levels in a few years, reflecting investor concerns regarding their exposure to mortgage products.  These concerns also weighed on share prices of these government-sponsored enterprises, which fell roughly 10 percent on net.

In its quarterly refunding statement, the Treasury Department announced that it will offer $22 billion in new securities at the August refunding, including $13 billion in ten-year notes and $9 billion in thirty-year bonds.  The Treasury also reported that it expects the current debt ceiling to be reached in early October.

State and Local Government Finance

Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds fell sharply in July.  Short-term issuance is on track to match its average pace over the first half of the year.  Rating changes were minimal in July, and the ratio of a representative municipal bond yield to a comparablematurity Treasury yield stayed near the low end of its range of the past decade, suggesting that the credit quality of municipal bonds remains solid.

Money and Bank Credit

M2 expanded at an annual rate of about 4 percent in July, down from its surprisingly strong pace earlier in the year.  Liquid deposits and small time deposits, the main contributors to the slowdown, have been about flat in July, whereas retail money funds surged nearly 23 percent.  Currency growth has been modest, held down by weak foreign demand.

Commercial bank credit is estimated to have grown at about a 9 percent rate in July, a pace just below that of the second quarter.  Commercial and industrial loans continued to expand smartly.  By contrast, lending to businesses through commercial real estate loans is estimated to have slowed notably in July.  The weakness in residential real estate lending in June appears to have persisted last month, as banks sold a large volume of mortgages.  According to the July Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey, the demand for both nontraditional and subprime mortgages weakened further over the past three months. Consumer loan originations rebounded in July, although this increase was mainly a result of a thrift-to-bank consolidation within a bank holding company; without this boost, consumer loans continued to advance at a moderate pace.

Appendix

Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices

The July 2007 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey on Bank Lending Practices addressed changes in the supply of, and demand for, bank loans to businesses and households over the past three months.  Special questions in the survey asked banks about their involvement in, and 1 assessment of, the outlook for the syndicated loan market. As in the April survey, banks were queried separately about changes in standards on, and demand for, prime, nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgages.  This appendix is based on responses from fifty-two domestic banks and twenty foreign banking institutions.

Both domestic and foreign institutions indicated that they had eased terms on commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans over the past three months, while a small net fraction of banks reported a tightening of standards on such loans over the same period.  Respondents also noted in the July survey that they had tightened credit standards on commercial real estate loans.  On net, domestic institutions reported somewhat weaker demand for C&amp;I loans over the past three months. Branches and agencies of foreign institutions, in contrast, reportedly experienced moderately stronger demand for such loans, on net, over the same period.  Both domestic and foreign institutions noted that the demand for commercial real estate loans has weakened, on net, since April.

With regard to loans to households, domestic institutions reported that lending standards on prime residential mortgages had tightened some, on balance, during the survey period, whereas considerable net fractions of respondents indicated that they had further tightened lending standards on nontraditional and subprime mortgage loans.  Demand for prime and nontraditional residential mortgages was reportedly slightly weaker over the past three months, but a notable net fraction of banks reported that they had seen weaker demand for subprime residential mortgages over the same period.  A significant net percentage of domestic banks also reported weaker demand for consumer loans over the past three months.

Business Lending

In the July survey, a small net fraction of domestic institutions reported that they had tightened lending standards on C&amp;I loans to large and middle-market firms over the past three months. Domestic respondents, however, noted that they had further eased some terms on C&amp;I loans to such firms over the same period.  About 30 percent of respondents-a smaller net fraction than in the April survey-indicated that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds over the previous three months, while smaller net fractions reported that they had reduced the costs of credit lines and eased loan covenants.

III-A-2

Similarly, a very small net fraction of domestic institutions also reported having tightened lending standards on C&amp;I loans to small firms in the July survey.  About one-third of domestic banks, on net, reported that they had trimmed spreads of loan rates over their cost of funds for such borrowers over the past three months, and smaller net fractions reported that they had reduced the costs of credit lines and lowered premiums charged on riskier loans.

Fifteen percent of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks reported that they had tightened credit standards on C&amp;I loans during the survey period.  Regarding loan terms, a small net fraction of foreign institutions indicated that they had increased the maximum size of credit lines, whereas other terms on C&amp;I loans at these institutions were reportedly little changed over the past three months.

Nearly all domestic banks and all U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks that reported having eased their lending standards and terms in the July survey pointed to more-aggressive competition from other banks or nonbank lenders as the most important reason for having done so.  Institutions that reportedly moved to a more stringent lending posture, in contrast, cited a less favorable or more uncertain economic outlook, a reduced tolerance for risk, and decreased liquidity in the secondary market for C&amp;I loans as the most important reasons for the change in their lending policies.

The net fraction of domestic banks reporting weaker demand for C&amp;I loans in the survey period declined somewhat relative to the April survey.  On net, about one-eighth of domestic banks noted that they had experienced weaker demand for C&amp;I loans from large and middle-market, as well as from small firms in the July survey.  In contrast, one-fifth of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, on net, reported stronger demand for C&amp;I loans over the past three months.  The most frequently cited reasons for weaker demand at domestic banks were borrowers' decreased need to finance inventories and investment in plant and equipment.  A relatively large number of domestic and foreign institutions that reported an increase in demand for C&amp;I loans, pointed to greater financing needs for merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity as the most important reason for the rise.

Regarding future business, about 13 percent of domestic respondents, on net, reported that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers had decreased over the previous three months, about the same percentage as in the April survey.  On net, foreign respondents indicated that the number of inquiries from potential business borrowers was unchanged over the past three months.

III-A-4

The July survey included a set of special questions regarding banks' involvement in, and assessment of the outlook for, the syndicated loan market.   In general, syndicated loans 2 accounted for a relatively small fraction of C&amp;I loans on domestic banks' books, but the share was substantial for some banks.  About one-fourth of domestic institutions noted that syndicated loans accounted for less than 5 percent of their bank's C&amp;I loans, and about one-half reported that syndicated loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent of their C&amp;I loan portfolios.   About one-fifth of respondents noted that syndicated loans accounted for between 3 21 percent and 50 percent of their C&amp;I loans.  Four domestic respondents noted that these loans accounted for more than 50 percent-but less than 75 percent-of  C&amp;I loans on their books. These institutions accounted for about 10 percent of all C&amp;I loans on the books of the domestic banks that responded to this special question.  In general, the share of syndicated loans did not appear to be related to the size of banks' portfolios of C&amp;I loans.  At foreign institutions, syndicated loans accounted for a more significant fraction of C&amp;I loans on respondents' books: Of the twenty respondents, four foreign institutions reported that syndicated loans accounted for between 35 percent and 50 percent of their C&amp;I loan portfolios, whereas six institutions reported that such loans accounted for between 50 percent and 75 percent of C&amp;I loans.  Finally, nine foreign banks reported that syndicated loans accounted for more than 75 percent of C&amp;I loans on their books.  One relatively small foreign respondent noted that syndicated loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent of its C&amp;I loans.  As was the case for domestic institutions, the share of syndicated loans did not appear to be related to the size of the foreign banks' loan portfolios.

According to the July survey, leveraged syndicated loans generally accounted for a relatively modest fraction of all syndicated loans on the books of most domestic and foreign institutions. 4 About one-half of domestic banks reported that leveraged syndicated credits accounted for less than 5 percent of syndicated loans on their books, whereas approximately 40 percent noted that such loans accounted for between 5 percent and 35 percent of their syndicated loans.  About onetenth of domestic respondents reported that leveraged loans accounted for more than 35 percentbut less than 75 percent-of their syndicated loans.  Regarding foreign banks, about one-third of

these institutions reported that leveraged loans accounted for more than 20 percent-but less than 50 percent-of the syndicated loans on their books.  About the same fractions of foreign banks noted that leveraged loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent and for less than 5 percent of syndicated loans on their books.

Domestic institutions reported that loans originated to fund leveraged buyout (LBO) activity typically accounted for a relatively small fraction of syndicated loans on their books.  About twothirds of domestic respondents noted that LBO-related loans accounted for less than 5 percent of syndicated loans on their books, whereas about 30 percent reported that such loans accounted for between 5 percent and 35 percent of their syndicated loans.  Finally, about 6 percent of respondents noted that LBO-related loans accounted for more than 35 percent-but less than 75 percent-of syndicated loans on their books.  Foreign institutions also mostly reported relatively small exposure to LBO-related loans.  About 65 percent of foreign respondents reported that LBO-related loans accounted for less than 5 percent of their syndicated loans, and about onefifth of respondents noted that such loans accounted for between 5 percent and 35 percent of their syndicated loans. Only three foreign institutions reported that LBO-related loans accounted for more than 35 percent-but less than 75 percent-of their syndicated loan portfolios.

At both domestic and foreign institutions, bridge loans and equity bridge loans generally accounted for very small fractions of syndicated loans.  About one-half of domestic institutions 5 reported that they did not have any bridge loans on their books, and about 45 percent of domestic banks noted that such loans accounted for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated loans.  Only one institution reported that bridge loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent of its syndicated loan portfolio.  Regarding equity bridge loans, three-fourths of domestic respondents reported that they did not have any such loans on their books, and the remaining fraction noted that equity bridge loans accounted for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated loans.  Of the nineteen foreign respondents, five banks indicated that they did not have any bridge loans on their books, whereas twelve banks noted that bridge loans accounted for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated loans. Only two foreign institutions reported that bridge loans accounted for between 5 percent and 20 percent of their syndicated loans.  Regarding equity bridge loans, two-thirds of foreign institutions reported that they did not have any such loans on their books, whereas the remaining banks noted that such loans accounted for between 0 percent and 5 percent of their syndicated loans.

Domestic and foreign banks reportedly expect a tightening of credit standards and terms in the syndicated loan market in coming months, in part because of a very large number of deals in the

pipeline.  Indeed, about two-thirds of domestic respondents and almost all foreign respondents expect tighter lending standards, a widening of loan spreads, an increased number of covenants, and more-stringent covenants.  Moreover, more than one-third of domestic respondents and approximately two-thirds of foreign respondents expect a reduction in the loan portion of financing deals and the introduction of call protection or original issue discounts on loan deals.

Lending standards for commercial real estate loans were reportedly tightened further over the survey period:  About one-fourth of domestic institutions-a slightly smaller net fraction than in the previous survey-and about one-third of foreign institutions indicated that they had tightened lending standards on commercial real estate loans over the past three months.  Regarding demand, approximately one-fourth of domestic and foreign institutions reported that demand for commercial real estate loans had weakened over the past three months.

Household Lending

As in the April survey, banks were asked to report separately about changes in standards on, and demand for, prime, nontraditional, and subprime residential mortgages.  In the July survey, banks indicated that they had tightened their lending standards on the three mortgage loan categories over the past three months, although the net fractions of banks that reported doing so were somewhat smaller than in the April survey.  About 13 percent of domestic banks reportedly tightened their lending standards on prime residential mortgages over the past three months.   By 6 contrast, about 38 percent of respondents-out of the forty institutions that originated nontraditional residential mortgages-noted that they had tightened standards on these types of mortgage products.   Moreover, of the fifteen institutions that reported having originated 7 subprime residential mortgages, about 53 percent reported that they had tightened standards on such loans. 8

As in the April survey, tighter standards on subprime and nontraditional mortgage loans were not necessarily associated with more-stringent lending policies on prime loans.  Indeed, of the eight institutions that reported having tightened standards on subprime residential mortgages over the past three months, only one bank had tightened standards on prime residential mortgages.  Of the fifteen domestic banks that tightened standards on nontraditional mortgage loans, five tightened standards on prime mortgages.

III-A-10

On net, about one-tenth of domestic banks-a smaller net fraction than in the April surveyreported weaker demand for prime mortgage loans, and about one-fifth of respondents-about the same net fraction as in the April survey-experienced weaker demand for nontraditional mortgage loans.  In contrast, about 46 percent of respondents, on net-more than twice the percentage in the April survey-reported weaker demand for subprime residential mortgages over the past three months.

On balance, domestic respondents' willingness to make consumer installment loans and their lending standards for approving applications on credit card loans were little changed over the past three months.  A small net fraction of banks reported having tightened lending standards on noncredit-card consumer loans over the same period.  Some terms on both categories of consumer loans were tightened a touch during the survey period.  On net, about one-eighth of respondents reported having raised spreads of interest rates charged on outstanding credit card balances relative to their cost of funds, and about one-fifth of respondents reported having reduced the extent to which consumer loans other than credit card loans were granted to customers who did not meet credit-scoring thresholds.  The remaining terms on both types of consumer loans were reportedly little changed.  Finally, on net, about one-fifth of domestic respondents reported that they had experienced weaker demand for consumer loans, about the same net fraction as in the April survey.

In May, the value of exports of goods and services increased 2.2 percent, following little change in April.  The May increase mostly reflected a 3.3 percent jump in exports of nonagricultural goods (excluding gold), although exports of services also rose.  Within goods, exports of capital goods moved up briskly, rising 5.5 percent; the increase was led by a particularly large jump in exports of aircraft but was also supported by higher exports of computers and semiconductors.  Exports of industrial supplies exhibited strong growth, boosted by a jump in exports of petroleum products.  After a sharp 10.6 percent increase in April, agricultural exports edged down in May.  For the second consecutive month, automotive exports declined modestly.

The average value of exports in April and May increased 9.6 percent (a.r.) from the first quarter.  Exports of agricultural goods and industrial supplies exhibited particular strength.  In contrast, exports of capital goods edged down, reflecting declines in exports of aircraft and computers.  In the advance NIPA release, real exports of goods and services rose at an annual rate of 6.4 percent in the second quarter.

The value of imported goods and services rose 2.3 percent in May following a 2 percent decline in April.  About half of the May increase was due to non-oil goods, but oil and services imports were also higher.  The rise in imports of non-oil goods was led by imports of non-oil industrial supplies and capital goods, which increased 3.9 and 2.9 percent, respectively.  After a decline of 4.7 percent in April, imports of automotive products fell a further 2.4 percent in May.

The average value of imports in April and May rose 7.4 percent (a.r.) from the first quarter.  The increase partly reflected a large rise in the value of imported oil, as a jump in the price of imported oil more than offset a decline in quantity.  Imports of non-oil industrial supplies also rose sharply.  Imports of services increased only slightly, whereas imports of autos, consumer goods, and capital goods all declined.  In the advance NIPA release, real imports of goods and services fell 2.6 percent in the second quarter.

Prices of Internationally Traded Goods

Non-oil imports. In June, prices of U.S. imports of core goods rose 0.2 percent, below the 0.5 percent increase in May.  Prices for imported material-intensive goods rose 0.5 percent, more slowly than in recent months, but they still accounted for the bulk of the increase in core prices.  Within material-intensive goods, non-fuel industrial supplies led the way, as prices for imported metals jumped in June.  Prices for imported finished goods inched up in June, as the boost from a sizable jump in prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors) was offset by flat prices for consumer goods and a sluggish increase in prices for automobiles.  Outside of core imports, the price for imported natural gas rose 0.5 percent, prices for imported semiconductors were unchanged, and prices for imported computers fell.

In the second quarter, core import prices rose about 3½ percent at an annual rate (on a NIPA basis), continuing the acceleration from the first quarter.  Prices for materialintensive goods were up 12 percent (a.r.), whereas prices for finished goods increased 1¼ percent (a.r.).  Within material-intensive goods, prices for agricultural products and metals both rose sharply, while most of the price increase for imported finished goods reflects higher prices for capital goods (excluding computers and semiconductors).

Oil. The BLS price index of imported oil rose 4.7 percent in June.  The index has risen for five consecutive months and stands 28 percent above its level in January.  The spot price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil increased roughly 6 percent in June and nearly 8 percent in July.  In July, the spot price averaged around $74 per barrel.

The rise in oil prices over the past two months appears to reflect recent supply disruptions and concerns of a tighter oil market going forward.  Planned and unplanned production outages in the North Sea, worsening violence in Nigeria, and continued OPEC production restraint have provided upward support for oil prices.  In addition, global oil demand has remained robust.  Moreover, the idiosyncratic weakness that has recently characterized the spot price of WTI relative to the prices of other grades of oil has begun to dissipate as inventories at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for WTI, have run off from record levels.

Exports. Prices of U.S. exports of core goods rose 0.4 percent in June, somewhat faster than in May.  All of the increase came from material-intensive goods; prices of exported finished goods were flat in June.  Within material-intensive goods, prices of exported agricultural products rose almost 3 percent in June, after falling in April and being roughly flat in May, with prices for imported grains and meat both soaring in the month. Prices of exported computers fell 0.3 percent in June, a modest decline compared to the average decline over the past year, and prices for exported semiconductors were unchanged for the second consecutive month.

In the second quarter, core export prices rose 7 percent at an annual rate (on a NIPA basis), about 1 percentage point faster than in the first quarter.  The step up in inflation is attributable to prices for nonagricultural industrial supplies.  There was a sharp deceleration in prices for agricultural exports, which rose at an annual rate of 7½ percent after rising at an average rate of over 20 percent in the three previous quarters.

U.S. International Financial Transactions

Total net foreign private purchases of U.S. long-term securities (line 4 of the Summary of U.S. International Transactions table) totaled $125 billion in May, the first month during which total foreign private net purchases have exceeded $100 billion, but moderated in June to $62 billion.  May's inflows were led by record foreign net purchases of both U.S. corporate debt (line 4c) and U.S. equities (line 4d).  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. corporate debt dropped to an unusually low $16 billion in June.  Foreign acquisitions of U.S. equities also fell in June, but remained strong at $27 billion.  Private net purchases of Treasures (line 4a) were relatively robust in both May and June following large net sales in April.  There were small net purchases of agency debt securities in both May and June.

For the second quarter as a whole, total private inflows were exceptionally large at $222 billion (line 4), resulting primarily from record inflows into U.S. equities ($105 billion). Foreign investors purchased more U.S. equities in the second quarter of 2007 than they did in all of 2005 and are on pace to double their acquisitions of 2006.  Foreign purchases of U.S. corporate debt ($100 billion) accounted for the bulk of the remaining inflows into U.S. securities during the quarter and were in line with inflows seen in recent quarters. There were modest net purchases of agency debt securities and small net sales of Treasuries during the quarter.

Foreign official flows in May and June (line 1) followed a markedly different pattern from private flows, with very small inflows recorded in May ($8 billion) and very large inflows recorded in June ($58 billion).

.  For the quarter, total official inflows were measured at $100 billion, a bit lower than the average of recent quarters.

.

U.S. residents' acquisitions of foreign securities (line 5) in May and June were in keeping with recent trends and were evenly distributed between equity and debt securities. Outflows during the second quarter ($88 billion) were about the same as those recorded in the first quarter and a bit ahead of last year's pace.  Most of these acquisitions were recorded versus the United Kingdom, which yields little conclusive information as to the ultimate destination of these flows as many non-U.K. securities trade on U.K. exchanges.

The normally volatile banking sector (line 3) posted a small net inflow during the quarter despite a large net outflow in June.

Combining official flows with private banking and private security flows yields a net inflow in the second quarter of $241 billion, roughly $40 billion above the first quarter's figure for this measure.

Foreign Financial Markets

Volatility in financial markets increased over the intermeeting period, with sovereign yields falling 10 to 33 basis points and stock markets declining 2.7 to 4.7 percent in major economies.  Although these moves were prompted by rising concerns about the subprime-mortgage market in the United States, investors appeared to re-evaluate risk spreads more generally in both U.S. and foreign financial markets and to increase their demands for safer assets.  The major currencies index of the dollar's exchange value declined 1.4 percent on balance over the period.  On a bilateral basis, the dollar depreciated over 3 percent against the yen, 1.4 percent vis-à-vis the euro and sterling, and it was little changed against the Canadian dollar.  In late July, the dollar depreciated against the euro to an all-time low.

Headline equity indexes declined about 4 percent in the United Kingdom and in the euro area, and 4.7 percent in Japan.  Following elevated concerns in credit markets, realized volatilities on headline equity indexes picked up in the euro area, Japan, and in the United States over the period.

The intermeeting period saw widespread tightening in monetary policy and increases in short-term interest rates.  On June 28, Norway's central bank raised its benchmark rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percent; on July 5, the Bank of England increased its Bank rate 25 basis points, to 5.75 percent; on July 10, the Bank of Canada raised its target for the overnight rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percent; and on July 12, the Bank of Japan voted 8-1 to keep its target rate unchanged at 0.5 percent.  All moves were fully anticipated.  The European Central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at the July and August meetings, also in line with market expectations, and the Bank of England kept the Bank rate unchanged on August 2.  Three-month spot interest rates increased 3 to 13 basis points in Germany, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Canada.  In contrast, ten-year nominal sovereign yields decreased between 10 and 22 basis points in the same countries. U.S. ten-year rates fell 33 basis points.  Yields on inflation-indexed sovereign bonds decreased almost as much as nominal yields did during the intermeeting period, except in the Japan, where inflation breakeven rates rose slightly.  Realized volatilities of ten-year bonds increased in the intermeeting period in the United States, Germany, and Japan.

The dollar's trade-weighted exchange value against the currencies of our other important trading partners changed little on balance over the intermeeting period.  The dollar depreciated 6.5 percent against the Thai baht, despite Thailand's central bank's

announcement on July 12 that it would scrap limits on direct offshore investment by listed Thai companies in an effort to stem currency appreciation.  The Bank of Thailand surprised markets by cutting its benchmark 1-day repurchase rate 25 basis points, to 3.25 percent, on July 18.  The dollar also depreciated 2.9 percent vis-à-vis the Brazilian real .  Brazil's central bank cut its Selic lending rate 50 basis points to a record low of 11.5 percent on July 19.  In contrast, the dollar appreciated 1.3 percent vis-à-vis the Mexican peso.  The Mexican Bolsa index decreased 2.5 percent on balance, whereas the Brazilian Bovespa index increased 1.1 percent.  In emerging Asia, Thailand and Korea's main equity indexes rose over 5 percent on balance.  Emerging market bond spreads increased considerably in Latin America over the period.

On July 20, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) increased its benchmark one-year lending and deposit rate floors, effective July 21, following news that both GDP and consumer prices increased strongly in the second quarter.  The renminbi appreciated on net 0.7 percent versus the dollar over the intermeeting period and the Shanghai Composite index increased 12.6 percent.

.  The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

Developments in Advanced Foreign Economies

Upbeat business and consumer confidence, as well as favorable labor market conditions, suggests that growth has remained above trend in all the advanced foreign economies in the current quarter, despite some slowing of expansion in the second quarter.  Although many of these economies experienced sharp declines in equity prices and widening credit spreads amid deepening concerns about credit quality, these developments occurred too late in the intermeeting period to have any apparent impact on incoming data.

Headline inflation has leveled off in both the United Kingdom and Canada, but elevated core inflation readings reveal that inflationary pressures are still strong.  In the euro area, inflation continues to hover close to, but below, 2 percent.  In Japan, headline inflation dipped back into negative territory in June.  The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada both raised their policy interest rates in early July.

In Japan, the June Tankan survey continued to portray an economy that is expanding moderately, with the headline index of economic sentiment among large manufacturers remaining high by historical standards.  The survey also pointed to strong capital spending plans by large- and medium-sized firms and indicated an across-the-board improvement in the sales outlook.  Overall, firms continued to see the labor market and resource utilization as relatively tight.

Nevertheless, recent indicators suggest that the economy is facing some headwinds. Second-quarter consumption indicators are somewhat mixed, with retail sales advancing in May and real household expenditures receding a bit in both May and June.  Industrial production rebounded 1.2 percent in June after declining for three consecutive months. Shipments continued to rise in June, leading to a reduction in the inventories-to-sales ratio.  The inventories-to-sales ratio for information and communications equipment also fell in May and June, after having risen substantially in previous months.  In June, real exports rose 0.7 percent, while real imports were about unchanged.  On a twelve-month basis, real exports to the United States declined for a fourth consecutive month in June, while real exports to the European Union and Asia continued to increase.

Consumer prices edged lower in June, and the twelve-month rate of headline inflation turned negative again.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation remained slightly below zero in June, and the fall in Tokyo core consumer prices in July indicated little inflationary pressure in the near term.  Nominal wages continued to decline in May,

despite the unemployment rate remaining at 3.7 percent, the lowest rate in nearly ten years.

In Upper House elections held July 29, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party lost its majority.  Prime Minister Abe vowed to continue pursuing reform despite calls for his resignation, but he said he would reshuffle his cabinet in an effort to win back voter trust. The ruling coalition still has a large majority in the more powerful Lower House of Parliament, but loss of control of the upper chamber may threaten policy gridlock.

Euro-area GDP growth in the first quarter was revised upward 0.5 percentage point to 2.9 percent.  The pace of economic expansion appears to have slowed a bit in the second quarter in spite of a rebound in consumption spending in Germany from the first-quarter plunge that was induced by a hike in the value-added tax.  Other data released during the intermeeting period came in a bit weaker than had been expected.  Euro-area industrial production rose in May, but the average figure for April and May was just 0.2 percent above the first-quarter average.  Euro-area retail sales also disappointed, with a decline of 0.7 percent in May, reportedly because of unusually gloomy weather conditions.  In June, in contrast, French consumer spending on manufactured goods bounced back after two weak months, rising 1.6 percent.

Indicators of third-quarter activity point to relatively strong growth.  The euro-area purchasing managers' index for manufacturing and especially for services remained well above the expansion threshold in July.  European Commission survey measures of business and consumer confidence remained near record levels in July.  In Germany, the IFO indicator of business morale edged down for a second straight month in July but remained at a fairly elevated level, even though manufacturers were less optimistic about exports.

Labor market conditions have continued to improve.  The euro-area unemployment rate declined further in May to 6.9 percent, and remained there in June, the lowest rate since Eurostat began measuring it in 1993 and almost 2 percentage points below its rate at the beginning of 2005.  Wage pressures have nonetheless remained moderate.  In the first quarter, total labor costs and unit labor costs rose only 2.2 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively, above their levels a year earlier.

Euro-area consumer prices rose 1.8 percent in July on a twelve-month basis, according to the preliminary estimate.  Core inflation (excluding energy and unprocessed food) stood at 1.9 percent in June.  Liquidity growth in the euro area has remained surprisingly high, renewing concern about price stability among several ECB officials.

Real GDP in the United Kingdom rose 3.3 percent (a.r.) in the second quarter, according to the preliminary estimate.  Growth was driven mainly by services, which expanded 3.6 percent.  After four quarters of stagnation, the output of production industries expanded 2.0 percent, led by a 2.7 percent expansion of manufacturing.

Although GDP expenditure components are not yet available, other indicators are consistent with a firming of domestic demand in the second quarter.  Retail sales grew a robust 4.7 percent (a.r.) in the three-month period to June, up 2.6 percentage points from a quarter earlier.  According to the Bank of England Agents' Summary of Business Conditions, a survey of U.K. private businesses, investment intentions in the services and manufacturing sectors were both near decade highs in June.

The Labor Force Survey and the claimant count measures of the unemployment rate both ticked down during the intermeeting period, reaching 5.4 percent in April and 2.7 percent in June, respectively.  Wage inflation remains contained.  The twelve-month growth rate of average earnings (including bonuses) was 3.5 percent in May, almost 0.5 percentage points lower than its average over the previous five years.  Unit wage costs in manufacturing industries were 1.3 percent higher in May than they were a year earlier.

The twelve-month rate of headline inflation continued to revert back towards the 2 percent target during the intermeeting period, sliding to 2.4 percent in June.  For a fourth consecutive month, housing and household services were the main drivers of the fall in inflation, as natural gas and electricity prices declined so far this year after having risen last year.  Core inflation, which excludes energy and unprocessed food, was unchanged at 2.2 percent in June, remaining near record highs since the series began in 1997.

The Bank of England raised its key policy interest rate ¼ percentage point to 5.75 percent on July 5, judging that the balance of risks to the outlook for inflation continued to lie to the upside.

In Canada, real GDP by industry rose 4.2 percent (a.r.) in May, propelled by significant increases in retail and wholesale trade.  The advance in retail trade between April and May, which was widespread across sectors, was the best one-month showing since late 2001.  Construction activity also increased, as strong growth in non-residential construction more than offset a small decline in residential construction.  Manufacturing output rose; however, industrial production slipped a bit, due to a retreat of energy sector output, especially in oil and gas exploration activities.

Other indicators for the second quarter continue to suggest growth at a rate slightly above that of potential.  Averaged over April and May, the volume of exports was over one percent higher than the first-quarter average, while the volume of imports was about 0.6 percent higher.  Despite appreciation of the Canadian dollar, the manufacturing sector, which is heavily export-oriented, has fared particularly well:  the volume of manufacturing shipments increased for a fourth consecutive month in May, and both new and unfilled orders also rose strongly.  Second-quarter housing starts were 2 percent above their first-quarter level.  The composite index of leading indicators and the Ivey purchasing managers' index both rose again in June.

Employment growth picked up in June after being about flat on net in the previous two months; the April and May lull came on the heels of first-quarter job gains that were the strongest in five years.  The unemployment rate again held steady at 6.1 percent in June, a thirty-three year low, and twelve-month wage inflation increased to 3.2 percent from 2.8 percent in May.

In June, the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation was 2.2 percent, the fifth consecutive month it has been above the mid-point of the Bank of Canada's target range of 1 to 3 percent.  The twelve-month rate of core inflation, which excludes the eight most volatile components and the effects of changes in indirect taxes, moved up to 2.5 percent in June from 2.2 percent in May.  Continuing to exert upward pressure on the core index is homeowners' replacement costs (which are estimated using, among other data, prices for new homes); replacement costs have decelerated since last summer, but they continue to grow at over 6 percent.  The twelve-month rate of change of new home prices inched down to 8.6 percent in May, continuing its gradual moderation since last summer.

The Bank of Canada increased the target for the overnight rate ¼ percentage point to 4.5 percent on July 10, its first move since May 2006, citing stronger-than-expected economic growth and inflation in the first half of this year.

Economic Situation in Other Countries

Recent economic indicators from the developing economies suggest that economic activity remains generally strong.  The Chinese economy has continued to expand at a blistering pace, and activity elsewhere in emerging Asia appears to have accelerated.  In Latin America, Mexican indicators point to a weaker-than-expected rebound in the second quarter, whereas Brazil and Argentina appear to have experienced solid growth. Inflation has increased in China, mainly due to soaring food prices, but has generally remained little changed elsewhere in the developing world.  Equity prices have fallen and bond spreads have widened in several emerging market economies, particularly in Latin America; however, there is no evidence so far that this increased volatility has weighed on economic activity.

In China , second-quarter real GDP grew at an estimated 14¾ percent annual rate, driven by strength of exports and fixed investment.  The rise in output from its year-earlier level was the fastest recorded rate in nearly twelve years.  Exports have been spurred by both high global demand and a rush to ship goods before the imposition of a fresh round of cuts in value-added tax rebates, effective July 1, on a wide array of exported products. Ballooning exports have resulted in another large increase in the trade surplus.  Fixed investment continued to expand rapidly, up 28 percent in the second quarter from its year-earlier level, and retail sales grew at an impressive pace of more than 15 percent.

Consumer prices accelerated further in June, with a twelve-month increase of 4¼ percent, up from 3½ percent in May.  Food prices continued to soar, rising more than 11 percent in the twelve months ending in June.  Non-food price inflation hovered at just 1 percent, but concerns about food price inflation spilling into non-food price inflation have intensified.  Part of the acceleration in food prices is due to rising meat prices resulting from hog disease earlier this year.  Moreover, the rate of inflation of grain prices has not fallen.  Chinese authorities tightened monetary policy again in mid-July after the release of the second quarter's much-higher-than-expected growth and inflation figures.  Interest rates on the benchmark one-year deposit and lending rates were increased by 27 basis points each, to 3.33 and 6.84 percent respectively, the third increase in rates this year.  In late July, the reserve requirement ratio for banks was raised by ½ percentage point, effective August 15.  Reserve requirements have been raised a cumulative 4.5 percentage points since June 2006, bringing the total ratio to 12 percent for large banks.

In Hong Kong , recent data point to a pickup in the pace of real GDP growth in the second quarter, following below-trend growth in the first.  Retail sales rebounded in May from a weak April level.  In addition, the value of exports and imports in the second quarter grew 11 and 12 percent from a year earlier, respectively, an indicator of strong activity in this entrepôt economy.  The unemployment rate fell to its lowest level since 1998.  Twelve-month inflation remained low in May and June because of a rent concession on public housing, scheduled to expire in October.

In Taiwan , economic indicators suggest that output growth increased in the second quarter from a first-quarter trough.  After contracting in the first quarter, industrial production jumped nearly 8 percent in the second.  In addition, trade data for June showed strong growth in both exports and imports, with the merchandise trade surplus

increasing.  In June, twelve-month consumer price inflation remained near zero; however, consumer prices climbed in the first half of this year following a fall in the second half of 2006.  The central bank in June increased its official discount rate to 3.125 percent, the highest level since September 2001, mainly to discourage the carry trade that has targeted Taiwan because of its low interest rates.

Korean GDP jumped 7 percent in the second quarter, a notable acceleration from the previous two quarters.  Domestic demand remained strong, and net exports rebounded some.  On the back of the solid trade performance, Korea's current account returned to surplus in the second quarter.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation in Korea rose 2.5 percent in July.  Korean inflation continues to be boosted by food prices and a shift up in core inflation from last year.  Bank credit has risen sharply with lending to smalland medium-sized establishments up over 20 percent in the twelve months ending in June.  In response, the Bank of Korea raised its target rate ¼ percentage point to 4.75 percent in mid-July and also announced restrictions on overseas borrowing by foreign and domestic banks.  Short-term external debt has soared of late, in part reflecting currency hedging by Korean shipbuilders.  Finally, the Bank also stated that it would be shifting its target rate from the call rate to a 7-day repo rate early next year, but provided few details.

In India , economic indicators hint at some moderation in output growth after a first-quarter surge.  Average industrial production for April and May was up 3.6 percent from the previous quarter.  Inflation continued to decline, following monetary policy tightening earlier in the year and other government measures targeted at reducing consumer prices for imported goods, and loan growth slowed.  After soaring in April, the trade deficit narrowed a bit in May, as export growth remained strong but imports weakened a touch.  The Reserve Bank of India held rates steady at its meeting on July 31 but raised the required cash reserve ratio for banks and removed the ceiling imposed on

the size of its daily reverse repo auctions.  Both moves were thought to be targeted at removing liquidity from the banking system related to strong capital inflows.

Recent data for the ASEAN region suggest continued expansion in the second quarter.  In Singapore, the advance unofficial estimate (not shown) indicates that second-quarter real GDP rose nearly 13 percent, as the volatile biomedical sector rebounded and domestic activity, notably construction, continued to be strong.  Elsewhere in the region, average industrial production for April and May was up from first-quarter levels, and trade surpluses remained high.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation across the region continued to decline in most countries owing to more subdued energy price inflation and, in some countries, the unwinding of previous increases in food prices and local currency appreciation.  One exception was Singapore, where higher healthcare and recreation prices boosted headline inflation.  Amid the reduced inflationary pressures and the desire to stimulate domestic demand, the central banks of Indonesia and Thailand lowered interest rates 25 basis points in July.  The Philippine central bank also lowered its policy rate 150 basis points in mid-July, but the bank simultaneously removed a tiered scheme that offered a lower interest rate on large deposits.  The rapid appreciation of its currency against the U.S. dollar prompted Thailand to relax its foreign exchange regulations in order to facilitate capital outflows.  Similarly, the Philippine central bank announced that it would ease foreign exchange regulations by the end of September.

In Mexico , recent indicators point to a weaker-than-expected rebound in economic activity in the second quarter.  The average level of industrial production in April and May was up only 1 percent from the first quarter, as the key manufacturing and construction sectors failed to experience any significant recovery from their first-quarter weakness.

Twelve-month headline inflation remained at 4 percent in June, largely due to increases in milk, avocado, and orange prices.  Despite inflation hovering around the upper limit of the Bank of Mexico's 2-to-4 percent inflation target range, the central bank decided during its late July meeting not to tighten monetary policy but signaled a further tightening of policy might occur if inflation does not recede as expected.

In Brazil , recent data releases indicate robust activity in the second quarter.  Average April-May industrial production was up 1.7 percent from the first quarter and 4½ percent from a year earlier, while retail sales were up over 9 percent from a year earlier.  The trade surplus widened to $49 billion in the second quarter (a.r.), boosted by high commodities prices, bringing the current account surplus to over $10 billion, about 1 percent of GDP.  The trade surplus narrowed again in July, largely due to an increase in imports.

Twelve-month inflation moved up to 3.8 percent in June, fueled in part by higher prices of food, but is well below the 4.5 percent mid-point of the government's inflation target range.

In Venezuela , inflation remained very high, ending at over 17 percent in July on a twelve-month basis.  The government continued to focus most of its attention on suppressing inflationary pressures, in part by reducing the VAT from 11 to 9 percent in July.  The government is also reputed to have lowered spending growth in recent months, but fiscal accounts lack transparency.

In recent weeks, the Finance Minister stated that the official bolívar would not be devalued in January 2008, when a so-called monetary reform is enacted, but may be devalued in early 2009.  (In January 2008, the bolívar is scheduled to be replaced by the bolívar fuerte, which will be equal to 1,000 bolívares.)   The parallel market bolívar has depreciated 25 percent against the dollar over the past nine months, fueling inflationary pressures, and prompting congressional efforts to punish those who have large transactions in the market.  At the end of July, the parallel market exchange rate stood at over 4,200 bolívares per dollar, versus 2,144 per dollar for the official rate.  The government also continued to conduct intervention sales of foreign exchange to support the bolívar via non-market mechanisms.  On July 27, the central bank's international reserves including gold stood at about $25 billion, down from $30 billion at end 2006.

In Turkey , real GDP expanded 6.8 percent in the first quarter, on the back of strong growth in government consumption and net exports, and the unemployment rate decreased slightly.  However, the large current account deficit widened despite strong growth in exports.  Industrial production rose 3.5 percent in May after weakness earlier in the year.

Twelve-month consumer price inflation continued to edge down in June but remained well above the central bank's 2007 target of 4 percent.  Early results from the recent parliamentary election indicate the ruling AK Party will remain in power, as expected. Financial markets reacted favorably to the results as investors anticipated the AK Party would press ahead with its pro-business reform agenda.  EU accession talks continue, although progress on several critical chapters has stalled.

In South Africa , indicators on second-quarter performance were mixed.  Manufacturing recovered strongly in May, though production in the mining sector was down.  Because of high commodity prices, the value of metal exports reached a record level in May, leading to an improvement in the merchandise trade balance.  However, the trade balance worsened again in July as exports fell while imports increased.  Twelve-month consumer price inflation in June was 6.4 percent, making June the third consecutive month in which prices have breached the South African Reserve Bank's 3-6 percent target range.  The sources of inflation are widespread, but food and fuel prices made a combined contribution of 3.7 percentage points.  The outlook for inflation has worsened somewhat

as public-sector strikes in June were resolved with employees receiving a 7.5 percent cost-of-living raise.
