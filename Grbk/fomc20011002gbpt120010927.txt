Overview

In constructing  this forecast, we have worked to assess the implications  of two broad sets of developments.  First, data on foreign  activity have  come in weaker than we anticipated in the previous Greenbook.  In particular,  we were  surprised on the downside  by second-quarter  GDP data for Canada and for several  Asian emerging-market  economies, and economic  indicators  for July  and August point to continued weakness in many countries.  Second, the terrorist attacks  of September  11  have cast  a long  shadow  across the foreign  outlook.  Our assessments of the  economic implications  of these events are surrounded  by significant uncertainties. That said, we expect  that the effects of these events will reduce growth in foreign economies through  several  channels: weaker import demand  from the  United States, in line with the lower near-term  forecast for U.S.  growth;  disruptions in industries  such as  air travel  and tourism; consequences  of developments  in financial markets, including both negative wealth effects  due to falling stock prices and possible reductions  in international capital  flows;  and retrenchments  in  consumer and business  sentiment.

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE.  Changes  for years  are  measured as Q4/Q4;  for half-years,  Q2/Q4 or Q4/Q2.

... Not applicable.

In response to the weaker-than-expected  data and to our assessment of the effects  of the terrorist  attacks,  we have  significantly  reduced our projection for foreign  growth in the second  half of this year.  We now anticipate that growth will remain at zero,  down nearly  1-1/2 percentage  points from the previous Greenbook.  However, we project that the foreign  economies will begin to heal in 2002  as the repercussions  from the attacks  wane,  as the U.S.  economy begins to recover,  as  global  electronics demand  strengthens, as energy prices trend down, and as the monetary and fiscal stimulus that many  countries have put in place  supports activity. Under these circumstances,  we see foreign growth moving up next year, albeit to a lower rate than  was projected in the  August Greenbook.  These same factors  should allow for a further acceleration in 2003 with  foreign  output  moving back toward potential.

The spot price  of West Texas  Intermediate  is now trading around  $22 per barrel, down about $5 per barrel, on balance,  since the events of September  11. Concerns  about potential disruptions  in oil supply,  which drove  the price of oil higher in the immediate aftermath  of the terrorist  attacks, quickly gave  way to concerns  about the  outlook for world oil demand.  Our forecast  calls for the price of WTI  to edge up to about $23 per barrel in the first half of next year and then to decline  to  around  $20.50 per barrel  by the end of 2003. Given this path for oil  prices and our outlook  for foreign  activity, we expect  that foreign inflation  rates, after having moved down considerably  since  late last year, will remain contained through the end of the  forecast period.

Since  September  11,  the nominal value of the dollar has declined on balance against an index  of major currencies but has risen  against an  index of our developing-country  trading  partners.  The broad dollar index  has changed little on net.  Our forecast  calls for the broad  real dollar to depreciate  slightly through the end of 2002,  as we see the near-term  weakness  of U.S. growth  and the projected  easing of U.S.  monetary policy likely to weigh on the  dollar. However, we expect  its value to stabilize over 2003,  as the U.S.  recovery gains steam.

We expect that both imports and  exports declined at double-digit  rates in the third quarter  and will remain weak through the first quarter of next year.  We project that as 2002 progresses,  imports and  exports will recover roughly in parallel,  as both U.S.  growth and foreign  growth  strengthen.  On balance,  net exports  are expected  to make a negative arithmetic  contribution  to growth  of between  1/4 percentage  point and 1/2 percentage  point in the second  half of this year and in 2002 and 2003.

Recent Developments

International financial  markets. The average  exchange value  of the dollar against  the major foreign currencies  was  about unchanged, on balance,  over the intermeeting  period.  Dollar appreciation  against several  major currencies  early in the period was reversed  as markets reacted to the weak U.S.  employment report for August and then, more  dramatically, to the terrorist attacks  of September  11. In the aftermath, the dollar tended to decline against the currencies of European  countries, falling nearly 4-1/2 percent against the Swiss franc and 2 percent against the euro.  The dollar fell sharply  against the yen in the days after the attacks,  prompting repeated  intervention purchases  of dollars and euros  by the Japanese  authorities;  on balance,  the dollar has depreciated 1 percent  against  the yen. In contrast,  the dollar firmed 6 percent against the Australian  dollar and 3/4 percent against  the Canadian  dollar. On average, the

dollar has moved down  3/4 percent  in terms of the major foreign  currencies since September  11.

The exchange  value of the  dollar against the currencies  of our other important trading  partners  climbed 2 percent over the intermeeting period.  Half of this increase occurred  after  September  11,  as the dollar strengthened  4-1/2 percent against  the Brazilian real,  4 percent  against the  Chilean peso, 2-1/4 percent against  the Mexican  peso,  and  1-1/2 percent  against the Korean  won.  Relative to these  currencies the dollar seemed to benefit from some "safe-haven" sentiment.

Following the FOMC's intermeeting rate  cut on  September  17,  the Bank of Canada,  the European  Central Bank,  the Swiss National  Bank, and  the central banks of Sweden, Denmark, and New Zealand  all lowered  their respective policy rates 50 basis points, and the Bank of England  eased policy  25 basis points. In addition, the Bank of Japan committed to maintain excess reserves above its previous target of ¥6 trillion and  lowered its discount  rate from 25 basis points to  10 basis points.  In explaining  these moves, the central banks cited weak prospects  for global growth  and  concerns that the terrorist attacks might weigh heavily  on consumer and business  confidence.  On September 24, the  Swiss National  Bank eased  another 50 basis points in an  effort to stem the appreciation  of the franc.

Share prices have fallen sharply on all major exchanges  since the last FOMC meeting.  Significant  declines were recorded  after the events of September  11, as  equity prices in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France,  Italy, and many emerging-market  economies  dropped  more than  10 percent.  Long-term interest rates in  most foreign countries  remained about unchanged,  on balance, after the attacks,  while  short-term market rates  moved down with  official lending rates.

The EMBI+ index of emerging-market  risk spreads declined  about 30 basis points,  on balance,  during the first three  weeks  of the intermeeting  period, mainly  on the announcement  that the IMF would further augment Argentina's program.  In the aftermath  of the terrorist  attacks,  however, the EMBI+ spread jumped  140 basis points, reaching  its highest level in  two years;  spreads on Argentine  and Brazilian  debt rose  150 basis points and 250 basis points, respectively.

After the terrorist attacks,  the  European Central Bank and the  Bank of England established  temporary swap facilities  with the Federal  Reserve--and  the Bank of Canada augmented its facility--in order to provide temporary dollar liquidity to their respective  financial institutions. Only the ECB drew on these facilities, and it quickly closed  out its drawings.

Economic  activity  abroad. Incoming data for the foreign industrial countries paint  a picture of continued weakness.  Japanese real GDP fell sharply  in the second quarter,  led by a plunge in private investment.  For July, the all-industry index,  a production-side  proxy for GDP, moved down, and machinery  orders--a leading  indicator of business  investment--declined  for the  third consecutive month.  In the  euro area, second-quarter GDP  was about flat,  with consumer expenditures  remaining  fairly strong but with investment  spending declining markedly.  More recent indicators,  including German manufacturing  orders and euro-area  industrial  production,  point to continued weakness. In Canada, annualized real GDP growth dropped to about  1/2 percent in the second quarter, as private consumption  slowed abruptly.  Canadian  employment  declined in July and August, and the unemployment  rate climbed  to its highest level in two years,  raising concerns  that labor market  conditions may further brake consumer spending.

With oil prices moving down over the past year and with economic slack increasing,  twelve-month  inflation  in the euro area and in Canada  dropped below 3 percent in July and  remained below  3 percent  in August.  Deflation continued  in Japan.

Conditions  in many of the major developing  countries have been acutely recessionary. The emerging Asian economies continue to be battered by the falloff of global electronics  demand.  During the second quarter, GDP plunged more than 10 percent  (s.a.a.r.)  in Singapore  and Taiwan,  8-1/2 percent in Malaysia, and 6-1/2 percent in Hong Kong.  Recent  indicators provide little  sign of an imminent recovery. In Latin America,  the Mexican  economy  has contracted for three consecutive  quarters,  and  declining industrial  production and weak exports point to further contraction in the third quarter.

U.S.  international transactions. The U.S.  trade deficit in goods and  services was $28.8  billion in July, little changed  from the $29.1  billion deficit recorded in June. The value of exports  in July dropped 2-1/2 percent from the previous month, with declines recorded  in most trade categories, particularly  in machinery  (high tech and  other), industrial  supplies,  and automotive products. In the second  quarter, exports  tumbled  12 percent (a.r.),  their third consecutive quarter  of contraction. Exports  of semiconductors  and  other machinery accounted for most of this decline,  but exported industrial supplies also fell off sharply. The value of imports moved down 2 percent  in July, with marked weakness in the value  of imported oil  (both price  and quantity),  semiconductors,

other achinery, utomotive  roducts,  nd  consumer  goods.  Imports n  the m a p a i second  quarter  ropped  15 percent  a.r.),  e econd  consecutive  uarterly d ( th s q decline.  he bulk  of his ecline  ccurred n  computers,  emiconductors, d T t d o i s an other achinery.
