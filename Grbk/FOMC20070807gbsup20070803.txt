Supplemental Notes

The Domestic Nonfinancial Economy

Labor Market Developments

Private nonfarm payroll employment rose 120,000 in July, and the June level was revised up 33,000.  The July gain was equal to the average increase this year and was about 50,000 less than the average increase in 2006.  The unemployment rate edged up to 4.6 percent last month; it has remained between 4.4 and 4.6 percent since last September.

By industry, construction employment declined 12,000 in July, with most of the drop in jobs typically associated with nonresidential construction.  Since the beginning of the year, construction employment has decreased an average of 5,000 per month after having been essentially flat over the second half of last year.  Manufacturing employment edged lower (-2,000) in July after somewhat larger declines earlier in the year.  Employment in retail trade also was little changed.  Hiring in most other private service-producing industries continued to be solid, with noticeable increases in jobs at professional and technical services firms (26,000), at health care facilities (36,000), and at leisure and hospitality businesses (22,000).

Average weekly hours of production or nonsupervisory workers ticked down to 33.8 hours in July, reversing its June increase.  Over the past year, the workweek has changed little on net.  Aggregate production worker hours moved down 0.1 percent in July, leaving the current level 0.3 percent (not at an annual rate) above the average level in the second quarter.

Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on nonfarm private payrolls rose 0.3 percent in July.  Over the twelve months ending in July, average hourly earnings increased 3.9 percent, the same as over the preceding twelve months.

In the household survey, the participation rate held steady at 66.1 percent in July. Although the number of short-term job losers remained at a relatively low level last month, the number of longer-term job losers increased, suggesting a decrease in hiring. Last month's slight uptick in the unemployment rate reflected increases for both adult men and women, but not for teenagers.
