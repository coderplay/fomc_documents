Foreign Exchange  Markets

The exchange  value of  the  dollar against a weighted average  of other major currencies has risen 1 1/2 rcent on balance  since the FOMC meeting on pe October  3; the dollar appreciated against European currencies  and the Canadian and Australian dollars,  but depreciated  slightly against the yen.

Exchange  Value  of the Dollar

<!-- missing-text -->

Buoyed by the market's focus on the continuing positive differential in growth rates  between the United States  and the euro  area, the dollar appreciated to record  highs against the euro in the  second half of October, surpassing levels reached prior to the  September 22 joint foreign exchange  intervention operation by the G-7. The October 5 decision  of  the European  Central Bank to raise its refinancing rate 25  basis points to 4  3/4 rcent did not give any support to the pe common currency. However, the release  of weaker-than-expected  U.S.  GDP growth data on October  27 was viewed by many in the market as marking a shift in the exchange rate trend, and the dollar lost a sizable share of its intermeeting gains versus the euro in the two weeks  preceding the publication  of  this Greenbook.

The British pound and the  Swiss franc generally followed the movements of the euro during the period.  On net, during the intermeeting period, the dollar appreciated about 2  1/2 rcent against the euro pe and the  Swiss franc,  and 3 percent versus  sterling.  The dollar also appreciated 1% percent against the Canadian  dollar amid uncertainty about the upcoming Canadian parliamentary  elections.

The dollar  epreciated    percent  gainst e en  over  the ntermeeting riod d 1 a th y i pe despite  isquieting  gnals  bout he ragility   apan's  conomic  recovery, d si a t f ofJ e including  he ankruptcy  f wo  life  nsurance  ompanies  and  a  substantial t b o t i c decline  n  industrial  oduction  n eptember.

Asset prices  in several Asian countries  also declined  during the intermeeting period, suggesting a possible  decrease  in the appetite  of  international  investors for exposure  to emerging markets.  A set of country-specific  factors, however, also contributed to the movements in asset prices in the region.  For example, political turmoil continued to weigh on the exchange  values of the currencies of the Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan, and sharp declines in the price of computer chips  were seen as a major cause of the decline  of equity prices in Korea.
