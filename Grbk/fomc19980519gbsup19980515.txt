In  addition,  e  production r l m th of medium  and heavy  trucks as  grown strongly  n  the  last  wo months,  coinciding  ith  sales h i t w rates hat re  the  highest  ince 978.

Consumer Sentiment

According  to  the  preliminary  eport  rom the  Michigan  Survey  Research  Center, r f consumer  sentiment ell  ack  somewhat in  early ay  but  remained  at  a highly avorable f b M f level. All  the  major  components in  the  aggregate  ndex  moved  lower;  if  hese eadings  ere 2 i t r w not  to  change  in  the  final  eport, e  overall  ndex  would be  back  to  the  level hat revailed, r th i t p on average, n  the  fourth uarter  f  last  ear. i q o y

Among  those  questions  ot  in  the  overall  easure, he ndex  of  expected n m t i unemployment change  jumped 9 percentage  oints n  early ay  as  the  share f  respondents p i M o expecting  ore unemployment over  the  coming year  climbed  from 16 to  22 percent f  the m o sample. Nevertheless,  e  increase  n  the  index  in  early ay  only  returned  t o  about  the th i M i t same level hat revailed  n  the  fourth uarter. t p i q

Consumers'  appraisals   buying  conditions  or ars dged higher n  early ay, while of f c e i M their  iews  on  buying  conditions  or omes fell  ack. Although  a larger  hare f  respondents v f h b s o believed hat ow was a good time  to  buy a home  because  "times re  good" and "prices  ow," t n a l this as offset,   part,  y a  decline n  the  share hat iewed  interest  tes  s  low. w in b i t v ra a
