SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK

_  _

Overview

On  the surface, the projection of  economic activity herein is almost identical to  that in the  May Greenbook. Real GDP growth apparently is spurting in  the current quarter, as  we expected; and on  the assumption that monetary policy will not change materially, we  are still projecting that activity will run at  roughly its trend rate of growth in  coming quarters, a  pattern that prevents any magnification of  existing pressures on  labor and capital resources. But with no cushion to absorb adverse shocks to aggregate supply-notably, the recent poor grain crops--the consumer price index is projected to increase a  bit more than 3  percent this year and next.

Below the surface, however, is our concern that the risks surrounding this forecast may be  more heavily weighted to the upside, particularly in  the near term. The  tenor of  incoming information on economic activity has been more upbeat than we anticipated; notably, there is no indication that employment growth is flagging, and the demand for homes may  not be responding to the rise in  mortgage rates as quickly as  we  have predicted. Moreover, because inventories now appear to  be fairly lean in  a  number of industries, sustained strength in  final sales could put pressure on firms to build stocks more rapidly than in  our baseline forecast; if that were to happen, the  multiplier effects on  jobs and income could raise aggregate demand over coming months, intensifying inflationary pressures.

This kind of scenario may  well be  what is  worrying some bond market participants; certainly, some prominent Wall Street analysts are predicting that growth will remain relatively strong for a while. At this point, however, we are more comfortable sticking with the pack, and our  baseline forecast does not differ greatly from the most recent Blue Chip consensus. We  see the rise in longterm interest rates, continued modest fiscal restraint, the appreciation of  the dollar since last summer, and the general maturing of the business cycle as arguing for only a  moderate expansion of activity. Thus, we  are projecting that real GDP growth, after posting a  hefty increase in the current quarter, will drop back quickly and average just a  little more than 2  percent during the next six quarters.

Although this baseline projection for activity does not, by itself, suggest that we  should revise our inflation outlook, we  have in  fact shaved a  bit off our wage and price forecasts. In  part, this revision reflects our introduction of  a  technical adjustment for changes in the way  the BLS will measure medical care inflation in  the CPI beginning January 1997. In addition, we  have incorporated a  more favorable near-term outlook for energy prices associated with anticipated sales of  Iraqi oil this summer; the resultant lowering of  overall consumer price inflation helps in  turn to damp the rise in  compensation, thus diminishing cost pressures later this year and in 1997. As a  result, we  now are projecting that reported core CPI inflation will edge up only to 3.0 percent in 1997--a couple of tenths less than projected in  the May Greenbook. Key Background Factors in the Forecast

Our key financial assumptions are essentially unchanged from those in the last Greenbook. As  a  baseline for the Committee's discussion, we  have continued to assume that the federal funds rate remains at or  near 5-1/4 percent through 1997. Bond yields currently are a  touch higher than we  expected they would be, reflecting mainly the  market's response to the upside surprises in employment and other recent indicators of activity; we  are not anticipating any dramatic movements in long rates from here, but we do think that the markets will tend to respond favorably if growth moderates as  we have forecast. On  the other hand, if  our concerns about more persistent strength in activity were to  be realized, the response of the bond market would likely be  quite negative.

Although we  believe that the rise in intermediateand longterm interest rates this year has been great enough to drain some energy from aggregate demand in  coming months, there are no signs that households or  businesses are finding borrowing costs prohibitive. Moreover, the availability of  financing clearly is not an issue today for most of them. There is some anecdotal evidence that lenders are becoming a  bit more cautious in  extending credit to the household sector--especially with regard to new  credit card issuance--but conditions are far from tight, and we  don't foresee much further change in this direction. Meanwhile, lenders continue to  be accommodative, sometimes even aggressive, toward business customers; barring a  deterioration in credit quality, which seems unlikely in  the projected economic environment, we don't view access

to  credit becoming an  inhibition to  business investment in inventories or fixed capital.

The recent hesitation in  the stock market uptrend is consistent with our expectations. Market participants appear to  have come increasingly to our view that prevailing share valuations may be stretching the fundamentals, and we  continue to anticipate a  mild correction in the nearer term. However, we  expect that, with some growth in corporate profits and some easing of  bond yields, stock prices will recover the lost ground in  1997. This path is  the same as that in  the May Greenbook.

Nor have we  made any significant changes to our assumption that fiscal policy will exert some restraint over the projection period, albeit less than the modest amount imposed in  the current fiscal year. In  particular, we expect that discretionary spending will be somewhat higher than  is envisaged in  the recent congressional budget resolution, by $3  billion in  fiscal 1997 and by $17 billion in fiscal 1998. Moreover, we  continue to  assume that the proposed cuts in taxes and mandatory spending in  the resolution will fail to materialize--as happened this year. Under our policy and economic assumptions, we  project that the unified budget deficit will be $128 billion in fiscal 1996 and $163 billion in  fiscal 1997, somewhat higher than in  the previous Greenbook. The strikingly small deficit in  fiscal 1996 is due to events that we  expect will be transitory--in particular, a  surge in  tax  payments presumably associated with higher realized capital gains and an  unusually slow rate of  growth in nondiscretionary health care outlays.

With respect to the external sector, the trade-weighted value of the dollar in  terms of other G-10 currencies has declined only slightly in recent weeks, and we  have retained the assumption that it  will be little changed through the end of 1997. The outlook for foreign economic growth is a  touch stronger than in  the last Greenbook, with foreign GDP (on  a  U.S. export-weighted basis) projected to  increase 3-1/2 percent in  1996 and 3-3/4 percent in 1997, versus 1-3/4 percent in 1995. Although the reported surge in Japanese GDP in the first quarter caught everyone by surprise, the broader array of  information on foreign activity seems generally consistent with our forecast of a  moderate acceleration in world activity. Because of  the recent agreement reached between Iraq and the United Nations, we  have revised down our projection for oil prices over the remainder of this year. In  particular, we expect

the additional exports to  push down the spot price for  WTI crude from its recent level of around $20 per barrel to less than $17 per barrel. Oil prices are projected to  move back up to about $19.50 per barrel by  mid-1997 because of increases in demand associated with  world economic growth.

Recent Developments and Prospects for  the Current Quarter

Our projection in  the May Greenbook was for a  sizable advance in real GDP in the second quarter--roughly 3-1/2 percent at  an annual rate. Thus far, the data we have received since the May  FOMC have been mainly on  the strong side of our expectations, and it  now appears that GDP growth might be  closer to 4  percent this quarter. To be sure, much of  the acceleration in output reflects special factors; the most important of  these is the rebound in  motor vehicle production after the  March strike at  GM,  which accounts for a  substantial positive swing in inventories this quarter. Indeed, the stepup in  motor vehicle production contributes a  percentage point to  GDP growth. But the latest readings on the spending side suggest that final demand remained robust well into the quarter.

We  would be  more confident about our current-quarter projection were it not for the mixed signals coming from the labor market. As noted earlier, the gains in  payrolls through May  were impressive, outstripping our expectations; furthermore, the low level of initial claims for unemployment insurance in  recent weeks suggests the likelihood of  another solid gain in  jobs this month. At  the same time, however, the average workweek of private sector production workers has been on  the short side recently, and aggregate hours were little changed in  April and May. Nevertheless, cutting through the monthly volatility in  the recent data, hours in  May stood 1.6 percent (annual rate) above the fourth-quarter level--an increase we  see as  consistent with a  substantial first-half gain in GDP--and on  balance, we read the range of labor market indicators as relatively upbeat.

Signs of strong second-quarter activity are especially evident in  the industrial sector. The aforementioned rise in  motor vehicle assemblies boosted industrial production sharply in  April, and additional broad-based gains occurred in  manufacturing in  May. On net, industrial production is  projected to  be  up about 5-1/2 percent at an  annual rate this quarter, after a 3 percent rise in  the first quarter.

Final sales are projected to grow at a  2-3/4 percent annual rate in  the current quarter, with the  household sector accounting for much of the gain. Non-auto retail sales registered healthy advances in  April and May, and sales of  light vehicles have remained at a  surprisingly high level. All told, we now  expect growth in consumer spending to approach 3 percent this quarter.

Although the sharp decline in  housing starts in  May may  be  a sign that higher mortgage rates have begun to bite quite forcefully, permits fell much less, and the range of available demand-side indicators for the sector suggests that the drop-off in  housing activity has thus far been rather mild. In  any event, given the robust level of starts before May and the typical lags between starts and construction, another substantial gain in residential investment outlays is pretty much assured for the current quarter.

Incoming information on business fixed investment has been consistent with the moderation we  were expecting, and our forecast for growth in the current quarter--6 percent at an  annual rate-differs little from our previous projection. Recent data on orders and shipments point to  another sizable increase in computer purchases this quarter, but probably less than half the 50 percent

(annual rate) gain recorded in  the first quarter. Apart from computers, business spending on  motor vehicles may  be  boosted by  an uptick in  fleet sales (after manufacturers favored retail customers during the strike-affected period); but shipments of  nondefense capital goods other than computers have been relatively weak, and  we expect that this component of  equipment spending will post only a small increase. For nonresidential structures, construction put-inplace was up 1-1/2 percent in  April, boosting the level of expenditures well above its first-quarter average.

Government expenditures on  consumption and investment are projected to  post another moderate rise in  the current quarter. For the  most part, the increase reflects a  sharp bounceback in  state and local purchases from  a  weather-depressed first-quarter level. But our estimate for the second quarter also has been boosted by  the hiring of  temporary election workers in some states and by  evidence from the April construction data of  a  sizable advance in state and local infrastructure outlays. We  continue to expect purchases on the federal side to drop back in the second quarter after an anomalous surge in the first; however, we  have pushed some of the offset to the second half of the year in light of  the indications of relatively strong outlays in  April and May.

The recent monthly data on  international trade, in combination with the annual revisions to the balance of  payments accounts, have led us to revise down slightly our prediction of real net exports in the current quarter. Exports are projected to rise about 7  percent at an annual rate, while imports are expected to climb another 11 percent, in part owing to a  rebuilding of  oil inventories from low levels earlier in  the year. On  balance, real net exports are expected to decline almost $11 billion in  the second quarter, roughly one-half the pace of  decline registered in  the first quarter.

As  in the last forecast, a  positive swing in  nonfarm inventory investment is projected to provide a  major boost to GDP growth in the current quarter. Motor vehicle inventories, which plummeted in the first quarter, are expected to be  little changed as higher production levels match the pace of sales. With capacity constraining output of some of  their more popular models, automakers may  take a  while longer to supply the stocks dealers desire; they've raised their third-quarter assembly schedules. Outside of  motor vehicles, the pace of inventory investment is projected to moderate

from its substantial first-quarter rate. But even here, inventorysales ratios look rather lean in  some sectors, and a  little of  the strength in production evident in  non-auto IP  could well have reflected efforts to rebuild stocks.

Continued reports of  tightness in  the labor market and recent statistics suggest that employers may  be  bidding up  wages to attract workers. The latest monthly data on  average hourly earnings reinforce the impression of  an  uptrend in  wage inflation that was left by  the jump in the first-quarter wage and salary figure from the Employment Cost Index. To date, however, there is  no indication that any resultant cost pressures are feeding through to prices. Although the surge in  energy prices likely will boost the CPI about 4  percent at an annual rate this quarter, excluding food and energy, the CPI is  projected to rise just over 2-1/2 percent, a  pace little different from that of recent quarters.

The  Outlook for the Second Half of 1996 and 1997

The contour of  the projection for economic activity through 1997 is essentially the same as that in the last Greenbook. Growth in real GDP is forecast to slow sharply in  the third quarter and to

average just over 2  percent through 1997. 2 However, as  noted in the overview, we  have lowered our inflation forecast--in particular, for 1996. We  emphasized in  the last Greenbook the important uncertainties attending the price outlook, owing to  the questions surrounding Iraqi oil exports and future grain crops. The question about grain remains largely unanswered, but the prospects for oil supplies have clarified considerably--and they point to less pressure on energy prices in  the next half year.

Consumer spending. We  are projecting that the growth of real personal consumption expenditures will slow from its estimated pace of 3-1/4 percent in  the first half of this year to 2-1/2 percent in 1997. Such growth in  spending would be  in line with the projected gains in  real disposable income, and the personal saving rate holds steady on  an annual basis at 4-1/2 percent over the forecast period.

We still view the  huge rise in stock market wealth over the past year and a  half as implying some risk that spending could maintain a  greater momentum than we  have assumed and  that the saving rate will decline. However, the saving rate has shown no clear trend in recent quarters, and it is conceivable that the  wealth effects on  consumer demand are being offset by other forces--such as heavier indebtedness or perhaps greater precautionary saving in light of  job insecurity or concerns about retirement income. In  any event, on our forecast of  the stock market, the potential boost to consumption should tend to  wane over the projection period. On  the credit side, lenders appear to  be getting a  bit more cautious about extending credit to the household sector: for example, there are

We  do not think that the Olympics will have a  material effect on third-quarter GDP growth, as some of  the additional spending in Atlanta will be offset by  lower expenditures elsewhere. Reported employment growth in  July will also be little affected because the bulk of activity will take place after the survey week.

reports that banks are tightening standards for credit card issuance and that lenders are less enthusiastic about "B" and "C" rated mortgages. However, on  balance, we  aren't projecting a  significant cutback in credit availability to  households over the projection period. Consumer lending remains highly profitable for  most institutions, and nothing in the general economic outlook suggests that they will want to  curtail this lending substantially.

We  expect that the long uptrend in  the durable goods share of real consumer expenditures will be  extended over the next year and a half. Purchases of  electronic equipment are likely to remain robust, given substantial price declines (especially for computers this year) and a  constant barrage of new  products--and complementary services--to stir consumer interest. Apart from electronics, the forecast shows a  deceleration in  durables spending more typical of  a mature business cycle. Demand for appliances and home furnishings is likely to  be  damped by  the projected slide in  housing activity. Light motor vehicle sales are projected to  average a  shade under 15 million units at  an annual rate; although this pace is  below the recent one, it still represents a  sustained high level of net acquisitions.

Spending on  nondurables exhibited very subdued growth last year, but trade reports suggest that consumers are now replenishing their wardrobes. However, we  are projecting that real purchases of nondurables will decelerate from the almost 3  percent annual growth pace estimated for the first half of this year to about 2  percent in 1997. Spending on services has been boosted thus far this year by exceptionally high heating and cooling bills; assuming a  return to normal weather, spending growth should slow in the near term and remain moderate thereafter.

Residential investment. Housing construction is projected to decline over the forecast period, reflecting the effects of higher mortgage interest rates. Single family starts will probably average just over 1.15 million units at  an  annual rate in the first half of this year, and we  foresee a  decline of  roughly 8  percent from that pace by  mid-1997. Gauging the effect of the increase in  mortgage rates that has occurred is difficult. In recent months, more homebuyers have been turning to  ARMs in  order to avoid the increased initial cost of fixed-rate financing; we  would not expect this to provide total insulation of  demand from the effects of the steepening of  the yield curve on expected ownership costs. However,

mortgage rates per se are only part of  the demand story: sustained income growth, affordability ratios near their best levels of the past couple of  decades, and lessened concern about falling house prices than prevailed a  few  years ago all should tend to  keep homebuilding close to the underlying trends associated with demographic factors.

In the  multifamily market, starts are expected to  hold steady at a  bit under 300,000 units at an  annual rate. Although recent data show some increases in vacancy rates and slower absorption rates, anecdotal reports suggest that builders are not expecting to cut back on  multifamily construction and that credit remains readily available for new  projects.

Altogether, starts are projected to total something over 1.4 million units this year and something under that mark in 1997-averaging about the same in  the two years as in 1994-95. Absent a further rise in  mortgage rates, there might well be an upside risk to this forecast if  the pace of  net household formations, which appears to have fallen short of the trend over the first half of  the decade, rebounds more than we  expect. On  the other hand, we've seen a  substantial run-up in  manufactured housing ("mobile home") sales in the past couple of  years, and  with population continuing to shift toward the Sunbelt, this lower-cost sector might absorb a disproportionate amount of  any upside surprise in the pace of household formation.

Business fixed investment. Recent data have generally been in line with our expectations of  a  deceleration in  business fixed investment, and thus we  have not significantly altered our longerterm forecast. Growth in  BFI is projected to slow to an annual rate of roughly 4-3/4 percent over the second half of this year and to 4-1/4 percent in 1997. The key factor in this forecast is the notion that the accelerator effects that had previously boosted investment are no longer present. The more modest increases in profits and cash flow in prospect for coming quarters might also argue for a  moderation of spending growth, but the need for external finance is likely to  be quite limited, and  we  do  not foresee any major tightening of credit availability for those firms that must borrow. Indeed, in  the near term, spending may be  encouraged to a small degree by  what is reportedly an  aggressive posture among banks seeking lending opportunities in  the small business market.

Real outlays for producers' durable equipment are projected to rise at a  5-1/2 percent rate over the next six quarters, well below the pace of  growth registered over the last year or so. Spending on basic industrial and construction machinery is projected to  be lackluster because of  the absence of  major pressures on capacity. In contrast, business spending on  computers is projected to remain robust, although we  don't think that the growth rates will match the extraordinary pace registered in recent quarters. Admittedly, as  we have noted before, we  have had a  tendency to  underestimate the potential for spending in  this area. At  this point, we  see some upside risk in the possibility that the new  version of  Windows NT, the expansion of  intranets, or the drop in  memory prices will spur a more extensive upgrading of  computing equipment.

Growth in nonresidential construction is also projected to slow sharply, from an  average pace of about 5  percent at  an  annual rate in recent quarters to less than 1  percent in 1997. The recent widespread downturn in contracts might suggest a  sharper slowing, but these data are erratic and of less than absolute reliability. Although retailers appear to have some excess capacity, indicators of  market conditions in  other sectors have been more upbeat. Vacancy rates for office buildings have continued to  decline, prices for office buildings and warehouses have generally been firming, and financing for commercial construction remains readily available. Anecdotal information, such as  that in  the Beige Book, suggests, if anything, a  more upbeat near-term outlook for construction than reflected in our forecast.

Business inventories. Inventory investment is expected to pick up sharply in the third quarter and then to rise at a  relatively modest pace over the remainder of the projection period. As in  the second quarter, much of  the positive near-term swing in  inventory investment occurs in the motor vehicle sector, where automakers have indicated that they  will boost production further to raise stocks from their uncomfortably low second-quarter levels. Outside of motor vehicles, stocks currently appear to  be  fairly lean, and so we're anticipating a  moderate accumulation in  the third quarter-somewhat above the pace we're predicting for the current quarter. Clearly, a  great deal of  uncertainty attaches to the forecast for

this volatile component of  GDP; one alternative scenario suggested by  the rather hefty accumulation of non-auto stocks in  April is  a stronger boost to second-quarter GDP from inventory investment and a lesser contribution in  the third. Beyond the third quarter, we  have inventory investment stabilizing at a  level consistent with a gradual downtrend in  the stock-to-sales ratio and thus being essentially a  neutral factor in  the overall GDP projection for 1997. We  are not anticipating that concerns about delivery lags or price increases will become great enough to prompt purchasing managers to raise their target inventory levels.

Government. Federal consumption and investment expenditures are expected to fall sharply in the third quarter--further retracing the bulge in  first-quarter spending. This decline could be  larger still if  spending doesn't drop as we  expect in  June, but these nearterm patterns reflect timing differences rather than any fundamental change in our view. Beyond next quarter, we expect spending to follow the  trend indicated by  appropriations, with real purchases down 4  percent in the fourth quarter and 3-1/2 percent in 1997; the defense and nondefense components are projected to  decline at similar rates.

On  the whole, the fiscal position of state and local governments remains relatively healthy. Thus, although there is political pressure to downsize governments and reduce taxes, we expect real purchases in  this sector to  trend up at roughly a 2-1/2 percent pace without generating significant budgetary strains. Major changes in the  welfare and Medicaid programs haven't been anticipated in this forecast, but if such changes were enacted, they could have significant, and uneven, effects on the finances of various units; the possibility of federal legislation evidently is already affecting budget planning in  at  least some states.

Net exports. The external sector is projected to  be  a  mild drag on real GDP growth over the projection period. Export growth somewhat lags the rise in  imports in  the second half of this year, and this slight deterioration in our real net export balance reduces real GDP growth about 1/4 percent at  an  annual rate. In 1997. however, the impetus from the pickup in foreign economic growth shows through more clearly to  U.S. exports, and the external balance stabilizes. (A  fuller discussion of  these developments is contained in the International Developments Section.)

Labor markets. As has been noted, the recent data on  labor demand have been difficult to interpret. It appears, however, that net hiring is still quite strong, and we  have revised up our nearterm projections for employment somewhat. Still, with output growth projected to  moderate considerably from its first-half pace, the overall contour of  the labor market projection remains one of  a significant slackening in coming months. In particular, we  expect gains in nonfarm payrolls to slow to around 110,000 per month by  the fourth quarter and to remain at  that pace through 1997. This forecast assumes that businesses will adjust hiring fairly promptly as sales growth slows, and thus nonfarm productivity growth is projected to dip only slightly below its trend rate over the second half of  this year. In 1997, productivity is projected to rise at about its trend rate of 1-1/4 percent.

The labor force participation rate is expected to hold steady at its recent average of 66.7 percent. Although the data have been volatile from  month to  month, our view is that the rise registered in the average rate for the first five months constituted a  return to about the underlying trend, after a  period of unusually low participation in 1995. Looking ahead, with the moderation in  the growth of new  job opportunities diminishing the incentives for additional labor force entry, we  see little reason to expect labor force or  employment gains to exceed population growth in future quarters. In  these circumstances, the unemployment rate is projected to remain around 5-1/2 percent.

Wages and prices. We  continue to see the levels of resource utilization in  the forecast as  consistent, ceteris paribus, with a gradual underlying acceleration in  wages and prices over the projection period--indeed, so gradual that it could easily be lost in the noise of  the reported data. However, in  light of unfavorable developments in  energy and agricultural markets, we still foresee a

noticeable uptick in  overall consumer price inflation--to about 3.2 percent by  1997, a  half percentage point faster than in 1995.

In  the energy sector, the recent developments in oil markets have led us to lower the price path over the second half of  this year. Indeed, as the Lundberg survey indicates, lower crude prices are already beginning to show  up  at gasoline stations, where the usual summer increase in  prices did not occur. The additional declines in  oil prices that we  anticipate in coming months should be passed through fairly promptly to the retail level as  well, and  we now  expect the CPI for energy to decline 5-1/2 percent at  an  annual rate over the second half of  the year. In  1997, energy prices are projected to rise about 3-3/4 percent, reflecting the firming in crude oil costs that we  have assumed for next year.

<!-- missing-text -->

Agricultural commodity markets have remained volatile in recent weeks. The spot prices of  crops have backed away from the  highs of a  few  weeks ago, and mixed patterns continue to  be evident in the

prices of  livestock products. Meanwhile, the price war in  the cereal business has escalated, with  more producers announcing sizable price cuts. In view of  these events, we've trimmed our food price forecast by  a  couple of tenths. Nonetheless, we  still expect to see food price increases running noticeably to the high side of core inflation over the next several quarters, as  lagged effects of high grain prices work their way through to the retail level. We probably can also anticipate another year of considerable volatility in  farm prices, as recent weather adversities--notably the wet conditions in parts of  the Corn Belt--have chipped away at  the potential size of  this year's harvest; as a  result, rebuilding of grain stocks this year will likely be  only modest at  best.

Employment costs are still anticipated to accelerate a  bit over the forecast period, given the tightness of  the labor market. However, our current projection for the rise in  the employment cost index for private industry workers--3 percent in  1996 and 3-1/4 percent in 1997--is a  bit lower than that in the  May Greenbook. This downward revision reflects primarily the lower near-term path for consumer food and energy prices, which reduces the dimension of  the cost-of-living pass-through we  had  built into our previous projection.

The downward revision in  the labor cost forecast has been carried through to  our projection for the core CPI. As a  result, core inflation is now  projected to increase about 3  percent in  both 1996 and 1997. However, as  we noted in the last Greenbook, the projected pickup in core inflation is held down by  an adjustment to the forecast to reflect technical changes being introduced by  the BLS to eliminate formula bias in  the CPI; in  addition, we  have included an adjustment in  this forecast to account for the planned introduction next January of  new  procedures for estimating medical care inflation. Absent these adjustments, measured core price inflation would be  0.1 percentage point higher (at an  annual rate) in  the second half of  this year and 0.2 percentage point higher in 1997.

There is  currently discussion in  the Congress of a  variety of legislative initiatives that could raise employer costs, the most likely possibility being a  hike in  the minimum wage. As in  May, we have not incorporated a  minimum wage increase into the projection; there are indications that a  minimum wage bill will be  voted on in the Senate after the July 4th recess, but whether an  agreement on

the details can be  worked out remains to be  seen. As we  reported in the  last Greenbook, we  think that the higher minimum wage under consideration would raise CPI inflation about 1/4 percentage point in 1997 if  the federal funds rate were held at its current level. The effect would likely be a  bit smaller if  proposals intended to ameliorate the effects on  employers--such as  enlarging the number of small businesses that would be  exempt from the legislation or increasing the extent to which tips can  be counted toward the hourly minimum--are included in  the final version of  the legislation.

Money and credit flows. Growth of  M2 is expected to  be sustained over the projection period at a  rate close to the 5  percent pace of the first half of 1996. The effect of a  slight slowing in nominal GDP growth on  M2 expansion is likely to be  about offset by  improved relative returns for retail time deposits. M3 growth, though expected to decline somewhat in  coming months, should come in  around 6  percent this year and near that pace during 1997.

The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is  projected to expand 4-1/2 percent this year and next, roughly matching the growth rate of  nominal GDP. Borrowing by  both households and businesses should slow from last year, whereas federal debt growth is likely to be a  bit lower on  average this year but edge up in 1997. State and local debt is expected to continue contracting, on net, as a  sizable volume of previous advance refundings is completed.

Aggregate borrowing by  nonfinancial businesses is expected to remain near its restrained first-half pace over the forecast period as cash flow rises about in line  with corporate capital outlays and debt-financed merger activity levels off. Few  signs have emerged at this point to suggest that credit availability is posing a constraint for business activity, nor is it  expected to do so in  the outlook period. Bank profits and capital positions should remain healthy, providing a  solid base for loan expansion. If  bond rates remain near current levels--let alone edge downward, as  we've projected--short-term borrowing is likely to be  moderate, with the bond market remaining the most important source of credit.

Net borrowing by  households is projected to drift lower over the next few  quarters. Selective tightening of  lending standards for credit cards and some other credit products will continue in response to rising delinquency and default rates, but the overall restraint on consumer spending and borrowing from such measures should be  quite limited. Slower growth in consumer credit

outstanding should be  associated with the  moderate growth projected for nominal expenditures on  consumer durable goods and an  upward tilt to debt repayments on the large volume of loans extended in  the past several years. Growth in  home mortgage debt is expected to slow a  bit from the recent pace as  home sales fall off.

Alternative Simulations

We have run two model simulations in  which the funds rate is symmetrically raised or  lowered relative to  the assumption in the Greenbook. Deviations from baseline mount gradually to  a  total of 100 basis points by  the end of  this year and remain at that differential in 1997. In the lower-rate scenario, real GDP growth is little changed this year and 3/4 percentage point higher in 1997. The unemployment rate is lowered 0.4 percentage point by  the end of 1997, and core CPI inflation is 1/2 percentage point higher than in the baseline forecast. The effects of  the tighter policy scenario are symmetric.

An  Accounting Note

As  noted in footnote 4  on productivity, the real GDP growth rates in  the projection are in  terms of  fixed-weight 1994 dollars rather than true chain-weight dollars and, other things equal, would be slightly lower when the BEA shifts to 1995 weights in  August and to 1996 weights next summer. The effects of those changes would be to lower the GDP growth rates from  what has been reported here to about 2.4 percent in 1996 and 2.0 percent in 1997.

Recent Developments

The value of the  dollar in terms of  the  other G-10 currencies has  declined slightly since the May FOMC meeting. The dollar depreciated about  1 percent  against the mark and  other major European currencies, declined  1 percent  against the Canadian  dollar, and  rose  2-1/4  percent on  balance against the  yen. The Mexican peso declined 2-1/2  percent  against the  dollar.

The mark strengthened  as  a recent pickup  in German  economic indicators damped market expectations  of a further  near-term easing by the Bundesbank. The  downward tilt  to  near-term Euromark futures that  prevailed at  the  time  of the  May meeting has  since  been reversed. In  contrast, the  yen weakened on balance  despite the announcement of  exceptionally strong GDP  growth in the  first quarter,  as  market  opinion appeared to  be  swayed by  a series  of official  statements  that  short-term interest  rates  would not  be raised  in the  near  term.

Short-term interest  rates  in Japan and Germany were  little changed  over the  intermeeting period, but rates  elsewhere in Europe eased when the Bank  of England  and the  Bank of France cut  their lending rates  by 25  and  10  basis  points,  respectively,  on June  6. Long-term rates moved up  20  basis  points  in Germany  and  less elsewhere in Europe but were  about unchanged, on balance,  in Japan.

The Desk did  not  intervene.

On average, economic  activity in the  foreign G-7  countries  in the  first  half of  this year  appears to  have been about in  line with our  earlier  expectations. First-quarter Japanese real  GDP  did exceed  our  expectations  as  it  surged  12.7  percent  (SAAR),  reflecting a broad-based  expansion of  domestic demand as  well as  some transitory influences. A bunching of government spending, which accounted for  one-third of the first-quarter  expansion, is  not thought to  have extended beyond the first  quarter. In addition, measurement practices  associated with the  leap year added  about 2 percentage points  (AR) to  the first-quarter number  and will  be

reversed in the second. As a  result, we estimate that GDP declined in  the second quarter. Nevertheless, available indicators including industrial production, orders, and housing starts, point to strength in  underlying activity.

German GDP fell 1-1/2 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, because of  a  weather-related plunge in construction and a  weakening of exports, but appears to  have turned up in the second quarter. Construction has rebounded strongly, and in  April industrial production was 1-1/4 percent above the first-quarter average. In France, GDP bounced back at an annual rate of  nearly 5  percent in the first quarter from strike-depressed levels in  the fourth quarter, although, as in  Japan, leap-year effects accounted for about 2  percentage points. French industrial production and indicators of  confidence have been soft so far in  the second quarter. Sluggish to  moderate GDP growth was recorded in the United Kingdom and Canada in the first quarter; indicators for the second quarter are mixed but, on  balance, point to acceleration in  both countries.

Inflation in  the foreign G-7 countries on average remains below that in  the United States. Japanese twelve-month inflation turned slightly positive in  April and May as a  result of the effects of  the depreciation of the yen over the past year. Twelve-month inflation rates elsewhere (in  most cases through May) have ranged from 1-1/4 percent in  Germany (June) and 1-1/2 in Canada, to between 2-1/2 and 2-3/4 percent in France and the United Kingdom, to about 4 percent in Italy (June).

GDP growth in  major U.S. trading partners among developing countries (weighted by  U.S. nonagricultural export shares) continued at about 5-3/4 percent at an annual rate in the first quarter. Growth in several Asian countries picked up from moderate slowdowns in the second half of 1995. At the same time, Mexican GDP growth slowed to a  still strong rate of 6-1/2 percent (SAAR) in the first quarter, following a  15 percent rate in  the fourth quarter. The level of  Mexico's GDP in the first quarter was 7-1/2 percent above

the mid-1995 recession trough, but still 4-1/2 percent below the previous peak.

The deficit on U.S. net exports of goods and services (in nominal terms) widened in  April relative to  the first-quarter rate. April data showed a  broad-based expansion of exports; a  slightly stronger expansion of imports was concentrated in oil imports as refiners began to replenish domestic stocks. The current account deficit in the first quarter exceeded the fourth-quarter rate but remained below the 1995 average as both the trade deficit and the deficit on net investment income showed improvement over last year.

A  surge in  grain prices caused U.S. export prices to accelerate somewhat in  April-May over the first quarter despite declines in  prices of  industrial supplies and computers. Non-oil import prices fell somewhat in  April-May as increases in food prices partly offset declines in the prices of capital goods and industrial supplies. The price of imported oil increased sharply further in April and declined a  bit in  May. The spot WTI price fell a  total of $3.50 during May and June and has been trading around $20 per barrel recently. The decline in  oil prices since April has reflected primarily the unwinding of temporary weather-related shocks to  the oil market that occurred earlier in the year. The agreement Iraq reached with the United Nations in  mid-May appears largely to have been priced into the futures market and in the event did not have much of  an immediate effect on prices.

Outlook

We expect the recent signs of underlying strengthening in economic activity abroad to  be followed by  modest acceleration during the second half of  the year. Growth should level off in 1997. The projected annual rate of expansion of  total foreign GDP (weighted by  U.S. nonagricultural export shares) over the next six quarters--3-1/2 percent at an  annual rate--is a  couple of tenths higher than that in  the May Greenbook. As in  the previous projection, we expect the dollar to remain near its current level through 1997. We project that export growth will pick up somewhat over the next six quarters, abstracting from residual seasonal

fluctuations. 2 Stimulus from stronger growth abroad more than offsets the restraining effects of  the appreciation of the dollar over the past year. Imports should expand even faster, however; we expect real net exports to  make a  moderately negative contribution to GDP growth.

The Dollar. We project that the foreign exchange value of the dollar in  terms of  the other G-10 currencies will remain little changed from its recent levels throughout the forecast period. This level is the same as that forecast in the previous Greenbook. We expect that the CPI-adjusted value of the dollar in terms of the currencies of  key developing countries will depreciate at a  moderate rate both this year and next. Notably, the peso is expected to appreciate in real terms over the forecast period, as its nominal exchange value against the dollar depreciates at a  slower pace than the extent to which Mexican inflation exceeds U.S. inflation.

Foreign G-7 countries. We estimate that real GDP growth in the foreign G-7 countries on average slowed in  the second quarter from the unexpectedly rapid pace in the first quarter, but we expect that it will pick up to an annual rate of  nearly 2-3/4 percent on average over the next six quarters. Growth will be supported in general by  lagged effects of  monetary easing that has occurred over the past year; in  Europe and Canada, this factor will more than offset the effects of  ongoing fiscal contraction.

Japanese GDP likely declined in  the second quarter as government spending and inventory investment receded from very strong first-quarter levels and private consumption paused following its rapid advance. Nevertheless, the breadth of the first-quarter advance and continued strength in new orders during the second quarter suggest that the underlying recovery in Japan has firmed, and we project GDP to resume positive growth in the second half of 1996. We expect growth to slow a  bit in 1997 as fiscal policy shifts toward being contractionary.

We estimate that German GDP advanced at a  2-3/4 percent rate in  the second quarter and that growth will average somewhat less than that over the next six quarters. Recent gains in disposable income should bolster consumption spending, and both exports and investment are expected to  benefit from the depreciation of the mark over the past year. In  France and the United Kingdom, inventory cycles are expected to contribute to significant pickups of GDP growth in the second half of 1996. Growth over the next six quarters should average around 2-1/2 percent in France, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Our forecast assumes that the continental European countries will continue to strive to meet Maastricht budget reference levels for 1997. We  foresee Germany and France but not Italy coming within striking distance of  meeting those reference levels. 3

Canadian GDP is estimated to  have advanced at about a  2-3/4 percent rate in the second quarter, supported in part by recovery from the GM  strike and strong growth in U.S. imports. Canadian growth should pick up a  bit more over the period ahead as stimulus from the substantial easing of  monetary conditions in that country over the past year more than offsets the effects of planned fiscal consolidation.

The outlook for inflation in  the foreign G-7 countries remains subdued. Average consumer prices in these countries (weighted by U.S. bilateral import shares) are projected to rise about 1-1/2 percent during 1996 and 1-3/4 percent during 1997, about 1/4 percent more each year than we projected in  May. Given the higher projected level for Japanese GDP, we expect inflation in  Japan to reach nearly 1/2 percent this year and to rise to 1-1/2 percent next year--about 1/2 percentage point more per year than we projected previously. The projected pickup in  Japanese inflation next year

also reflects the effects of an increase in  the consumption tax in the second quarter of 1997.

Our outlook for the foreign G-7 countries incorporates the assumption that short-term market interest rates on average are about at their trough and will rise moderately over the forecast period. Rates are assumed to remain around current levels in Germany before edging up late in 1997. In  Japan, short-term market rates are assumed to increase late this year and in 1997 as the Bank of  Japan tightens in response to firming aggregate demand. Longterm rates abroad are expected to rise only slightly over the forecast period.

Other countries. The real growth of GDP in  major developingcountries is projected to slow during the second and third quarters of 1996 and to pick up to a  bit less than a  6  percent rate during 1997. The near-term slowing reflects a  pause from recent very rapid rates of expansion in  Mexico and a  return to  more sustainable growth rates in Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.

We project that real GDP in  Mexico will expand around 4  percent during 1996 and 5  percent in 1997. The strength of  the rebound in  Mexico's private consumption and investment spending during the past three quarters while the trade balance has remained flat underlies our projection that Mexico's continued recovery will be driven by  internal demand. Elsewhere in  Latin America, Argentina appears to be emerging from its recent recession and is projected to continue to  do so, while Venezuela is not expected to  begin to recover from its recession until late this year. In  Brazil, monetary restraint and an overvalued currency are expected to keep growth from exceeding 2  percent over the forecast period.

Real output of our major trading partners in  Asia is expected to grow at a  6-1/2 to 7  percent rate over the forecast period. 4 These countries should experience less stimulus from net exports because of  the appreciation of  their currencies against the yen over

the past year, but more stimulus from domestic demand induced by easing of  monetary conditions in some cases.

U.S. real exports and imports of goods and services. Real exports of goods and services are projected to expand at an annual rate of  nearly 7  percent in  the second quarter and in the second half of 1996 and to accelerate to 9  percent growth in 1997. 5 The growth of real computer exports is expected to slow substantially in the second quarter from the torrid pace in  the first quarter but should return to its longer-term trend over the period ahead. Real exports of semiconductors also are expected to recover to a  robust rate of expansion after a  pause related to global inventory adjustments in the first half of  the year. The quantities of exports of other goods (excluding agricultural products) are estimated to have bounced back in  the current quarter from their decline in the first quarter, in part a  make-up of  automobile

shipments after the resolution of  the GM  strike, and to average about 3-1/4 percent in the second half of 1996 and nearly 4  percent during 1997.

Real imports of goods and services are projected to  have continued to advance rapidly in  the second quarter as a  surge in oil imports offset some slowing in  most other categories from rapid rates recorded in  the first quarter. Over the rest of the forecast period, real imports should expand at a  slower (but still fairly strong) pace as oil import growth recedes and the growth of domestic demand slows. Imports of computers are projected to grow rapidly over the next six quarters in real terms, as are imports of semiconductors. Imports of other non-oil goods are projected to decelerate from their double-digit growth in the first half and to expand at a  little under twice the rate of growth of  U.S. real GDP (in line with recent historical trends) over the remainder of  the forecast period.

We expect the quantity of oil imports to  have surged in the second quarter and to  continue to grow somewhat faster than normal in  the second half of  the year as stocks are rebuilt from low levels. In 1997, oil imports should expand more in line with the dictates of growth in  U.S. economic activity and declines in U.S. oil production.

Oil prices. In light of the agreement reached between Iraq and the United Nations for limited oil exports, we assume that Iraq will begin to export some oil in  August and will be  shipping the full allotment of around 800,000 b/d by  September. 6 We also assume that other oil producers will be unwilling to cut production to offset the price effects of  Iraqi exports. Given these assumptions, the projected prices of imported oil for the third and fourth quarters have been revised down roughly $1.00 and $2.25, respectively, per barrel. We now expect the import price to drop

below $15 per  barrel in the fourth quarter with the increased supply from Iraq. Trend increases in consumption, augmented by  strong seasonal demand early in 1997, are expected to return oil prices fairly quickly to our long-run projection paths of $19.50/b for WTI and $17/b for the oil import unit value.

Prices of non-oil imports and exports. Prices of  non-oil imports are projected to increase only slightly during 1996-97 as foreign inflation remains low and world commodity prices decline. Prices of nonagricultural exports (including computers and semiconductors) are projected to change little on balance this year and then to rise somewhat next year. We project agricultural export prices to decline moderately over the next six quarters, in line with futures prices for key U.S. export commodities. Prices of  corn and soybeans, in  particular, have declined recently on expectations of good fall harvests.

Nominal trade and current account balances. The nominal trade balance on goods and services is expected to  widen somewhat over the forecast period, from its rate of $97 billion in  the first quarter of 1996 to $115 billion in  the fourth quarter of 1997. Net earnings from direct investment are projected to continue expanding, but that gain will be  more than offset by  an increasing deficit on portfolio income. Accordingly, the current account balance is projected to widen over 1996-97, reaching $175 billion, almost 2-1/4 percent of GDP, in 1997.
