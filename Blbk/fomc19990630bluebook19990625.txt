period, as yields on Japanese  government debt rose sharply relative to rates on U.S. Treasuries.  The rise in Japanese  rates owed  to perceptions  of  improved  prospects  for the Japanese  economy, supported  in part by the  surprising strength  of reported Japanese GDP in the  first quarter. Monetary authorities in Japan have leaned against the rise in the foreign exchange value  of the yen, intervening on four recent days in both Japan  and Europe and purchasing more than $20 billion and the equivalent of more than $4-1/4 billion in euro. 2

- (4) In Latin America,  financial  markets have been subject to heightened  stress over the  intermeeting period, related  only in part to  market expectations  of higher U.S. interest rates.  Uncertainty  about Argentina's longer-term  commitment to its  currency-board regime and concerns over the slow progress  of fiscal reform in Brazil have contributed  to these  pressures. Stripped Brady bond spreads spiked higher in late May and early June; on balance, Brady bond  spreads have increased  60 to 140 basis points from their levels in mid-May.  In Argentina,  domestic short-term  interest rates  are up 2-3/4 percentage  points since  early May. The Brazilian realhas depreciated  almost 7-1/2 percent against the dollar on balance, while the Mexican  peso has fallen almost 1-1/2 percent.  Major Latin American stock market indexes are up slightly  to off 5-1/2 percent over  the intermeeting period.  In contrast, financial  markets in emerging Asian economies  have generally improved, with  their currencies appreciating  and share price indexes  up considerably in many cases.
