since  trading  in the currency  began on January  4, as data releases confirmed  a slowdown  in growth and the lack of inflationary pressures in many parts of the euro area, particularly  in Germany.  The Bank of England lowered its repo rate 25 basis points on January  7,  surprising most market analysts, who had not expected another cut so soon, and the dollar appreciated about 2 percent with respect to sterling.

- The Desk did not intervene on behalf of the System or the Treasury.
- (4) Prices of emerging market financial assets were importantly influenced  by events in Brazil.  The declaration  on January  6 by the  state of Menas  Gerais  of a moratorium in its debt payments to the central government,  a relatively  minor event in its own right, crystallized fears that the Brazilian  central government  would be unable to accomplish the deep fiscal reforms  seen as the only sustainable  solution to its financial  problems. Faced by continuing outflows of capital, Brazilian  authorities  were eventually  forced to let the real float.  The initial reaction was euphoric  in Brazilian  stock and bond markets, but in subsequent days,  the real depreciated further and capital  outflows  continued  despite rising domestic  short-term interest rates. On balance over the intermeeting period, the real depreciated about 40 percent, equity prices  rose  14 percent, and Brady bond yield spreads widened  about 275 basis points.  The perceived risk of contagion to the rest  of Latin America was evidenced  by increases  in the Brady yield spreads  for other Latin American  countries ranging from 40 to 250 basis points, increases  in domestic interest  rates,  and a 3-3/4 percent  appreciation of the dollar versus the Mexican  peso.  In addition, the widely publicized announcement  by Argentina that it was considering  a full dollarization  of its economy was seen, at least in part, as an  attempt to insulate its currency board regime  from
