MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) With investors putting only small odds on a pause in the tightening cycle following Hurricane Katrina, there was little market reaction to the FOMC's decision at the September meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3¾ percent, to maintain its assessment that the risks to price stability and sustainable growth were balanced, and to retain the 'measured pace' language. 1 The expected path for monetary policy shifted up in subsequent weeks though, as incoming data indicated that output had been expanding briskly prior to the hurricane and that the disruptions to economic activity from Hurricane Katrina and Rita were likely to be less severe than initially feared.  This upward pressure on interest rates may have been amplified by comments from a number of Federal Reserve officials that were read as stressing inflation concerns.  By the time of the release of the FOMC minutes, investors had reportedly anticipated their somewhat hawkish tone, and the market response to their publication was minimal.  Current readings on futures contracts indicate that the federal funds rate expected after the December meeting has increased about 25 basis points over the intermeeting period to nearly 4¼ percent, consistent with investors placing high odds on a quarter-point rate hike at each of the next two meetings (Chart 1).   The level of the funds rate expected to prevail by June 2006 rose 2

50 basis points, to a peak just above 4½ percent.  Respondents to the Desk's latest dealer survey have similarly come to expect more policy tightening, with the majority now anticipating rate increases at the November, December, and January meetings. Most of the respondents expect little change in the measured pace and accommodative language, and six of twenty-two respondents indicated that recent statements by Federal Reserve officials had influenced their interest rate forecasts. Uncertainty about the expected path for policy over the coming six months, as measured by implied volatility read from eurodollar options, has decreased some since the September meeting, although it remains above its pre-Katrina levels.

- (2) Nominal Treasury yields rose 25 to 50 basis points on net, with most of the advance accounted for by increases in near-term forward rates. 3, 4 In addition to stronger-than-expected economic data, declines in some energy prices likely contributed to a more positive economic outlook, helping to push yields higher. Increases at the longer end of the term structure, especially late in the period, may have been due in part to increased mortgage hedging flows, as suggested by anecdotal reports.  Despite a higher-than-expected reading on the overall consumer price index for September, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation were about unchanged over the intermeeting period, although they remain 15 to 20 basis points above the levels seen prior to Hurricane Katrina.
- (3) Partly in response to the rise in interest rates, major stock price indexes fell 3 to 4¼ percent over the period (Chart 2).  Although reported earnings for the third quarter appear to have largely met or exceeded expectations, investors may also have

been concerned about the cautious tone to corporate guidance about future earnings growth.  Implied volatilities from equity options remained low but edged up a bit over the period in response to several announcements of corporate distress, including the sudden collapse of Refco, the bankruptcy filings by Delphi, Delta Airlines, and Northwest Airlines, and the announcement of an SEC investigation into the pension practices of General Motors (more details about the bankruptcies are provided in the box 'Credit Market Developments').  The timing of some of the bankruptcy filings may have been related to the implementation of new bankruptcy rules in October.  As a result of the problems at these firms, the number of downgrades of corporate bonds increased, as did the aggregate bond default rate.  However, corporate quality outside of the automobile and airline sectors remained solid.  Broad indexes of investmentand speculative-grade corporate bond yields moved largely in line with Treasury yields over the period, leaving spreads little changed.

- (4) The dollar's foreign exchange value against major currencies rose about ¾ percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).   Somewhat stronger5 than-expected U.S. economic data and the expressed resolve of U.S. officials to combat inflationary pressures reportedly supported the dollar.  A number of foreign central bankers conveyed similar determination, heightening expectations of monetary policy tightening abroad.  In Canada, the Bank of Canada raised its policy rate another 25 basis points in mid-October, citing inflation concerns.  In most major industrial economies, yields on foreign long-term government securities rose a bit less than in the United States . The dollar was little changed against the Canadian dollar and the euro, but gained 1¼ percent against sterling and almost 3¼ percent against the yen. Although recent Japanese data have been somewhat softer than during the first half of the year, that economy apparently advanced further.  Bank of Japan officials have

Credit Market Developments

Four high-profile companies-Refco, Delphi, and Delta and Northwest Airlinesfiled for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the last six weeks; corporate bonds with par value totaling slightly more than $8 billion were affected by these filings. Refco, a large derivatives broker, collapsed when clients deserted the firm following the revelation of accounting irregularities just two months after its initial public offering.  Delphi, the largest U.S. automobile parts manufacturer, cited its inability to reach cost-cutting agreements with unions and with General Motors-from which it spun off in 1999-as reasons for its filing.  Competition from low-cost carriers and soaring fuel prices were instrumental in the airlines' defaults.  Some of these firms may have filed for bankruptcy more quickly than they otherwise would have in order to avoid the corporate provisions of the new bankruptcy law, which took effect on October 17.

Delphi's bankruptcy filing rekindled investors' concerns about credit quality in the automobile sector-where spreads on several firms, including Ford and General Motors, initially rose sharply and have since remained volatile.  The airlines' defaults, however, elicited little reaction, as they were largely expected.  Refco's collapse had no discernible effect on financial market functioning, as its wind-down was orderly and its accounting troubles were seen as isolated.  Overall, the impact of the bankruptcies on the broad credit market appears to have been limited.  In a sign that investors expect little spillover from the recent defaults, a measure of the likelihood that future defaults in the investment-grade sector will be clustered-the so-called implied default correlation obtained from CDS index tranches-has remained extremely low.  The equivalent measure for the speculative-grade sector has picked up, but that increase reflects in part the considerable presence of automobile-sector firms in the high-yield CDS index.  Even with the recent increase, investors apparently still judge the likelihood of correlated defaults among speculative-grade firms to be lower than it was last spring.

continued to hint that, given their economic outlook, the quantitative easing regime will likely end during the first half of next year.  Share prices in Japan made solid gains during the intermeeting period, led by banking and other financial-sector stocks that reacted positively to passage of the postal reform bill.  Stock prices in other foreign industrial countries recorded declines of 2 to 7 percent, broadly similar to those in U.S. markets.

- (5) The dollar recorded a small gain against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners over the intermeeting period.  The dollar moved up ¾ percent against the peso, as the Bank of Mexico eased its overnight lending rate 25 basis points for the second time in recent months.  The dollar continued on its downward trend against the Brazilian real , and the Brazilian central bank surprised markets with a 50 basis point easing of its policy rate to counter weakening domestic demand.  Equity prices in many emerging market countries dropped fairly sharply, as investor demand for riskier assets appeared to abate with increases in U.S. interest rates.
- (6) Domestic nonfinancial debt is estimated to have advanced briskly in the third quarter, rising 8¼ percent on net (Chart 4).  Growth in household debt appears to have edged down in the third quarter owing to a slowing in mortgage debt growth, although the forecast of the latter remains at an elevated level.  Household bankruptcies surged in the weeks immediately before bankruptcy reforms went into effect on October 17.  The debt of nonfinancial businesses appears to have risen in the third quarter at a rate comparable to increases seen in the first half of the year.  In October, bond issuance has slowed as higher yields may have discouraged new longerterm issues.  Commercial paper, which ran off at quarter-end, bounced back in early October.  Bank loans to businesses continued to advance briskly, and the results of the most recent Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey show some further easing of lending terms and standards for such loans.

- (7) M2 expanded at an annual rate of 6 percent in September, bringing thirdquarter growth to 4 percent.  The increase in September was in part attributable to a surge in retail money market funds and to a boost to currency and liquid deposits resulting from Hurricane Katrina.   Growth in nominal output in the third quarter 6 likely exceeded that of M2, implying a further rise in velocity.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Economic Outlook

- (8) The staff has revised down slightly its projection for real GDP growth since the September Greenbook, as the rise in longer-term yields, drop in equity values, and appreciation of the exchange value of the dollar over the intermeeting period established a launching-off point for the forecast consistent with more financial restraint than in the previous projection.  The outlook is predicated on the same cumulative amount of policy tightening, which brings the federal funds rate to 4¼ percent, but is now based on an assumption that the process of firming will be completed this year, rather than in the middle of next year.  At the time of the September meeting, market participants had foreseen a little less tightening than the staff; now they foresee somewhat more.  As a result, bond yields are forecast to decline slightly as investors' expectations for policy gradually come into line with the lower path in the staff outlook.  As in previous forecasts, the stock market generates risk-adjusted returns similar to those on fixed-income investments, while the foreign exchange value of the dollar depreciates modestly.  In the context of these financial conditions and the impetus to spending from a burst of rebuilding in the Gulf region, GDP grows a little faster than the 3 percent expansion of potential output next year and a little slower than that pace in 2007.  The unemployment rate in 2007 edges slightly above the estimated NAIRU of 5 percent and the output gap widens a bit to almost ½ percent.  Core PCE inflation picks up to 2¼ percent next year, in light of some pass-through to inflation expectations of recently elevated headline inflation. However, falling energy prices help bring overall PCE inflation down from 3¼ percent this year to 2 percent in 2006 and 1¾ percent in 2007 and, along with a little economic slack, pull core inflation below 2 percent in 2007.

Policy Alternatives

- (9) This Bluebook presents three policy alternatives for the Committee's consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would leave its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 3¾ percent at this meeting; the statement emphasizes uncertainties surrounding the economic dislocations of the hurricanes and associated effects on consumer and business confidence, but still signals that remaining monetary policy accommodation could likely be removed at a measured pace.  Under Alternatives B and C, the Committee would raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points.  Alternative B retains much of the statement the Committee issued after its September meeting, including the characterization that policy remains accommodative.  Alternative C takes a somewhat more aggressive tone and eliminates the balance-of-risks, accommodative, and measured pace language. 7
- (10) Although core inflation readings have been favorable in recent months, Committee members may be concerned that, in light of some signs of sharply higher near-term inflation expectations and reports of greater pricing power, elevated energy and other costs threaten to pass through significantly to core price inflation.  If the Committee believes that a continued measured pace of policy firming will prove sufficient to contain these inflationary pressures, it might be inclined to raise the target funds rate another 25 basis points at this meeting and choose language as in Alternative B .  As seen in Chart 5, a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate would move the real funds rate into the range of rates estimated by the staff to be broadly consistent with closing the output gap over the next few years.  However, the

Short-Run Estimates with Confidence Bands

Notes: The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the quarterly average of the observed nominal funds rate and the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters.  For the current quarter, the nominal funds rate used is the target federal funds rate as of the Bluebook publication date.

Short-Run and Medium-Run Measures

<!-- missing-text -->

Notes: Confidence intervals and bands reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential output.  The final column indicates the values for the current quarter based on the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-consistent measure and the actual real funds rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model's projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate shown in the chart employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Committee may believe that higher real interest rates and a bit more resource slack will be required to contain inflation, making it appropriate to issue a statement suggesting that more tightening is likely in store.  Such a policy course might also be favored if the Committee viewed the current rate of core inflation to be at or above the upper limit of a range consistent with price stability.  With most measures of labor compensation posting moderate gains and some reversal of the runup in energy prices in prospect, members may believe that remaining firming can be done gradually, consistent with the measured pace language of Alternative B.  While a policy hike at this meeting would place the funds rate at the high end of the prescriptions of several policy rules that are based on a 1½ percent objective for core PCE inflation, that is only a matter of timing because those rules indicate a need for an even higher funds rate by mid-2006 (Chart 6).

- (11) The Committee may wish to begin the rationale portion of the statement for Alternative B by reaffirming the view that adverse effects of the hurricanes will probably slow the pace of the expansion only temporarily.  Robust underlying growth in productivity may still be seen as a support for economic activity.  The statement could also note the boost to aggregate demand from increased private and public spending associated with rebuilding efforts in hurricane-affected areas.  While a 25 basis point move would place the funds rate at about the midpoint of the staff's range of estimated equilibrium rates, the Committee may still prefer to characterize policy as accommodative in light of the underlying strength of demand and upward pressures on inflation.  As for inflation, the Committee could cite indications, evident in some producer prices and in surveys of near-term inflation expectations, that 'The cumulative rise in energy and other costs has added to inflation pressures,' while still noting that 'core inflation has been relatively low in recent months.'  The observation that 'longer-term inflation expectations remain contained' may be seen as appropriate to convey a balanced view of the inflation outlook.

Note: Rule prescriptions for 2005Q4 through 2006Q3 are calculated using current Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap (or unemployment gap).  For rules that contain the lagged funds rate, the rule's previous prescription for the funds rate is used to compute prescriptions for 2006Q1 through 2006Q3.  It is assumed that there is no feedback from the rule prescriptions to the Greenbook projections through 2006Q3.  The TIPS-based rule is computed using average TIPS and nominal Treasury yields to date.

- (12) Futures market quotes suggest that investors are virtually certain of a 25 basis point firming of policy at this meeting, and surveys reveal that primary dealers expect little change in the nature of the statement.  Therefore, market prices would likely be essentially unaffected by a 25 basis point increase in the funds rate and the statement language as under Alternative B.
- (13) If the Committee wished to convey greater concern about upside risks to inflation, it might prefer to combine a 25 basis point increase in the target funds rate with the language included under Alternative C .  The Committee may especially favor this alternative if increases in energy and other costs were viewed as beginning to unmoor inflation expectations, potentially starting an upward shift in inflation dynamics that would be hard to reverse later.  Even if inflation expectations remain well anchored for a time, a sharper rebound in spending growth as rebuilding in the hurricane-affected areas picks up steam may put excessive strains on resources.  The proposed statement drops the characterization of policy as accommodative, but it indicates in the comments on inflation (row 3) that further policy firming likely is necessary on the thought that the Committee might soon envision moving the real funds rate past its neutral level-that is, to impose policy restraint.  The sentence on the balance of risks is also eliminated; the Committee might see that formula as redundant or possibly misleading about the extent of upside inflation risks at present. The final paragraph on the measured pace language is also dropped, allowing greater flexibility for possible future adjustments of policy.  The Committee may see this more forceful tone as warranted in light of the backup in market interest rates, increase in inflation compensation, and depreciation of the dollar in recent days, which might be viewed as signs of the emergence of inflation jitters in financial markets.  Indeed, the Committee may prefer to raise the target funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting in association with language similar to that under Alternative C to underscore its determination to resist an increase in inflation.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

- (14) Market participants would be surprised by the removal of the measured pace and policy accommodation language and, perhaps, by the explicit indication that additional firming was likely to be necessary.  With a 25 basis point move and the language proposed under Alternative C, short-term interest rates and the exchange value of the dollar would likely rise, while stock prices would fall.  If markets revised down their outlook for longer-term inflation as a result of the statement, however, longer-term interest rates might increase only a little.  With a 50 basis point firming, market participants would likely raise their sense of inflation risks and the near-term path of expected monetary policy substantially; short- and intermediate-term market interest rates would jump, the dollar would rally, and the stock market could sell off sharply.
- (15) Committee members may wish to consider Alternative A if they think that the recent moderate rates of core inflation are likely to continue and if they see the outlook for the economy as especially uncertain because of the effects of the hurricanes and elevated energy prices.  Particularly if the Committee, like the staff, views the real federal funds rate as in the vicinity of its equilibrium level, a pause in policy firming might be seen as desirable, partly to await further readings on consumer and business sentiment and spending.  Such a pause may also be chosen if members believe that the real estate market is in the process of softening, which heretofore has been an important spur to household spending.  Under this alternative, the Committee might refer to 'remaining' policy accommodation in the final risk assessment paragraph.  Markets would be surprised at the decision to leave the target funds rate unchanged.  Short-term interest rates would probably decline considerably as markets lowered the probability of near-term tightening moves.  Longer-term interest rates might be little changed or even back up if investors saw the FOMC as more tolerant than they expected of an increase in inflation.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would likely fall, especially if inflation expectations deteriorated.

Other Language Alternatives

Committee members have recognized for some time that certain features of its policy statement would not prove durable, not the least being its characterization of policy as accommodative and its prediction that this accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured.  The assessment that policy is accommodative becomes increasingly problematic as the real federal funds rate enters the range of plausible estimates of its equilibrium level.  Moreover, the Committee may feel it necessary to move the real funds rate beyond its neutral level to unwind inflationary pressures or to roll back some of the rise in inflation over the past couple of years.  In doing so, the Committee might be reluctant to switch its characterization of policy from accommodative to contractionary.  Two alternatives might be considered.

(16)ntinue at a pace that is likely to be measured." For one, if it is important to convey the sense that policy action will remain gradual, the statement could replace the description of the stance of policy with words describing the direction of its likely future action.  In particular, the key portion of row 5 could read: ". . .  the Committee believes that policy firming can co

For another, the Committee could drop rows 4 and 5 in favor of a formula for its risk assessment.  One such formula, for example, was proposed in a box in the September Bluebook.  In that structure, the Committee would provide separate assessments of the risks to its two goals under the explicit assumption that the stance of policy remains unchanged for the next few quarters.

Money and Debt Forecasts

- (17) Under the staff forecast, M2 is expected to expand 3¾ percent this year, almost 2½ percentage points slower than nominal GDP, owing to rising opportunity costs (Table 2).  With short-term market rates assumed to be unchanged in 2006 and 2007, deposit rates should gradually catch up, partially unwinding the recent sharp increases in the opportunity cost of money holding.  As a consequence, M2 is projected to accelerate to a 4½ percent pace next year and 5 percent in 2007, a little below and above the growth rates of nominal GDP, respectively.  Domestic

nonfinancial sector debt is expected to grow around 8¼ percent this year and then decelerate to a 6½ percent pace in 2007.  Less rapid home price appreciation tempers mortgage borrowing by households, and business debt growth slows with the deceleration of economic activity.
