. U.S. monetary authorities did not intervene  during the period.

- (4) The growth of M2 in November, at 5-1/2 percent, remained moderate, with higher opportunity costs  evidently tending to offset some  of  the impetus  to money demand from stronger spending in the second half of  the year.  Among the components  of M2, currency growth, which  has been brisk for some time, strengthened  further last month. Some portion of the recent runup in currency  could mark a pickup in Y2K-related  demands, but strong holiday  spending also may have played a role. In contrast  to M2, M3 growth surged  last month with the institution-only money  fund and large time deposit components of M3  running especially  strongly.  The pickup in the expansion of institution-only money funds is consistent with reports that firms may be consolidating liquid assets in professionally managed funds in advance of the year-end.  Rapid growth in large  time deposits  at domestic banks  seems to have been driven by the need to  fund sizable increases  in bank credit and vault cash.  Moreover,  the Treasury ran down its deposits in November, probably leading some domestic banks to ratchet up their issuance  of large  time deposits.  U.S. branches  and agencies of foreign banks  apparently  relied increasingly  on large time deposits  to fund their head offices  and build up liquid assets in advance  of the century  date change  and to  finance loan growth.  Recent informal contacts  with several  foreign branches  suggested  that their

head  offices  ave  found  U.S.  markets o  be  a  relatively  tractive  urce f unds  and  have h t at so o f chosen  to  issue  arge ime  deposits  n he nited tates  s  one  of heir  referred hicles  or l t i t U S a t p ve f securing  ver-the-turn  nding or he lobal  rganization. owth of 2  and  M3  from  the o fu f t g o Gr M fourth  uarter  f 998 to  the ourth  uarter  f his  ear,  t   percent  nd  7-1/2  ercent, q o 1 f q o t y a 6 a p respectively,  ceeded  the nnual anges f   to  5 percent  nd  2  to  6 percent, spectively, ex a r o 1 a re for hese ggregates. t a 3
