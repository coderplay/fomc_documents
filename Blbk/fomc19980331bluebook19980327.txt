- (2) The dollar traded  in a relatively  narrow range  against the currencies  of other industrial  countries,  rising  against the yen,  depreciating  against the  Canadian  dollar  and the British pound,  and  remaining  basically  unchanged  against  other major  currencies. In Japan, disappointment  about prospects  for fiscal  stimulus  and concerns  about  Asian crises  worked  to damp long-term  interest rates, which,  however, retraced  a part of their  declines  on Thursday and  Friday  in reaction  to a proposal by Japan's ruling party of a large but still  incompletely specified  fiscal  package. In other industrial  countries,  interest  rates  were  down,  in part  on softer  oil prices  and other  good news  on inflation. Short-term  rates  declined  significantly  in Italy,  Spain,  and  Portugal,  as  expectations  coalesced  around the  view  that short-term rates  in the  countries  likely to initiate Europe's monetary  union at the beginning  of next year  would converge  at or just  a bit above the current  German level. The Bundesbanks  monetary  policy remained on hold  during the period. Financial  market  conditions  in the troubled  emerging Asian  economies improved  somewhat  during the  period, and their  currencies  generally  firmed against  the dollar. Progress  in reforming  economic  policies  and financial  and  commercial practices  was  evident  in most  of these countries;  an  exception  was  Indonesia,  where uncertainty  continued  over  President  Suharto's commitment  to such reforms.
