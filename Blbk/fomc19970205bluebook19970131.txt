the peak posted  four months  ago. 1 Despite the apparent  rise  in real  yields  over  the intermeeting  period,  major  equity  indexes  gained  almost  10 percent. The majority  of earnings reports  for the  fourth  quarter  have  proven  favorable,  and  earnings  growth prospects  looking one  year  ahead  were  mostly revised  even  further  into  double-digit  territory  by stock  analysts.

- (3) The uptick  in intermediate-  and  longer-term  rates  in  the  United  States  was  in sharp  contrast  with  declines  in interest  rates  in many  foreign  markets,  contributing  to  a 4-3/4 percent  surge in the  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  on  a weighted-average  basis  over  the intermeeting  period. In Europe,  weaker-than-expected  economic  data fostered  yield declines of 5  to  25 basis  points; in Japan, the  announcement  of greater-than-expected  fiscal restraint led to  a  5 basis  point  decline  in yields. The degree  of dollar  appreciation--6-1/4  percent against  the yen  and  5-1/2  percent  against  the DM  and  other  ERM  currencies--seems  larger than can be  explained  by  relative interest  rate movements  alone, perhaps  reflecting  increased risk premiums  in response  to the growing  pessimism  about  European  and Japanese  economies. In  Japan,  renewed  concerns  about the financial  system  and  the  economy  sparked  a  sharp decline  in  the stock market,  particularly  bank stocks. In  Canada, by  contrast,  readings  on economic  activity  came  in  on the strong  side;  yields  there  rose  10  basis  points,  and the  U.S. dollar  depreciated  1-1/4 percent. In mid-January,  Mexico repaid  ahead  of schedule  its remaining  $3-1/2 billion  outstanding  debt to  the Treasury's Exchange  Stabilization  Fund.

- (4) Recent  data suggest  that  the  monetary  aggregates  ended the  old  year  and  opened the  new  on a  faster  growth track than the staff had  anticipated  at the  last  Committee  meeting, likely  owing  in part  to  the unexpected  strength in nominal  spending  late  last  year. The decline in  interest rates since  September,  on net,  also  may have  contributed  to  the  strength of M2  demand by  reducing  its  opportunity  cost,  a notion supported  by continuing  anemic noncompetitive  tenders  at Treasury  auctions. December's expansion  of M2,  at a  7-1/2 percent rate,  pulled  that aggregate's  growth  for  1996 to  4-1/2 percent,  in the  upper  portion of its  1-to5 percent range. 2 In January,  the  growth of M2  slowed,  but  only  to  a 5-1/2 percent rate. 3 This strength in M2  apparently  did not  come  at the  expense  of capital  market  mutual  funds, which  still  seem  to be  attracting  healthy inflows. The increase  of M3  in the last month of 1996,  at  an  11-1/4  percent  rate, put its  growth  for the year  at 7  percent,  well  above its  2-to-6 percent  annual  range. The expansion  of the broader  aggregate  slowed  in  January  to  a 6-3/4
