MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) The Committee's decision at its June meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 3¼ percent, to retain an assessment that the risks to price stability and to sustainable growth were balanced, and to reiterate the 'measured pace' language was largely anticipated by investors, and the market reaction was muted.  Over subsequent weeks, a string of better-than-expected data releases on spending and output along with upbeat corporate earnings reports painted a consistent picture of solid economic expansion.  News on inflation was read as more mixed:  Revisions to the national income and product accounts indicated that PCE inflation last year was noticeably higher than previously estimated, but readings for recent months came in below market expectations.  Against this background, and with the monetary policy report and public statements of policymakers seeming to point to continued measured firming, investors marked up the expected path for policy. 1 Options on federal funds futures suggest that investors have become virtually certain of a 25-basis-point tightening at this meeting, which is consistent with the Desk's latest survey of primary dealers.   Respondents to that survey anticipate no significant 2 changes to the wording of the FOMC statement this round and expect additional

- 25-basis-point policy moves at the September and November meetings.  Money market futures quotes indicate that the expected funds rate at year-end was boosted about 35 basis points over the intermeeting period to a bit above 4 percent, and the rate for year-end 2006 was lifted around 45 basis points to about 4¼ percent (Chart 1).
- (2) Yields on nominal Treasury notes climbed about 35 to 40 basis points over the intermeeting period.  With much of the increase concentrated in forward rates at the front end of the curve, the spread between two- and ten-year Treasury yields narrowed further to around 30 basis points.  The London bombings did not appear to prompt much in the way of safe-haven flows to Treasury securities or greater market uncertainty.  Similarly, the announcement of a revaluation of the Chinese renminbi reportedly had no lasting effect in the Treasury market.   Over the intermeeting 3 period, yields on inflation-protected Treasury securities rose roughly in line with those on their nominal counterparts, implying little net change in inflation compensation. Inflation expectations as gauged by the Michigan survey also were little changed, edging down for the short-term measure but rising slightly for the longer-term measure.  The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil rose about $4.00 per barrel, ending the period close to a record high in nominal terms (Chart 2).  Prices of far-dated oil futures moved up more than $3.00 on balance.

- (3) Reflecting positive earnings announcements and strong economic data, spreads on investment-grade corporate bonds edged lower over the intermeeting period.  Those on speculative-grade securities fell about 60 basis points, nearly reversing their runup of this spring.  Broad equity indexes rose 3 to 6 percent over the period, paced by large gains in technology shares, and the implied volatility of equity prices remained low.  Nonetheless, a rough measure of the equity premium-the gap between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio and the real long-term Treasury yield-held steady at a fairly high level.
- (4) Although dollar interest rates rose noticeably relative to those of other major currencies, the trade-weighted foreign exchange value of the dollar against other major currencies declined about 1 percent on balance over the intermeeting period (Chart 3).   The dollar initially rose after the June FOMC meeting, but it gave 4 up these gains late in the intermeeting period.  On net, the dollar depreciated about 2 percent against the euro and 1 percent against the Canadian dollar, while registering modest gains against sterling and the yen.  On August 4, the Bank of England announced a cut in its official target rate of 25 basis points to 4½ percent, citing downside risks to the economy in the near term.  This decision had been widely anticipated, and its announcement prompted little market reaction.  Share prices in foreign industrial countries increased 2 to 6 percent over the intermeeting period.
- (5) Against an index of the currencies of our other important trading partners, the dollar fell about 1½ percent on balance over the period, pulled down by decreases in its value versus the Mexican peso and Chinese renminbi.  The dollar also declined against the currencies of several other Asian emerging economies in the wake of China's revaluation.  Immediately after China's announcement, the Malaysian

authorities announced that they were adopting a managed float for the ringgit exchange rate.

- (6) Domestic nonfinancial debt appears to have decelerated in the second quarter, with all major sectors contributing to the slowing (Chart 4).  In the business sector, internal funds evidently are abundant and capital expenditures are apparently expanding at only a moderate pace, holding down borrowing by nonfinancial firms in recent months.  Net bond issuance remained tepid in June and July, and commercial paper outstanding dropped somewhat, on net, over the same period.  In contrast, business loans continued to expand briskly on balance.  Data from the Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey indicate a further easing of standards and terms on C&amp;amp;I loans over the past three months and also a further strengthening in demand for such loans, supported by increased financing needs for investment and mergers and acquisitions. Household borrowing seems to have slowed a bit in the second quarter but apparently remained quite brisk, propelled by continued expansion of mortgage debt at close to a 10 percent rate.  Federal debt growth dropped off markedly last quarter, consistent with higher-than-expected tax receipts and a narrowing of the deficit in recent months.
- (7) M2 growth picked up to a 6 percent rate in June, but fell back in July to around the pace registered over the first five months of the year.  The strength in M2 in June owed primarily to an increase in liquid deposits; a rise in mortgage prepayments and a bulge in nonwithheld individual income tax payments likely played a role in that pickup.  Over the first two quarters of 2005, the growth of M2, at a 2¾ percent annual rate, was somewhat above the pace predicted by standard historical relationships with income and short-term interest rates, perhaps owing to the flattening of the yield curve.

Economic Outlook

- (8) Incoming data on spending and production have led the staff to mark up its assessment of near-term strength in the economy, and the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts have induced the staff to trim its estimates of the level and growth rate of potential output.  Inflation pressures are also greater in this projection, partly because of the upward revision to the outlook for energy prices. Consequently, the staff has assumed more policy tightening than in the June Greenbook, with the target federal funds rate reaching 4 percent in the fourth quarter of this year and 4¼ percent by the middle of next year, 50 basis points higher than in June-a path roughly the same as that priced into asset markets.  Bond yields are expected to remain close to their current higher levels, while equity prices are assumed to increase further at a pace sufficient to generate risk-adjusted returns in line with those on fixed-income instruments.  Relative to the last round, the foreign exchange value of the dollar starts at a level that is a bit lower than anticipated in June and declines over the forecast period at a slightly faster pace.  The price of West Texas intermediate crude oil is projected to stay near its recent higher level, in line with futures market quotes.  Under these assumptions, real GDP is forecast to expand at a pace slightly above 4 percent over the second half of this year, essentially closing the output gap by the fourth quarter.  Next year, real output is projected to grow at the same rate as its potential, about 3 percent.  The flattening out of oil prices and a deceleration in non-oil import prices cause total PCE inflation to drop from 2½ percent this year to 2 percent in 2006, while core PCE inflation holds about steady near 2 percent over the forecast period.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Policy Alternatives

- (9) Table 1 presents three policy alternatives for consideration by the Committee.  The federal funds rate would be boosted 25 basis points at this meeting under Alternatives A and B, and 50 basis points under Alternative C.  Apart from updating the description of the current economic situation, the proposed announcement associated with Alternative B is little changed from that issued after the June meeting.  In contrast, the announcement accompanying Alternative A would hint at a near-term slowing in the pace of policy tightening, in part by noting that policy accommodation has been substantially reduced.  The proposed announcement for Alternative C emphasizes the strength of aggregate spending, suggests that pressures on business costs and inflation could be increasing, and eliminates all forward-looking language.  As usual, the Committee could consider combining the policy action and draft language from more than one alternative or view some of the language options as possibilities for the future.
- (10) If the Committee agrees with the staff's assessment that a small amount of slack remains in the economy and that the current configuration of financial asset prices is likely to prove consistent with the expansion of aggregate spending coming into line with potential output growth before long, it may be attracted to the 25-basispoint firming and statement language of Alternative B. Investors currently anticipate a quarter-point move at this meeting followed by several additional firmingsexpectations that should be largely preserved by the combination of policy action and language proposed under this alternative.  And, while recent indicators suggest that the growth of aggregate demand has been surprisingly buoyant of late, the Committee may interpret the relatively low inflation readings for recent months as indicating that prices are not currently in the process of accelerating.  Although the stance of monetary policy evidently remains accommodative, the gap between the actual real funds rate and current estimates of its equilibrium value has narrowed considerably

Table 1: Alternative Language for the August FOMC Announcement

<!-- missing-text -->

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

since mid-2004 (Chart 5).  According to those estimates, continued policy firming at a pace of 25 basis points per meeting would bring the real funds rate within the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value by November.  But even if members believe that such a sequence of policy actions is likely to produce sufficient restraint on inflation, they might judge it premature to send any signal at this time that the course of policy tightening is nearing completion.  Indeed, in light of the recent indications of strong economic activity, policymakers may have boosted their sense of the degree of policy tightening that will prove necessary and may now even see an appreciable probability that the federal funds rate will need to be raised for a time above its estimated short-run equilibrium value.  Even with such an assessment, though, members may judge that continuing to tighten policy at a measured pace, albeit over a slightly longer period than previously anticipated, should provide adequate restraint on spending and inflation.

- (11) As shown in Table 1, the statement for Alternative B updates the wording employed in June in light of incoming data on spending, output, and employment by noting that 'Aggregate spending, despite high energy prices, appears to have strengthened since late winter, and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.'   The Committee might acknowledge incoming price data by noting that 5 'Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months,' and, with both survey and TIPS-based measures of inflation expectations little changed, it could reiterate that 'longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained.'  However, it might wish to emphasize that 'pressures on inflation have stayed elevated' by moving that thought to the end of the sentence.  The statement could again indicate that 'with appropriate monetary policy action, the upside and downside risks to the attainment of both sustainable growth and price stability should be kept roughly equal.'  That

Notes: The real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the quarterly average of the actual nominal funds rate and the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters.  For the current quarter, the nominal funds rate used is the target federal funds rate as of the Bluebook publication date.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its potential level over time.  The short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given a model's projection of the economy, and the medium-run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter.  The real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation, with the staff projection used for the current quarter.  Since TIPS indexation is based on the total CPI, the TIPS-consistent measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between CPI inflation and core PCE inflation.

assessment would also support retention of the phrase indicating that the removal of policy accommodation can likely proceed at a measured pace.

- (12) Investors appear virtually certain that the FOMC will increase the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting, and they reportedly put high odds on an announcement that retains both the measured pace language and the assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and to price stability should remain balanced with appropriate policy action.  Thus, the market reaction to an announcement along the lines of Alternative B should be relatively modest, although rates could back up a little in response to the changes in the wording suggesting that the FOMC was focusing on the strength in spending and inflation pressures.  Barring significant downside surprises in economic data over coming weeks, investors would likely come to boost further the already substantial odds placed on additional policy moves later this year, particularly should public statements by policymakers point to a continuation of firming.
- (13) Recognizing that the cumulative tightening put in place over the past year has substantially reduced the degree of monetary policy accommodation, the Committee may believe that the real federal funds rate is now nearing its equilibrium level.  In view of such an assessment as well as the subdued readings on core inflation in recent months, the FOMC might opt for Alternative A's combination of a 25-basis-point hike in the funds rate at this meeting and a statement that hints that the Committee could soon slow the pace of policy firming.  This alternative would seem particularly attractive if members thought that slack in labor markets was greater than in the staff assessment, implying less need to tighten policy than in the Greenbook. Even if the Committee believed that it would probably need to tighten policy somewhat further following a quarter-point step on Tuesday, a near-term pause might be viewed as prudent to allow more time to evaluate the effects of its cumulative policy action to date.  A funds rate path incorporating a quarter-point tightening at

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

this meeting followed by a shallower trajectory of tightening would be consistent with the prescriptions from several policy rules (Chart 6).

- (14) The draft statement associated with Alternative A could indicate that 'The Committee believes that the degree of monetary policy accommodation has been substantially reduced,' while again acknowledging that the expansion remains firm and that labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.  Particularly if the Committee were concerned about a possible slackening in the pace of trend productivity growth, it might wish to eliminate the previous language pointing to robust underlying productivity growth as a factor supporting the expansion.  With regard to prices, the statement could indicate that 'Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remain well contained,' dropping the reference to inflation pressures.  In the penultimate sentence, the FOMC could indicate that 'remaining' policy accommodation can likely be removed at a measured pace.  Alternatively, if the Committee judged that the real federal funds rate now was in the neighborhood of its equilibrium level, it might choose to drop the 'measured pace' sentence entirely, thus suggesting that further firming could prove to be unnecessary.
- (15) Market participants expect that the path of the intended federal funds rate will begin to flatten out around year-end, but market commentary and survey evidence indicate that investors do not anticipate that the FOMC will signal any such development next week.  Accordingly, a statement employing the draft wording shown in Alternative A would likely produce a noticeable downward shift in interest rates implied by money market futures quotes, as investors priced in a slower pace of policy action and probably also revised down the likely extent of cumulative tightening.  That change in policy outlook would likely prompt a rally in bond and equity markets and some depreciation in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.  If

Note: Rule prescriptions for 2005Q3 through 2006Q2 are calculated using current Greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap (or unemployment gap).  For rules that contain the lagged funds rate, the rule's previous prescription for the funds rate is used to compute prescriptions for 2005Q4 through 2006Q2.  It is assumed that there is no feedback from the rule prescriptions to the Greenbook projections through 2006Q2.  The TIPS-based rule is computed using average TIPS and nominal Treasury yields to date.

the 'measured pace' sentence were included, the extent of the rally might be limited by a recognition that some further policy tightening could still be in the cards.

- (16) If the Committee has become significantly more concerned about inflation pressures of late, it may favor the 50-basis-point increase in the federal funds rate of Alternative C .  Greater worries about inflation prospects could have been prompted by the brisk growth in aggregate demand apparently in train in the current quarter, which could be read as suggesting that asset prices are not exerting sufficient restraint on spending to keep actual output from overshooting its potential before long. Moreover, members may see the potential for an intensification of cost pressures stemming from a variety of sources.  The further rise in far-dated oil futures prices over the intermeeting period, for example, suggests that business energy costs will ratchet up somewhat further in coming months.  Also, members may be concerned about the potential for further acceleration in unit labor costs if their assessment of the NAIRU is noticeably higher than the staff's estimate of 5 percent or if they judge that structural productivity growth could be slowing more sharply than estimated by the staff.  Indeed, the slower growth of productivity in recent quarters as well as the lower estimates of productivity implied by the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts might incline policymakers to trim their views of structural productivity even more than has the staff.  And, even if they had a baseline outlook for the economy and prices similar to that in the Greenbook forecast, members may prefer lower inflation than the 2 percent core PCE rate projected by the staff for late 2006.
- (17) The Committee could consider a number of modifications to its statement in conjunction with the selection of Alternative C.  For instance, the FOMC might wish to delete the reference to 'robust underlying growth in productivity.'  Although the staff continues to forecast solid growth of structural productivity, the Committee's confidence on this score may be diminishing and hence it might not wish to

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

characterize the pace of underlying productivity growth so explicitly.  The statement could highlight the strength of the economy by stating that 'Aggregate spending appears to be expanding briskly despite high energy prices.'  It could acknowledge recent price developments while registering some concern about inflation prospects by noting that 'Core inflation has been relatively low in recent months and longerterm inflation expectations seem well contained, but pressures on business costs and inflation appear to be increasing.'  As discussed in the June Bluebook, the Committee might also take this opportunity to eliminate the forward-looking language from the statement, dropping both the risk assessment and the last two sentences referring to the measured pace of tightening and to the Committee's commitment to respond to economic developments as needed to maintain price stability.

- (18) Market participants would no doubt be taken aback by the combination of a 50-basis-point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for Alternative C.  Investors might infer that policy firming in the current cycle would likely bring the funds rate appreciably above 4¼ percent, the peak funds rate that seems to be currently incorporated in market prices.  Moreover, with the elimination of the measured-pace language, market participants might come to believe that at least some of that rate gap could be covered in additional 50-basis-point strides.  With the expected policy path pushed sharply upward and little forwardlooking guidance provided by the FOMC, investors' uncertainty regarding the future path of policy would likely increase.  In all likelihood, the upward revision to policy expectations would trigger a sell-off in fixed-income and equity markets and a rise in the foreign-exchange value of the dollar, although the increase in long-term yields and appreciation of the dollar could be limited if the drop in share prices were especially sharp.  If the FOMC were particularly concerned about inflation pressures but was not prepared to hike rates 50 basis points at this meeting, it could couple a quarterpoint move with some of the changes in the statement suggested for Alternative C.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Such a pairing would temper the surprise to market participants, but it would probably still lead them to mark up significantly their expectations of policy firming.

Money and Debt Forecasts

- (19) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 growth this year and next is projected at only about 2¼ percent and 3½ percent, respectively (Table 2).  M2 velocity is expected to increase modestly further over the forecast period.  However, the projected flat yield curve should support the demand for M2 assets, and thus velocity is likely to remain below the level suggested by historical relationships among money, nominal income, and short-run opportunity costs.  The growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is forecast to step down somewhat this year and to slow further in 2006.  Borrowing by households is expected to drop off considerably, largely reflecting a deceleration in mortgage debt as the pace of home price appreciation slows and activity in the housing market flattens out.  Federal borrowing is also likely to slow a little as the budget deficit narrows a bit.  Despite rising capital expenditures, business borrowing is projected to remain moderate this year and next, as some firms meet their funding needs by drawing on their large stockpiles of liquid assets and on repatriations of retained income from abroad.  Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is expected to expand 7½ percent in 2005 and 6 percent in 2006, down from about 8½ percent in 2004.
