but movements  on some days were sharp and difficult  to relate  to fundamentals. Both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England  firmed policy late in the intermeeting period, raising official rates  50 and 25 basis points, respectively. Market participants apparently interpreted  these  actions-which  had been largely  anticipated--and,  in the case of the ECB, the accompanying statement, as lowering the cumulative  tightening  that might be necessary and  as reducing uncertainty by rendering it less likely  that additional policy action would be forthcoming for a while.  Against this backdrop, ten-year nominal yields fell 30 basis  points in Germany  and 70 basis points in the United Kingdom over the intermeeting period.  These interest rate declines  supported equity values but tended to weaken  the euro and pound relative  to the dollar.  In Japan, evidence  of sustained  economic growth  and expectations  of substantial  fiscal stimulus  pushed up bond yields  about 15 basis points, share prices 5 percent, and the exchange value of the yen against the dollar over  1 percent. Although rumors surfaced  of  impending  action  from time to time, Japanese authorities did not intervene  in the  foreign exchange  market.

. The Desk did not intervene.

- (5) The depreciation of the dollar against the currencies  of other important trading partners  over the intermeeting period owed in part to greater  assurance of economic expansion  in many of those emerging economies  and, perhaps, to an increased willingness of global investors  to bear risk.  In addition,  relatively orderly  elections  in Indonesia  and Argentina  and a primary in Mexico  underscored  a sense of renewed  stability in many of
