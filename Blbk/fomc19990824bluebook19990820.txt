most industrial  countries  held their policy rates  steady over the intermeeting period, longer- term interest rates in many countries  rose on the market's more upbeat assessment of economic growth going forward.  Spurred in part by data showing a sharp  widening of the trade balance,  the dollar dropped  further against European  currencies  in recent days. Concerns about a stronger yen drove the Japanese  authorities to intervene  three times in July.  The depreciation  of the dollar against the yen resumed in mid-August,  as statements by Japanese  officials and an absence  of further intervention by the Japanese government apparently  suggested  to market participants  that the willingness of  Japanese  authorities to engage in measures  to limit the rise in the yen may be diminishing. 6

- (4) Credit  spreads widened across  a broad range of international financial  assets during the intermeeting  period.  Corporate bond spreads  against government obligations rose  10 to 15 basis  points in Germany, Japan, and Canada.  In Latin America,  financial markets appeared  particularly sensitive  to prospects for rising interest rates in the United States. Spreads were  further boosted by the news very late in the period that Ecuador would seek to reschedule  its next Brady debt payment.  In total, Brady yield spreads  over Treasuries  widened  appreciably, with the Emerging Market  Bond Index spread increasing 150 basis points.
