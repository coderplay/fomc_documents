- 2-1/4 percent depreciation  on net of the dollar's value  against a basket  of  major currencies since  the May FOMC meeting.  Notable  among the changes in the components  of the major currencies  index was a 2-1/2 percent drop in the dollar's  value vis-a-vis the  euro, abetted  no doubt by the European Central Bank's decision to hike its policy rate  1/2 percentage  point on June 8, a  quarter point more than had been built into market prices. While the Bank of  Japan kept its policy rate at zero, officials hinted  frequently  that some tightening was in the offing, and the dollar lost about 4-1/2 percent  of  its value against the yen on balance.  Even so, Japanese  longer-term  yields were  little changed.

U.S. monetary authorities  did  not intervene.

- (4) Concerns about a few emerging market countries  have cropped up in recent weeks and appear mostly responsible  for the modest appreciation  of the dollar against  an index of the currencies  of our other important trading  partners.  Recent polls  suggest the presidential race in Mexico is too close to call, heightening nervousness  on the part of some investors  about the potential for unsettled political  and economic  conditions  after the election. On net, the dollar has gained  4-1/4 percent against  the peso.  Social unrest in Indonesia  and a pickup in piracy in  the Phillippines  depressed their currencies  and added to the risk premiums  on their foreign debt.  In contrast, yield spreads  on Brazilian  dollardenominated  debt over U.S. Treasury  securities declined  and the real appreciated  2 percent on favorable  inflation news  that allowed the  central bank to  ease policy late in the
