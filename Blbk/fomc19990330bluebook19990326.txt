inflation damped.  Nonetheless,  some of the increase  in nominal yields apparently was also accounted for by a rise in inflation expectations,  perhaps partly in reaction to the recent increase in oil prices.  More  favorable  perceptions  of and appetites  for risk in private  securities markets have narrowed  spreads  on corporate bonds vis-a-vis  Treasuries, but they remain well  above the unusually  thin levels prevailing  in the first half of 1998  (Chart 2).  Indexes of equity prices have been mixed:  The Dow Jones and S&amp;P 500 posted net gains, but lower earnings  expectations, especially  for technology companies,  led to a drop in the  NASDAQ and the Russell 2000 index of small-cap  firms.  Bank share  prices have  moved up sharply, notably for money center banks, reversing  earlier declines when  a significant  fallout from Brazil's difficulties  was feared.

- (2) The rise in interest rates  in the United  States has contributed  to  a 3  3/4 ercent p appreciation  of the  dollar relative to an average of other major currencies since  the February FOMC meeting.  The dollar has increased  7  1/4 rcent on balance  against the yen, as the Bank of pe Japan eased  monetary policy, announcing that it would guide the overnight call rate  "as  low as possible." In recent weeks,  the call rate has remained  at or below  5 basis points, the ten-year government yield has fallen 45 basis points,  stock prices have risen  substantially, and the socalled "Japan premium" in funding costs for Japanese  banks has declined markedly. The dollar has appreciated  5  1/4 rcent on balance over the period versus  the euro, which was weighed down pe by continued  signs of weakness in German  economic  activity and, late in the period,  by the hostilities in the Balkans.  The term structure of euro interest rate futures  suggests that market participants  continue to expect a modest monetary policy easing by the ECB Council  by the fall.

- (3) Financial market conditions  have continued to improve in most emerging market economies,  as investor  confidence  evidently has been bolstered by the limited contagion from Brazilian  developments.  In Brazil itself, overall financial  conditions have  stabilized somewhat and the real has tended  to firm in recent weeks, owing to a number of factors:  The Brazilian Central Bank demonstrated  its commitment to containing  inflation by raising the overnight policy interest rate  appreciably early in  the period;  the government  struck an agreement  with the IMF, paving the way for the release  of the  second tranche  of multilateral financial  assistance; international  banks made public commitments  to maintain or increase their exposure to Brazil; and its  Congress  completed passage  of the major elements of the fiscal  austerity program.  The Mexican  peso has  appreciated  5  percent since the February FOMC meeting, bolstered in part by the snapback in oil prices.  Despite financial collapse in Ecuador, yield spreads over Treasuries of Latin  American  Brady bonds have continued to decline, and prices  in most major equity markets  in the region  are up.  Monetary  authorities  in a number of emerging Asian economies allowed domestic  interest rates  to fall somewhat over the intermeeting  period.  The Korean  won, the Taiwan dollar, the Indonesian rupiah, and the Thai baht have depreciated  between  2 and 5 percent against the dollar over the  intermeeting period.  In local currency  terms, share prices have risen between  5 and 22 percent in the aforementioned  countries, with the exception  of Indonesia, where equity prices have registered a 3  percent decline.
- (4) The broad monetary aggregates have decelerated markedly in recent months and by more than expected  at the time  of the Committee's last meeting.  Data through the first half of
