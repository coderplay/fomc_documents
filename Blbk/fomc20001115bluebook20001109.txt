- (4) A small net appreciation of the dollar also  contributed  to the firming of financial conditions.  The foreign  exchange value  of the dollar rose noticeably through much of October, but over the past two weeks the dollar has given up about one-half of those gains. On net, the dollar increased  1-3/4 percent against an index of major currencies, appreciating 2-3/4 percent against the euro,  3 percent against the British pound, and 2-1/4 percent against  the Canadian  dollar, while  depreciating  1-1/4 percent against the Japanese yen. The euro's value in terms of the dollar touched a new low in late October, about 6 percent  below that at the start of the month, even  though the European  Central Bank  (ECB) firmed its target policy  rates  1/4 percentage  point on October  5.  A welter of statements  on policy by European  officials  and a perception  that prospects for growth in the United  States remained  stronger than those in Europe apparently weakened the euro.  But perceptions about relative economic growth seemed to shift a little after  the release  of  weaker-thanexpected third-quarter  U.S.  GDP, and the  euro has since rallied.
