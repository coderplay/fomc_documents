major currencies.  The  decline  of the dollar against the yen seemed especially puzzling at times, but it may have reflected both some tendency for investors to seek the greater perceived safety  of assets  in home  markets and the influence  of the zero bound on  nominal interest rates  in constraining  further declines  in nominal  and real rates in Japan. With incoming data suggesting further deterioration  in the Japanese  economy, the Bank of Japan announced that it would guide the  overnight call rate down  to around  1/4 percent  from the previous  target "somewhat  below" the  official discount rate  of 1/2 percent.  This move, which surprised  investors, contributed to a 36 basis point decline in Japanese bond yields over the intermeeting period to a level of 85  basis points.  The lack of progress  on legislation to reform the banking system contributed to the negative outlook for Japan.

- (5) The broad money aggregates  expanded  rapidly over the intermeeting  period, propelled largely by unexpectedly  strong growth in retail and  institution-only money market mutual funds.  As in some past episodes  of market turbulence, money funds  appear to have been favored by investors  looking to wait out the current bout of market volatility by parking balances in relatively  safe, liquid assets.  In addition, many investors  no doubt have found the yields  on money funds attractive given the current very flat yield curve and the decline in Treasury bill rates. M2 and M3  are now estimated to have  grown at 14-1/2  and  15-3/4 percent rates respectively  in September,  placing both aggregates still further above the upper bounds  of  their annual ranges.
