MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) By  the  time of  the July 2-3 FOMC meeting, market participants had mostly become convinced that no action to tighten reserve market conditions would be taken at that meeting. As a result, the decision to  keep the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent prompted only modest declines in rates at short maturities and no reaction further along the yield curve. Maintaining the funds rate at that intended level over the  intermeeting period, however, proved difficult at times in light of  unpredictably high demand for reserves at the end of  July and in early August, and perhaps pressures spilling over from  the financing market. As a  consequence, the federal funds rate averaged a  shade more than its intended level over the intermeeting period.1

(2)  Most market interest rates have declined 15 to 25 basis points, on net, over the intermeeting period (chart). Rates rose sharply in the days just after the July FOMC meeting as incoming data were read by  market participants as indicating that the economy was straining its productive resources and pressures on labor costs were mounting. Futures quotes (chart) indicated a  presumption that the funds rate would be  hiked at the August FOMC meeting, and there was even some market chatter that an intermeeting move was a  distinct possibility. While Chairman Greenspan's Humphrey-Hawkins' testimony

conveyed to  the market the  notion that inflation risks were clearly tilted to  the upside, it also raised the possibility that the economy could settle into a  sustainable growth path without policy action and it flagged several upcoming data releases as important in  assessing that possibility. As  those reports became available, they were seen, by  and large, to be  pointing to a  slowing in demand growth and only a mild upturn in labor compensation, and a  considerable decline in interest rates ensued. Market participants have mostly discounted the possibility of action at  the upcoming FOMC meeting, and further-ahead futures quotes seem consistent with high odds that policy would be on hold for a  considerable stretch. Yields on Treasury coupon securities have declined 25 to  35 basis points since the Chairman's testimony. While some of  this decline probably reflects an easing of inflation expectations, the sharp rebound in equity prices in recent weeks-which were also helped by  favorable earnings reports--and the easing of  the dollar in  foreign exchange markets support the assessment that much of  the drop in  interest rates represented a  downward movement in real rates. The decline, reflecting a  reassessment of the path of real rates needed to  keep inflation pressures contained, likely reversed only a  fraction of  the run-up in long-term real rates since January.

(3)  The dollar's foreign exchange value has decreased 1-1/4 percent on a  weighted-average basis since the July FOMC meeting. The dollar moved down 2-1/4 percent against the mark and 2  percent against the  yen. Japanese and German monetary policies remained on  hold during  the period, and short-term interest rates in  Japan and Germany were little changed. Bond yields in Japan were also essentially unchanged. Surprising the market by  failing to reduce its RP rate,

Bundesbank officials stated that above-target money growth is  still  a concern, although  some of those  officials apparently believe a further easing might  still be possible. Despite disappointed  expectations about German monetary policy, German bond yields decreased somewhat during the  period, possibly reflecting a reduction in  inflation and uncertainty premiums in German financial markets  as  doubts  about the implementation of European Monetary Union resurfaced.

The Desk did not  intervene.

(4) The  expansion of the monetary aggregates  slowed more abruptly in July than the  staff had anticipated  at  the  last FOMC meeting. M2 grew at  a 2-1/4 percent  pace  last month, down  from a 5-1/2 percent  rate in  June, but  still  remained in  the upper portion of its annual  range. Much of the weakness in July was  accounted for by an unexpected drop in demand deposits, which had posted unusually strong growth in the first half of this year. Offsetting part  of the  recent slowdown, currency growth has picked up  some,  apparently fueled by shipments  abroad. Contacts with currency shippers have  indicated that much of this  cash is  destined for Russia,  but growing worldwide acceptance of the new hundred dollar bill also may have  played a role. 2 M2 apparently has  not benefitted much from investors'  recent skittishness  about  long-term investments. Net  inflows to stock and bond funds fell  off substantially in July, but little of that financial capital

appears to have been redirected toward money market mutual funds or retail deposits.

(5)  The weaker growth of  M2 showed through to M3, which expanded at a  3-3/4 percent rate in  July, about a  percentage point slower than in the previous month. This slower growth opened a little room between M3 and  the upper end of  its annual range. Bank funding needs apparently were weak, with bank credit growing at only a  1  percent rate in  July. Banks ran off their securities holdings at a  6-1/2 percent pace, even as lending diminished. The growth rates of  both real estate and consumer loans edged lower, but the former seems to have been pulled down by  a  step-up in  the pace of  securitization. Banks continue to pull back from their aggressive stance in seeking consumer loans: In  a  recent survey, about half of  the banks said that they tightened their standards for approving credit card applications and about a  quarter tightened standards for other consumer installment loans.

(6)  Data on credit flows for July and early August, apart from those provided by commercial banks, are sparse. The available information suggests that the expansion of  debt of  nonfederal sectors has slowed in recent months. In  the household sector, consumer credit growth fell off  to around a  8-3/4 percent rate in  the second quarter, and mortgage borrowing remained moderate. Net bond issuance by  nonfinancial firms in  July was a touch above its second-quarter rate, but most of  this reflected lessened reliance on shorter-term borrowing. Credit continues to  be readily available to  business borrowers, with spreads in  securities markets still narrow and  banks continuing to

offer accommodative loan terms. The runoff of  the debt of state and local governments persisted, with particularly hefty retirements bunched at  the beginning of  July. Surprisingly strong tax inflows allowed the Treasury to slash its borrowing in  the second quarter, but borrowing has since picked up. Overall, domestic nonfinancial debt grew at a  4-3/4 percent pace in  the second quarter. From the fourth quarter to June, debt of  the nonfinancial sectors expanded a  4-3/4 percent pace, putting the aggregate a  tad below the midpoint of  its 3 to 7 percent annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(7)  Reports since the last FOMC meeting have suggested that, on  balance, aggregate measures of spending, production, and inflation are coming in  fairly close to staff projections. Wage and total labor compensation figures, though, have seemed more clearly to point to an acceleration in recent quarters. Even with economic expansion projected by  the staff to slow to  around the growth rate of potential output over the next year and a  half, resource utilization would remain high. Moreover, the just-passed federal minimum wage hike, not previously assumed in the staff forecast, will add to future laborcost pressure on  prices. As a  result, the staff envisions that an uptrend in core CPI inflation will become apparent over the coming year, even after methodological improvements in  that price measure. The increase in  the  CPI for 1997 in  the staff forecast would be  a little above the central tendency range of  FOMC members in the Humphrey-Hawkins' report, even though the real growth and unemployment outcomes for 1997 would be consistent with the central tendencies for these measures.

(8)  Nonetheless, the Committee may  well feel that it can afford to wait, as  in alternative B, for additional data to accumulate to  allow a  more confident judgment concerning whether an  underlying process of rising inflation seems to be taking hold. Arguably, the upturn in  the compensation trend is not firmly established in a statistical sense, leaving questions about the level of  the NAIRU. And even if  wages have begun to accelerate, the profit share may be sufficiently high to cushion the extent to  which faster increases in labor compensation are passed through to  prices for a  time. Even if the staff assessment of  emerging price pressures is confirmed, with

the economy still close to its potential, the pickup in  inflation would be  gradual. Consequently, as long as a  slowdown in real GDP growth of  the dimension foreseen by  the staff still appears to be  in train, the case for an immediate policy tightening may not be seen as compelling. While keeping policy on  hold for a  time in these circumstances might imply the need for a  greater tightening later to reverse the pickup in  inflation, so long as  the action were not postponed too long, a wrenching adjustment to  output should be avoidable.

(9)  The decision at this FOMC meeting to leave the policy stance unchanged would accord with the current market consensus. Still, the elimination of  the small perceived chance of  a  tightening at this FOMC meeting could cause interest rates to slip off, but only a  bit, and the exchange value of  the dollar would remain around recent levels. Over the next few  weeks, when new  information on  the economy will be  relatively sparse, market interest rates probably would be little changed. Subsequently, markets could be quite volatile in response to the heavier flow of  economic news, as participants sort out its implications against the background of  a  Federal Reserve characterized by  Chairman Greenspan as "especially vigilant to  incipent inflation pressures." A  partial retracing of  the recent bond market rally cannot be ruled out, if, consistent with the staff forecast, incoming indicators suggest prospective inflation pressures.

(10) The Committee instead may wish to implement the 25 basis point increase in the intended federal funds rate involved in  alternative C. Especially in  light of  the recent low level of  initial claims and the  upside potential for inventory stocking, the Committee may question the staff forecast that economic activity is likely to  downshift in  the near term  by enough to stabilize resource utilization.

Alternatively, even if  the Committee does expect growth in real aggregate demand soon to line up  with that of  potential output, it may be troubled by  the strains on  resource availability and the uptrend in core inflation embodied in  the staff forecast. Particularly with the upward pressure on prices from the  minimum wage hike, a  rise in  the nominal funds rate would be  necessary at some point just to keep the real rate from falling and thus the stance of  policy from effectively easing, unless the economy is appreciably weaker or output-price tradeoffs considerably more favorable than the staff predicts. An immediate tightening of 1/4 percentage point would increase the likelihood of  holding the line against an  upcreep in core inflation by better ensuring an eventual relief of  pressures on  resources. Such a tightening might be  viewed as a  fairly typical policy reaction to  the revision to the outlook since the Committee last eased at  the end of January. From the February monetary policy report to that in  July, the  members' central tendencies for real GDP growth and CPI inflation for 1996 were revised up  by  1/2 and 1/4 points, respectively. In light of  these revisions and their implications for the longer-term outlook, an  immediate 25 basis point tightening, or  perhaps one of  50 basis points, would be  even more warranted if  the Committee were seeking to  move policy over time to a  stance restrictive enough to put a downward tilt to  the inflation rate in  1997 and beyond.

(11) Given the recent adjustment to their expectations for monetary policy, market participants would be  somewhat surprised by  a Committee decision to raise its intended federal funds rate by  25 basis points, as  under alternative C. Other short-term market rates would immediately adjust upward by  a  like amount. Because the likely

trajectory of  short-term interest rates would be higher over the intermediate run than previously expected by  the  market, some increases in  longer-term interest rates and in  the exchange value of the dollar would occur. The size of  the upward adjustments would depend in  part on  whether the market saw the policy firming as an isolated event or the first of  a  series of  policy tightenings. Some market participants apparently sense that the Committee may require extra evidence to change direction in  monetary policy, and hence might assume that Committee members now see the potential inflationary situation as having worsened appreciably and may  be  contemplating more than one small move. In that regard, the announcement accompanying the policy tightening presumably could provide some guidance to  the market on these matters.

(12) The debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected by  the staff to expand at about a  4-1/4 percent rate over the second half of  this year, slower than the first-half pace and leaving growth for the  year a  little below the  midpoint of its annual range. The moderation is concentrated in  the household sector. Still-high fixedrate mortgage costs should begin to bite more into residential housing activity and mortgage lending. Consumer credit should also decelerate over the second half in keeping with diminished growth in outlays on durables and a more cautious approach to such credit by  both households and  banks. Meanwhile, credit for business should remain available on favorable terms both from banks and in securities markets. Business borrowing should continue to be  moderate, supported by  large equity retirements and inventory restocking.

(13) The staff has revised down its projection of  the growth of  M2 and  M3 for this year under the unchanged funds rate of  the

greenbook forecast by 1/4 percentage point each to 4-3/4 percent and 5-3/4 percent, respectively (see table). The slight downward revisions primarily reflect weaker than expected money growth in  July. The recent lull in  M2  growth is not expected to persist, however. For one thing, demand deposits should return to a  more normal pace of expansion. More fundamentally, M2 growth will be  buoyed by  moderate growth in  nominal GDP while opportunity costs experience little further change. The projected strengthening in  M2 is expected to show through to  M3, but the pickup in  M3 growth likely will be restrained to a  degree by  a  sluggish projected advance in bank credit. M1  will continue to  be depressed by  additional sweeps; M1 adjusted for the initial effects of  such sweeps is projected to grow at a  6-1/2 percent pace this year.4

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the  usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In the implementation of  policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY)/ maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In  the context of  the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint (WOULD) might be  acceptable in  the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to  be consistent with moderate growth in  M2  and M3 over coming months.
