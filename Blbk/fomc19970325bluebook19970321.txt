both expected  inflation and  inflation uncertainty. Survey data on inflation expectations  have shown little change  of late. Most  indexes  of equity  prices  declined  slightly  over the period, but  weakness  in technology  and  small capitalization  stocks  sent the NASDAQ down sharply.

- (3) With growth  prospects  in the U.S. boosted relative  to those  abroad,  reflected  in greater  increases  in interest rates  in the U.S. than abroad,  the  dollar's weighted-average exchange  value rose 2-1/2  percent  over  the  intermeeting  period. The dollar appreciated  only slightly  against  the yen, which  was  supported  by a growing  realization  that Japan's trade  and current  account  surpluses  are burgeoning, that  these  surpluses  are not sustainable,  and that the yen most likely  will  eventually  appreciate  in response.
- (4) Broad  money growth remained  fairly  strong  in February,  though  data for  early March  suggest some  moderation. M2 expanded  at a 5 percent  rate  last month, the  same  as  in January,  no doubt  supported  in both months  by  robust  income  growth. 1 Based  on the staff's GDP forecast,  M2 velocity  is expected to  rise  only  a little  in the first quarter. With opportunity  costs about  unchanged,  this  behavior  of velocity  would  extend  the relatively stable relationship  between  these  two measures  that has prevailed  for the last  2-1/2  years. M3 growth continued  to outpace  that  of M2, reflecting  sizable  issuance  of large  time deposits, particularly  by foreign banks,  which have  been using them to  fund rapid  asset expansion  as

well  as  to ay down borrowing  from  their  oreign  ffices.  3  also ontinued o  be boosted p f o M c t by further  trong rowth  of  money funds, hich  have  continued o  gain opularity   a s g w t p as business ash  management vehicle  n  recent  ears. c i y
