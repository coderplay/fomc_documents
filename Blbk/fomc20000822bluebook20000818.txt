already been embedded in market prices, and intermediate-  and longer-term Japanese  yields changed little,  on balance,  over the intermeeting  period.  Japanese  equity prices  rallied after the policy tightening, but still declined about 6 percent  over the past eight weeks,  perhaps reacting to a rising level  of bankruptcies,  including that of a prominent retailer.  The European  Central Bank has kept policy on hold in recent months, but officials have been hinting broadly that more tightening is  in store given  the vigor in  spending along with the uptick in inflation  and weakness  in the euro.  Still, longer-term yields  are down 5 to  10 basis points across  Europe, and equity prices  have posted mixed changes.  There was  no intervention by U.S. monetary  authorities over the intermeeting period.

. The exchange value of the  dollar depreciated a little  on net against the currencies  of other important trading partners, paced by a substantial rise in the exchange value of the Mexican  peso.  Prospects brightened in Mexico on the promise  of a peaceful  transition of power following the opposition party's victory in the presidential election  along with strength in economic  data and higher oil prices.

Emerging market bond spreads narrowed  further, with the Mexican  spread shedding 75 basis points.

- (4) The moderation in the growth  of private  spending in the second  quarter and the tightening in financial conditions  through May  did not seem  to affect  the pace of borrowing materially this spring.  Growth of domestic  nonfinancial  sector debt in the  second quarter is  estimated  at a  5-1/4 percent rate, only  a touch below that in the  first quarter.  The
