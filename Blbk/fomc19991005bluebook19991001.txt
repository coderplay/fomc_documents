which Japanese  authorities tried  to stem with two rounds of intervention in  September.  The actions, aggregating to $9.4  billion, seemed  to have little lasting effect  on the  tide of a rising value  of the yen.  Concerns  about the longer-term  consequences  of a strong yen on the economy eventually  came to weigh on Japanese  equity prices and intensified pressures on the Bank of  Japan to take unusual  easing measures,  such as not sterilizing  foreign exchange intervention  or adopting a quantitative  goal for reserve growth.  To  date, the Bank of  Japan has not changed operations,  but long-term rates fell in Japan  as market participants  seemed to push expectations  of eventual policy tightening  further into the  future.  Nonetheless,  the dollar's value  fell 6 percent  against the yen.  In Europe, signs of stronger growth in spending prompted talk of  policy tightening by the European Central Bank and was associated with increases  in bond yields of around 40 basis points over the intermeeting  period.  On net, the dollar depreciated  1-1/2 percent against the euro.  Catching  market participants  unawares, the Bank of England tightened policy, hiking its repurchase  rate 1/4 percentage  point, to 51/4 percent, citing, among  other factors,  concerns  about the implications  of  rising  property prices;  over the intermeeting period, longer-term  U.K. interest rates rose about  60 basis points, share prices  lost 9 percent,  and the pound appreciated  3 percent against the  dollar. There was no intervention by U.S.  monetary authorities  over the intermeeting period
