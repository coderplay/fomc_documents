- (2) The foreign  exchange value  of the dollar has  appreciated  1  1/2 percent on net against a basket of major currencies  over the intermeeting period; a gain of around 2 percent against the euro was offset only partially by a  1/2 percent depreciation  against the Japanese yen.  European interest rates  changed  little relative  to U.S. interest rates,  even though the European  Central Bank firmed policy  1/4  percentage  point on August 31. Still,  over most of the period, the dollar steadily gained ground  on the euro,  reportedly supported  by capital flows favoring  U.S. assets  and conflicting statements  from European  officials regarding their attitude toward  a weak euro.  The slide in the euro  over the intermeeting period cumulated  to about 5 /2 1 percent  by September 20, but it was rolled back some on September  22 by intervention  in the exchange  market that day, initiated by the ECB and joined by the U.S. monetary  authorities  and the central banks  ofJapan, the United Kingdom, and Canada.
