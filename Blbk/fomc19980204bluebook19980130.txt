participants  currently rate  the  odds  for  a policy  easing  at  the February  FOMC  meeting  as  slim at  most, but  consider  the  probability  of a small  easing  by  midyear to  be  somewhat  higher.

- (3) Since  the  December  FOMC  meeting,  the dollar has  continued  to  appreciate against  the currencies  of emerging  market  economies  in  Asia. The  dollar  rose  a  further  6 percent  against  the  won  over  the  intermeeting  period,  but has  been little  changed  since  early January. The factors  that have  helped to  stabilize the  situation  in Korea  include  Presidentelect  Kim Dae-jung's public  support  of strong adjustment  measures  and material  progress  in resolving  the  short-term liquidity  problems  of Korean  financial  institutions. The Indonesian rupiah  fell  46  percent  against  the  dollar over  the  intermeeting  period  on concerns  about  the government's commitment  to  economic reform  and  about  longer-term  political  stability. The weakness  in the rupiah led  to  downward  pressures  on  other  regional  currencies. The Malaysian ringgit  and Thai  baht  fell  8  percent  and  11  percent,  respectively,  vis-a-vis  the dollar  over  the  intermeeting  period. Equity markets  rallied  in those  countries  whose currencies  had  fallen  the most,  apparently  as  some  investors  felt that both equity  prices  and currencies  had  dropped  far  enough to  warrant  taking  a chance  on  companies  with  strong export  potential.
- (4) On balance,  the  exchange  value  of the dollar  against the  currencies  of most industrialized  countries  was  up somewhat  over the intermeeting  period. European  currencies were  affected  by  growing  market  realization  of the  adverse  impact  of the Asian crisis  on European economies. The dollar gained  around  2  percent  against  the  Canadian  dollar,

. To counter the associated  decline  in  the  Monetary  Conditions  Index,  the  Bank  of Canada  raised  short-term

rates  50 basis  points. The  one  major  exception  was  the yen, which  appreciated 3 percent against  the  dollar  on balance,  as the prospects  for  additional  fiscal  stimulus,  along  with somewhat  greater stability  in  the  region,  appeared  to support the yen.

. The Desk  did not intervene  in the foreign exchange  market  during  the period.

- (5) Growth of the  broad  monetary  aggregates finished  1997  on  a strong note  and that  tone has  been  sustained  into the new year. M2  expanded  at  a 6  percent pace  in the fourth  quarter  last  year,  boosting  its growth  over  the four  quarters  of 1997  to just  above  the upper  end  of its  annual  range. 2 The velocity  of M2 fell  in the fourth  quarter  of  1997  for the second time in as  many quarters,  retracing  a  small portion  of its  upward  drift over  the period since  mid-1994. M2  growth in January  is now projected  at 7 1/2 ercent,  well above  the staffs p projection  at the  December  FOMC meeting. Much of this strength in M2 has  likely been associated  with recent  gains  in nominal income. In addition,  M2  has  been boosted  by a pickup  of mortgage  refinancing  and,  perhaps,  some substitution  away  from market instruments whose  yields  have  declined  relative  to  those  on M2  assets. 3 M3  also  accelerated  in  the  last quarter  of  1997,  and  its  growth  over  the year--at  8  1/4 rcent--came  in  well above  the upper pe end of its  annual  range. M3  growth in January--now  projected  at  10 1/2  ercent--also  exceeded p the staff projection  in  December  and  was  propelled  by  the  strength  in M2,  a sharp jump  in RP

financing  y a  few  banks,  and  continued olid  xpansion n  bank credit.  usiness oan b s e i B l growth  at  banks  remained  brisk  n  December and  January;  he  strength  as related  o i t w t financing  eeds  associated  ith  a  spate f  merger  activity   recent  onths and  perhaps ising n w o in m r business nventories. i

- (6) Total  domestic onfinancial  ebt  advanced  at  about  a  5  percent ace  in n d p December,  putting  ts  stimated  nnual  growth  over  1997 at  about  4-1/2 cent--well thin he i e a per wi t 3 to  7 percent  nnual ange  for he  debt  aggregate. ederal ebt  growth  stayed ow and a r t F d l nonfederal  ebt  growth  apparently  emained  elevated  n ecember, bolstered  y  strong d r i D b business orrowing.
