MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) With the probability of imminent war having increased, investors apparently shifted away from some aspects of risk taking, intensifying downward pressure on equity prices and interest rates over the intermeeting period.  The fall in stock prices, which cumulated to about 3 percent for broad indexes, was amplified by lackluster earnings reports and disappointing data on auto sales, labor markets, and consumer confidence.  Financial markets were quite sensitive to shifting perceptions of the likelihood of war.  For instance, just today equity prices rallied sharply and bond yields rose markedly, on news of a possible delay in a new U.N. resolution on Iraq.  On net, market participants seemed to interpret developments over the intermeeting period as suggesting that the onset of vigorous economic growth would be a little more delayed than previously expected.  The term structure of money market futures rates tilted down, as investors appear to have once again put off the time at which policy is expected to begin tightening, shifting the date from midsummer to late in the year, and reducing the expected amount of tightening by the middle of next year by 35 basis points.   (Additional detail about policy expectations is 1 provided in the box on the next page.)

Monetary Policy Expectations

Money market futures suggest that investors have trimmed their expected path of the federal funds rate as much as 3/8 percentage point over the intermeeting period (Chart 1).  As for the upcoming FOMC meeting, the April federal funds futures contract is now trading about 8 basis points below the FOMC's intended rate of 1-1/4 percent, consistent with a one-in-three chance of a 1/4 percentage point easing on March 18.  Market chatter seems to put the odds of action lower than this, suggesting that the futures rate embodies some possibility of a 1/2 percentage point move.  Analysts are increasingly of the view that at this meeting the Committee will shift its assessment of the risks to its objectives from balanced to tilted toward economic weakness.

According to options prices, the implied probability distribution for the funds rate six months hence has become more skewed to the downside.  Indeed, about 8 percent of the probability mass now rests at levels of the federal funds rate at or below 50 basis points.

- (2) Treasury coupon yields dropped 10 to 30 basis points over the intermeeting period, on net, pulled down by lower policy rate expectations and perhaps by enhanced investor demands for safety (Chart 2).  Much of these declines were accounted for by lower forward rates at the two- to seven-year maturities, consistent with the view that the level of economic activity would be on a lower track for some time.   Indexed-debt yields declined by more than those on their nominal counterparts, implying an edging higher of implied inflation compensation.  Survey measures of longer-term inflation expectations, in contrast, held steady.
- (3) Despite the evident jitters about the possibility of war and increasing concerns about economic fundamentals, declines in rates on investment-grade private instruments somewhat exceeded those on comparable-maturity Treasuries.  Risk spreads for lower tier instruments were about unchanged at high levels, and measures of implied volatility in stock and bond markets remained elevated.  The term structure

of implied volatilities calculated from options on swap forwards suggest that much of that uncertainty pertains to the near-term outlook:  Further out this term structure, those measures of volatility decline sharply.  The reduction in stock prices and yields on fixed-income securities were accompanied by considerable flows out of equity mutual funds and into government and, especially, other bond mutual funds (Chart 3). Falling equity prices and interest rates further widened the spread between the forward earnings-price ratio and the real longer-term Treasury yield, a measure of the equity premium, to levels of the early 1990s.

- (4) After moving mostly sideways on balance against the major foreign currencies for the first part of the intermeeting period, the dollar has fluctuated in a wide range in recent days.  On net, the foreign exchange value of the dollar has slipped 1 percent against a basket of major foreign currencies, losing 3-1/4 percent against the Canadian dollar and edging lower against the euro and the yen.  Share prices have declined substantially in the major foreign markets, reaching multi-year lows in Japan and Europe before rebounding somewhat at the end of the period. Consistent with a global shift toward fixed-income assets, yields on long-term government securities also were down on net, although the declines were smaller abroad than in the United States. Additional signs of economic weakness in key euroarea countries - especially Germany - prompted the ECB to cut its key policy rates 25 basis points on March 6.  Policy actions to counter downward pressures on activity were also taken in the United Kingdom and Switzerland.  The Bank of England lowered its repo rate 25 basis points in early February, and the Swiss National Bank in early March cut further its already very low range for policy rates to counteract the deflationary effects of Swiss franc strength.  In contrast, the Bank of Canada raised its target for the overnight rate by 25 basis points earlier this month to blunt inflationary pressures.  In Japan, the announcement that Toshihiko Fukui will become the next

- (5) The dollar was about unchanged over the intermeeting period against an index of the currencies of our other important trading partners.  The dollar rose about 6 percent against the Korean won, while Korean stocks declined more than 11 percent, largely in reaction to rising tensions in that part of the world.  The Mexican central bank sought to bring inflation down with another round of tightening in early February, but uncertainties about the strength of the U.S. economic recovery weighed on the peso at times during the period.  On balance, though, the exchange value of the peso firmed about 1 percent against the dollar.  Brazilian financial markets continued to improve, even as the Brazilian central bank tightened policy another notch in February by raising its target overnight interest rate 1 percentage point.  The real strengthened about 5-1/2 percent, and the spread over Treasury yields of Brazilian sovereign debt issued in dollars (Brazil's EMBI+ spread) narrowed about 320 basis points during the period.
- (6) The pace of business borrowing receded in February from the brisker pace of January, but remained somewhat above that of the fourth quarter (Chart 4). Business borrowing continued to be concentrated in bond financing, as firms exploited the historically low level of longer-term interest rates by paying down outstanding short-term debt with the proceeds of bond issuance.  Household debt growth continued to be dominated by heavy mortgage borrowing.  Growth of

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

consumer credit, after stalling in the fourth quarter, jumped at banks in January and February, in part owing to tax refund anticipation loans.  The pace of federal borrowing picked up in the first quarter, and federal debt outstanding reached its statutory limit in mid-February.  However, the Treasury has been able to use accounting devices to allow its regular auctions to go forward.  Although down from the high level of late last year, issuance of state and local bonds has remained strong this year.  Backward-looking measures of corporate asset quality-bond default rates and C&amp;I loan delinquency rates-are showing signs of stabilization or even some improvement.  With equity prices in a downdraft, gross equity issuance has remained subdued and net issuance negative.

- (7) M2 growth was exceptionally strong in February, owing mainly to robust inflows to liquid deposits.  Rapid money growth appeared to reflect earlier tax refunds (owing to greater use of electronic filing) and hefty mortgage prepayments as record low interest rates spurred refinancing activity.  Money growth may also have benefitted from the ongoing retreat from equity markets.  The expansion of liquid deposits additionally reflected shifts from other components of M2, including retail money funds-whose yields have fallen to about the same level as MMDA rates-and small time deposits.  The ample availability of low-cost deposit funds over the past year has facilitated wide net interest margins at commercial banks, to the benefit of their profitability, the subject of the box on the next page.

Bank Profitability in 2002

Banks' returns on assets and equity both moved up smartly last year, the former to a threedecade high.  A major contributor to the rise in profitability was a large drop in noninterest expense, an important part of which appears to be attributable to a regulatory change that eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill unless it is impaired.  A low level of bank mergers last year also likely held down noninterest expense.  Salaries and benefits, however, which had been falling for several years as a share of revenue, edged up in 2002.  Profitability also benefitted considerably from a large widening of interest rate spreads, which in turn importantly reflected a surge in low-cost transaction and savings deposits as investors responded to the very low opportunity cost of holding liquid assets and adverse developments in equity markets.  In addition, falling longer-term interest rates allowed banks to realize sizable capital gains on securities holdings for the second consecutive year in 2002. Finally, loan-loss provisioning, which had risen sharply in 2000 and 2001, held steady last year, albeit at twice the pace of the mid-1990s.

Although banks began last year with very comfortable capital levels, they chose to boost them further by retaining income at somewhat above the pace of the preceding two years. The rise in risk-based capital measures was particularly large, reflecting the shift in banks' portfolios away from full risk-weight business loans toward lower risk-weight residential mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.  With the cushion of additional capital, commercial banks appear relatively resilient going forward.

Policy Alternatives

- (8) The broad contours of the staff forecast remain similar to those of the January Greenbook, with moderate growth of activity giving way to robust expansion in the second half of this year.  However, recently some sour economic releases-particularly indicators of labor market conditions and consumer sentiment-and lower equity prices and higher oil prices in the baseline forecast have led the staff to write down somewhat weaker growth of real GDP this year and next as well as a higher unemployment rate at the end of the Greenbook forecast interval. Partly as a result, this forecast assumes that the intended federal funds rate will hold at 1-1/4 percent throughout the forecast period, rather than turning upward in the second half of 2004 as in the prior Greenbook.  As was true in the January Greenbook, the current forecast does not embody a specific scenario for resolution of the conflict with Iraq.  Rather, the forecast is premised on financial assumptions that are guided by current market quotes that appear to be consistent with a high likelihood of a relatively short and successful war but that also encompass a range of potential resolutions of that conflict.  This is most evident for oil prices, which the staff assumes will fall substantially in coming quarters in line with the current configuration of oil price futures.  Equity prices are assumed to increase from their current level over the forecast period at a rate that provides investors with a risk-adjusted return comparable to that on longer-term bonds.  Corporate bond yields are pulled lower over the forecast period as a gradual improvement in the economic outlook and a partial lifting of uncertainty spur a narrowing in risk spreads.  With these assumptions, GDP growth, after running below that of potential over the first half of this year, begins to pick up smartly as falling oil prices, improving sentiment, accommodative monetary policy, and tax cuts provide a lift to household and business spending.  However, even with an acceleration in GDP in 2004 to a 4-1/2 percent pace, output at the end of the forecast

period remains about 3/4 percent below the staff's estimate of potential GDP and the unemployment rate is 5-1/2 percent, about 1/2 percentage point above its estimated natural rate.  The persistent slack in resource usage is large enough to offset the effect on core inflation of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar; core PCE prices are projected to rise about 1-1/4 and 1 percent in 2003 and 2004, respectively.

- (9) If the Committee remains of the view that the current setting of the federal funds rate likely would provide enough stimulus to redress the existing amount of resource slack over time while maintaining low inflation, it may wish to keep the target rate unchanged .  To be sure, global tensions have escalated in recent weeks, and the uncertainties associated with developments in Iraq and the attendant rise in oil prices seem to be weighing heavily on financial markets and restraining economic activity.  But the Committee may believe that a significant portion of these fundamental uncertainties will be resolved before long and-as was the case following the onset of the Gulf War in 1991-lead to a notable improvement in financial market conditions (Chart 5).  Moreover, although many observers have worried that higher oil prices may continue to depress spending, as discussed in the Greenbook, it is persistent increases in oil prices that have materially adverse implications for activity.  In fact, futures and options data suggest that market participants do not expect the currently elevated level and uncertainty about oil prices to persist (Chart 6).  Moreover, while the nominal price of oil has approached historical highs, the recent spike does not appear outsized in real terms.  Even if the Committee is concerned that the pace of economic growth could remain subpar once some of the current uncertainties have been resolved, it still may see a considerable advantage to deferring policy action at this time in order to await more information about geopolitical developments.  Indeed, inaction at this meeting might seem especially attractive if the Committee wants to preserve the option of easing forcefully if events turn unexpectedly adverse in coming weeks.

Moreover, in the current environment, the response of the economy to policy action at this meeting might be viewed as quite uncertain, and models of optimal monetary policy under uncertainty would counsel gradualism in adjusting policy.

- (10) If the Committee viewed the range of possible outcomes for the economy over the foreseeable future as fairly symmetric around its forecast, it might also choose to retain a balanced risks assessment at this meeting.  While some economic data have proved disappointing of late, a successful prosecution of a war in Iraq could trigger a substantial rally in equity markets and prompt a sharp rebound in confidence, suggesting that upside risks may be significant.  The Committee might also favor a neutral balance of risks if it regarded the risks as unusually difficult to assess and subject to rapid change.  If, instead, the Committee judges that the distribution of possible outcomes for economic activity is appreciably skewed toward more downbeat scenarios, it might be inclined to shift the balance of risks toward economic weakness , although it may be concerned that markets could see such a decision as a signal of more conviction about the outlook than it actually has.
- (11) Because current futures quotes put some odds on an easing at this meeting, a decision to leave the target rate unchanged and the risk assessment balanced would likely prompt an increase in market yields and a corresponding downtick in stock prices.  However, in light of the unusual geopolitical aspect to the uncertainties about the near-term outlook and the prospect that they may be partly resolved sometime soon, market participants are not likely to extrapolate this monetary policy combination very far forward in revising their expectations, which would work to mute the likely market reaction.  In principle, keeping policy unchanged but shifting the balance of risks toward economic weakness would come closer to matching current market expectations, and their heightened expectation of more imminent easing would tend to offset disappointment about the lack of immediate action.  In practice, though,

market participants may infer from the Committee's decision to alter the risks assessment that the economic outlook was bleaker than previously expected, pulling bond yields and stock prices lower.

(12) The Committee might interpret some of the recent data, particularly the February employment report, as pointing to a weaker trend in economic activity than it previously thought-and one that might well persist even if global tensions were to diminish markedly in the weeks ahead.  Against this backdrop, the Committee might conclude that a policy easing at this meeting is appropriate.  Indeed, the current setting of the real federal funds rate no longer lies below the lower bound of the range of staff estimates of equilibrium real rates (Chart 7).  As a result, members might conclude that a cut in the nominal funds rate would be necessary just to maintain the effective stance of policy established at the November meeting.  The Committee might consider a quarter-point policy easing as a measured response to a projected shortfall of economic growth below that of potential this year.  However, the Committee might instead favor a more aggressive half-point policy easing if the possibility of especially adverse shocks and the constraints on policy posed by the zero bound to nominal interest rates loomed large in its thinking.  The apparent stability of inflation expectations in the face of higher oil prices and a weaker dollar along with the Greenbook projection for further declines in core inflation from already low levels might be viewed as arguing for the more aggressive policy action, inasmuch as its potential cost in terms of higher risks of inflation pressures would appear to be minimal.  Indeed, the Committee might even welcome a small uptick in projected inflation.  Moreover, the market response to a successful prosecution of war in Iraq is not entirely clear.  In contrast to the experience around the Gulf War in 1991, concerns about geopolitical tensions may not be punctured by decisive military victory, as

questions could still linger about the formulation of a new government in Iraq, the prospect for terrorist acts, and the situation in other trouble spots.

- (13) As noted, market prices can be interpreted as incorporating some odds on a policy move at this meeting, but a quarter-point easing is far from fully priced in. As a result, either a quarter-point or half-point easing at this meeting would have a substantial element of surprise.  Bond and stock prices would tend to climb in either case, but the market reaction could be significantly influenced by the choice of the balance-of-risks assessment and the wording of the announcement.  A balanced risks assessment would likely be taken by market participants as a sign that the FOMC would be reluctant to ease more anytime soon, while a balance of risks tilted toward economic weakness would lead them to place higher odds on further policy easings.
- (14) Under the Greenbook assumptions, growth of domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to run at about a 7 percent pace this year and next.  In the business sector, the projected recovery in investment spending is associated with a notable increase in the financing gap, which in turn, leads to an upturn in business borrowing. With credit spreads contracting, the forecast anticipates that much of this increased demand for financing will be met by firms tapping capital markets.  Businesses are projected to continue to rely heavily on the bond market, while commercial paper and bank loans, after running off sharply over the past two years, are expected to be about unchanged this year and register a modest advance in 2004.  A gradual relaxation in bank terms and standards may well also to contribute to the projected rise in business loans.  In contrast, households should rein in the growth of mortgage debt in response to the assumed leveling off of mortgage rates, which reduces the incentives for cashout refinancings.  The expansion of consumer credit probably will dip this year, largely reflecting a moderation in the pace of spending on motor vehicles.  Federal borrowing is expected to rise over the forecast period, propelled by rising military expenditures

and by tax cuts that trim receipts.  State and local debt growth is forecasted to taper off, with state and local governments anticipated to scale back advance refunding issuance and also to take steps to restore balanced budgets.  The staff projects M2 to advance at a 6-1/2 percent pace this year-somewhat faster than nominal GDP growth. The anticipated decline in M2 velocity this year is attributable to the lagged effects of the policy easing last November and to a further boost to money growth from mortgage refinancing.
