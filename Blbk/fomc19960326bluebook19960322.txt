MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1)  Following the January 30-31 meeting, the Federal Reserve announced that it was easing money market conditions a  bit further; the discount rate was cut 1/4 percentage point to 5  percent and the federal funds rate was lowered a  like amount to 5-1/4 percent. The effective federal funds rate has averaged close to  that rate over the intermeeting period, but has shown a  bit more variation than usual around the intended rate, perhaps partly reflecting the effects of low levels of required operating balances stemming from the spread of sweep programs.

(2)  The easing move had been  mostly anticipated, and shortterm market rates dropped slightly in  its wake, while long-term rates were about unchanged. Since then, most rates have moved higher, and by  substantial amounts, as incoming data have contradicted market expectations that the economy would be quite soft for a  time and  monetary policy consequently would be eased further. Rates on federal funds futures contracts, which in  late January suggested a  high probability of  further ease not only at the  January meeting but thereafter as well, are now  essentially flat through the summer (chart). Longer-term Treasury rates are up around 60 basis points over the intermeeting period, returning yields to their levels of late last summer. By  far, the largest increases in  forward one-year interest rates have occurred in the intermediate range, tending to support the

view that much of the rise in rates owed to  evidence of  unanticipated cyclical strength. Likely adding to the upward revision to expected future short-term rates was the dimming prospect for long-term deficit reduction. Given that both of  these factors would tend to boost real interest rates over time, and given little in  the way of surprising inflation news over the intermeeting period, it seems likely that the upward movement in  nominal interest rates primarily reflected a  rise in real rates. Despite the apparent increase in real interest rates, equity prices on  net are up considerably since the last meeting, after having moved more or less in concert with bond prices for more than a year. The recent disparate movements may reflect a  shift in investors' appetites for stocks or a more optimistic outlook for earnings-though professional stock analysts have been trimming their profit forecasts of  late.

(3)  The dollar's weighted average foreign exchange value declined over the first part of  the intermeeting period, but has risen since late February, partly in  association with increases in  U.S. interest rates. On  balance, the dollar is down about 1 percent since the last meeting. From one perspective, the lack of  net dollar appreciation despite higher U.S. interest rates is not surprising, as ten-year bond rates in  major foreign countries other than Japan are up 40  to  65 basis points over the intermeeting period, roughly in  line with the increase in  U.S. rates. From another, however, the reasons for the rise in foreign interest rates are not entirely clear, since they appeared to respond unusually strongly to  movements in U.S interest rates after the March 8  employment report. To be sure, an improved economic outlook in a  few countries, notably excepting Germany, and growing doubts that the fiscal discipline associated with the budget goals currently in  the Maastricht treaty will ever be realized

may have contributed to rate  increases abroad.

The Desk did not intervene.

(4) Private credit flows continue at  a moderate pace,  but there are  some hints that  underlying demands  for credit  have slowed a bit. Bank lending has fallen off in February and March, even taking into  account  increased securitizations  of bank loans. Business  loans decelerated in February and declined in  early March despite a sharply reduced  pace of  corporate bond  issuance associated with the back-up  in long-term interest  rates. Although nonfinancial business borrowing in money and  capital markets  has  been supported by  financing requirements associated with  elevated merger and corporate  restructuring activity, credit needs to  bridge the  gap between internal  funds  and capital expenditures  are estimated to have become quite  small as  inventory investment has  declined. The  weakness in bank business  lending likely does  not  reflect  a reduced  availability of  credit. For  example, the Survey of Terms  of Bank Lending showed that spreads  on business  loans continued to narrow in early February. Consumer credit  growth remained fairly robust in January, but more recent bank data adjusted for securitizations  suggest that  consumer borrowing has  downshifted a bit. Bank Call  Report data from late  1995  show that delinquency rates on household  loans,  particularly credit cards,  have deteriorated further,  possibly restraining growth  of consumer debt  by damping both demand and  supply.

(5) Both  of the broad monetary aggregates have  strengthened in  recent months and have moved above their growth cones. To  some extent, the pickup in growth mirrors the decline in short-term interest  rates in  late  1995  and  early  1996. Money market mutual funds,

whose rates adjust with a  lag to market rates, have been particularly strong. M2 has been supported as well in  the past three months by an unusual surge in  demand deposits, which is only partly attributable to increases in  mortgage refinancings. The brisk advance in  M2  has come in  the face of strong inflows to stock and bond mutual funds, which appear to have paused only briefly in reaction to recent market volatility. 2 M2 is estimated to  have grown faster than nominal income in  the first quarter, extending the recent string of  velocity declines. As in  the previous few quarters, the growth of  M2  was somewhat faster than that predicted by  the standard money demand model.

(6) The surge in  demand deposits has pushed M1 growth well into positive territory in  March, its first monthly advance since July 1995. Currency growth also picked up in  March, to  an 8  percent pace, reportedly reflecting strong foreign demand associated with uncertainties in Taiwan and Russia.3 The introduction of  additional sweep programs, however, caused balances in  other checkable deposits to continue to contract. Adjusted for retail sweeps, M1 has expanded at an 8-3/4 percent rate since the fourth quarter, while the base has risen 5  percent.

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and  borrowing, are calculated by  prorating averages for two-week reserve maintenance periods that overlap months. Reserve figures for March incorporate assumptions of $1 billion for excess reserves and $50 million for adjustment and seasonal borrowing in  the maintenance periods ending March 27 and  April 10. Reserve data incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated with changes in reserve requirements.

Policy Alternatives

(7) Sorting through the estimated effects of  bad weather, government shutdowns, and strikes, the economic data released since the January FOMC meeting suggest that the economy is now  operating about where the staff had anticipated, albeit with a  little more final demand and correspondingly less inventory stocking. While longer-term interest rates have moved sharply higher in  recent weeks, the rise has been only a  little larger and sooner than had  been built into the last staff forecast. On  balance, financial conditions still seem conducive to  moderate expansion of  spending, and the staff forecast anticipates that output growth will settle around its potential rate over the next two years with the federal funds rate maintained at 5-1/4 percent. This pace of economic activity should keep the unemployment rate steady, in  the vicinity of 5-1/2 to  5-3/4 percent. With employment and production a  touch above their long-run potential levels, increases in  labor compensation and prices edge higher. The outcomes for real GDP growth and CPI inflation envisioned by  the staff for 1996 are at the high end of the central tendencies of  the forecasts provided by  Board members and Reserve Bank presidents at the time of the last meeting.

(8)  An  unchanged policy stance, as in  alternative B, would probably be preferred if  the Committee concurred with the staff's assessment of  the economy, viewed potential risks as about evenly balanced, and was willing to accept the possibility of  a  slight intensification of  price pressures. Of  course, this alternative might be even more attractive if  the Committee saw smaller odds of rising inflation, as it did in  January judging from the CPI forecasts submitted by  the members. Moreover, in light of  the unusual number of  temporary

disruptions and distortions to economic activity in  the last few months and the difficulties in  understanding the implications of  the recent movements of  stock and bond prices, a  pause might be favored to allow sufficient time to establish a  firmer bearing on the likely course of spending and inflation, even if  the Committee saw the risks to  the outlook as possibly tilted to one side or  the other.

(9)  With market participants apparently expecting no policy action over the next few  months, maintenance of  current reserve conditions, as under alternative B,  would elicit little reaction in credit markets. Capital market prices could remain volatile as  incoming information continues to be difficult to interpret in  the wake of  the winter's economic disruptions. Although the anticipated softening of many indicators in  March, such as payroll employment and industrial production, might boost markets for a  time, data consistent with the staff forecast would seem, on  balance, to imply little net change in longer-term yields. Market participants have largely discounted any chance of  a  multi-year budget agreement before the elections, so a renewal of  meaningful negotiations on  long-term deficit reduction has the potential to  raise bond and stock prices. Absent such a  development or unanticipated changes in policy abroad, the foreign exchange value of  the dollar probably would remain around its current level.

(10) Given the staff's assessment of  the economy, the 1/2 percentage point easing in reserve market conditions offered under alternative A  would boost the economy marginally further beyond its potential and tilt the inflation rate up a  bit more noticeably. With the latter outcome apparently inconsistent with the Committee's strategy for achieving its long-run goals, adopting alternative A would seem to  require that, relative to the staff, Committee members

expect somewhat weaker spending or better inflation. For example, policy relaxation might be seen as buying further insurance against the risk that the recent rise in bond yields would truncate the apparent strengthening in activity this year or as attaching weight to the possibility that the NAIRU is lower.

(11) In light of the uncertainty about the current economic situation and the widespread expectation that System policy is on hold, it is difficult to gauge how  market participants would react to the 1/2 percentage point of  policy ease envisioned under alternative A. It is safe to say that most of  the decline in  the federal funds rate would carry through to other shorter-term market rates. Market participants might read the action, coming on  the heels of 1/4 point moves at  two successive meetings, as revealing the judgment of  policy makers either that the economy could work with a  thinner margin of unused capacity without higher inflation or  that aggregate demand is weaker than most analysts are now  expecting. With market participants particularly uncertain about the economy, they  might give the Committee the benefit of the doubt, at least for a  while, and infer from the policy action that the economic situation had changed. In that circumstance, intermediateand long-term rates could fall significantly. Alternatively, this policy easing might be seen to reflect a  misreading of the economic situation or evidence that the Committee was willing to tolerate upside risks to inflation in  the interest of stimulating growth for a  time. Should this interpretation predominate, inflation expectations would rise; although real interest rates probably would fall, the prices of debt instruments could come under downward pressure. Under all these scenarios, the foreign exchange value of

the dollar would weaken, and especially so if inflation expectations deteriorated.

(12) A  1/2 percentage point tightening in reserve conditions, as under alternative C,  might be favored if the Committee agreed with the staff forecast but viewed its outcome for inflation as undesirable, particularly if  the Committee wanted to make some progress toward price stability. Indeed, given that the economy is already operating at or beyond many estimates of  its potential, the Committee might see significant upside risks to  the inflation forecast. In  this regard, the recent behavior of asset prices and some financial aggregates could potentially be signalling inflationary pressures. Part of  the rise in bond yields might be associated with higher inflation expectations, and the gains in equity markets have the potential to provide excessive stimulus to spending. Moreover, the broad monetary aggregates have been growing rapidly of late, suggesting ample liquidity in  household balance sheets and readily available funds for depositories. Relative to the staff forecast, a  1/2 percentage point firming in  reserve conditions would take a  little pressure off resource markets, raising the odds that the inflation rate would not tend to drift higher.

(13) The 50  basis point tightening of  alternative C would catch market participants unawares and show through to instruments at the shortest maturities. The response further along the term structure of interest rates could also be substantial, as  the action would likely be interpreted as suggesting that the Federal Reserve saw considerable inflation risks. Even so, the rise in  longer-term rates likely would reflect a  significant real component and the dollar would tend to increase on  exchange markets and stock prices to  weaken.

(14) As shown in  the table below, over the next six  months the staff expects some rebound in  the growth of  nonfederal sector debt to around the pace of  earlier in  the year, but a modest slowing in broad money growth. In  the staff outlook, credit conditions are anticipated to remain favorable, although banks may adopt a  little additional caution, particularly with regard to their consumer lending. Consumer debt growth is expected to slow some, but should still be fairly robust, while the expansion of home mortgage debt stays near its recent pace. As long-term yields stabilize in  the staff forecast, bond offerings should pick up, in  part to  finance the ongoing wave of merger activity. Bank business lending is likely to recover, but, reflecting the lessened need to finance inventory accumulation, to a moderate growth pace. On  net, domestic nonfinancial sector debt should expand at a  5 percent annual rate over the March-to-September period, remaining comfortably within its 3-to-7 percent annual range.

(15) The waning impetus imparted by  past policy easings is expected to damp growth in the broad monetary aggregates relative to their recent rapid pace. Still, both M2 and M3 should expand faster than nominal income for the next two quarters. The staff is anticipating M2  to grow at a  5  percent rate from March to September, leaving the aggregate somewhat above its 1-to-5 percent annual range. With bank credit remaining sluggish, M3 is expected to  slow to a  5  percent rate over the next six months and thus edge back toward the upper end of its 2-to-6 percent annual range. The continued spread of  retail sweep programs is likely to pull down M1 further, although a  pickup in currency shipments abroad associated with the introduction of  the redesigned $100 bill next week should provide some offset in coming months. 4
