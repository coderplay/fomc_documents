the Japanese  economy released over the intermeeting period was mixed and  suggests,  on balance,  that recovery has  yet to gain a  firm  foothold in that country.  Longer-term  yields in Japan drifted higher, equity prices  stalled,  and the yen appreciated  about 1-1/2 percent against the dollar.  The strength of the yen prompted Japanese  authorities to intervene, purchasing  dollars on two occasions  and euros  once, but those actions  left no  lasting imprint on market prices.  A brightening of prospects in Latin America--highlighted  by Moody's upgrade of Mexican  foreign debt to investment grade--lent  support to the currencies  of emerging markets.  The dollar depreciated  more than 2-3/4 percent  against the Mexican peso and 3-1/4 percent vis-a-vis the Brazilian real, and sovereign  bond risk spreads narrowed considerably further.  Indeed, most Brady bond spreads have retreated to near levels last seen  around the time of Russia's default  in August  1998. U.S. monetary authorities  did not intervene  over the intermeeting period.
