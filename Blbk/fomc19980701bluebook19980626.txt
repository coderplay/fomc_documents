strength  of businesses. This possible  shift in  attitude  is also  consistent  with  the  performance of the  stock market  despite the  decline in  interest  rates: On balance,  major stock indexes have posted  mixed  changes since the last  FOMC  meeting. With the exception  of the  S&amp;P 500, which touched  a record  high on  June  26, most major indexes  have fallen  a few  percent from their peaks  reached  earlier this  year.

- (3) The dollar appreciated  significantly  in  the  early part  of the  intermeeting  period, led  by  an  8  percent rise  against the  yen. Evidence  of a  steep drop  in  economic  activity  in Japan and  a lack of confidence  that  government  policies  were  coming  to grips  with  the country's economic  and  financial  problems  were  the main  factors  behind  the  yen's weakness. The bellwether government  bond yield in  Japan  declined  to a record  low in  early  June on speculation  that  the Bank  of Japan might  reduce  its official  discount rate. After  reaching  an eight-year  low  against the  dollar of almost  147  on  June  15,  the  yen began to  firm  on rumors of imminent  intervention. On  Wednesday, June  17,  the  Desk purchased yen

for

$833  million for U.S.

accounts,  split evenly  between  the  Federal  Reserve  and  the Treasury. In  conjunction with  the intervention,  a statement  by Japanese  officials  noted their government's intention  to  consider further fiscal  stimulus  and to  act  quickly  to resolve  problems in  their banking  sector.

Immediately  after the intervention,  the  dollar  fell 4 percent  against  the yen and  1 percent against  the mark. Over the  last week,  however, the yen has  given up  all of its  gains against the  dollar  as  it became  clear  that  the Japanese  government  would not take  immediate  action and as  concerns  about  the  viability  of a number of major Japanese  banks mounted. The yen ended the  intermeeting  period  down 4  percent  against  the  dollar. Relative  to continental

European  currencies,  the  dollar has risen  only  modestly  on  net since  the  last FOMC  meeting, as  declines  in  long-term interest  rates  in  those countries  about matched  those on  comparable U.S.  instruments. In  contrast,  the  dollar fell  2  1/4 rcent  against  sterling,  which  was buoyed pe by  a  surprise  increase  of percentage point on June  4 in  the Bank of England's official  RP rate  and  by  subsequent  incoming  data that  fostered  expectations  of at  least one  more  rate increase  in  the near  term. On  net, the foreign  exchange  value  of the dollar relative  to major currencies  increased  more  than  2 percent  over  the intermeeting  period.

- (4) Declines  in the  exchange  value of the yen  put  added pressure  on financial markets  in  other Asian  economies. Prior to  the joint U.S.-Japanese  intervention,  Chinese officials  speculated  openly  about  the possibility  of abandoning  the renminbi's current  peg to the  dollar,  but following  the  intervention  and the yen's initial rebound,  they reiterated  their commitment  to their  current exchange  rate policy. The Indonesian  rupiah  has  depreciated  20 percent  against  the  dollar over  the intermeeting  period, pressured  by political  uncertainty. Despite  the  drop  in  the rupiah,  Indonesian  stock prices  rose 11 percent,  and  credit  spreads  on the  nation's sovereign  foreign  currency  debt  narrowed  a bit  over the  intermeeting  period. By contrast,  the currencies  of other  Asian economies  depreciated  slightly  on  average  relative  to the  dollar. However, these economies'  equity  markets  were  down  about 5  to 25 percent,  and credit  spreads  on their  dollar-denominated  sovereign  debts moved  up  30  to 110 basis  points.

Over f t di u s the  intermeeting riod s  a  whole, redit  preads n  dollar-denominated ssian  foreign pe a c s o Ru debts  increased 330 basis  oints. redit  isk  preads or atin merican sovereign  orrowers p C r s f L A b widened  90  to  140 basis  oints,  n balance,  ver  the  same period. p o o
