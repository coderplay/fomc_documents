MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) The Committee's decision at the last FOMC meeting to leave the intended federal funds rate unchanged at 5-1/4 percent was widely expected and prompted little response in  market interest rates. Following the release in early June of  the strong employment report for May, however, market yields resumed the uptrend that began this past February, increasing as  much as 30 basis points during the intermeeting period; in  recent days, though, that rise has been largely rolled back, as expectations of  System tightening ebbed, and on  balance most rates are up only 5 to 10 basis points (chart). Markets still seem to incorporate modest policy firming over the balance of  the year, as  is evident in the trajectory of  quotes on federal funds futures. Stock prices have generally fallen, with notable declines in the high-tech and small-capitalization sectors.

(2) The increases in interest rates since the last meeting bring the upward movement over the period since January 31, the day of

Although banks have continued to implement new retail sweep programs, required reserve balances have fallen only slightly over the intermeeting period, owing to a  surprising surge in demand deposits, while required clearing balances have edged up. These developments have left the sum  of  required reserve and required clearing balances about unchanged.

the Committee's last policy move, to about 7/8 to 1-1/4 percentage points at intermediate and long maturities; short-term rates, anchored by  the federal funds rate, rose considerably less. This pattern was reflected in substantial increases in one-year forward rates at all horizons. An  especially sharp bulge in  forward rates in  the threeyear area is consistent with the interpretation that the increase in yields was primarily a  response to signs of  cyclical strength in  the economy. Judging from the available survey data, long-term inflation expectations have deteriorated little, if at all, and thus the increase in  nominal long-term rates seems to represent primarily higher real interest rates. Shorter-term inflation expectations are flat to up slightly on  these survey measures since early in  the year, implying that the real federal funds rate since the last easing has held steady or fallen a  bit. At its current level, however, the real funds rate is only a  little below its level last June, because part of  the reduction in the nominal funds rate since then has been offset by  declines in short-term inflation expectations over the second half of last year.

(3) The dollar's weighted-average exchange value slipped about 3/4 percent over the intermeeting period. The dollar declined moderately against the German mark and other European currencies as accumulating signs of  a  pickup in economic growth in  Germany prompted a  reduction in expectations of  any further easing of  German monetary policy. Ten-year government bond yields in  Germany rose 20 basis points over the intermeeting period. The dollar firmed 2-3/4 percent against the yen, despite the  much larger-than-expected gain in firstquarter Japanese GDP. Various statements by  Japanese officials indicated that Japanese monetary policy would not be tightened until the recovery proved self-sustaining; as a  result, Japanese bond yields

declined slightly, on  balance, over the  period.

; the Desk did not intervene. Since the  end of January  the dollar has  risen  1/2  percent on balance, placing it  in the middle of its  range of fluctuations over nearly a decade.

- (4) Domestic  nonfinancial sector debt  has  decelerated in the past few months, bringing this  measure to just  below the middle of  its 3 to  7 percent  annual  range. Federal  debt  growth has  been particularly  damped over the second  quarter, owing mainly to unexpectedly strong tax receipts. Nonfederal borrowing also is  estimated to have edged down. Consumer  credit growth appears  to be  slowing, although it continues to outpace income. Home mortgage borrowing to date, however,  has been well maintained  and has yet to  show any perceptible response to  the  rise  in mortgage  interest rates. Business  borrowing was  slower in the  second  quarter, as  merger  activity and associated share retirements dropped substantially. In  general, funding for both households and businesses  appears to  remain readily available. Spreads on  junk and investment-grade bonds and mortgage-backed securities have stayed narrow. Terms on bank loans  are generally attractive,  and banks  seem to be tightening standards  only  selectively, mainly for credit cards. Equity markets also have been highly receptive, at  least until very recently, and  equity issuance--especially through initial  public offerings--has been robust  over  the quarter, holding down credit needs.

(5) The broad monetary aggregates remained weak in May following relatively  slow  growth in April,  apparently  reflecting the

drawdown of  balances to  meet unusually large individual tax  liabilities. Preliminary data, however, suggest that both M2 and M3 have rebounded in  June to annual rates of about 5-1/2 and 6 percent, respectively. The pickup was spread widely across the components of these aggregates, including M1. The latter has registered a  small upturn following two months of  decline, as currency has accelerated 2 and demand deposits have shown surprising strength. Among the non-M1 components of  M2  and M3, money market mutual funds have been particularly robust.

(6) From  the fourth quarter of 1995 through June, M2  has grown at a  4-3/4 percent annual rate, leaving it just below the upper end of  its 1  to 5 percent annual range. M3 has increased at a 6-1/4 percent rate over this period, placing it a  bit above its 2  to 6 percent range. M2 growth so far this year has been quite close to the staff forecast prepared in advance of  the January meeting. Nominal GDP growth over the first two quarters of  the year, however, appears to have been a  bit stronger than expected last January. As a  consequence, the velocity of  M2 has been a  little higher than projected, declining only slightly rather than falling at a  3/4 percent annual rate. This firmer velocity has likely reflected the depressing effects on  money demand of unusually sluggish upward adjustment of deposit interest rates as well as of  higher expected yields on market instruments. Consistent with this interpretation, flows into stock

mutual funds were very heavy in  the first half of  the year and noncompetitive tenders at  Treasury bill and note auctions have picked up as well. 4 In contrast to M2 expansion, the growth of  M3 has been stronger than expected over the first half. While the increase in bank credit was significantly slower than projected, in part owing to downward revaluations of investment portfolios, banks have substantially reduced their reliance on  nondeposit funding this year, probably in response to  the elimination of  deposit insurance premiums last fall.

MONEY, CREDIT, AND RESERVE AGGREGATES

NOTE: Monthly reserve measures, including excess reserves and borrowing, are calculated by  prorating averages for  two-week reserve maintenance periods that overlap months. Reserve data incorporate adjustments for discontinuities associated with changes in reserve requirements. Reserve figures for June assume adjustment and seasonal borrowing of $225 million and excess reserves of $1 billion in  the maintenance period ending July 3.

Long-Run Scenarios

(7) This section examines the  monetary policies needed to achieve alternative objectives for inflation over the long run. Specifically, the first set of scenarios compares two approaches for maintaining inflation around the rate forecast to prevail at  the end of  the Greenbook projection period. The second set of scenarios addresses issues related to achieving effective price stability over the next five years or so.

(8) The new  staff econometric model of the U.S. economy (FRB/US) was used to extend the  baseline forecast beyond the  Greenbook horizon and to derive the effects of alternative policies.5 One of the distinguishing characteristics of  the new  model is the process of expectations formations. Participants in  labor, product, and financial markets use the information at their disposal to  make projections of  future events in  a  much more complex fashion than in  the staff's previous large-scale model (the  MPS model), in  which expectations were adaptive and not distinguished from other sources of sluggish adjustment. For the purposes of  the exercises in  this section, the manner of  forming inflation expectations is especially important: Participants use historical relationships among interest rates, prices and output along with a  notion of  where inflation will be in  the distant future to forecast a  path for prices and the economy; long-run inflation expectations in turn can depend on  actual inflation, but the model also allows them to  be influenced by  announced objectives of  the monetary authority. Aside from  the contributions of expectations,

wage and price adjustments are influenced by labor and product market frictions, imparting real effects even to anticipated policy actions.

(9)  The simulations share a  common NAIRU of around 5-3/4 percent. The sacrifice ratio varies, however, depending on  the elements influencing long-term inflation expectations. For the model relationships embodied in Chart 2,  which do  not have monetary policy credibility effects, the sacrifice ratio is 2-1/2--that is, reducing inflation by 1  percentage point would require unemployment to exceed the NAIRU by 1  percentage point for 2-1/2 years. By  assumption, fiscal policy in all the scenarios moves slightly in a  stimulative direction over the extended forecast period, as indexed by  a  rise in  the NIPA Federal government current account deficit in  the steady inflation cases to 2-1/2 percent of  GDP from 1-3/4 percent in  1997. The model's implied equilibrium real funds rate stays close to 2-3/4 percent, with the effects of  mild fiscal stimulus offset by  the influence of  an assumed steady real dollar on  the foreign side, which, with the relatively high income elasticities for U.S. imports, tends to induce faster growth of imports than exports.

(10) The baseline strategy, shown by  the solid line in Chart 2,  follows the Greenbook through 1997, by  which time inflation, as  measured by  the chain-weight PCE price index, is expected to  have edged up  to nearly a  3  percent rate (from 2.2 percent in 1995). With the nominal federal funds rate fixed and inflation rising, real shortterm interest rates fall over 1997 and  would continue that downward course absent a  tightening of  monetary policy. But the disequilibrium is not large, and a  50 basis point increase in  the federal funds rate in  early 1998 raises real shortand long-term rates by enough to induce an  increase in  the unemployment rate to its natural level in 1999, flattening out the path of inflation. Under the alternative

near-term tightening strategy, the Committee begins to tighten sooner, following a  Taylor rule adjusted to embody the 2-3/4 percent equilibrium real interest rate implied by the simulations and a 3 percent target for the increases in  the PCE chain-weight index. Nominal and real rates begin to rise immediately, so  that the unemployment rate is higher in the near term than in  the Greenbook and inflation levels are a  little lower. Starting sooner also implies that both nominal and real interest rates do  not have to climb as high in  the middle years of  the simulation.

(11) Chart 3 considers policies aimed at  achieving effective price stability by reducing measured inflation to around 1  percent early in  the next decade. The  three scenarios illustrate the effects of  different processes by which the public's expectations of  inflation adjust to  this policy goal. In  the circumstances illustrated by the dotted line (low  credibility), perceptions of  the eventual inflation rate are formed by observing actual inflation, as  they were for Chart 2: Inflation expectations adjust down to 1 percent, but they do so slowly, and the central bank's target plays no role in this process except to discipline its actions and hence inflation outcomes. In this case, the funds rate needs to rise more than a  percentage point, and the  unemployment rate increases about a  percentage point, running at about 6-1/2 percent for a  while. The dashed line shows a  high credibility case in  which the public's expectation of  where inflation will be in  the long term is quickly lowered to the 1 percent objective established and presumably announced by the Federal Reserve. Owing primarily to frictions in labor and product markets, even with high credibility it  takes several years for inflation to move to 1 percent, and unemployment rises slightly above the natural rate. The sacrifice ratio is only about 1  and it  would be even lower

if  the disinflation process were stretched out further. The dot-dash line (earning credibility) gives an  intermediate case. Initially, the public forms expectations much as in  the scenario shown with the solid line. But the Federal Reserve earns increasing credibility for its 1 percent inflation target as actual inflation is reduced. As might be expected, cumulative output losses are below the two other cases. While these simulations illustrate the potentially powerful effects of inducing the public to reduce inflation expectations faster than  they would by  observing actual inflation outcomes, they provide no guidance on  how to accomplish this. As noted in  the report to the FOMC on "The Price Objective for Monetary Policy", empirical evidence of credibility effects of  announced inflation targets is difficult to find.

Long-Run Ranges

(12) The table below provides background for the Committee's discussion of  growth rate ranges for the  monetary and debt aggregates for 1996 and 1997. The staff baseline projections for money and debt are based on  the Greenbook forecast of  the economy. In terms of  the outlook for  money growth, the key elements in that forecast are the federal funds rate remaining at 5-1/4 percent through next year, longterm interest rates staying around current levels, and nominal GDP growing at a rate close to 4-1/2 percent over each of  the next six quarters.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

(13) M2  is projected to outrun nominal GDP slightly over the forecast period, leaving growth for 1996 at about 5  percent and at around that same pace next year.6 Interest rates on  small time deposits, which have been rising, are still unusually low  relative to market interest rates and should continue to move higher. If  the historical money demand relationship prevails, this edging lower of the opportunity cost of  M2 relative to short-term interest rates should work to reduce the velocity of  M2  a  little. In fact, the historical relationship between movements in  M2's opportunity cost and in  its velocity appears to  have reasserted itself in  recent years after having gone off track in  the early part of  this decade (chart 4  ). The staff's working assumption is that this relationship will continue to hold, though the increased availability of alternative financial instruments and the changes in  household balance sheets over the last decade suggest that considerable uncertainty remains about the characteristics of M2 demand.

(14) Unlike M2, M3 is seen as  moderating over the second half of  this year to a  little more than a  5  percent rate, bringing its growth over the four quarters of  the year down to 6  percent. Shifts of  funding from Eurodollar borrowing to large time deposits, which apparently had been encouraged in  part by  the removal of  the deposit insurance premiums for commercial banks last year, are expected to

ebb. In  addition, inflows to money market mutual funds, which had been boosted by the  drop in  short-term market rates resulting from policy easings in late 1995 and early 1996, should be moderate with short-term market rates about unchanged. Next year, M3 expansion is projected to strengthen from its second-half pace to a 6 percent rate, as  bank credit growth picks up.

(15) The growth of  the debt of  domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to  be 4-1/2 percent over both this year and next. The expansion of the debt of  nonfederal sectors over the next six quarters slows relative to the first half of 1996, along with nominal income. While equity is anticipated to be  retired at a  hefty pace, the corporate financing gap over the balance of 1996 and 1997 is expected to remain relatively low owing to restrained inventory investment and rising internal funds. The staff does not foresee any pullback in credit supplies to businesses, whose outlook for earnings and debt servicing seems favorable. In contrast, in light of rising delinquency rates on  consumer credit--especially the revolving component-households may  well face a  further tightening of  the availability of certain types of  consumer credit. This contributes to slowing growth of such credit in  coming quarters, but only a  little--most of  the deceleration reflects spending trends and rising repayments from  debt assumed earlier. Home mortgage debt expansion later this year and in 1997 should fall below the first-half pace as  the increases to date in mortgage rates exert more noticeable restraint. Debt of  the state and local government sector will continue to contract over the remainder of  this year and next owing to the large volume of  advance refunded bonds still scheduled to  be retired. Federal debt should grow  more

slowly this year  than last, but it is likely to  be picking up by  1997 because of projected increases in  the federal budget deficit.

(16) The money and credit projections for the "tighter" strategy are consistent with the alternative scenario presented in  the Greenbook Part I  in  which the federal funds rate is raised gradually, by  a  total of 100 basis points by  year-end, and maintained at that level through next year. The more restrictive policy damps nominal GDP growth by  about a  percentage point over the next six  quarters. The slower spending growth, together with the higher opportunity costs of  holding liquid money balances generated by sluggish upward adjustment of  rates on retail deposits, should hold M2 growth to 4-1/2 and 3  percent over this year and next, respectively. Much, but not all, of the slowdown in  M2 would show  through to M3; bank credit and associated funding needs would moderate only a  bit, leading banks to rely more heavily on  managed liabilities in  M3 to  make up for some of the shortfall in funding from  M2 sources. The expansion in  the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors would likely be retarded next year to  about the same extent as growth in  nominal spending, posting a  projected rate of  growth of  3-1/2 percent.

(17) The table on page 11 presents two alternatives for  money and credit ranges for 1996 and 1997. The Committee first selected the alternative I  growth rate ranges for 1996 of 1 to 5  percent for  M2, 2  to 6  percent for M3, and 3  to 7  percent for debt on a  provisional basis at  its meeting a  year ago, and it reaffirmed these ranges at its 9 meeting in late January of  this year. The debt range was reasonably well centered on  the likely outcomes for growth in  this measure under staff or Committee members' economic forecasts, and it remains

so unless policy tightens very substantially. When the Committee chose its 1996 M2 and M3 ranges in  July and January, however, it recognized that staff baseline projections of  these aggregates were in the neighborhood of  the upper ends of  these ranges. The Committee's rationale was to provide a  benchmark for secular growth of  the broader monetary aggregates that, in  the words of  the Federal Reserve Act, would be "commensurate with the economy's long run potential to increase production so as to promote effectively the goals of  maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates" under the assumption of  historically typical velocity behavior. The Monetary Policy Reports to the Congress after those meetings indicated that growth of  the broader aggregates might run near the upper ends of their ranges. A very similar situation confronts the Committee at this meeting, with the baseline staff forecast for M2 and M3 for both this year and next at  the 5 and 6 percent upper bounds of  their respective alternative I  ranges. The Committee may  wish to reaffirm the alternative I  ranges for 1996 under this rationale of providing longer-run benchmarks, and extend them to 1997. As another rationale for the alternative I  ranges, the Committee may foresee slower growth of  M2 and M3 than the staff projects, moving these aggregates comfortably within their ranges: For example, a  hike in short-term interest rates, to better ensure that inflation remains contained, such as in the tighter scenario, would tend to  depress the growth of  the broader aggregates, particularly next year given the usual lags.

(18) Alternative II raises the M2 and M3 ranges by 1  percentage point to align them  better with the  money growth likely to  prevail under the staff forecast and, judging by the central tendency of  the members' nominal GDP projections, the Committee's as  well. Even if

the Committee has no intention of  placing greater weight on  the aggregates, this alternative might be seen as closer to the spirit of  the Federal Reserve Act's requirement to report the "objectives and plans" for money and credit for  the current and, in July, the following calendar year, taking account of past and prospective developments in employment, prices, and other factors. One option might be  to center the ranges around expected monetary growth. To be sure the alternative II ranges are not high enough to accomplish this, but the Committee may find this feature acceptable if  it intends to pursue an  opportunistic strategy in  approaching its long-run objective of price stability. In this case, monetary policy would respond aggressively to upside surprises to nominal GDP or  inflation in  order to  hold the line against sustained increases in inflation, but would be  more tentative in resisting downward shocks to spending. Because increases in short-term interest rates or shortfalls in nominal GDP would therefore be  more likely to  be sizable than  movements in  the opposite direction, shortfalls of  money growth from  the staff forecast would tend to be  larger than overshoots.

Short-run Policy Alternatives

(19) Two policy alternatives are discussed below for consideration by  the Committee. Under alternative B, federal funds would continue to trade around 5-1/4 percent. The tighter option, alternative C,  would boost the funds rate to 5-1/2 percent, through either a 1/4 percentage point hike in the discount rate or a  slightly more restrictive provision of  nonborrowed reserves using open market operations.

(20) The unchanged reserves market conditions of alternative B  are assumed in the staff economic forecast. In that forecast, growth in output and employment slows in  the months ahead to a pace that is in  line with the rate of  increase in  the economy's potential. However, because the staff sees the economy as operating in level terms a  bit beyond its potential currently and over the forecast period, an  upward drift in inflation develops. Even so, the overshoot of output is quite small and the rise in  inflation consequently mild and gradual, suggesting that major policy adjustments would not be necessary to keep inflation from rising. Real bond yields have increased substantially in recent months and are now more in line with levels that in  the past appeared to have been consistent with holding inflation in check. The yield curve at present embodies only small odds of a  modest policy tightening over coming months, and further decreases in rates are likely to be quite minimal in  the near term if the  Committee chose to keep policy unchanged at this meeting. In these circumstances, even if  the Committee wished to  lean against the sorts of  incipient inflation pressures inherent in the staff forecast, it might be  able to  afford to  wait for more information to gauge whether those pressures were likely to develop and their extent.

(21) A  1/4 percentage point increase in  the federal funds rate, as  under alternative C,  might be  favored if  the Committee wished to impose greater restraint on spending to reduce the odds of  a gradual increase of  inflation pressures. Prompt action would help to counter the possibility of  an  impression developing, should data come in on  the strong side, that the Federal Reserve had become less willing to act anticipatively to forestall a  buildup of  inflationary pressures. A  single 1/4 point tightening, however, would likely not be adequate to contain inflation pressures if aggregate demand were stronger than in  the Greenbook or if  the recent favorable behavior of prices and costs were not to  persist. Even in  the staff forecast, a single 1/4 point move probably is not sufficient to induce a downward tilt to inflation. For example, the tighter alternative in  the Greenbook, in  which policy is sufficiently restrictive to  make noticeable progress toward price stability in 1997 and beyond, assumes that a  quarter point tightening at this meeting would be followed by considerable further firming later in the  year.

(22) A  25 basis point rise in  the federal funds rate at this meeting as under alternative C  would exceed the small amount currently built into money market yields. As a  consequence, interest rates probably would rise across the  maturity spectrum, and the exchange rate would tend to  firm. The extent of  the rise in intermediateand longer-term interest rates would depend on  whether the market saw this as the first in a  series of  firming actions. Some such extrapolation seems quite probable; market participants would reason that the  new direction for policy was unlikely to be limited to only a  1/4 percentage point increase, and might read the action as suggesting that the Federal Reserve saw  inflation pressures as relatively strong. The interest rate increase might be  more circumscribed if the tightening

were implemented through open market operations rather than by  raising the discount rate, and if  the announcement emphasized that the Federal Reserve itself saw  the action as a  limited adjustment reflecting, for example, a  view that the easing undertaken at the end of  January to gain greater assurance of satisfactory economic growth was no longer needed. In any case, the large backup in intermediateand long-term yields that was associated with the initial firming in 1994 is unlikely to be repeated: Nominal and real federal funds rates were much lower then, and the Federal Reserve's public posture at that time was that a  substantial policy adjustment was to be  expected. If  the Committee were to  tighten more aggressively, by 50 basis points, real rates would ratchet significantly higher, but the rise in  nominal longer-term rates might be limited by  the perception of  timely and decisive action to counter a  buildup in  inflationary pressures. There is some risk that market participants would read the action as signalling that the Federal Reserve was quite concerned that the economy had excessive momentum and was prepared to  tighten considerably further, prompting a  very substantial upward movement in  interest rates, especially in short and intermediate maturities, and in  the dollar.

(23) The money and credit flows associated with a  flat federal funds rate under alternative B  were discussed in  the previous sections of  this document under the baseline case. In sum, the staff would expect money and credit growth at or  below their rates in  the first half, keeping M2 and M3 near the upper ends of  their ranges and debt in the middle of its range. Money growth would be expected to slow somewhat more under alternative C,  putting the broad aggregates on  paths more likely to leave them below the upper ends of their longer-term ranges.

Directive Language

(24) Presented below for Committee consideration is  draft directive wording relating to  the Humphrey-Hawkins ranges for 1996 and 1997 and the operational paragraph for the intermeeting period.

Paragraph for 1996 and 1997 Ranges

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. In  furtherance of these objectives, the Committee REAFFIRMED at THIS [DEL: its] meeting  [DEL: anuary]  THE in  J RANGES IT  HAD established IN  JANUARY ranges for growth of  M2 and M3 of  1  to 5  percent and 2  to 6 percent respectively, measured from  the fourth quarter of 1995 to the fourth quarter of 1996. [IN FURTHERANCE OF THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMMITTEE AT  THIS MEETING RAISED/LOWERED THE RANGES IT HAD ESTABLISHED IN  JANUARY FOR GROWTH OF M2 AND  M3 TO  RANGES OF ___ TO ___ PERCENT AND ___ TO ___PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, MEASURED FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1995 TO  THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1996.] The monitoring range for growth of total domestic nonfinancial debt was MAINTAINED set at 3  to  7 percent (RAISED/LOWERED TO  ___ TO  ___ PERCENT) for the year. FOR 1997 THE COMMITTEE AGREED ON  TENTATIVE RANGES FOR  MONETARY GROWTH, MEASURED FROM  THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1996 TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1997, OF  ___  TO  ___  PERCENT FOR  M2  AND TO __  PERCENT FOR  M3. THE COMMITTEE PROVISIONALLY SET THE ASSOCIATED MONITORING RANGE FOR GROWTH OF TOTAL DOMESTIC NONFINANCIAL DEBT AT ___ TO  ___ PERCENT FOR 1997. The behavior of  the  monetary aggregates will continue to  be  evaluated in  the light of  progress toward price level stability,

movements in their velocities, and developments in  the economy and financial markets.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In  the implementation of policy for  the immediate future, the Committee seeks to  DECREASE SOMEWHAT/maintain/ INCREASE SOMEWHAT the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In  the context of  the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint WOULD/MIGHT or slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would/MIGHT be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in  M2 and M3 over coming months.
