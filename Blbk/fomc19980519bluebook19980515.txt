indications  of weak  economic  activity  in  Japan,  very  accommodative  monetary  conditions, and  considerable  declines  in short-  and  long-term  yields. Following the  release  of the  details of Japan's latest  fiscal  stimulus  package  on  April 9,  Japanese  authorities  sold  dollars  for yen on a massive  scale. The  effects  of the  intervention,  amounting  to  more  than  $20 billion  over two  days, were  short-lived;  the  dollar  immediately  depreciated  3  percent  but  recouped  these losses  within  ten  days.

- (4) Other  Asian  financial  markets  have  come  under renewed  pressure  after  two months of relative  calm. Although  Indonesian  and IMF  officials reached  an  agreement  that accelerated  reform  measures  and  allowed  for  a  resumption  of IMF  payments  in early  April, subsequent social unrest  has triggered  a  20 percent  fall  in the rupiah  against  the  dollar over the  intermeeting  period. Labor  unrest  in  Korea  has  also  emerged  as unemployment  continues to  rise  and  a  number  of chaebols  have announced  restructuring  plans  that  are  expected  to generate  significant  layoffs. With the exception  of the rupiah,  currencies  in the region  have been  relatively  stable  since  the  last FOMC meeting,  though  achieving  that  stability  has taken substantial  increases  in market  interest  rates  in  some  cases. Equity prices  in  emerging  Asian economies have  fallen  as much  as  25  percent  over the  intermeeting  period. Renewed difficulties  in  Asia  have  not prompted  substantial  declines  in the  prices  on financial  markets of emerging  economies  elsewhere,  although  spreads  on Latin  American  and Eastern  European debt have moved  a bit higher and their  equity  markets  are  generally  lower.
