- (3) Growth  of M2  in  July,  at  a 4-1/2  percent  rate,  remained  near the  moderate pace  of June. Data for early  August  suggest  a pickup  in M2  growth,  owing  particularly  to inflows to retail  money  funds,  which may  be related  to  the  recent jitters  in  the  stock market. From the  fourth  quarter  of last  year  through July, this  aggregate  expanded  at  a 5 percent  pace, a  shade faster  than  expected  at the  time  of the last  Committee  meeting. The velocity  of M2 edged  down  in the  second  quarter,  owing to a slight  narrowing  of opportunity  costs,  ending the sequence  of upticks  seen  over the previous  four quarters. 2 M3  growth  surged  to  a  10-3/4 percent rate  in July,  even though  adjusted  bank credit  growth  slowed;  issuance  of large time deposits  was  particularly  strong,  replacing  overseas  sources  of funding  at  foreign  banks  and  a runoff  of government  deposits  at  domestic  banks. Moreover,  institution-only  money  funds posted  another month  of rapid  growth,  as their yields  lagged the decline  in private  short-term interest  rates  and  they evidently  continued  to  substitute  for  in-house  cash management by businesses. From the fourth quarter  of 1996 through  July, M3  grew  at  a 7-1/2 percent  rate, substantially  faster  than the  staff had  anticipated.
- (4) Private  debt  growth  appears  to  have  slowed  a little  from  its brisk pace  earlier in the  year,  owing  largely  to  a  softening  in household  borrowing. Business  borrowing  has risen  in recent months,  reflecting  strength  in capital  spending. Financing  conditions  for the

business  ector  emain  quite avorable; deed, uality  preads n  junk onds  have  edged s r f in q s o b lower  recently, d in urvey  responses   sizable  raction   banks  reported    further  ecrease an s a f of a d in  loan  rate preads rom  already  arrow  levels. lthough  banks, n  balance,  ave  continued s f n A o h to  tighten  tandards  n consumer  credit, e roportion  oing  so  declined n he  most  recent s o th p d i t survey.  A high  level  f  tax  receipts abled he  Treasury o  pay  down  debt  in  May  and June, o en t t appreciably  lowing  the  growth  of  total  onfinancial bt.  From the  fourth  uarter f  last s n de q o year  through une,  domestic onfinancial bt  grew at  a  4-1/2 ercent nnual  rate,  ust  elow J n de p a j b the  middle  of  its  nnual ange. a r
