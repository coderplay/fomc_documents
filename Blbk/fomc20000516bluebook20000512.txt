lagging.  The bulk of the 2  percent appreciation  of the dollar  against the yen has  come  after the beginning of April, reflecting in part widening interest rate differentials. 4 Equity prices in foreign industrial  countries  have been about  flat to down 13  percent.  Yield  spreads  on emerging market debt have widened on balance, and the dollar has gained  1-1/2 percent relative  to the currencies  of other important  trading partners.

- (4) Growth of M2 in April increased  from its already  strong March pace,  as households evidently  built up liquid balances  to meet a higher-than-usual  level of nonwithheld tax payments (chart 2).  After tax payments  cleared,  the surge in M2 reversed, and consequently M2 growth is expected  to slow appreciably  in May.  Averaging  growth in April and that projected  for May,  M2 is estimated  to be advancing at around a  5-1/2 percent annual rate, about the same as over the previous two quarters.  This virtually unchanged pace  of expansion is  occurring in the face  of higher market interest rates  that have  reduced the  attractiveness  of M2  assets  and most likely reflects  continued  substantial gains in income. 5 In addition, the weakness  and volatility of stock prices  may have led  some investors to increase  their holdings  of  the  safe, liquid  assets  in M2. In contrast to the acceleration  in M2, M3  growth  slowed considerably  in April following a robust advance in

. U.S.  monetary authorities  have  not intervened.

5 In the  first quarter, the staff estimates  that M2 velocity rose at a  1-3/4 percent annual rate--the  third  consecutive quarterly increase,  coinciding with the current period of policy  tightening.
