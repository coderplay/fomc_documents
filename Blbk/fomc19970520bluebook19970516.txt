- (4) Growth  of the broad  monetary  aggregates  have  been strong  over the past two months,  exceeding  the  staffs  projection. Much of the  strength in M2,  particularly  in April, however,  seems  to have  reflected  a  temporary  buildup of liquid balances  by households  to make  outsized  tax payments. 1 Supporting this interpretation,  data for  late  April  and  early May show  a reversal  of the  M2  bulge  as tax payments  cleared. These  data,  together with rough  estimates  of the possible  effects  of the unusual  tax  payments  on money  holdings  in April,  suggest that  underlying  growth in M2  has  tapered  off from  its strong  pace  of earlier this  year. For the first  time this  year,  M2  dropped  below  the  5 percent  upper  end  of its annual  growth range in the  early  weeks  of May. The  rapid  growth  in  M3 in  March  and  April was  impelled  by its  M2  component  as  well  as  by large  time  deposits. M3  also  dropped sharply in  early  May--but  not by  enough  to bring  it  within  its growth  cone. The  strength in M3  in March  and  April was  associated  in part  with the  need  to fund  a brisk expansion  of bank credit. Banks  acquired  large  volumes  of securities  on balance  over  the two months, likely  as  temporary  outlets  for the  buildup  of tax-related  deposit balances,  and  business  and real estate  lending  remained robust.

- (5) Growth of  domestic onfinancial ctor ebt  so  far n  1997 has  been  somewhat n se d i slower  than n  1996,  mainly  owing to  the educed  pace  of  federal  orrowing.  In  March,  this i r b aggregate as a little  low  the  midpoint f  its  nnual  range.  Among w be o a private  orrowers, b consumer credit  rowth  slowed  in  March from  a  very  rapid ate arlier  he  quarter, d g r e int an bank data  for pril uggest odest  expansion n  such  debt  last  onth.

However, f y h u i this s ot  expected o  have  a  material  ffect  n  the  growth  of  spending.

However, in ecent eeks,  markets  appear o  have  removed all ut  modest  odds  of r w t b any action,  nd  the  choice f  alternative  should rigger  relatively  nor  decline  n  rates. a o B t a mi i As the  intermeeting riod rogresses, coming  evidence  confirming he  staff  orecast  f pe p in t f o markedly  slower  second-quarter owth  in  real DP  and  still-quiescent  lation  adings gr G inf re could  further  rode  expectations   policy irming,  ueling  dditional ice ains n  fixede of f f a pr g i income markets.
