evidence that the economic expansion in Europe had  found firmer footing.  Against that backdrop, market participants became increasingly  confident that policy tightening would be forthcoming.  Indeed, judging by money market  futures,  expectations  are for official rate hikes  by the  European  Central Bank  of about  1 percentage  point over the next year,  only a little less than  for the United States.  The Bank of  England  actually tightened,  citing concerns  about inflation pressures as justification  for a  1/4 percentage  point increase in its repurchase  rate  on January  13. In Japan, in  sharp contrast, market participants apparently saw little news  in recent weeks  to lead  them to believe  that the Bank of  Japan will change its zero-interest-rate  policy any time soon as economic recovery  there continues  to proceed  in fits and starts.  Japanese  long-term yields edged lower over the intermeeting  period, supporting the dollar.  Japanese monetary  authorities intervened  to weaken the yen on two days early in  the period.

;  U.S. monetary  authorities did not intervene.  Financial  market conditions in emerging market economies  generally improved further over the intermeeting  period, with sovereign  debt spreads narrowing and equity prices rising.

- (4) M2 growth rose to a 7-1/4 percent annual rate in December and edged up further to an 8-1/4 percent pace in January. 3 Growth over the two months was above  that expected  at the time of the December  Committee meeting.  Extra demands  for liquidity and
