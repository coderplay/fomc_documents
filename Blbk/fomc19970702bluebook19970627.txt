markets,  which moved up sharply  on balance  over  the intermeeting  period  to reach record levels.

- (3) The  dollar's weighted-average  exchange  value  appreciated  about 2/3 percent, on  balance,  over  the  intermeeting  period  even though U.S. long-term rates  fell by more than the  average  of foreign  long-term  rates;  the latter  declined  15  basis  points. The  dollar appreciated  more  than  1-1/2  percent against  the DM  and  most other  continental  European currencies  in response  to  a growing  perception  in  the market  that none  of the major European countries  will  be able  to  comply  strictly  with  the Maastricht  deficit criterion--implying  that  if EMU goes forward,  it will  be  with  a  broad  group  of countries. The  market apparently believes  that a  broad EMU, and  one  that  might  place a  bit greater  emphasis  on  reducing unemployment  given  the results  of the  French  election,  will  be  less committed  to  the monetary  discipline  required  for price  stability. The dollar declined  1 percent against  the  yen amid  growing  market  focus  on recent and prospective  increases  in Japan's current  account surplus. Short-term interest  rates in  most industrial  countries  were  little  changed  over  the intermeeting period. Short-term  rates  moved up  in the  United  Kingdom  and  Canada  after  the newly independent  Bank of England  increased  its repo rate by  1/4  percentage  point and  the Bank of Canada  raised  its bank rate by  the  same  amount. Italian  short-term  rates  are expected  to  fall next  week after  the Bank  of Italy  announced  late today  that it would  cut  both its  discount  and  Lombard  rates  by  50  basis points  effective  next  Monday.

and mutual  funds, ince he  latter e  now  much more readily  vailable  han n he  1970s and s t ar a t i t 1980s. Moreover,  even  if  oney  demand remains  reasonably  redictable,  e  Committee may m p th value he  ranges rimarily  s  a  means of ignifying ng-term oals,    role hat  hey  began  to t p a s lo g a t t take  on in  the econd  half  f  the  1980s. Although  the  Committee  used  M2  growth  as one  of s o its  ndicators   that ime, he  emphasis  was more on  longer-term  rends han  on  recent i at t t t t behavior elative   the ange, n  part ecause  the  interest  asticity    M2  meant that ts r to r i b el of i velocity  aried ppreciably  ver  the horter-run,  beit  airly edictably,  th  changes  in  the v a o s al f pr wi stance  of olicy. p

- (29) Alternatively,  e  Committee could  see  the  better  ehavior f  money  demand th b o as  making velocity  elationships  fficiently dictable   warrant n attempt,  t  least  n a r su pre to a a o provisional  asis,  o  let he ublic now approximately  hat  rates  f  growth  of oney  and b t t p k w o m debt  it hought ere  likely  o  accompany its  xpectations  or conomic  performance. t w t e f e

Supplying  such  an expectation ght  be  viewed  as  more in  the  spirit   the  Federal eserve mi of R Act,  which  calls  or he  Federal eserve  to  provide objectives d plans" or oney and f t R " an f m credit  n he  specific ars.  While  that xpectation  ould  not  be  a "plan"  r  "objective," i t ye e w o it might  be  helpful  o he ublic. hould  the ommittee wish  to  move in  this  irection t  on t t p S C d bu a  very  tentative sis,  ne  possible  pproach  would  be to  retain  he urrent  anges nd  their ba o a t c r a rationale r  1997,  but  to dopt  provisional 98 ranges  that ere keyed  to  the  Committee's fo a 19 w expected  outcomes.  The Committee could  emphasize  the  provisional ture f  the  ranges nd na o a the  opportunity  o  re-examine he anges nd  their  ationale xt ebruary  in  light  f t t r a r ne F o experience  n  the  second  half f  1997. If  he  Committee saw growth  in 2  or  the  other i o t M aggregates  s  having  some value  as  indicators levant  or olicy,  he ase  for resenting a re f p t c p

ranges  designed o  capture xpected rowth  would be  strengthened.  iven  the  relatively  ose t e g G cl relationship    M2  and  nominal  income of ate,  ersistent  rength  r  weakness  of  money of l p st o relative   expectations,  less vidently  aused  by  a  demand shift  r short-term  olicy to un e c o p action,  ight  raise  uestions  bout  whether  nominal  GDP m q a was on  track.

As compared with  alternative   he  Committee could  use IIr b I,t alternative   o  indicate  n  intent  o ursue  a  less  estrictive  icy,  hich would not  be as IIt a t p r pol w likely  o  involve  aising  hort-term terest tes  ubstantially  fight  he  inflationary t r s in ra s to t tendencies  n  the  staff recast.  uch a  policy pproach  also ould allow  more of  any i fo S a w favorable  upply evelopments  to  be  taken n  greater  utput nd less n  lower  inflation, s d i o a i
