MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1) Since the March 26 FOMC meeting, federal funds generally have traded close to  their intended level of 5-1/4 percent. Although banks have continued to implement retail sweep programs, seasonal strength in transaction deposits and required reserve balances and a modest expansion of  required clearing balances have kept total required balances from eroding further over the intermeeting period. Desk operations were complicated by unexpectedly strong flows of individual nonwithheld tax payments, which resulted in persistent overshoots relative to projections in  the Treasury's balance at Federal Reserve Banks in late April.

s (2)  The Committee's decision at the March meeting to leave its intended level for the federal funds rate at 5-1/4 percent was anticipated by market participants and  had little effect on other interest rates. Nonetheless, market rates subsequently climbed substantially over the intermeeting period, except at the shortest maturities (chart). Intermediateand long-term Treasuries rose 25 to 40 basis points, on  balance. As over the previous intermeeting period, the increases were especially sharp on several days when economic releases pointed to brisk growth in  output and employment. A considerable portion of  the rise probably represents an increase in real interest rates, apparently reflecting market views that monetary policy will need to  be  tighter than previously thought in order to keep the economy on a  path of sustainable growth. Changed expectations about policy are reflected in  quotes on  federal funds futures

contracts, which have risen appreciably and now suggest that participants see some possibility of  tightening by the end of  the year. Surveymeasures of inflation expectations have ticked up, suggesting that the  backup in  nominal yields also owed in  part to  market concerns about price increases. The climb in grain and energy prices and stronger economic growth in  the context of aggregate output around the economy's capacity seemed to  heighten inflation fears, but more recently relatively low readings on core inflation and the retreat of oil prices appear to  have damped those concerns. The rise in  yields on coupon securities steepened the Treasury yield curve, but has not left it unusually steep by historic standards, reinforcing the impression that market participants anticipate that economic developments will dictate only minor interest rate adjustments. Most stock price indexes rose over the intermeeting period, as generally favorable first-quarter earnings reports and the stronger economic outlook evidently outweighed the effects of  the backup in interest rates.

(3) The rise in  U.S. interest rates contributed to an increase in  the dollar's exchange value of 1-3/4 percent on a  weightedaverage basis since the March Committee meeting. The dollar was especially strong against the  mark, and to  a  lesser extent against other European currencies, reflecting indications of continued weak economic activity in Europe. Three-month interest rates edged lower in Germany on  expectations of  further monetary easing; the Bundesbank cut its discount and Lombard rates by 1/2 percentage point on  April 18, but has not yet lowered its repo rates. German long-term bond yields were unchanged, on  balance. The dollar rose by  a  lesser amount against the yen. Signs of continuing Japanese economic recovery heightened expectations of a  move by  the Bank of Japan to  tighten monetary policy, though these concerns were largely allayed by statements from  the Bank

of Japan in mid-May. On balance, short-  and long-term rates in Japan showed  little net  change over the period.

The Desk did  not  intervene.

(4) The  growth of  overall debt  has  remained moderate  on average in  recent months, with the total debt of  domestic nonfinancial sectors  staying near the middle of its  3 to  7 percent  annual  range. Net  federal  borrowing was  light  in April, held down in  part  by strong tax receipts. Nonfederal credit  flows  appear to have maintained the slower  growth pace of around 5 percent that was  established around the middle of  1995. Household and business borrowing seems  to have moderated  a little, while the runoff of  state and  local debt  has turned  to a modest expansion owing to  a slowdown in  redemptions. In the  business  sector,  a slowing  in  equity retirements  has  reduced  credit needs. Bond  issuance has been damped by the increase in long-term  rates,  with some borrowers  shifting  financing into the commercial paper  market. In contrast,  business  loans at  banks  expanded  sluggishly, on balance, over  March and April. In  the household sector,  consumer credit decelerated sharply in March, and bank figures  for April suggest that borrowing  remained on a slower track. The number of mortgage  refinancing applications has  fallen off appreciably, but--while  few data are  yet  available--net mortgage borrowing appears  to have been restrained only slightly to  date by the  backup in  longer-term interest rates. According to the May senior  loan officers survey, banks  continued to  ease terms  for  C&amp;I  loans  over  the previous three months  but tightened  standards  for  consumer credit-card loans.

(5) The broad monetary aggregates slowed in  April to annual growth rates of  about 2  percent--a sharper deceleration than projected at  the time of  the  March FOMC meeting--and both aggregates drew closer to  the upper ends of  their ranges on a  monthly average basis.1 Data for  the first half of  May suggest continued weakness in broad money growth. Last month's fall-off owed partly to a  contraction in demand deposits following surprisingly rapid growth in  the first quarter. A failure of  currency demand to pick up after the introduction of  the new  $100 bill accounted for some of  the shortfall of  the aggregates as well. Movements in  the opportunity costs of  holding money also have contributed to the slowing of broad money growth, as the stimulative effects of  previous decreases in  market interest rates wore off  and the impact of the  more recent rise in intermediateand long-term rates began to  be  felt.2 The consequences for money growth of  the unexpected strength in individual nonwithheld tax payments around April 15 are difficult to  sort out: Much of  the weakness in  money occurred late in  the month when payments to the Treasury cleared, but in the past large tax  payments have  been associated with strength in  the aggregates in  April owing to the  buildup of  balances early in  the month. The sluggishness in  M2 showed through to M3, despite a  rebound in  bank credit.

Policy Alternatives

(6) Incoming data suggest both stronger demand and slightly higher resource utilization rates than were anticipated by  the staff at the time of  the March FOMC meeting. In the Greenbook forecast, the recent rise in  interest and exchange rates, which are expected to hold near current levels with an  unchanged federal funds rate, exert some restraint on economic growth going forward, but the economy still produces around or a  little beyond its potential. The high level of resource utilization, combined with the effects of rising food and energy prices, imparts a  small upward tilt to inflation, with both core and  total CPI projected to increase 3-1/4 percent in 1997. For 1996, the staff forecasts for total CPI inflation and real GDP growth are above the upper ends of  the central tendencies of  the projections of  Board members and Presidents last February.

(7) In addition to  the rise in  food and energy prices, another potential supply shock is an increase in  the minimum wage, which is  discussed in  a  special section of  the Greenbook but not incorporated in  the basic forecast. These sorts of  shocks in principle could show up as effects on  the level of prices, and not on  the ongoing rate of inflation. However, supply shocks could get built into inflation through attempts by businesses and workers to  maintain real earnings--in the case of  businesses by  passing through higher costs into prices and for workers by linking wage demands to  past inflation. In  addition, observed price increases could lead to inflation by  being extrapolated into the future and incorporated into inflation expectations. Both mechanisms produce a  similar result, requiring a  monetary policy response to avoid a  ratcheting up of  the inflation rate. Paragraph 8,  describing the policy response, treats

the process as working through expectations, but its analysis would hold for  the "catch-up" mechanism as well.

(8) Under circumstances in which price shocks were tending to boost expected inflation, policy would have to offset effects working through two channels. First, with unchanged nominal short-term interest rates, a  rise in expected inflation over the near-term would lower real short-term rates, thereby tending to  raise spending and economic activity relative to the economy's potential. Such an  effect on resource use would begin to induce more rapid wage and price increases. Second, expected inflation is thought to have a  direct, independent influence on  wage and price setting. Thus, any rise in expected inflation could further add to  the rate of inflation on  a  lasting basis. To counter these effects on  ongoing inflation, were they to emerge, the Federal Reserve would need to  raise the nominal funds rate. Such a  tightening would have two components. To prevent any decline in  the real funds rate and thereby avoid any additional pressures on  resources, the nominal funds rate would have to be raised relative to the path it otherwise would follow by  the same amount as the induced increase in inflation expectations. This forestalls any change in  the output gap that, for example, would produce increasing inflation if  the shock occurred with the economy already producing at its potential. Still, even at this higher nominal funds rate, the initial uptick in inflation expectations and inflation would persist. To  lean additionally against the inflationary impact resulting from any initial increase in expected inflation itself, the Federal Reserve would need to raise the real funds rate, implying a  further upward

adjustment to  the nominal funds rate.3 That is, to bring inflation back down once higher expectations became embedded, some slack in resource utilization would need to be  created.

(9) If real rates needed to be raised in response to a  significant supply shock, the timing and magnitude of  the policy actions would depend on the approach followed. Realistically, no  monetary policy is going to  be able to avoid at  least some near-term uptick in measured inflation in  these circumstances. A  gradualist approach to bringing inflation back down might be favored if  a  string of  small output gaps were thought to  be  preferable to a  short, but sharp, correction, even though the total output loss in either case might be little different. On  the other hand, more forceful policy actions, by clearly demonstrating the central bank's intention to rein in inflation, could have a  "credibility" effect holding down price expectations. If  such an effect occurred, it  would substitute for some of the need to sacrifice output to  bring inflation back to the desired path.

(10) Despite these potential problems on  the inflation front, the minimum wage has not yet been raised, measures of industrial prices and of strains on  production capacity remain quiescent, and recent information on  core PPI/CPI inflation provides little evidence of  an  incipient acceleration. Moreover, the rise in  intermediateand long-term rates this year may  have left these measures not far from levels consistent with the economy producing at its potential. In these circumstances, the Committee may  prefer to adopt alternative B,

awaiting more concrete evidence that inflationary pressures are emerging before adopting a  tightening action. Financial market participants are anticipating that the  FOMC will leave its policy stance unchanged at this meeting, implying that selection of alternative B would have little market impact. Although the Greenbook is forecasting a  strong second quarter, many  market economists have a  similar view, and hence release of economic data in  conformity with the Greenbook forecast should not elicit much response in security prices or dollar exchange rates.

(11) The case for a  policy tightening at  this FOMC meeting presumably would rest on  the view  that the risks of  higher inflation had become substantial. Even without an  assumed minimum wage increase, the Committee may see the gradual upcreep in core CPI inflation projected by  the staff as a  likely and undesirable outcome. If the higher rate of  overall inflation so far this year were feeding through in some part to inflation expectations, a  rise in  the nominal funds rate would be  needed at some point to forestall an effective easing of  the policy stance. Alternative C embodies a  50  basis point increase in the federal funds rate to 5-3/4 percent in order to counter the incipient increase in  price pressures. The Federal Reserve is not expected by market participants to  tighten for several months, and hence, investors would be caught off guard by  the FOMC's choice of alternative C  at this meeting. Short-term interest rates would rise by 1/2 percentage point. A  sense that the FOMC would be assuming a  more aggressive anti-inflationary posture than previously anticipated, at least over the near term, might limit increases in nominal intermediateand long-term rates, but would lead to  an appreciable increase in real interest rates on  instruments of  these

maturities. The value of  the dollar would probably ratchet higher on exchange markets.

(12) The interest rates of  alternative B  and associated staff forecast for the economy are thought to be consistent with a slight moderation in  the growth of  money and credit over coming months relative to  their pace of  expansion so far in 1996. (Projected growth for April to September and from the fourth quarter to September are shown in  the table below.) The staff anticipates that the terms and conditions of  bank lending will remain on  the accommodative side, though perhaps continuing to firm a  little for consumer credit. Only partly as a  consequence, growth of consumer credit is projected to continue its downtrend, accompanied by  sustained moderate expansion of home mortgage debt. Business borrowing may edge off as the recent rise in long-term yields continues to restrain bond issuance, while subdued inventory investment keeps the lid on  bank loans and commercial paper. Near-term borrowing by  the federal government is now shaping up as rather weak in light of  the  build-up in  the  Treasury's cash balance stemming from outsized individual tax payments in  April. As a  result of  the  downward-revised forecast for federal debt growth, the expansion of  total domestic nonfinancial sector debt from April to

<!-- missing-text -->

September is  now  projected at only a  4-1/2 percent pace, leaving its level in  September somewhat below the 5  percent midpoint of  its annual growth rate range.

(13) The weakish cast of  the incoming monetary data, together with the recent further increases in  the returns on intermediateand long-term instruments that compete with monetary assets, has led  to  a downward revision in  the staff's projections of growth in  the monetary aggregates as well. Expansion of  M2 and M3 from April to September has been scaled back to only 3-3/4 and 4  percent, respectively, which implies that the growth of  the broad aggregates will be slower than that of  nominal GDP in both  the  second and third quarters. Even so, both aggregates in September are not far below the upper bounds of their annual ranges of  5  and 6  percent, respectively. The volume of new sweep programs coming on line over the next few  months is expected to remain substantial. M1 is projected to fall at a  rate of 3  percent from April to September; adjusted for sweeps, M1 is projected to grow at a  rate of  4-3/4 percent.

Directive Language

(14) Presented below is draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the  usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In  the implementation of policy for the immediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY)/maintain/ INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on reserve positions. In the context of  the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to economic, financial, and monetary developments, slightly (SOMEWHAT) greater reserve restraint (WOULD/MIGHT) or  slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint would (MIGHT) be  acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to be consistent with moderate growth in  M2 and M3 over coming months.
