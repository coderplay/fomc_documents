- (2) The weighted-average  foreign  exchange  value  of the  dollar  has  decreased somewhat  since the  August  FOMC meeting;  bilateral  rates  have  diverged  substantially, reflecting  disparate  economic  developments  in major  foreign countries. The dollar has declined  3-1/4 percent  against  the mark, as  data  suggesting  a pickup  in German  economic activity  and  consumer price  inflation  fueled  speculation  about  a possible  increase  in  German short-term  interest rates  prior  to the  selection  of  initial  participants  in  stage  III  of EMU  next spring. In contrast, the  dollar  has  risen  2-3/4 percent  against  the  yen. Weakness  in the yen against  the  dollar has  been  fostered  by continuing  sluggish  economic  conditions  in Japan,  by persistent  problems  in its  financial  system,  and  by the potential  impact  of the recent depreciations  of Southeast  Asian  currencies  on  Japan. Yields  on Japanese  long-term government bonds  have  fallen  18  basis points,  while  equity prices  have  dropped 7 percent. Long-term interest rates  in the United  Kingdom  fell  60  basis points  over the  intermeeting period  as signs  emerged  that  activity is  slowing  and  as public  statements  by British  officials seemed  to  increase prospects  for sterling's early  entry  into the  third  stage  of EMU.

. The  Desk did  not intervene.

- (3) M2  growth surged  in  August  before  slowing  to the  still-brisk rate  of 6-1/2 percent  now  estimated  for  September--a much faster  advance  over the two months  than expected  at the time of the last meeting. Part  of the  strength was  attributable to heavy inflows to  money  funds,  which seem  to have  captured  balances  deflected  or  withdrawn from stock mutual  funds in response  to declines  in  share  values  in August. However,  other

components of  M2  were also elatively  bust,  nd,  based  on the  staff ojection r ominal r ro a pr fo n GDP,  the  velocity  f  this  ggregate  eclined lightly   the  third  uarter  espite  teady o a d s in q d s opportunity  osts--the rst op  in  a  year  and  a half. rom the ourth  uarter  f  1996 to c fi dr F f q o September, 2  has  grown at  a  5-1/2 ercent ate,  bove  its   to  5 percent  ange.  M3  growth M p r a 1 r has  remained  exceptionally  pid uring ugust and  September, ven  though  bank credit ra d A e growth  has  been  moderate.  Banks have  substituted  rge  ime  deposits  or  foreign la t f borrowings, nd  inflows o nstitution-only  ey  funds  have  been  substantial.   of a t i mon As September, 3  had advanced  at  an 8-1/2  percent  ate rom  its ourth-quarter  96 base, ell M r f f 19 w above  the  6 percent  pper  end of  its  ange. u r

- (4) In  contrast  o  the onetary  aggregates, e xpansion f  total  ebt  has t m th e o d remained  moderate.  Growth of  the  debt  of  private  ectors  as  been  supported n ecent s h i r months by  borrowing  by nonfinancial sinesses, ere  credit  as  apparently  een  needed  to bu wh h b finance nventory  ccumulation nd  merger  activity.  redit upply  and  credit  uality  n  the i a a C s q i business ector  ontinue o  be very  good:  Spreads  on  business  bligations  arkets  and at s c t o inm banks  are  quite arrow, hich  is ot  surprising ven istorically  rates  f  default  nd n w n gi h ow o a delinquency n  junk  bonds  and  business  oans.

Over the  past ew quarters  ustained  igh  levels  f  resource f s h o utilization e  been  associated  ith  flat  r, y some measures, ven  declining  nflation. e hav w o b e i Th Committee  may read  this  xperience  s  suggesting  he ossibility  at  conomic activity n e a t p th e ca run  on  the igh  side f istorical  rms without utting  uch pressure  n  inflation. en in h o h no p m o Ev the  staff  orecast  ome of  the oderate  pickup  in  consumer  prices wes to  smaller rag f s m o a d

Some  reassurance  n  this  egard ight  be gotten  rom  the  likelihood at he i r m f th t real ed  funds  rate as  ticked igher n  recent onths,  as  inflation  pectations em to ave f h h i m ex se h declined long  with  the  drop  in  measured  inflation,  ile  the ominal  funds  rate  as  been a wh n h held  steady. ith scant ndications   pipeline  ressures  hat ormally resage   pickup  in W i of p t n p a inflation,  d with  business  rofit  argins erhaps  ample enough  to  absorb  a  portion  f ny an p m p o a speed  up  in  cost ncreases,  e  Committee may well  have  time  to  act efore n  incipient i th b a increase  n  inflation  comes firmly mbedded in nflation  pectations. i be e i ex

The need  for rompt  action  ight  be  seen p m as  elevated  ecause  the igor f  final  ales  hreatens   add  to  pressures  n  resources, d  the b v o s t to o an longer he  economy operates  eyond its ustainable tential,  e  more disruptive y be the t b s po th ma correction eded  to  contain  nflation. spite elatively  gh  short-term  eal ates, nancial e i De r hi r r fi conditions  emain  quite upportive  o  spending:  The stock arket  continues  o  generate r s t m t impressive  ains n  wealth; onger-term  eal nterest  tes  eem to  have  held  fairly  teady r g i l r i ra s s o

perhaps  edged  lower  since pring;  nd  capital rkets  and depositories  main  quite eceptive s a ma re r to  borrowers. The rapid  growth  of  the onetary  aggregates  n  the ast ew months  may  be m i p f seen  as  one  more warning  flag hat  inancial nditions  re  supporting  ore spending  than t f co a m can  be accommodated without n increase  f  inflation. ile  the  Committee  might  be  more a o Wh inclined  han  ever  to  view structural  anges  as  permitting  he  economy to  operate t  a  higher t ch t a rate han  in he  past,  he  projected  nemployment rate f  4-1/2 ercent alls  hort f  all ut t t t u o p f s o b the  rosiest timates  f  the  natural  ate. oreover,  a portion  f he  recent  ood performance es o r M o t g of  inflation  s  owed to  temporary actors, ch  as  the  strength  n  the oreign  xchange  value ha f su i f e of  the  dollar, ich are  not  likely  o  be  repeated ver  coming quarters.  ven worker wh t o E insecurity y be expected o  erode  in  a strong abor arket  marked by reduced  layoffs. ma t l m With  those eneficial rces ikely  o  wind down, the  Committee may fear hat  he  effects  f b fo l t t t o strains  n resources  ay show through ore forcefully    the rices f  goods  and services o m m to p o than  in  the  staff recast, rhaps ore in  line ith  traditional ationships. o pe m w rel

Money  market  rates  ould rise t  least  s  much as  the co u w a a 25 basis oint ike  in  the  federal  unds  rate,  nd intermediate-  d long-term  ates ould  increase p h f a an r c substantially  well.  The extent f  the  increase,   course, ould depend on market as o of w participants' erpretation he  rationale r ederal eserve  action. he action  ight  be int of  t fo F R T m viewed  as  simply  a  purchase f imited  dditional surance  gainst  igher nflation o l a in a h i in response o  a spurt o  final  emand.  Alternatively,   tightening ght  be  taken  as  evidence t t d the mi that he  Federal eserve  had  not  become as  optimistic   market  participants  ve  come to t R as ha suspect t as about  the  economy's  ability   produce  at  unusually igh ates ithout i w to h r w generating  ore inflation;  ch  a  reassessment  ight  even  lead ome investors   revise  heir m su m s to t own views  about  inflation    well  as  about  future  ederal eserve  behavior. n  either  ase, as F R I c the  implied ise n  real ates ould buoy the  exchange  value f  the  dollar  ut  depress quity r i r w o b e values.

In  these ircumstances,  coming  data earing n the p ou c in b o strength  f  spending nd  inflation  essure  ould be  especially rutinized,  large wings o a pr w sc and s in  financial ices ight  become even  more  common. pr m

Still,  e  rapid rowth  of 2  in t m e p d h th g M August  and September  implies  hat his  ggregate  ill egin he ourth  uarter  t  a  high  level, t t a w b t f q a so  even  substantial  owing  thereafter  aves uarterly erage rowth  at  an elevated  ate-sl le q av g r indeed, gain  a  shade  above  that rojected  or ominal  GDP. a p f n M3  growth  will low  as  well, s but  will emain  above  the  rate f  expansion f  M2  owing  to  continued apid xpansion f r o o r e o institution-only  ual  funds, hich are  gaining arket  share  in he  cash  management mut w m t business,  nd  further  ubstantial  owth  in  large ime  deposits. ll  told,  2  and  M3  growth a s gr t A M for  1997 should e about  1/2  and 2-1/4 ercentage  oints, spectively,  ove  their  nnual b p p re ab a ranges.
