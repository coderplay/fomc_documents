in Asia and Russia induced decreases  in market interest rates in other Western  industrial countries.  Data releases  showing  a slowdown in U.K. economic  growth contributed to an unwinding of expectations  for an imminent rate  hike by the Bank of England and a rise in the dollar against the pound.  The dollar was  little changed on balance  against continental  European currencies.

The Desk did not intervene during the period for the accounts of the System or the Treasury.

- (3) After averaging  nearly  6 percent over March  to June, M2  growth moderated  to a 5 percent rate in July.  This slowing was expected  and moved M2 growth down closer to the projected third-quarter  increase  in nominal  income.  Recent  stock market  weakness seems  to have been  associated with  some shift in household  investment preferences,  as evidenced by the cessation of flows into equity mutual funds and increased  flows into M2 money funds in late July and early August.  M3  was about flat in July, even though bank credit  grew at a 5 percent  pace; however, large time deposits ran off sharply, owing largely to substitution of overseas  sources of funding for deposits, particularly  at the U.S.  branches  and agencies of European banks. Institutional  money funds also  declined in July as investors evidently  shifted into market instruments  around quarter end to take advantage  of a temporary  spike in short-term interest  rates that was only partially reflected in more slowly  adjusting money fund yields.  From the fourth quarter of last year through July, M2  and M3  grew at rates of 7 percent  and 81/2 percent, respectively.
- (4) Borrowing by households  and businesses  has edged down of late, but remains brisk, boosted by the heavy pace  of equity retirements  and robust private  spending.  With long-

term  interest  tes  ow, orrowing  has  been  concentrated   bond  and fixed-rate  rtgage ra l b in mo markets.  Although  investors   securities  rkets eem to  have  become a  bit  ore cautious, e in ma s m th August survey f  senior  oan  officers ggested  hat  tandards  t  commercial  banks  were  little o l u t s a changed  over  the ast hree  onths  and  terms n  business  oans ere  eased lightly  rther p t m o l w s fu on net. 2 The  federal  overnment  has  continued  o ay  down debt n  a  seasonally justed  asis. g t p o ad b Growth of  total  omestic onfinancial bt as  slowed  to he  percent  rea n ecent  onths, d n de h t 5 a i r m leaving  ts  rowth  from  the ourth  uarter  f ast  ear hrough une  at   6  percent  ate. i g f q o l y t J a r
