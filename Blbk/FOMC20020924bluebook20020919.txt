MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) Investors' view of the economic outlook seemed to be colored by the FOMC's announcement following the August meeting of no change in the target funds rate and a shift in the assessment of the balance of risks toward economic weakness.  Over the remainder of that day, near-term interest rate futures edged higher as those expecting imminent ease were disappointed, but rates several months ahead dropped as much as 20 basis points and broad equity indexes were off about 2-1/2 percent as the tilt and the wording of the announcement were taken to signal weaker economic prospects.  Spirits were lifted briefly by the uneventful passing of the August 14 deadline for the recertification of corporate financial statements; equity markets rallied for several days, pulling Treasury yields up in tow.  Since then, however, the softer tone to incoming data on production and employment, heightened tensions over Iraq, and a gloomier assessment of the path for business profits seem again to have left investors marking down their outlook for the economy. On balance over the intermeeting period, the expected path of the federal funds rate embedded in futures rates rose slightly at near maturities, largely reflecting the absence of an easing at the August meeting and statements by Federal Reserve officials that appeared to convey lower odds on near-term policy action (Chart 1).   Current quotes 1 suggest that investors see only a small likelihood of policy easing at this meeting, and

recent surveys of market participants have indicated that most anticipate the Committee will retain a balance of risks toward economic weakness.  Futures rates suggest that investors think it likely that the Federal Reserve will respond to weaker economic outcomes with additional easing at some point in the next few months. Moreover, the futures curve beyond midyear 2003 dropped 15 to 45 basis points and now points to a more gradual expected tightening of policy than previously anticipated.

- (2) In keeping with the revisions to policy expectations, short-term Treasury yields were about unchanged to up slightly while intermediate- and long-term Treasury yields shed 35 to 40 basis points.  The decline in longer-term Treasury yields reportedly was amplified by hedging demands from mortgage-backed securities investors.  Those investors apparently purchased longer-term Treasuries to offset the shortening in the duration of their portfolios stemming from the jump in prepayments on mortgage-backed securities that accompanied the surge in mortgage refinancings. 2 At the ten-year maturity, yields on Treasury indexed securities fell a bit less than those on their nominal counterparts-perhaps because indexed securities did not experience increased hedging demands to the same degree-but also probably suggestive of a slight decline in inflation compensation and a downward revision to economic prospects.  The absence of any major new accounting scandals was a palliative for the corporate bond market.  Issuers returned to the market after mid-August, though gross issuance was still light, and anecdotal reports suggest that market liquidity has

largely returned to normal, at least for higher-tier credits.  Yields on highly rated issues kept pace with declining Treasury yields, but risk spreads for speculative-grade bonds were unchanged to a bit narrower (Chart 2).  (More detail on credit market conditions is provided in the following box.)  Major equity price indexes finished the period down about 6-1/4 to 8-1/2 percent, on balance, moving the forward earnings-price

Credit Market Conditions

On net, it appears that credit market conditions improved marginally over the intermeeting period.  The dimunition of event risk following the passing of both the August 14 recertification date and September 11 without major incident seemed to contribute to an improved climate in capital markets.  Anecdotal reports suggest that bid-asked spreads and market depth for investment-grade credits have returned close to normal.  Transaction volumes in corporate securities reported by primary dealers moved higher over the period (Chart 3), and the drop in long-term interest rates prompted a pickup in bond issuance.  In the high-yield bond market, spreads remain at very high levels and issuance has been anemic.  By some measures, however, risk spreads for speculative-grade bonds narrowed a little over the intermeeting period and, very recently, liquidity in this market segment reportedly has improved somewhat.  These recent stirrings in the speculative-grade sector may have been occasioned by the sizable net inflows to high-yield bond funds recorded in late August and early September.

Market pressures on major broker-dealers may be a factor hindering further improvement in capital market conditions.  Credit default swap spreads for broker-dealers increased substantially this summer and, although narrowing a touch in recent weeks, remain quite wide.  Major banks have also been under some market pressure recently. The well-publicized troubles of JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup led to a widening in their subordinated debt spreads in recent months, and subordinated debt spreads gapped wider for a number of other major banking institutions after mid-year as well.  Late in the period, JP Morgan Chase's risk spread ticked higher after the firm was downgraded by one of the two major ratings agencies.  However, spreads for most other banks narrowed over the intermeeting period.  In the syndicated loan market, market participants have noted a pickup in new deals in early September and a growing forward calendar.  The sense of continued availability of business credit from banks seemed to apply to smaller firms as well.  The most recent survey by the National Federation of Independent Businesses suggested a marginal improvement in credit availability for such firms.

- (3) On balance, the trade-weighted value of the dollar against other major currencies appreciated slightly over the intermeeting period as concerns emerged about other industrial countries, particularly Germany and Japan, regarding the momentum of economic recovery that were even more pronounced than in the United States.  The dollar generally moved in narrow ranges against individual currencies, ending the period about unchanged against most, but it appreciated almost 2-1/4 percent on balance against the yen.  Policy rates in foreign industrial countries were left unchanged, and most foreign long-term government bond yields declined 20 to 25 basis points.  Political pressure intensified on the Bank of Japan to employ unconventional means to spur the economy and aid banks, including by stepping up purchases of government bonds.  Yesterday, the Bank of Japan surprised market participants by announcing that it would explore ways to purchase equities from banks.  Japanese stocks rallied after the announcement, but JGB yields rose about 15 basis points to end the intermeeting period down only slightly on net.  Foreign stock prices extended prior declines, on balance, in often volatile trading; share prices in Germany sank 15 percent, pulled down by the poor performance of the insurance and technology sectors.

.   The Desk did not intervene during the period.

- (4) The dollar's value against the currencies of other important trading partners rose 1-1/2 percent over the intermeeting period.  Brazilian financial markets were buoyed by final IMF approval of a financial support package, but concerns remain about the potential victory of an opposition candidate in next month's

Brazilian presidential election.  The Brazilian real declined nearly 9 percent on balance against the dollar, but Brazil's EMBI+ spread narrowed almost 240 basis points-to a still-high level.  The Mexican peso depreciated about 2-1/4 percent against the dollar, and Mexico's sovereign yield spread widened a bit.  In emerging Asia, equity prices in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia fell 3 to 7 percent amid questions about prospects for continued expansion of the technology sector.  Stock prices posted small gains in Korea, where domestic demand continued to show strength, and the Korean won appreciated slightly versus the dollar.

- (5) Borrowing by businesses appears to have remained weak (Chart 4), as external financing needs apparently are very low this quarter.  In recent weeks, the improved tone in the corporate bond market has prompted a modest step-up in gross bond issuance, but the proceeds appear to have been used primarily to pay down short-term debt and maturing or called bonds.  As a result, commercial paper outstanding has continued to fall, although the pace of the runoff has slowed, and bank business loans have been basically flat since the end of July.  In the household sector, consumer credit growth has been supported by the recent round of incentives offered by the major auto makers.  Mortgage debt continued to expand briskly as low rates have propelled both home buying and mortgage refinancing.
- (6) M2 growth remained elevated last month with much of the strength concentrated in its liquid components.  In part, the advance in M2 likely reflects the impact of the recent surge in refinancing activity and the accompanying boost to liquid deposits associated with the temporary placement of prepayments on mortgagebacked securities in escrow deposits at banks.  In addition, demands for M2 assets probably have been boosted by investors seeking a safe haven from the volatility in equity markets.  Net outflows from equity mutual funds continued last month, albeit at a much slower pace than in July, and apparently halted in early September.  With

current estimates suggesting that M2 growth in the third quarter will be in the neighborhood of 10 percent, the velocity of M2 is almost certain to register a substantial decline this quarter, even though its opportunity cost changed little.

Policy Alternatives

- (7) The staff has read incoming data over the intermeeting period as suggesting stronger final demand in the current quarter than projected at the time of the August FOMC meeting but as providing little reason to change its longer-term outlook.  In the Greenbook, economic growth is anticipated to rise a bit above that of potential by the middle of next year and by more in 2004, leading to a gradual ebbing of the slack in resource use.  In this environment, the staff has retained the assumption of an unchanged stance of monetary policy through 2003, followed by some unwinding of monetary ease in 2004.  As the economy picks up steam and the onset of policy tightening approaches, Treasury yields edge higher, and corporate risk spreads narrow.  Share prices rise in line with risk-adjusted returns on bonds, and the dollar is assumed to depreciate at around a 1 percent annual rate in real terms over the forecast period.  The unemployment rate moves up to just above 6 percent by early next year and then gradually returns to 5-3/4 percent by the end of 2004, noticeably above the staff's 5 percent estimate of the natural rate throughout the forecast period. The effect of this ongoing slack on domestic inflation is expected to be partly offset by accelerating import prices as the dollar depreciates and by lagged impetus from this year's runup in energy prices.  On net, core PCE price inflation is projected to edge lower to a 1-1/4 percent pace in 2004.
- (8) If the Committee is still of the view that the current stance of policy is likely to be sufficient to foster an improving business climate over time, it may want to keep the intended funds rate unchanged .  The Greenbook projects that the current setting of the funds rate would support economic expansion that gains strength over the next year or so.  The sense that considerable monetary accommodation has been in place for some time is reinforced by the sustained low level of the real federal funds rate relative to estimates of its equilibrium (Chart 5).  Indeed, the Committee may read the robust purchases of autos and other items by households and heavy mortgage

Note: The shaded range represents the maximum and the minimum values each quarter of six estimates of the equilibri real federal funds rate based on a statistical filter and the FRB/US model.

activity as suggesting that aggregate demand will run stronger than in the staff forecast, implying that excess capacity will be worked down more quickly than in the Greenbook.  Even if the Committee accepts the Greenbook assessment of aggregate demand as likely, it would interpret the attendant gradual decline in the unemployment rate as implying less slack in labor markets than in the staff outlook should it also have a less favorable assessment of the sustainable level of resource utilization.

- (9) If the Committee views the downside risk of economic weakness to be substantial at the current setting of the federal funds rate, especially when compared with the seemingly low odds of a pickup in inflation, it probably would wish to retain a balance-of-risks assessment tilted toward economic weakness .  The elevated threat of terrorist attack and concerns about the potential for military action in Iraq may seem to pose significant adverse risks.  Even absent such developments, the Committee may consider a sustained expansion of aggregate demand as by no means assured, particularly given continuing questions about businesses' willingness to hire and spend and the fragility of key emerging markets.  Market participants appear to share such qualms in that equity prices are still quite volatile and lower on balance, and corporate risk spreads remain wide.  At this juncture, with financial markets quite skittish, the Committee may find it more difficult than usual to predict the market response if policy action does not match prevailing expectations.  Futures market quotes indicate that investors on average place just a small probability on a policy easing at this meeting, although they appear to expect at least a quarter point cut in the funds rate by early next year.  A policy decision of no change in the funds rate and a balance of risks still pointing toward economic weakness therefore would probably represent only a minor disappointment to market participants and induce just a slight backup in interest rates at shorter maturities and perhaps a modest decline in stock prices.  As always, the wording of the announcement will prove important in shaping

that market reaction.

- (10) The Committee may wish to shift to a balanced assessment of risks if it believes that the likelihood of a slide back into economic weakness, which seemed more palpable when market stresses mounted in the runup to the August meeting, has receded.  Two important hurdles-the August 14 deadline for certifying financial statements and the first anniversary of September 11-passed uneventfully, perhaps suggesting that the Committee's assessment of the uncertainties surrounding its forecast has narrowed.  In addition, the Committee may be concerned that a zero real funds rate will soon pose the risk of imparting excessive stimulus if the forces currently holding down the equilibrium real funds rate lift more quickly than is implicit in the staff forecast, perhaps along the lines of the alternative simulation in the Greenbook. With some measures of the equity premium at their highest levels since the early 1990s, the Committee may see good odds that the stock market and, hence, aggregate demand will rebound more than projected in the Greenbook, especially given the apparent ebbing of investors' concerns about corporate governance.  Announcement of a Committee decision to shift back to balance in its risk assessment, with no change in the funds rate, would likely induce market participants to reevaluate their expectations for policy.  Short-term interest rates would rise as the probabilities of policy easings by early next year were lowered.  Stock prices would likely fall somewhat initially, while long-term interest rates would be subjected to the cross-currents of higher short-term interest rates but chances of a weaker economy in the intermediate run.
- (11) The Committee may desire to ease policy at this meeting to provide more assurance that economic growth would move up to an acceptable pace.  In particular, if the Committee shares the staff's assessment that the unemployment rate will decline only modestly by 2004, it might see little risk that additional policy ease will

revive inflation and a particular benefit in absorbing slack more quickly.  Judging by the path of the funds rate in the 'policymaker perfect foresight' simulations, a 25 or 50 basis point policy easing at this meeting could be consistent with stable or even declining inflation given the staff's assessment of longer-term trends and the relationships embedded in the FRB/US model (see box and chart).  The Committee may also favor policy easing at this time in light of the possibility that the lack of such a policy adjustment could risk economic weakness and further disinflation.  Although household spending and a swing in inventory investment have carried economic activity along to date, the extent of the pickup in capital spending-and therefore sustainable economic expansion-remains uncertain.  Indeed, declines in equity prices

'Policymaker Perfect Foresight' Strategies

The updated perfect foresight exercises have been renamed 'policymaker perfect foresight' strategies in this bluebook to clarify that, while policymakers are assumed to know the structure of the economy and the shocks that will occur over the projection period, private agents in these FRB/US simulations form expectations using a small vector autoregression model.  The funds rate path is chosen to minimize the sum of squares of the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate of 5 percent, the deviation of core PCE inflation from a long-run goal, and changes in the funds rate.  In the extension of the Greenbook baseline beyond 2004, potential output is projected to grow at about the same rate projected for 2004 in the Greenbook, foreign GDP growth strengthens modestly, the dollar depreciates at a 3 percent real rate, and the federal budget balance gradually improves.

The dotted line in Chart 6 depicts the policy path for the funds rate with a long-run inflation goal of 1 percent, while the dashed line shows a path for a 1-1/2 percent inflation goal.  The solid line depicts the Greenbook funds rate assumption through 2004, which implies a tighter policy over the next year or so than either of the FRB/US simulations.  As a result, the baseline projection delivers a faster disinflation and a slower closing of the output gap than the policymaker perfect foresight strategies.

over the intermeeting period and reductions in longer-term interest rates may well indicate that market participants have become more doubtful on that score as well.

- (12) Market participants place only small odds on a policy move at this meeting, and domestic bond and stock markets would therefore likely rally if the Committee chose to ease, particularly if the move were 50 basis points.  The extent of the rally would also depend on whether market participants interpret the action as an earlier-than-expected completion of the easing already built into market prices or as a harbinger of further easings.  That assessment, of course, will depend importantly on the Committee's judgment on the balance of risks and the wording of its announcement.
- (13) Under the Greenbook forecast, with a flat funds rate, total nonfinancial debt and its nonfederal component are both projected to continue to grow at about a 6 percent pace over the next couple of quarters.  The composition of nonfederal borrowing shifts somewhat, however, as business borrowing recovers while household debt grows more slowly.  Business demands for external finance are projected to rise as profit growth is subdued while inventory building resumes and fixed investment gradually picks up.  Banks and financial markets are expected to remain selective in making credit available to businesses without substantially constricting the overall prospects for capital spending.  In the household sector, a moderation in auto sales should contribute to some lessening in the growth of consumer credit.  Home mortgage debt is expected to decelerate from its rapid recent growth rates, reflecting moderation in housing activity and the completion of the current wave of mortgage refinancings.  Nonetheless, growth in household debt is expected to continue to outpace that of disposable personal income.  Reductions in mortgage refinancings should also contribute to a diminution in M2 growth in coming months.  Over the four quarters of this year, M2 is projected to grow 6-3/4 percent, considerably faster

than nominal GDP, owing largely to the lagged effects of last year's decline in shortterm interest rates and opportunity costs, as well as mortgage refinancings.
