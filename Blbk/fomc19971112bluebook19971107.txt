dollar  was  little  changed  against  the  yen. Prospects  for the  Japanese  economy  appeared  to deteriorate  over the  intermeeting  period;  domestic demand  evidently  has  not yet  rebounded from the  depressing  effects  of the  consumption  tax  increase  in the  spring,  and  the intensification  of financial  turmoil  in other  Asian  countries  raised the  prospect of further negative  shocks  to Japanese  exports. Over  the intermeeting  period,  the Nikkei index  fell  12 percent,  and  long-term  rates  in Japan  declined  25  basis points  to 1  /8 5 percent,  a historical  low. Virtually  all  of the  dollar's decline  occurred  against European  currencies. Short-term interest rates  in most  continental  European  countries  climbed  20 to  35  basis  points  over the period  as widespread  expectations  of a tightening  of monetary  policy  in Germany  were  confirmed  when the  Bundesbank  raised  the rate  on its  weekly  repo tender  on October  9. Long-term interest rates  in continental  Europe  rose in the first two weeks  of October  in line  with the  advance in short-term  rates,  but  they  reversed  course  as prices  in global  equity  markets  declined  in  the second  half of the month. This week,  the  Bank  of England  raised  its RP  rate 25  basis  points, citing  higher-than-expected  inflation  and  persistent  strength  in  domestic  demand;  financial markets  in the  United  Kingdom  sold off moderately  on  the  unexpected  action. For the intermeeting  period  as  a  whole, bond  yields in most  European  countries  were  up  5  to  10  basis points,  and  equity  indexes  generally  fell 5  to  10  percent.
