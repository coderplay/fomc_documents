MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) Although the decision at the May 10 FOMC meeting to raise the target federal funds rate 25 basis points to 5 percent was widely expected, the indication in the accompanying statement that 'some further policy firming may yet be needed' reportedly prompted financial market participants to raise their near-term policy expectations slightly that afternoon.   Over the intermeeting period, data releases on 1 economic activity generally came in soft relative to expectations, while readings on inflation surprised to the upside, apparently leaving investors less optimistic about prospects for growth and more concerned about inflation.  Those inflation concerns seemed to be assuaged by the release of the FOMC minutes and speeches by several Federal Reserve policymakers.  The expected federal funds rate at the end of 2007 rose about 25 basis points (Chart 1).  As judged from federal funds futures quotes and the Desk's survey of primary dealers, market participants appear virtually certain that the FOMC will hike the target funds rate 25 basis points at its upcoming meeting, and place high odds on another such increase at the August meeting (see the box 'Probabilities of Alternative Trajectories of Monetary Policy').  The expected policy path currently peaks near 5½ percent toward the end of this year and then slopes down gradually thereafter.  Policy uncertainty, as measured by volatilities implied by Eurodollar options, remained low over the intermeeting period, as did the implied volatility of longer-term Treasury rates.

Probabilities of Alternative Trajectories of Monetary Policy

On the assumption that at each of its next two meetings the Committee will choose either to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged or to increase it by 25 basis points, there are four possible near-term paths for monetary policy.  Quotes on federal funds futures and options can be used to solve for the implied probabilities of each of these possible paths. The time series of these probabilities since just before the last FOMC meeting are shown in the chart below.

Around the time of the May FOMC meeting, market participants apparently placed betterthan-even odds on the target federal funds rate being left unchanged at both the June and August meetings.  However, the probability of this outcome subsequently fell substantially, especially following the Chairman's comments at the International Monetary Conference, and it is now close to zero.  Early in the intermeeting period, investors had viewed a pause in June followed by a rate hike in August as possible, but the assessed chance of that outcome has dwindled to zero.  The odds of a rate hike in June followed by a pause in August rose over most of the intermeeting period, and now stand a bit below 40 percent.  The probability of rate hikes at both the June and August meetings has climbed, especially following the release of May CPI data, and is now over 60 percent.

- (2) Nominal Treasury yields showed mixed changes, on balance, over the intermeeting period:  Two-year yields rose about 25 basis points, consistent with the increase in near-term policy expectations.  However, forward rates at maturities of five years and beyond were little changed, leaving ten-year coupon yields up only about 10 basis points.  Inflation compensation calculated from yields on nominal and indexed Treasury securities fell about 10 basis points across the maturity spectrum. This drop, which was consistent with a decline in some survey measures of inflation expectations and reversed most of the increase posted earlier in the spring, appears to have been a reaction to statements by Federal Reserve officials suggesting a willingness to tighten policy in order to contain inflation risks, as well as to soft readings on economic activity and perhaps also to lower commodity prices.
- (3) The expectation of less robust economic performance and more substantial near-term monetary policy tightening apparently led investors to mark down their longer-term outlook for corporate earnings and, perhaps, to require more compensation for risk.  Major stock price indexes fell 5 to 9 percent over the intermeeting period, and a rough measure of the equity premium-the gap between the twelve-month forward trend earnings-price ratio and the real perpetuity Treasury yield-widened somewhat (Chart 2).  Actual and options-implied volatilities on equities jumped over the intermeeting period, in contrast to implied volatilities of interest rates.  Spreads over Treasuries on investment-grade corporate bonds rose about 15 basis points, and those on speculative-grade issues rose around 35 basis points, but both stayed narrow by the standards of recent years.  Broad measures of corporate credit quality generally continued to be favorable over the intermeeting period, and expected year-ahead defaults remained very low.
- (4) Investors' confidence in the strength of the global expansion also flagged during the intermeeting period, a shift that was associated with substantial fluctuations in financial markets around the world.  Share prices in many industrial countries

recorded net declines of 6 to 11 percent (Chart 3).  Yields on long-term government securities were little changed on net in most major industrial countries, but in Japan they dropped 15 basis points.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar varied modestly over the period, declining in late May in reaction to the release of softerthan-expected U.S. economic data but more than recouping that loss this month in response to changes in relative returns associated partly with expressions of the FOMC's resolve against inflationary pressures.  BOJ authorities re-emphasized that any rise in policy rates will be gradual, and the dollar rose 5 percent versus the yen. Against the euro, the dollar gained about 1¾ percent over the period, as market participants interpreted ECB officials' statements associated with the 25 basis point tightening in June as consistent with a slightly lower path for policy going forward than had been anticipated.  The dollar appreciated 1½ percent against the Canadian dollar.  On balance, the trade-weighted exchange value of the dollar against major foreign currencies rose about 2¼ percent over the intermeeting period. 2

- (5) The cooling in equity markets in industrial countries was accompanied by a more pronounced chill in many emerging markets.  Brazilian and Mexican stock prices fell 17 percent over the period, and their EMBI+ spreads widened about 30 to 40 basis points.  The dollar gained almost 9 percent against the real and about 5 percent against the peso.  Stock prices in many Asian emerging markets also declined sharply during the period.  The dollar gained 2 to 7 percent against currencies of Asian countries with flexible exchange rates.  Central banks in a large number of emerging market economies firmed policy during the period, in some cases by substantially more than markets had expected.  Overall, the dollar rose 2¾ percent against an index of currencies of our other important trading partners.

- (6) Growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial businesses is estimated to have slowed a little in the second quarter to an 8½ percent annual rate (Chart 4).  This deceleration largely reflected some moderation in cash-financed mergers from the extraordinary first-quarter pace.  Commercial paper issuance has been weak so far in the current quarter, but growth of business loans has remained brisk.  Net issuance of corporate bonds has continued to be solid.  In the household sector, debt growth this quarter appears to have dropped below the double-digit rate that has prevailed for some time, as further increases in mortgage rates, the softening in housing activity, and a more moderate pace of house price appreciation have tempered the volume of mortgage borrowing.  Consumer credit has remained tepid in the current quarter.  In the federal sector, higher-than-anticipated tax payments have reduced the Treasury's borrowing needs.  Overall, domestic nonfinancial sector debt is estimated to have decelerated notably to a 6¼ percent rate in the second quarter.
- (7) M2 growth in the second quarter, at 2¾ percent, has been weak, as nominal income growth has apparently slowed and the lagged cumulative effects of increases in opportunity costs have continued to sap M2 demand.  Liquid deposits have remained particularly soft, as rates on these instruments adjust only slowly to rising short-term rates.  Overall, M2 velocity is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second quarter.

Economic Outlook

- (8) The staff's reading of incoming data over the intermeeting period implies a less favorable starting point for the Greenbook forecast, with real GDP growth notably lower in the current quarter and inflation higher.  In particular, the bulge in core inflation is expected to be a bit larger and to last longer than in the May projection.  The staff forecast is now predicated on the federal funds rate moving up to 5¼ percent in June and staying there over the next one-and-one-half years, up ¼ percentage point from the previous Greenbook.  The assumed policy path keeps longer-term Treasury yields at around current levels over the forecast period.  In the staff outlook, stock prices again rise at about a 6½ percent annual rate, but from a level that is 7 percent lower than in May, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar is again assumed to decline 2 percent per year, albeit from a somewhat higher point. In line with futures quotes, the price of WTI crude oil rises $2.50 by the end of this year and then is little changed in 2007, a path $4 to $6 lower than in the last forecast. Against this backdrop, the staff projects real GDP to increase at a 2¾ percent pace over the next six quarters, somewhat slower than in the May Greenbook.  With output expanding more slowly than its potential, the unemployment rate rises to 5¼ percent by the end of the forecast horizon, a little above the staff's estimate of the NAIRU.  This slack offsets only part of the impetus from the upside surprises in recent inflation releases, and the staff has increased its forecast of total and core PCE inflation to 2½ percent in 2006 and 2¼ percent in 2007.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Longer-Run Scenarios

- (9) Longer-run aspects of monetary policy strategies-including the selection of an inflation goal and the relative weight placed on different stabilization objectivescan be informed by simulations of the FRB/US model.  This analysis starts by constructing an illustrative extension of the current Greenbook projection through 2012, in which the natural rate of unemployment is assumed to hold steady at 5 percent and the equilibrium real funds rate has a medium-run value of about 2¾ percent.  The optimal policy balances three objectives:  keeping core PCE inflation close to a long-run goal; keeping unemployment close to its natural rate; and avoiding abrupt changes in the federal funds rate.   The optimal path of the funds rate 3 is determined in part by the weights assigned to these three policy objectives as well as by the goal for long-run inflation; it also depends importantly on the characteristics of the extended outlook and the structure of the FRB/US model.  In this analysis, policymakers and participants in financial markets, including those in the equity, bond, and foreign exchange markets, are assumed to understand fully the forces shaping the economic outlook, whereas households and firms are assumed to form their expectations using more limited information.
- (10) To get a sense of the recent evolution of the economic outlook, the first set of simulations, shown in Chart 5, compares the policy that best accomplishes the assumed objectives and macroeconomic outcomes implied by the current outlook (solid lines) with those implied by the extended outlook at the time of the January Bluebook (dashed lines).  In each of these simulations, policymakers are assumed to have a long-run inflation goal of 1½ percent and to place equal weights on the three

stabilization objectives.   As shown in the upper-left panel, the current outlook 4 implies a funds rate path that peaks a bit above 5½ percent in mid-2007 and then declines gradually to about 4½ percent by 2010.  This policy keeps the five-year real Treasury rate (upper-right panel) above its equilibrium value, thereby helping to restrain aggregate demand and pushing the unemployment rate (center panel) nearly ½ percentage point above its natural rate later in the decade.  Although core PCE inflation (bottom panel) exhibits a near-term bulge related to transitory effects of the increase in energy prices, the persistent mild economic slack subsequently causes inflation to decline very slowly towards the long-run goal of 1½ percent.  Chart 5 also illustrates the implications of recent unfavorable price developments, with the implied funds rate path through the end of next year having shifted up about a percentage point since January.  Furthermore, because the staff sees recent inflation surprises as only partly transitory, the medium-run policy tradeoff is less favorable now:  In these simulations, both the unemployment rate and core inflation beyond 2007 are higher than in the January outlook.

- (11) The next set of simulations, shown in Chart 6, explores the implications of alternative long-run inflation goals. The solid lines replicate those of Chart 5, in which policymakers have an inflation goal of 1½ percent, while the dashed lines depict an alternative in which policy pursues an inflation goal of 2 percent.  Both paths are computed using the current Greenbook projection and put equal weight on the three policy objectives.  Under a 2 percent goal, the funds rate remains near 5 percent throughout the remainder of the decade.  This flat trajectory largely reflects the extent to which core inflation is already close to the specified goal of 2 percent, looking beyond the transitory effects of recent energy price increases.  Accordingly, the stance of policy is set to keep the unemployment rate near its natural rate.

- (12) Chart 7 depicts the consequences of alternative choices regarding the relative weights assigned to the three policy objectives.  The solid lines replicate those of Chart 5, in which policymakers have an inflation goal of 1½ percent and place equal weights on the objectives.  A potentially unattractive implication of this specification is that attainment of the inflation objective is a long time coming, with actual inflation at the end of the decade still nearly ½ percentage point above the goal. The alternative scenario (dashed lines) depicts the outcome when policymakers place greater emphasis on the inflation objective, perhaps because of concerns-not explicitly considered in the model-that a persistent deviation of inflation from its goal could damage the Federal Reserve's credibility.   In this case, the federal funds 5 rate climbs more steeply to 6 percent by the end of next year.  This policy generates higher real interest rates that damp real activity more than under the baseline policy; as a result, the unemployment rate rises above 5½ percent late next year and remains above that level through 2010.  With this additional economic slack, actual inflation exhibits a more distinct downward trajectory and approaches the long-run goal by the end of the decade.

Short-Run Policy Alternatives

- (13) This Bluebook presents three alternatives for the Committee's consideration, summarized by the draft statements in Table 1.  Under Alternative A, the Committee would leave the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting and indicate that it would likely stay its hand for at least one more meeting before deciding whether further tightening was necessary.  Under Alternative B, the Committee would tighten 25 basis points and signal that an additional tightening in August was possible. Alternative C combines a 50 basis point increase in the target with a statement suggesting that additional firming was likely.
- (14) If the Committee finds the staff forecast both probable and as desirable as can be achieved in current circumstances, it may choose to tighten policy 25 basis points at this meeting, as in Alternative B .  A 25 basis point firming would raise the real federal funds rate somewhat above most of the staff's estimates of the equilibrium federal funds rate (Chart 8), a moderately restraining stance of policy that might be viewed as appropriate given the worsening of the inflation outlook.  Such a firming might also be seen as necessary to contain the risk that the near-term bulge in inflation could become entrenched in expectations.  In that regard, members might be heartened by the fact that the building market expectation of additional policy firming in recent weeks was associated with some apparent decline in inflation expectationsprogress that they might be loathe to surrender by surprising investors with an easierthan-anticipated policy action.  The current configuration of asset prices, however, might be judged as embedding too great a likelihood of policy tightening at the August meeting.  If so, the Committee would presumably seek to craft its statement to convey an assessment that an additional move in August was possible but perhaps not as likely as currently anticipated in financial markets.
- (15) Under Alternative B, the rationale paragraph could indicate that economic growth appears to be moderating.  The Committee could list the developments adding

Notes: Confidence intervals reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential output. The final column indicates the values for the current quarter based on the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-consistent measure and the actual real funds rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook.

Equilibrium Real Rate Chart: Explanatory Notes

The equilibrium real rate is the real federal funds rate that, if maintained, would be projected to return output to its potential level over time.  For the first three measures listed below, the short-run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model's projection of the economy.  For the first two measures, the medium-run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter.  The TIPS-based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead.  The actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation, where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate, and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff's estimate of the core PCE price index and its lagged value four quarters earlier.  For the current quarter, the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the Bluebook publication date.

to inflation pressure, including taut resource markets and elevated oil and commodity prices, and acknowledge the recent pickup in core inflation.  The rationale could also note the forces acting to reduce inflation pressures, such as the subdued increases in unit labor costs and the continued containment of inflation expectations.  To indicate that further tightening was possible but not certain, the assessment of risk could note that, while forces that should restrain inflation were at work, the risks to inflation continued to be on the upside.  The Committee could again note that any further policy action will depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.

- (16) Market participants are somewhat more confident that the Committee will tighten at its August meeting than the wording of Alternative B suggests.  As a result, investors would trim back their near-term policy expectations, and short-term interest rates would probably decline slightly.  The policy surprise might add to expected volatility, as market participants became a little less sure of the predictability of the Committee's behavior.  The downward revision to expectations would tend to lower longer-term yields, but some of that decline might be offset by a backup in term premiums.  Stock prices would likely rally some, and downward pressure on the foreign exchange value of the dollar could emerge.
- (17) The Committee might instead desire a more forceful policy response to the deterioration in the inflation outlook and find some appeal in the 50 basis point tightening of Alternative C .  Although measures of inflation expectations have edged lower on balance in recent weeks, they have risen since earlier this year, potentially adding momentum to actual inflation.  Moreover, resource utilization appears to be relatively high, and some policymakers have noted that inflation is already above a range they see as consistent with price stability.  In these circumstances, the Committee might be concerned by the risk that the recently higher readings on inflation could get embedded in inflation expectations along the lines of the 'rising inflation expectations' alternative simulation in the Greenbook.  The Committee may

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

also favor a more sizable move now so as to make more rapid progress toward moving inflation lower.  In the alternative policy simulation presented earlier, the pursuit of a 1½ percent inflation target requires additional tightening in the near term, especially so if inflation deviations receive a higher relative weight in the FOMC's objective function.  If policymakers believed that additional firming, beyond a 50 basis point policy move at this meeting, probably would be necessary, they may find it appropriate to indicate a fairly high likelihood that further tightening was in train. Such an indication may be particularly appealing if firmer financial conditions were judged to be desirable to make satisfactory progress toward the Committee's objectives.

- (18) The rationale paragraph under Alternative C could place more emphasis on the recent unwelcome pickup in inflation while noting that productivity gains and contained inflation expectations are restraining inflation.  To signal that further tightening is likely, the risk assessment could indicate that additional policy action may be needed to reduce core inflation to a more desirable level.  So that the Committee would not become locked into additional tightening even if there were additional elevated monthly readings on core inflation, the assessment could specify that the reduction in core inflation was sought in the medium term and repeat that the extent and timing of firming would depend on the evolution of the economic outlook.
- (19) The announcement of Alternative C would lead market participants to revise upward their outlook for the path for policy, and short- and intermediate-term interest rates would rise as a result.  Longer-term interest rates could also rise, especially if investors concluded that the FOMC was much more worried about underlying inflation than previously thought.  Stock prices would fall substantially, and the foreign exchange value of the dollar would increase.
- (20) If, in contrast, the Committee is particularly concerned by the soft tone to the incoming data on spending, it might feel that the best course of action at this

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

meeting would be to leave the stance of policy unchanged, as in Alternative A .  With news on spending and prices pointing in different directions, the Committee could combine such a policy move with statement language implying that policy would likely be on hold in the near term to await additional information, although policy firming was likely at some point down the road.  Leaving policy unchanged at the current meeting would be consistent with the prescriptions from a number of simple and estimated policy rules (Charts 9 and 10).  Indeed, most of those rules call for an easier policy than currently priced into financial markets, suggesting that the level of the federal funds rate may have already been brought up enough to prevent an unsustainable spurt in economic growth.  Staff estimates of equilibrium real interest rates indicate that cumulative tightening to date has effectively removed policy accommodation.  Given the lags in policy, the easing of pressures on resources expected to result from this prior tightening, together with the anticipated flattening out of energy prices, may be seen as likely to be sufficient to point inflation down toward an acceptable range.  Moreover, the Committee may see significant downside risk to the outlook if it views the recent marked declines of indicators of housing activity as possible harbingers of a prolonged and sizable reduction in housing construction and household spending along the lines of the 'housing slump' Greenbook scenario.

- (21) To explain a choice to leave policy unchanged, the rationale paragraph could emphasize the considerable slowdown in economic activity.  That slowing, anchored inflation expectations, and subdued advances in labor costs could be cited as reasons why the recently elevated readings on core inflation, while unwelcome, should prove transitory.  The risk assessment could reflect the Committee's concerns by indicating downside risks to growth and upside risks to inflation, which would justify a pause in policy to await additional information bearing on the outlook.

Policy Rule Charts: Explanatory Notes

For the rules described below, i t denotes the federal funds rate for quarter  , while the explanatory t variables include the staff's estimate of trailing four-quarter core PCE inflation ( π t ), its forecasts of inflation two and three quarters ahead ( π t+2|t and π t+3|t ), its assessment of the current output gap ( * t t y y -), its one-quarter-ahead forecast of the output gap ( * 1| 1| t t t t y y + + -), its three-quarter-ahead forecast of annual average GDP growth relative to potential ( 4 4 * 3| 3| t t t t y y + + Δ - Δ ), and the assumed value of policymakers' long-run inflation objective ( * π ).

Rule prescriptions are computed using dynamic simulations of the FRB/US model, implemented as though the rule is followed starting at this FOMC meeting.  This quarter's prescription is a weighted average of the actual value of the federal funds rate thus far this quarter and the value obtained from the FRB/US model simulations using the timing of this meeting within the quarter to determine the weights. Finally, for the forecast-based rule and the first-difference rule, it should be noted that prescriptions near the end of the Greenbook horizon also depend on an extension of the Greenbook baseline forecast.

Estimated Policy Rules :  Estimation is performed using real-time quarterly data taken from the Greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter.  The specific lag structure of the outcome-based rule is chosen according to the Bayesian information criterion over the sample period starting from 1988Q1.  The forecast-based rule differs from the outcome-based rule in that it also permits staff forecasts of inflation and the output gap to be among the explanatory variables. Confidence intervals, shown only for the outcome-based rule, are based on stochastic simulations of the FRB/US model, where the shocks are randomly drawn from the set of model equations residuals for the period 1986-2004.  The following table indicates the specification of each rule and its root mean squared error (RMSE) over the sample 1993:1-2005:4.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

- (22) Markets would be surprised, to say the least, if the Committee left the stance of policy unchanged, and short-term interest rates would drop.  Longer-term interest rates could rise if market participants concluded that the FOMC was willing to tolerate a higher level of inflation over time than had previously been thought and so marked up inflation compensation.  The foreign exchange value of the dollar would probably fall.  Stock prices likely would rise, given the lower real interest rates.

Money and Debt Forecasts

- (23) Under the Greenbook forecast, M2 is expected to expand just 4 percent in 2006, reflecting the moderate growth in nominal income and the restraining effects of past policy tightenings (Table 2).  With short-term interest rates unchanged after the June meeting, opportunity costs gradually level out, and M2 growth picks up to 5 percent in 2007, matching the growth in nominal income.
- (24) Growth of domestic nonfinancial sector debt is projected to drop from 9½ percent last year to 8 percent in 2006 and 6½ percent in 2007.  The slowdown reflects the contours of the staff outlook for nominal GDP and, in the near term, a reduction in federal debt growth owing to the surprisingly strong tax receipts this spring.  In addition, merger and acquisition activity is expected to moderate next year, contributing to a decline in business borrowing.  Moreover, past increases in home mortgage rates and the projected deceleration of home prices restrain household debt growth over the forecast horizon.

Directive and Balance of  Risks Statement

- (25) Draft language for the directive and draft risk assessments identical to those presented in Table 1 are provided below.

Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with MAINTAINING/increasing/REDUCING the federal funds rate AT/to an average of around ________________ 5 percent.

Risk Assessments

- A. The Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of price stability remain tilted to the upside but recognizes that the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand, along with other forces, should work to contain inflation going forward.  While the Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks, considerable uncertainty attends the outlook, making it prudent to await the accumulation of additional information.
- B. Although the moderation in the growth of aggregate demand should help to contain inflation pressures, the Committee judges that the risks to the attainment of price stability remain tilted to the upside.  The extent and timing of any further policy action will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to support the attainment of sustainable economic growth and price stability.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

- C. In order to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth, the Committee seeks a medium-term decline in core inflation from its recent elevated levels.  The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to accomplish this outcome.  The extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.

Inflation Indicator Based on M2

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1. Change in the implicit GDP price deflator over the previous four quarters.

Note: P* is defined to equal M2 times V* divided by potential GDP. V*, or long-run velocity, is estimated using average velocity over the 1959:Q1-to-1989:Q4 period and then, after a break, over the interval from 1993:Q1 to the present. For the forecast period, P* is based on the staff M2 forecast and P is simulated using a short-run dynamic model relating P to P*. Blue areas indicate periods in which P* is notably less than P. Gray areas denote the projection period.
