MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

- (1) Market participants had largely anticipated the Committee's decision at its January meeting to leave the target federal funds rate unchanged and to retain the statement that the balance of risks was weighted toward economic weakness, but the accompanying press release was apparently read as suggesting optimism about the course of the economy going forward.  In response, most interest rates edged higher that day.  Over the intermeeting period, data on spending and output have come in considerably above market expectations and a fiscal stimulus package has been enacted, leading investors to see the economy as likely rebounding more rapidly than had been thought, a view reinforced by the Chairman's monetary policy testimony. As a result, market participants seem confident that there will be no change in the intended federal funds rate at this meeting, and a majority reportedly expect the Committee to shift its risk assessment to balance.  Judging by fed funds futures rates, market participants now place significant odds on policy tightening at the May meeting and have boosted their anticipated path for policy going forward as much as 55 basis points (Chart 1).  Eurodollar futures rates suggest that a cumulative tightening of about 300 basis points is expected by late next year.
- (2) Implied forward rates on Treasury securities at intermediate- and longer-term maturities also have risen appreciably over the intermeeting period.   In 1

part, investors have probably built in higher real interest rates over the longer run in light of incoming data on spending and activity suggesting more impetus to aggregate demand, increases in equity wealth, and higher estimates of underlying productivity growth.  In addition, inflation expectations may have moved up in response to the more rapid rebound in economic activity now foreseen, as well as the recent runup in oil prices, although the evidence is mixed.  A survey measure of household inflation expectations has only edged up, but inflation compensation as measured by the spread of nominal over indexed yields has risen substantially.   On balance, nominal yields on 2 Treasury coupon securities have risen 35 to 55 basis points since the January meeting. Yields on high-grade corporate bonds have generally risen a bit less, and broad measures of speculative-grade yields have actually fallen as the improved economic outlook led investors to trim their assessment of credit risk.  The better outlook also has boosted equity prices, with broad indexes up about 4-1/2 percent since the January meeting (Chart 2).  The telecommunications and technology sectors have performed less well, however, as concerns about accounting practices and lowered earnings forecasts have weighed on the bond and equity prices of some firms in these industries.  Accounting worries also contributed to the effective exclusion of a few more firms from the commercial paper market and widened risk spreads in that market.

- (3) The major currencies index of the exchange value of the dollar has declined 1-1/2 percent on balance since the January FOMC meeting.  The dollar came under downward pressure in early March after the President's decision to impose steel

tariffs, perhaps as that move raised concerns about official policy toward the dollar. With the exception of Japan, monetary policy in other industrial countries has remained on hold, while interest rates on long-term government securities have moved up about 20 to 30 basis points, and stock prices have moved higher.  The dollar fell most sharply against the yen-about 3-1/2 percent-despite negative economic news from Japan and a government 'anti-deflation' package that proved disappointing.  Japanese stock prices have rallied sharply, rising more than 10 percent during the intermeeting period, buoyed perhaps by new restrictions on short sales of stock as well as by strengthening in global equity markets. 3

- (4) The index of the exchange value of the dollar versus the currencies of our other important trading partners has changed little over the intermeeting period. In Argentina, the peso depreciated steeply when foreign exchange markets there reopened on February 11 following an extended bank holiday; the peso has declined almost 60 percent since Argentina abandoned its pegged exchange rate regime in early January.  The Brazilian real and Mexican peso have appreciated somewhat against the dollar, and stock prices in both countries have risen over the intermeeting period. Share prices in tech-heavy emerging Asian markets have posted even larger gains, in part on continued expectations that the global electronics market will particularly benefit from a U.S. economic recovery.  Although the EMBI+ spread for Argentina widened, those for other emerging markets have narrowed about 120 basis points on average during the intermeeting period as the global economic outlook improved.
- (5) Borrowing by domestic nonfinancial sectors appears to have picked up a bit of late, reflecting stronger demand and, aside from a few specific problem spots, no further reductions in credit availability.  Net borrowing by nonfinancial businesses

in the bond, commercial paper, and bank loan markets combined, which was negligible in January, rose to about $13-1/2 billion in February, a slightly faster pace than in the second half of last year (Chart 3).  Much of the increase owed to a rise in net bond issuance, as businesses continued to substitute bonds for shorter-term sources of funds.  Offerings by investment-grade firms have been particularly heavy. By contrast, heightened concerns about accounting practices and the record default rate on bonds may have made investors wary about high-yield securities, and net issuance in that market in February was at the low end of its recent range.  In early March, net bond issuance appears to have remained robust, with the bulk again coming from investment-grade firms.  Commercial and industrial loans at banks posted a substantial gain in February after four months of sizable declines.  However, some of this rise reflected draws on commercial paper backup lines by a few large firms after concerns about their accounting practices forced them to pay down commercial paper.  Household borrowing appears to have remained relatively robust this year.  Consumer credit expanded at a 9-1/4 percent pace in January, a bit faster than in the fourth quarter, as auto sales-while well off the record pace posted last fall-held up fairly well.  Although the pace of mortgage refinancing has fallen back considerably, it remains elevated, and with housing activity still brisk, applications for mortgage loans to purchase houses have stayed above their level in the fourth quarter. Growth in Treasury debt, which had been modest in December and January, picked up noticeably in February. 4

M2 Velocity and Opportunity Cost

<!-- missing-text -->

- (6) M2 growth rebounded to a 6-1/2 percent annual rate in February, after running at just a 2-1/4 percent pace in January.  Nonetheless, money growth thus far this year has slowed considerably from its robust pace over the last two months of 2001, likely owing in part to the waning influence of prior declines in opportunity costs on holding M2 assets.  Retail money market mutual funds, which accounted for much of the deceleration in M2, appear to have been depressed by a shift into bond and equity funds as concerns about volatility in financial markets ebbed.  The slower pace of mortgage refinancings also has contributed to the deceleration in M2.

Policy Alternatives

- (7) Stronger-than-expected economic data and the passage of a fiscal stimulus package have led the staff to mark up its forecast for spending and output appreciably since the January meeting.  As in the prior forecast, the staff assumes that the federal funds rate will be held at 1-3/4 percent through the first half of this year. Thereafter, however, the funds rate rises sooner and more steeply, reaching 4 percent by the end of 2003.  While the assumed tightening is less pronounced than that currently built into market rates, longer-term Treasury yields and mortgage rates are anticipated to remain close to current levels through 2003.  Corporate yields are projected to edge lower as the improving economic outlook leads investors to mark down their assessments of credit risk, and stock prices are projected to rise a bit faster than nominal GDP.  These changes in domestic financial conditions, along with the firming in underlying demand, are projected to be consistent with growth of output above that of the staff's upwardly revised estimate of potential GDP growth.  By late 2003, the output gap is about eliminated and the unemployment rate falls to about 51/4 percent, around staff estimates of the NAIRU.  In the interim, though, the persistent output gap contributes to a slight downtrend in core PCE inflation.  Total PCE inflation, responding largely to higher oil prices, rises a bit over the forecast period.
- (8) Unless the Committee's sense of the outlook differs materially from that embodied in the staff forecast, it might be inclined to keep the federal funds rate unchanged at this meeting.  In the staff forecast, holding the funds rate steady for a little while longer is consistent with both unemployment and core inflation edging lower.  Even if the Committee suspects that policy may have to be firmed sooner than assumed in the staff forecast, the uncertainty regarding the strength of the rebound may make it particularly advantageous to await further readings on the economy

before acting, especially given the lack of evident pressures on resources.  If so, selection of the balance-of-risks statement to accompany an unchanged target funds rate may be the primary focus of the Committee's discussion at this meeting.  (A box on the next page discusses the balance of risks in more detail.)  This bluebook will consider the three possibilities for the balance-of-risk statement given an unchanged funds rate and touch upon two policy choices bracketing an unchanged policy-easing or tightening 1/4 percentage point.

- (9) If the Committee remains mostly concerned about the possibility that the recovery could falter, it might wish to hold the funds rate unchanged and retain a balance of risks weighted toward economic weakness .  The recent spate of stronger-than-expected economic news might stem importantly from a reversal of the temporary depressing effects of the terrorist attacks on aggregate demand, with the pace of growth going forward quite possibly weaker.  In the staff forecast, the abatement of the inventory runoff accounts for a considerable portion of the strength in GDP growth over the next few quarters, implying that growth of final demand is noticeably below that of GDP.  The forecasted pickup in final demand over the second half of 2002 and in 2003 depends importantly on continued solid growth in consumer spending-which leaves the personal saving rate at a level that is quite low by the standards of all but the past few years-and a turnaround in investment that is far from assured.  Concerns about the strength of final demand, coupled with the possibility that the economy might be able to operate at higher levels of labor utilization without engendering inflation pressures than assumed in the staff forecast, might be viewed as providing the Committee with ample scope to pursue a more accommodative policy.  Indeed, such concerns may be sufficiently worrisome to justify easing 1/4 percentage point at this meeting (presumably while retaining the balance of risks tilted toward economic weakness).  In this view, failing to ease may

The Balance-of-Risks Statement

As noted in the main text, market participants are split on the balance of risks that the Committee will announce at the conclusion of this meeting, with a majority expecting a shift to a neutral risk assessment.  In principle, the Committee's decision on the balance of risks would seem to depend on three determinations.  First, it must weigh the implications for the appropriate setting of the policy rate of likely deviations from its twin goals of maximum employment and price stability.  Second, the Committee must assess the distribution of outcomes around that forecast-that is, the skew of potential shocks.  And lastly, the Committee would seem to need to form some assessment of the length of the time period over which this balance should be weighed-that is, how far ahead does the 'foreseeable future' stretch.

All three judgments are inherently subjective and hard to disentangle, but, given the brief history of announcing a risk assessment, investors will be particularly keen to interpret whatever the Committee decides at the this meeting-combined with how policy actually evolves over subsequent meetings-as a precedent regarding the time span covered by the foreseeable future.  By design, the balance-of-risk statement was not supposed necessarily to predict policy action at the next meeting, so it would seem that the horizon of the foreseeable future extends past May.  Just how far past May the foreseeable future extends is an open question, the answer to which depends on the Committee's confidence in its ability to predict events increasingly distant in time.  That, in turn, should be related to the Committee's assessment of the imbalances that exist at the start of the forecast period and the distribution of potential shocks.  At a time when uncertainties about the outlook may be especially elevated, the foreseeable future might be measured in quarters, not years.

ultimately induce inflation that is viewed as too low to provide an adequate cushion to set negative real federal funds rates if needed in the future to counteract the effects of adverse demand shocks.

- (10) By contrast, the Committee might be inclined to hold the funds rate unchanged and adopt a neutral balance of risks at this meeting if it is more confident that the growth of output will be around its potential and sees inflation as contained.  The especially adverse outcomes for the economy that the Committee was worried about at the prior few meetings may seem much less likely now.  Indeed, in recent weeks, data surprises have nearly all run on the upside, supporting the view that

risks are no longer skewed toward economic weakness.  Unlike the outlook at the time of the January meeting, the Greenbook forecast shows less overall slack in resource utilization, little updrift in the unemployment rate, and less of a downtrend to inflation.  To be sure, the real funds rate is unsustainably low, and if the nominal funds rate were held at its current level for very long, inflation would begin to intensify.  But as discussed in the box on the balance of risks, heightened uncertainty about the outlook could have the effect of making the horizon over which the Committee defines the foreseeable future relatively limited.  And in that shorter run, at least according to the staff forecast, inflation is likely to drift lower and output growth will be a tad above that of its potential.

(11) If the Committee reads the strength of recent economic indicators as signaling that lasting economic growth above potential is a distinct likelihood, it might wish to hold the funds rate unchanged and move the balance of risks toward heightened inflation pressures .   With the economy seeming to have regained its footing, the Committee might view a balance toward inflation as especially appropriate in light of the unsustainably low level of the real funds rate, the recent uptick in measures of inflation expectations based on Treasury inflation-indexed securities, and the possibility that sharp increases in oil prices could feed through to prices and wages more generally.  Indeed, the surprising resilience exhibited by the economy of late raises the possibility that spending may snap back more rapidly than in the Greenbook.  If the Committee were especially concerned that, if it did not move promptly to begin to restore the funds rate to more sustainable levels, inflation pressures could build over time to the point that they would be difficult to contain, it might even choose to implement a quarter-point increase in the target funds rate along with a balance of risks weighted toward inflation pressures.  In particular, the apparent turnaround of demand in the high-tech sector, favorable news on

productivity, accelerator effects stemming from the recent pickup in output growth, and the business tax incentives included in the fiscal stimulus package might be imparting an even more sizable impetus to investment spending than in the staff forecast.  Forces such as these help to explain why some measures of the equilibrium real funds rate have been boosted as much as a half a percentage point over the intermeeting period (Chart 4).  Such an increase in estimates of the equilibrium real funds rate implies that just maintaining the same degree of policy stimulus would require increasing the nominal funds rate target.

- (12) Market participants widely expect the funds rate to be held constant at this meeting and increasingly are looking for the FOMC to characterize the risks to the outlook as symmetric.  Retention of a balance of risks weighted toward economic weakness would surprise many, and would probably pull interest rates modestly lower. The outcome for equity prices and exchange rates is more difficult to gauge and no doubt would be influenced by the wording of the announcement:  If investors see the FOMC's statement as evidencing its desire to see output return to potential more quickly than they had previously anticipated, they might mark up their outlook for profits, and stock prices could accordingly rise.  Any initial decline in the dollar might be offset to some degree by the associated increased attractiveness of U.S. financial assets.  But there is also a chance that investors could read the FOM C's policy statement as presaging a weaker economy than they had anticipated.  This possibility would be even more likely if the Committee caught market participants unawares by easing 1/4 percentage point.  In either event, stock prices could fall and that decline, in turn, would tend to reinforce the initial decline in interest rates.
- (13) The selection of a neutral balance of risks would be in line with the expectations of the majority of market participants, but some investors would still be surprised by the decision.  The effects in financial markets in this case would likely be

rather muted but might encompass a small increase in interest rates, a drop in stock prices, and a small rise in the foreign exchange value of the dollar.

- (14) Market participants do not expect a move to a balance of risks toward inflation pressures at this meeting, much less one accompanied by a quarter-point increase in the target funds rate.  As a result, either choice would push interest rates higher across the term structure while equities could come under heavy selling pressure.  The extent of the market reaction could be sizable and, of course, would depend importantly on the wording of the announcement and the associated market perceptions about the future course of policy.  In particular, the reaction in markets could be attenuated if the wording of the announcement emphasized that the Committee viewed itself as merely unwinding some of the insurance it had taken out late last year at a time of unusual uncertainty, and that it intended to wait thereafter, rather than embark on a path that would promptly realign the real interest rate to a more normal level.
- (15) M2 growth is projected to slow this year to a pace somewhat above that of nominal GDP.  The waning stimulus from past policy easings, considerably wider opportunity costs later this year accompanying the assumed tightening of policy, and more attractive returns on equities and other market instruments are key factors contributing to the anticipated deceleration of M2.  Next year, the further assumed tightening of policy and the associated widening of opportunity costs pulls M2 growth well below that of nominal GDP, implying a significant increase in velocity.
- (16) Total domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to advance at about a 5-1/2 percent pace over the first two quarters of this year.  Given the strength of readings from recent economic indicators, the pace of business borrowing is projected to increase over coming months, spurred by a pickup in investment spending and an associated widening of the financing gap.  The improvement in the economy should,

over time, contribute to improved credit quality in the business sector and narrower risk spreads.  Borrowing by households is likely to slow somewhat in line with an anticipated ebbing of the demand for autos and new homes.  Federal debt is projected to advance at about a 3-1/2 percent rate over the first half of this year and at a somewhat faster rate in the latter half of the year.  Next year, federal debt growth drops off sharply with the economic recovery returning the federal budget to surplus by the second quarter of the year.
