MONETARY POLICY ALTERNATIVES

Recent Developments

(1)  The Committee's decision to  leave the funds rate unchanged at the August meeting was anticipated by  market participants and thus had little effect on  market interest rates. With incoming information on  balance confirming earlier indications that the economic expansion was moderating and inflation remaining subdued, the asymmetric tilt in  the directive was not utilized and the intended funds rate was  maintained at 5-1/4 percent during the intermeeting period. Federal funds have generally traded near the intended rate. Indeed, despite further reductions in  required operating balances owing to new  sweeps of  retail deposits, volatility of  the daily effective funds rate around its intended rate remains relatively low; some unpredictable late-in-the-day tightness in  the  funds rate has occurred, however.

(2)  In  the weeks following the FOMC meeting, market interest rates rose somewhat (chart), reversing their declines of  early August, as  output growth was seen to  have more momentum than had been anticipated and  press reports suggested increased concern among Committee members about the outlook for inflation. Credit markets rallied in mid-September on  favorable inflation reports and sluggish retail sales data, but gave back part of  their gains, particularly at  the short end, after a  wire service reported that a  number of  Reserve Banks had requested discount rate increases. On  balance over the intermeeting period, short-term interest rates have risen about 10  to 15 basis

points, while intermediate- and long-term rates  are up 20 to  25 basis points. Recent  surveys of short-  and  long-term inflation expectations (available through August for professional forecasters and  September for  households) show essentially no  evidence of a rise  (chart). Federal funds  futures  contracts now suggest a two-thirds chance of a 1/4  point  increase in the  funds  rate at  the  September FOMC meeting, while Eurodollar futures  rates  seem to imply  only a modest  amount of tightening through next year,  once likely term premiums  are taken into account  (chart). Equity markets rebounded over the  period, with major indexes up around  2 to  3 percent to  record highs;  small-cap  stocks rose  smartly but  remained below records  set  earlier this  year.

(3)  Reflecting in  part the  increase in U.S. interest  rates, the  dollar's weighted-average exchange value  rose almost  1 percent over  the intermeeting period  (chart). Declines in market interest rates  abroad also contributed to  a firmer dollar, as  foreign ten-year rates fell  15  basis points  and three-month  rates  dropped 25  basis points,  on  average. Official lending  rates were  lowered by several central banks,  including the  Bundesbank and the Bank of Canada. Canadian, German, and U.K. stock indexes  recovered to  or exceeded previous highs, while those in Japan, France, and Italy  remained well below recent peaks, as  investors were  apparently less  optimistic about prospects for economic  activity in the latter group  of countries.

; the Desk again did not inter- vene.

(4) Broad money growth picked up in August, but by somewhat less  than projected at  the  time of the last  FOMC meeting.  M2 grew at a 3-3/4 percent  rate, leaving  it  in the upper portion of its  1 to  5

percent annual range. Liquid deposits continued to run off, but at a slower pace than in  July. 2 Retail money funds grew rapidly, as their yields eased more gradually than  market rates in early August. Small time deposits, whose rates had increased appreciably in spring and early summer in  lagged response to upward movements in  market rates, posted a  solid gain. Little substitution between these M2 components and capital market mutual funds was evident, as stock fund flows resumed in strength and  bond fund flows also picked up in August. 3

- (5) Despite a  decline in bank credit, M3 accelerated to a 5  percent growth rate in  August, leaving it somewhat below the upper end of its 2  to 6  percent annual range. With favorable yield spreads, institutional money funds posted robust growth. Large time deposits also grew rapidly, as banks continued to shift markedly away from reliance on overseas sources of funding. Data for early September suggest a  further acceleration in  both M2  and M3.

(6) Growth of  the debt of  nonfederal sectors has moderated a bit in recent months. The rate of  increase in  consumer credit has remained below that earlier this year; the  less ebullient expansion of such credit primarily reflects more moderate increases in spending on consumer durables and repayments of earlier loans, but strains on household balance sheets and less generous loan supplies also may  be

restraining borrowing some. Comprehensive data on residential mortgage borrowing lag substantially; real estate lending by  banks posted a  solid gain in  August, but, rather than additional overall strength in home mortgage borrowing, this may reflect shifts to  adjustable-rate financing, which banks tend to  hold on their books. Business borrowing has slackened somewhat, particularly in commercial paper and corporate bond markets, as hefty profits are perhaps funding a  larger share of  business investment spending. Commercial and industrial lending at  banks has strengthened in early September, and  bank business lending in  the third quarter is running ahead of its pace earlier this year, perhaps reflecting the financing of  higher levels of  inventories. Loan supply conditions are still quite favorable for businesses, and quality spreads in  securities markets remain at  historically low  levels. Outstanding state and local debt has resumed its decline since mid-year, owing to  continued retirement of advancerefunded debt and a  slackened pace of  new issues. On  the other hand, federal borrowing has picked up  a  little this summer. Growth of  total nonfinancial debt for  the year has edged down to around the midpoint of  its annual range.

Policy Alternatives

(7)  The staff has read the mixed economic data since the August FOMC meeting as still consistent with growth moderating to a pace about in line with the economy's potential, assuming that the Committee's policy stance remains unchanged through the forecast period. The outlook for output growth and the  unemployment rate for the rest of  1996 and 1997 is essentially the same as in  the last Greenbook and remains broadly consistent with the central tendencies of  the Committee members' forecasts for these variables made in  July. Recent core inflation data have been a  shade lower than the staff anticipated, but resource utilization remains high enough in  the staff forecast to  put some upward pressure on  increases in  labor costs and prices. With crude energy prices likely to be  more elevated for a time than had  been assumed and a  hike in  the minimum wage further boosting costs and prices, the staff's projection for consumer price inflation remains around the upper ends of  the Committee members' central tendencies for both years. However, the underlying profile of inflation going forward under the staff forecast may  be slightly more adverse than Committee members were expecting in  July, because they may  not have fully incorporated upcoming technical adjustments in  the consumer price index at the time they were surveyed.

(8)  The Committee thus might view such an inflation outcome as unacceptable. Nonetheless, there are reasons why the Committee might choose the unchanged federal funds rate of  alternative B  for the upcoming intermeeting period. Although labor markets are tight and wages accelerating, the extent and timing of any feedthrough of  this acceleration to overall compensation and ultimately prices remain uncertain. Real interest rates are in  the  neighborhood of  levels that

over the  past fifteen years have been associated on average with little change in inflation, and the growth of  money and credit has been moderate, suggesting perhaps that if  the stance of policy is stimulative, it  may  not be greatly so. Indeed, the staff forecast has only a  gradual pickup in  core inflation, which in  any event will start from a  level in  the third quarter that is probably lower than the Committee had anticipated. In  these circumstances, waiting to assess better the economic situation might not incur much risk of  a  significant deterioration in  inflation expectations, provided the  delay were not too long, because containing inflation will still be possible before it has risen appreciably above the general level of  recent years. Moreover, the soft cast to  the recent trend of  retail sales and continued surprisingly favorable readings on  broad price indexes may  lead the Committee to  consider the staff forecast as too pessimistic about likely inflation pressures. If  so, inflation is  more apt to be  kept within acceptable bounds without policy adjustment.

(9)  With market participants apparently placing greater than even odds on policy tightening at this meeting, interest rates would likely decline and  the dollar weaken on  foreign exchange markets if the unchanged policy of alternative B  were adopted. Even before the discount rate story earlier this  week, markets had built in close to 50/50 odds of  a  slight policy tightening, and alternative B  probably would trigger rate declines that not only reversed the increases associated with the story, but some of  those registered earlier in the intermeeting period as well. Many would likely view  the Committee as merely delaying policy action until the  November meeting rather than changing its fundamental assessment of  the potential inflation threat, and this reaction would tend to limit the decline in  long-term rates.

There is a  risk that policy inaction would induce some in  the market to question the Committee's commitment to  holding down inflation, or its willingness to  take forward-looking action to  do so, which would tend to boost inflation expectations. Given uncertainties about the outlook and the perceived lack of a  policy consensus within the Federal Reserve, markets are likely to remain highly sensitive to new economic data and to indications of  Committee members' inclinations.

(10) A  tightening of  policy at this Committee meeting, whether by  50  basis points, as assumed in  alternative C,  or  by  only 25 basis points, would improve the chances that price pressures would be contained and inflation outcomes would be consistent with the Committee  members' expectations in  July. In  the alternative scenarios in the Greenbook, an increase of  one percentage point in the  federal funds rate over the next year is sufficient to tilt core inflation down. A  25 or 50 basis point tightening at this meeting could be  seen either as a  first installment in  moving more deliberately toward lower inflation, or  as a  more limited action aimed at  holding the line. With labor markets tight and wage gains already strengthening, the Committee may  see it as only a matter of  time before total compensation puts sufficient pressure on  profit margins to prompt businesses to raise their prices faster. Especially if  aggregate demand has more momentum than in  the staff forecast, waiting for very long to  tighten, given the lags in  the effects of  monetary policy, risks embedding some rise in inflation and inflation expectations into the economy and financial markets. That result would necessitate more aggressive and potentially disruptive policy action at a later date to return inflation to recent levels.

(11) Markets participants do not  have a  25 basis point firming at this FOMC meeting fully built into the structure of interest rates, and  would be  considerably surprised by  a  50 basis point hike. Thus, some of  the former and the bulk of  the latter would be  matched by  a  rise in short-term rates. The impact on intermediateand longterm rates is less certain, especially because the firming would constitute a  reversal in  the direction of  policy. Such policy reversals in  the past have often resulted in fairly large movements in  intermediateand long-term rates. However, in  light of  signs of  moderating aggregate demand and  damped inflation, as well as statements in the Committee's published minutes, much market commentary has accepted the notion that a  reversal in  the direction of policy could be  limited in scope. Still, policy action of  any size will probably lead market participants to revise their view  of  the path of policy and build in some expectations of additional tightenings. A 1/4 point firming is more likely to leave them skittish as they expect further action soon, while the larger tightening would have a  greater immediate impact on rates. The statement accompanying the announcement of  the policy change might be able to reduce the chance that the market would come to extrapolate sizable further increases in the funds rate.

(12) Borrowing by  domestic nonfinancial sectors in  the staff forecast is expected to remain moderate over the final months of  the year. Households are anticipated to use consumer credit at around the reduced pace of recent months while growth in  mortgage indebtedness probably will decelerate in  keeping with a  slowdown in home buying. Elevated debt burdens and further selective tightening of  consumer credit availability should act as a  mild restraint on  household borrowing. Business debt growth is likely to  strengthen a  bit in  the

near term in  keeping with inventory restocking and some levelling off of cash flow. Credit is expected to remain readily available to businesses from banks and securities markets; firms with access to the bond market will probably concentrate their borrowing there, especially if  bond rates do not rise much from recent levels. With growth in federal debt fairly subdued, debt of  domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to expand at a  4-1/4 percent pace over the final four months of 1996, implying growth of  about 5 percent for the year as a whole.

(13) In  view of  slower-than-expected M2 and  M3 growth in recent months, the staff has revised down projected growth for those aggregates in 1996. M2  is now  expected to increase at a  4-1/2 percent rate this year and M3 at a  5-3/4 percent rate under alternative B, somewhat below the upper ends of  their growth ranges for the year. Over the  August-to-December period, the expansion of  M2 is projected to pick up  to about a  4-3/4 percent pace, broadly in  line with GDP growth under alternative B. The pickup in  M2 should show through to M3, and growth in the latter is forecast to strengthen to a 6 percent rate over the final four months of  this year, abetted by a  strengthening of  the expansion of  bank credit. Continued large sweeps of  other checkable deposits and demand deposits will distort measured M1. Indeed, M1 is projected to  run off at about a 5 percent annual rate over the  August-to-December period, while expansion of  sweep-adjusted M1 increases to a 6-1/2 percent rate.

(14) Presented below is  draft wording for the operational paragraph that includes the usual options for Committee consideration.

OPERATIONAL PARAGRAPH

In  the implementation of  policy for the  immediate future, the Committee seeks to DECREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY)/maintain/INCREASE (SOMEWHAT/SLIGHTLY) the existing degree of pressure on  reserve positions. In  the context of  the Committee's long-run objectives for price stability and sustainable economic growth, and giving careful consideration to  economic, financial, and  monetary developments, somewhat (SLIGHTLY) greater reserve restraint would (MIGHT) or  slightly (SOMEWHAT) lesser reserve restraint might (WOULD) be acceptable in the intermeeting period. The contemplated reserve conditions are expected to  be consistent with moderate growth in  M2 and M3 over coming months.
