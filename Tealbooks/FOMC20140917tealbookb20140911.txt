POLICY RULES USED IN 'MONETARY POLICY STRATEGIES'

The table below gives the expressions for the selected policy rules used in 'Monetary Policy Strategies.' In the table, [math] denotes the effective nominal federal funds rate for quarter t, while the right-hand-side variables include the staff's projection of trailing four-quarter core PCE  inflation for the current quarter and three quarters ahead [math], the output gap estimate for the current period as well as its one-quarter-ahead forecast [math], and the forecast of the three-quarter-ahead annual change in the output gap [math]. The value of policymakers' long-run inflation objective, denoted [math], is 2 percent. The nominal income targeting rule responds to the nominal income gap,  which is defined as the difference between nominal income [math] (100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP) and a target value [math] (100 times the log of target nominal GDP). Target nominal GDP in 2007:Q4 is set equal to the staff's current estimate of potential real GDP in that quarter multiplied by the GDP deflator in that quarter; subsequently, target nominal GDP grows 2 percentage points per year faster than the staff's estimate of potential GDP.

The first two of the selected rules were studied by Taylor (1993, 1999), while the inertial Taylor (1999) rule has been featured prominently in recent analysis by Board staff.1 The outcome-based rule uses policy reactions estimated using real-time data over the sample 1988:Q1 -2006:Q4. The intercept of the outcome-based rule was chosen so that it is consistent with a 2 percent long-run inflation objective and a long-run real interest rate of 1 3/4 percent, a value used in the FRB/US model. The intercepts of the Taylor (1993, 1999) rules and the longrun intercept of the inertial Taylor (1999) rule are set at 1 3/4 percent for the same reason. The 1 3/4 percent real rate estimate also enters the long-run intercept of the nominal income targeting rule.

The prescriptions of the first-difference rule do not depend on the level of the output gap or the long-run real interest rate; see Orphanides (2003).

prescriptions from the different policy rules are calculated using Tealbook lagged funds rate value as in the prescriptions rate, for for the policy rate thus far in the quarter.  For the subsequent quarter, these rules Near-term projections for inflation and the output gap.  For the rules that include the lagged policy rate as a right-hand-side variable-the inertial Taylor (1999) rule, the first-difference rule, the estimated outcome-based rule, and the nominal income targeting rule-the lines denoted 'Previous Tealbook outlook' report prescriptions derived from the previous Tealbook projections for inflation and the output gap, while using the same computed for the current Tealbook.  When the Tealbook is published early in the quarter, this lagged funds rate value is set equal to the actual value of the lagged funds rate in the previous quarter, and prescriptions are shown for the current quarter.  When the Tealbook is published late in the quarter, the prescriptions are shown for the next quarter, and the lagged policy each of these rules, including those that use the 'Previous Tealbook outlook,' is set equal to the average value use the lagged values from their simulated, unconstrained prescriptions.

Monetary Policy Alternatives

This Tealbook presents three alternative draft FOMC statements-labeled A, B, and C-for the Committee's consideration.  These alternatives offer options for asset purchases and forward guidance, along with different possibilities for characterizing incoming information and the outlook.

With respect to balance sheet policy, Alternatives A and B reduce monthly purchases of agency MBS and Treasury securities by another $5 billion each and indicate that the program will 'likely' be concluded at the Committee's next meeting in October. In contrast, Alternative C announces that asset purchases will conclude this month, noting the Committee's judgment that there has been 'a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market' and its anticipation 'that inflation will move toward the Committee's longer-run objective.'

Alternative B retains the June statement's forward guidance for the federal funds rate, indicating that the current range for the federal funds rate will likely remain in place 'for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends.'  Alternative C replaces the entire phrase with 'for some time.'  Alternative A replaces the current date-based guidance with an inflation floor; according to this state-dependent guidance, the Committee would anticipate maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate 'at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent.'  Under each alternative, the Committee would repeat its intention to take a 'balanced approach' when it begins to remove policy accommodation.  In all three alternatives, the Committee would also reiterate that it 'currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.'

In their descriptions of current economic conditions, all three alternatives characterize the pace of economic activity as 'moderate,' and they note that labor market conditions improved 'somewhat further,' albeit with little change in the unemployment rate.  While Alternatives A and B reaffirm that underutilization of labor resources remained 'significant,' Alternative C points to 'diminishing' underutilization.  As in the July statement, all three alternatives observe that household spending appears to be rising

moderately, business fixed investment is advancing, and the housing recovery remains slow.  Alternatives A and B maintain the reference to the restraining effects of fiscal policy; that reference is removed from the statement language proposed by Alternative C. Alternatives A and B further acknowledge that inflation recently has been running 'somewhat below' (Alternative B) or 'somewhat further below' (Alternative A) the Committee's longer-run objective.  In contrast, Alternative C offers a judgment that inflation 'appears to be moving gradually toward' that objective.  Data to be received between the publication of this Tealbook and the second day of the September FOMC meeting-in particular readings on retail sales and the CPI in August-could lead to revisions in the first paragraph of each of the draft statements.

The alternatives all reaffirm the Committee's modal forecast that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate, although Alternative A notes that convergence is expected to be gradual.  All of the alternatives state that the Committee sees the 'risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.'  Alternatives B and C indicate that the risk of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished 'since early this year.'  In contrast, Alternative A notes that risks to the outlook for inflation are 'tilted somewhat to the downside.'

Subsequent pages present the July FOMC statement, as well as complete drafts of Alternatives A, B, and C followed by supporting arguments and then draft directives.

JULY 2014 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that growth in economic activity rebounded in the second quarter.  Labor market conditions improved, with the unemployment rate declining further.  However, a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has moved somewhat closer to the Committee's longer-run objective.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat.
- 3. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in August, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $15 billion per month rather than $20 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent

on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
- 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

The Committee continues to anticipate , based on its assessment of s these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and at least as long as inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be below 2 percent, provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B

Notwithstanding some softness in recent spending and labor market data, the Committee, like the staff, might see the information received during the intermeeting period as broadly consistent with an assessment that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Furthermore, policymakers may judge that there continues to be sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to generate ongoing improvement in labor market conditions, with moderate growth in employment and economic activity supported by diminishing restraint from fiscal policy and continued monetary accommodation.  Nonetheless, in light of the smaller-than-expected gains in payroll employment during July and August, and with most measures of labor utilization little changed, policymakers may continue to judge that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  Although the unemployment rate has appreciably declined over the year and is also somewhat lower than expected at the start of year, it is still well above the central tendency of participants' longer-run projections in the June SEP.  Moreover, policymakers may regard the labor force participation rate as atypically low, even after taking into account demographic effects.  They may also see the elevated number of part-time workers who would prefer a full-time job, the still-high share of unemployed workers who have been out of work for six months or more, and modest wage increases, as supporting the judgment that there is significant scope for improvement in labor market conditions.  In addition, policymakers might interpret the recent softness in inflation as indicating that the pickup in earlier months was in part transitory and that inflation may remain below their longer-run objective for some time. Policymakers might conclude that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy is still appropriate in order to promote continued improvement in the labor market and a return of inflation to 2 percent over the medium run.  Even so, in light of the cumulative improvements in the labor market in recent years and their expectation that progress toward their objectives will continue, policymakers may judge it appropriate to make another measured reduction in the pace of asset purchases, and to prepare markets for the likely end of the purchase program in October, while maintaining the current target range for the federal funds rate and forward guidance, as in Alternative B.

Some policymakers, however, may judge that more accommodation will likely be appropriate before long.  They may be concerned not only about downside risks to inflation, but also that the persistent shortfall of inflation from the Committee's longerrun objective poses downside risks to growth.  Moreover, they may worry that recent

softness in a number of indicators-including spending, payroll gains, and consumer prices-might foreshadow further weakness.  That said, the recently softer inflation readings have evolved along the lines of earlier Tealbook projections, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained within the range observed in recent years.  While they may see somewhat greater risks of less favorable outcomes for employment and inflation than in July, those policymakers might conclude that it would be premature to alter the Committee's forward guidance regarding the likely path of the federal funds rate in the direction of providing additional accommodation.

Taking into account the cumulative gains in payroll employment since the inception of the current program of asset purchases, some policymakers may judge that the second-quarter acceleration in prices and economic activity signals rapidly diminishing slack and might prefer to conclude asset purchases at the current meeting. However, in light of the somewhat disappointing labor market data received during the intermeeting period, policymakers may be reluctant to deviate from the balance sheet path suggested by past FOMC communications, which suggested that the Committee would end the program at its October meeting.  Other policymakers may be concerned that maintaining near-zero rates for a considerable time risks pushing the unemployment rate well below levels consistent with maximum employment and fueling an undesirably large rise in inflation over the medium run.  These policymakers might point to prescriptions derived from several simple policy rules and the optimal control simulations shown in the 'Monetary Policy Strategies' section of Tealbook, Book B.  However, policymakers might question a number of the assumptions that underlie those simulation results-including the sizable penalty on changes in the federal funds rate, the assumption that policymakers have symmetric preferences, the absence of any role for considerations such as the risk of derailing a fragile housing recovery, and the asymmetric risks posed by proximity to the zero lower bound. 1,2 They might further observe that readings on 12-month PCE inflation, both overall and core, are little

changed, while wage increases have generally been modest, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.

Relatedly, some policymakers may worry that maintaining highly accommodative policies for a long period of time could lead to excessive risk-taking in the financial sector; they might point to the low levels of realized and implied volatility in financial markets, evidence of reaching-for-yield behavior, and stretched valuations in some asset markets.  However, use of short-term financing instruments and indicators of leverage remain well below levels observed ahead of the financial crisis.  And while prices of real estate and broad equity indexes have risen further, policymakers may still see valuation metrics as generally in line with historical norms.  Furthermore, policymakers may be concerned that a premature tightening would pose risks to financial stability by impairing the economic recovery.  Policymakers may accordingly conclude that ending asset purchases at the October meeting and beginning to increase the federal funds rate next year will appropriately balance the risks to financial stability.

Market participants would probably not be surprised by the asset purchase decision or forward guidance laid out in Alternative B.  According to the Desk's latest survey, all but one dealer and one buy-side respondent expect the Committee to announce another $10 billion cut in the pace of asset purchases next week and are virtually certain of that outcome.  Most respondents did not anticipate any major changes to the Committee's forward guidance in September, although a few pointed to a possibility that the 'considerable time' language may be modified at this meeting or in the near future. With regard to the statement's description of the economic situation, most dealers did not anticipate changes to the statement's language other than modest updates of its summary of current conditions; a couple of dealers, however, expected the Committee to remove or modify the language indicating that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  Accordingly, a statement along the lines of Alternative B would likely cause little change in asset prices.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C

Policymakers may judge that the stated goals of the Committee's current program of asset purchases-a substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market in a context of price stability-have been achieved.  Furthermore, some policymakers may be convinced that a solid and durable expansion in economic activity is underway, and that this expansion likely will reduce any remaining slack in labor markets fairly quickly.  In

support of this view, they might cite the broad-based and swifter-than-expected reduction in unemployment, including long-term unemployment, so far this year.  Accordingly, these policymakers may judge it appropriate to conclude asset purchases by the end of September.

More generally, some policymakers may be concerned that maintaining the policy stance articulated by the Committee in its recent statements would be overly accommodative.  Abstracting from recent ups and downs in reported inflation, and with longer-run expected inflation remaining near 2 percent, policymakers may see inflation as much more likely to run at or above 2 percent than persistently below that rate.  They may worry that a trajectory for the federal funds rate similar to that in the Tealbook baseline forecast would create an appreciable risk that inflation might persistently exceed the Committee's longer-run goal in coming years, possibly even more than shown in the alternative scenario 'Higher Inflation with Unanchored Inflation Expectations' in the 'Risks and Uncertainty' section of Tealbook, Book A.  These policymakers might emphasize that most simple policy rule prescriptions and the optimal control simulations, as presented in the 'Monetary Policy Strategies' section of Tealbook, Book B, call for policy tightening to begin immediately.  Moreover, some participants may view the moderate strengthening in the growth of credit to households and nonfinancial businesses that has occurred this year as an indication that the Committee's accommodative interestrate and balance-sheet policies are beginning to generate a broad-based increase in credit supply that will eventually prove inflationary if those policies are not shifted toward more neutral settings relatively soon.  Some participants may also view high stock market valuations, low credit spreads, and very low levels of implied volatility as reflecting the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy and potentially posing risks to financial stability.  For all these reasons, participants may deem it appropriate to raise the federal funds rate sooner than under Alternative B, and so find the proposed changes to the forward guidance in the fifth paragraph of Alternative C desirable.

Furthermore, policymakers may perceive some restraining effects from fiscal policy on economic growth-possibly along the lines of the box 'Fiscal Policy Restraint and Government Budget Conditions' in Tealbook, Book A.  But they may deem these effects to be sufficiently small to warrant dropping from the statement the previouslyused reference to restraining effects from fiscal policy, as proposed in the first paragraph of Alternative C.

Based on the Desk's latest surveys of primary dealers and buy-side firms, a decision to adopt a statement like Alternative C would surprise market participants, as none of the respondents to those surveys expect asset purchases to be terminated at this meeting.  The announcement of an immediate termination of the Committee's current program of asset purchases in combination with Alternative C's modified policy guidance likely would lead market participants to pull forward their forecasts of the date at which the Committee will first increase its target for the federal funds rate.  In addition, the expected federal funds rate path for the subsequent tightening phase might steepen, particularly if the changes announced in Alternative C were interpreted as implying a shift in the Committee's reaction function and if the reference to a diminishing rate of underutilization of labor resources was taken to signal a larger-than-expected improvement in the Committee's assessment of the labor market.  In response, mediumand longer-term real interest rates would rise, equity prices and inflation compensation likely fall, and the dollar appreciate.  However, if investors read the statement in Alternative C as reflecting a more optimistic assessment of the outlook for economic growth, equity prices would not fall as much or could even rise, and inflation compensation might increase.  The shift in policy expectations might be accompanied by a rise in the volatility of fixed-income instruments and other securities, as investors could become more uncertain about the timing and pace of normalization.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A

In light of recent softness in the inflation data, some policymakers may worry that the pickup in inflation seen in the second quarter will prove short-lived, and that inflation will remain significantly below 2 percent over the medium term.  Participants might point to measures of inflation compensation derived from TIPS, which have declined toward the bottom of the range of values recorded over the last few years.  While policymakers may regard current levels of inflation compensation as still consistent with stable longerterm inflation expectations, they might also see the decline in inflation compensation as suggesting greater odds that inflation expectations will become unanchored.  If expected inflation were to drift down, mutually reinforcing dynamics could arise between declining inflation expectations, inflation slowing further, and economic activity remaining weak. 3 Policymakers who attach a sizable probability to such outcomes may

see merit in a statement like Alternative A because it seeks to quell such risks by introducing an explicit inflation floor into the Committee's forward guidance.

Some policymakers may also be concerned that, over the first half of this year, economic activity expanded only modestly, on net, and that the future pace of expansion may not be all that strong.  In addition, they might find it troubling that the housing recovery is not regaining momentum and that improvements in mortgage finance have stalled in spite of highly accommodative financial conditions.  Because of these worries about the strength of the economic recovery, participants may believe that it would be appropriate to provide updated, state-dependent, forward guidance regarding the path of the federal funds rate in order to provide more explicit scope for extending the period of highly accommodative policy.

Policymakers may note that recent payroll gains fell well short of expectations and thus may remain skeptical about whether further significant gains in employment can be achieved in the absence of a persistent pickup in growth of economic activity.  They also may see the low labor force participation rate, the still-high share of part-time workers for economic reasons, and the relatively moderate gains in hourly compensation as indicative of weaker underlying labor market conditions than is evident from the unemployment rate and payroll employment figures, possibly along the lines of the alternative scenario 'Higher Trend Labor Force Participation Rate' in the 'Risks and Uncertainty' section of Tealbook, Book A.

While participants may want to provide additional monetary accommodation, they may nonetheless judge that there has been a sufficiently substantial improvement in the outlook for labor markets since the inception of the current asset purchase program to bring the program to a close relatively soon, possibly after the October meeting.  To the extent that the proposed inflation floor also pushes out the date on which reinvestments are expected to end or begin to be phased out, the change in forward guidance would also amplify the accommodation provided by the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities.  Participants may thus prefer to add an inflation floor to the statement language in conjunction with a signal that asset purchases will likely end in October, but with a reaffirmation that asset purchases are not on a preset course and that future reductions in

the pace of purchases remain conditional on incoming data, as proposed in the fourth paragraph of Alternative A.

Market participants would be surprised by an announcement like Alternative A. In response to the new inflation-oriented forward guidance for the policy rate in the fifth paragraph of Alternative A, market participants might push back the date of the first increase in the federal funds rate, perhaps appreciably; a flattening of the expected path for the federal funds rate after liftoff is also conceivable.  After an announcement along the lines of Alternative A, medium- and longer-term real interest rates would likely decline, inflation compensation and equity prices might rise, and the dollar could depreciate.  However, insofar as investors interpreted a statement like that in Alternative A as reflecting a more downbeat assessment of the outlook for economic growth and inflation, equity prices would not rise as much or could even decline, and inflation compensation could fall.  The shift in policy expectations might also make investors more uncertain about the timing and pace of normalization, leading to increased volatility of fixed-income instruments and other securities.

DIRECTIVE

The directive that was issued after the July meeting appears on the next page, followed by drafts for a September directive that correspond to each of the three policy alternatives.  Each draft includes changes to make it consistent with the corresponding postmeeting statement.

The directive for Alternatives A and B instructs the Desk to purchase, beginning in October, longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month and to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $5 billion per month.  The draft directive for Alternative C instructs the Desk to conclude the current purchase program by the end of September.  All three of the draft directives instruct the Desk to maintain the current policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgagebacked securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues.

As shown in the final exhibit, 'Projections for the Monetary Base,' the monetary base increases through the middle of 2015 because the purchase program is accompanied by additions to reserve balances.  Once the normalization process begins, the monetary base shrinks through 2021, primarily because redemptions of securities cause corresponding reductions in reserve balances.  Starting around mid-2022, after reserve
