Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook

The information that we have received since the July Tealbook has been mixed but, on balance, seems to point to a somewhat weaker pace of economic recovery from this point forward than we anticipated in our previous projection.  In the labor market, the past two monthly reports on payroll employment were both disappointing.  The unemployment rate once again surprised us to the downside, but the signal from that downward move was muddied by a further decline in the labor force participation rate. With regard to production, we now estimate that real output rose at an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of this year, ½ percentage point more than our estimate in the July Tealbook.  However, this upward revision was concentrated in spending categories where we do not expect any carryover in momentum.  And in light of an apparent softening in the trajectory of consumer spending, as well as slightly more restrictive financial conditions, we have revised down our forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of the year to 2½ percent, ¼ percentage point less than in our previous projection.

Our medium-term projection for real activity is a little weaker than in the July Tealbook, reflecting a further rise in interest rates and a higher exchange value of the dollar.  Even so, we still expect economic activity to accelerate gradually through 2015 because of the waning of a number of headwinds that have been restraining growth in recent years, including the economic and fiscal stresses in Europe and restrictive fiscal policy domestically.  All told, our forecast has real GDP increasing 3 percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in 2015, ¼ percentage point lower in each year than in the July Tealbook.  In 2016, we expect real GDP to rise 3¼ percent.

In line with the gradual pickup in aggregate demand, the unemployment rate is projected to fall from about 7¼ percent in the current quarter to 5¼ percent at the end of 2016-close to our estimate of the natural rate.  Largely as a result of its lower starting point, the projected path of the unemployment rate is a little lower than in the July Tealbook, and it crosses the Committee's 6½ percent threshold in the first quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than in our previous projection.  However, because we also made a small downward revision to our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, our projection for the labor utilization gap has narrowed by a little less than implied by the revision to the unemployment rate.

Revisions to the Staff Projection since the Previous SEP

The FOMC last published its Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) following the June FOMC meeting. The table below summarizes revisions to the staff economic projection since the June Tealbook.

The staff projection for real GDP growth is somewhat weaker than in the June Tealbook, the result of both weaker indicators for the near term and less favorable financial assumptions. However, the projection for the unemployment rate is little revised on net: It ends 2013 a bit lower, reflecting the incoming data, and it is unrevised thereafter, reflecting the offsetting influences of the weaker GDP growth outlook and a small further downward revision to our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. In 2016, the staff projects another year of above trend GDP growth and a further decline in the -unemployment rate to 5¼ percent-close to our estimate of the natural rate.

The staff projection for overall PCE inflation has revised up this year relative to the June projection, reflecting the rise in oil prices over the summer. Beyond this year, however, the projection for both core and headline inflation is revised slightly lower, largely the result of a change in the BEA's methodology for measuring the nonmarket component of prices. In 2016, we project inflation to continue to edge higher but still to be below 2 percent.

The unemployment rate is still projected to cross the Committee's 6½ percent threshold in early 2015, and the policy rule that governs our assumption for the federal funds rate calls for the rate to lift off from the effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015, the same as in June.

Recent readings on core consumer prices have come in as expected and appear consistent with our view that the especially low pace of inflation in the first half of the year would prove transitory.  Accordingly, our core inflation forecast is broadly similar to the July Tealbook, with core PCE price inflation expected to step up to 1.4 percent in the second half of this year and to move gradually higher over the medium term, reaching 1.7 percent in 2016.  Our headline inflation forecast has been pushed up in the near term by the recent rise in imported crude oil prices.  Over the medium term, though, energy prices are expected to recede, causing total PCE inflation to run a little below core inflation.  The inflation projection is a touch lower in this Tealbook over the medium term, reflecting a change in the measurement of the nonmarket component of PCE prices.

We view the degree of uncertainty attending our projection of real activity as being similar to the average over the past 20 years-the benchmark used by the FOMC. We continue to view the risks to the outlook for real activity as being skewed to the downside, in part because of the constraints imposed on monetary policy by the zero lower bound on interest rates.  We also regard the uncertainty around our inflation forecast as being about normal and view these risks as roughly balanced.  This assessment of risk is unchanged from the June Tealbook-the last time that Committee participants submitted economic projections.

KEY BACKGROUND FACTORS

Monetary Policy

Our assumptions regarding purchases under the LSAP program are unrevised this round.  We assume that the Committee will begin to slow the pace of purchases this year and will end them by the middle of 2014, bringing the cumulative purchase amount under the current program to about $1.2 trillion.  Market participants' expectations for asset purchases appear to be aligned fairly well with these assumptions.

Given the revision to the unemployment rate projection already mentioned, the policy rule that governs our assumption for the federal funds rate calls for the rate to lift off from its effective lower bound in the second quarter of 2015-one quarter earlier than in the previous Tealbook.  After liftoff, the trajectory of the federal funds rate is quite similar to the one in the previous projection.

Other Interest Rates

In contrast to the staff, market participants have apparently slightly raised their expected path of the federal funds rate over the medium term; also, the Treasury term premium has risen noticeably further.  In sum, the 10-year Treasury yield has increased more than 40 basis points since the July Tealbook.  We interpret much of the increase in the 10-year yield as having pulled forward some of the changes we had expected to occur in coming quarters, so we have flattened the projected contour of the yield somewhat. Nonetheless, we continue to anticipate a significant rise in the Treasury yield over the medium term, primarily reflecting the movement of the 10-year valuation window through the period of extremely low short-term interest rates and a gradual waning of the effects of the FOMC's balance sheet policies on term premiums.  All told, the 10-year Treasury yield is expected to climb gradually from 3 percent at present to almost 4½ percent by the end of 2016.

Yields on investment-grade corporate bonds have increased in line with those on comparable-maturity Treasury securities in recent weeks, leaving their implied risk spreads about unchanged.  As in the July Tealbook, the projected pickup in economic growth that we are anticipating over the medium term is expected to gradually narrow this risk spread, producing a somewhat less pronounced rise in corporate bond yields than in Treasury yields.  Interest rates on conventional 30-year home mortgages have also moved up since the July Tealbook, but only about 30 basis points on net.  Our previous forecast had anticipated such a narrowing in the spread between mortgage rates and Treasury yields by year-end, so we did not adjust our projection for a fairly flat spread over the medium term this round, and thus have allowed the higher path for Treasury yields to completely pass through to higher mortgage rates.

Equity Prices and Home Prices

The Dow Jones U.S. total stock market index has edged down since the July Tealbook, and we have revised down the projected level of equity prices about ½ percent, on average, through the end of 2016.  As in our previous forecast, we expect stock prices to rise at an average annual rate of 7½ percent over the next few years-a pace sufficient, we think, to bring the implied equity risk premium down toward more typical levels over time.

The latest readings have continued to show increases in national home prices, although the rate of price appreciation has slowed markedly from the especially rapid

pace seen earlier in the year.  The CoreLogic index values for June and July came in a little below our forecast, leading us to revise down the projected level of house prices slightly.  We continue to expect a further deceleration in house prices to an average rate of about 4½ percent per year over the next few years on average.

Fiscal Policy

Our fiscal policy assumptions are little changed in this forecast.  In particular, we have maintained our assumption that policy continues to exert considerable restraint on the growth of aggregate demand.  Our best guess is that the restraint is beginning to moderate, with fiscal policy at all levels of government reducing the rate of real GDP growth by a little less than 1 percentage point (excluding multiplier effects) during the second half of this year after deducting about 1¼ percentage points from GDP growth during the first half.  That said, the precise timing of the drag is quite difficult to pin down.  In the medium term, we expect the drag from fiscal policy to diminish to ¾ percentage point in 2014 and ¼ percentage point in 2015.  And we continue to expect the federal unified budget deficit to drop from about 7 percent of GDP in fiscal year 2012 to less than 4 percent this year.  Beyond this year, we project it will gradually narrow to around 2 percent of GDP by 2016 owing to further improvements in the economy and ongoing policy actions to reduce the deficit.

Two important risks to our fiscal policy assumptions pertain to the need for legislative action over the next several weeks.  New legislation is required both to fund the federal government beyond September 30-the end of the current fiscal year-and to raise the statutory debt limit, as the Treasury has announced that it expects to run out of financing capacity in mid-October.  Our projection assumes that the Congress and the Administration will eventually provide funding for fiscal 2014 consistent with full sequestration and will lift the debt ceiling without defaulting on any government obligations.  However, with negotiations between the Administration and the Congress currently stalled and negotiating positions far apart, we attach considerable uncertainty to the policy outlook.

Foreign Activity and the Dollar

Foreign real GDP growth ticked up in the second quarter, but, at an annual rate of 2 percent, it was well below trend and ¼ percentage point lower than expected in the July Tealbook.  Although activity firmed in the advanced foreign economies and in a number of emerging market economies (EMEs), overall foreign growth was held down by a

surprisingly sharp contraction in Mexico, which has a high trade weight in our foreign aggregate.  In the second half of the year, aggregate foreign growth is expected to move up to an average pace of 2¾ percent, in part as Mexican growth again turns positive. However, this second-half forecast is a bit lower than we projected in the July Tealbook, as the restraint from greater financial stresses in some EMEs is only partly offset by stronger momentum in China and in Europe.  Thereafter, we project that foreign growth will step up further to 3 percent in 2014 and to 3½ percent in 2015 and 2016, supported by waning fiscal drag and improving financial conditions in the euro area as well as the influence of stronger growth in the advanced economies on external demand for the EMEs.

The broad nominal dollar index has appreciated 1 percent since the previous Tealbook.  The dollar was about unchanged against the currencies of the advanced foreign economies, but it appreciated about 1½ percent against an aggregate of EME currencies in response to rising interest rates in the advanced economies as well as to a weaker outlook and heightened investor focus on vulnerabilities in certain countries. Over the medium term, we project the broad real dollar to depreciate at an annual rate of about 2½ percent, little changed from the previous Tealbook.

Oil and Other Commodity Prices

Oil prices have risen in recent weeks because of increasing tensions in the Middle East-in particular, the potential for U.S. military intervention in Syria.  Although Syria is not a major oil producer, an escalation of the conflict there could further destabilize the region and threaten crude oil transportation networks.  After spiking earlier in the period, when U.S. intervention appeared more imminent, the spot price of Brent crude oil closed at about $111 per barrel on September 10, up about $3 from the July Tealbook.   In light 1 of these developments, we have revised up our forecast for the price of imported oil by about $3 per barrel.  In all, the price of imported oil is projected to hold steady at about $108 per barrel through the end of this year and then decline over the remainder of the forecast period, reaching $89 per barrel at the end of 2016; as usual, this forecast is guided by the path of futures prices.

Our broad index of nonfuel commodity prices has also been revised up relative to the July Tealbook, reflecting recent increases in metals prices in response to indications of improved Chinese demand.  Over the forecast period, as in the previous Tealbook, we expect our overall commodity price index to increase only slightly.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP

Real GDP is estimated to have increased at a faster-though still only moderatepace during the first half of this year compared with our projection in the July Tealbook. However, this upward revision was concentrated in inventory investment and government spending-two areas where we do not expect positive momentum to be carried forward. Indeed, we have revised down our projection for real output growth in the second half of the year, primarily because we have a somewhat less robust take on the outlook for consumer spending.  In all, real GDP growth is projected to increase from an annual rate of 2 percent in the first half of this year (½ percentage point more than in the July Tealbook) to 2½ percent in the second half (¼ percentage point less than in July).

Household Spending

We now estimate real PCE to have increased at an annual rate of 2¼ percent in the first half of 2013, a touch higher than in our July Tealbook projection.  We continue to expect a moderate step-up in the rate of PCE growth in the second half-supported by both the gains in wealth over the past year and the waning drag from fiscal policy. Consistent with this acceleration, motor vehicle sales have moved up noticeably in recent months and are expected to remain at about the current level through the end of the year. Nevertheless, we have trimmed the extent of the projected acceleration in real PCE in light of the weaker-than-expected pace of real consumer spending in July and the decline in the Thomson Reuters/Michigan measure of consumer sentiment.  In all, our secondhalf projection for the growth in real PCE is marked down by ½ percentage point to 2½ percent. 2

The sharp rise in mortgage rates since the spring appears to be affecting housing activity, restraining construction of single-family homes and pulling forward sales (see the box 'The Rise in Mortgage Rates and Housing Activity').  Meanwhile, multifamily construction appears to have flattened out this year after having risen appreciably in the

The Rise in Mortgage Rates and Housing Market Activity

Mortgage rates have risen roughly 100 basis points from their lows around the time of the April Tealbook, and we expect this increase to reduce housing demand over the second half of this year. To illustrate the sensitivity of our projection to mortgage rates, the left hand figure below provides -three forecasts of real residential investment. (Other determinants of housing demand are assumed to be the same as in the current Tealbook projection.) If mortgage rates had remained flat at their April levels and were anticipated to stay at those levels through the end of this year, we would be forecasting real residential investment to rise at an annual rate of 16 percent in the second half of this year (the full height of the rightmost bar). If, instead, rates had followed the gradual upward sloping path that we anticipated in the April Tealbook, we would be forecasting an -increase of 14 percent at an annual rate (the darkest and medium shaded portions of the bar). -And with the rate configuration that we anticipate in this edition of the Tealbook, we are forecasting an increase of 7 percent at an annual rate (the darkest portion of the bar). In addition, we expect the slowing in demand to reduce house price appreciation a few percentage points.

The sensitivity of residential investment to mortgage rates that we have built into our projection is attenuated by about one fourth relative to typical historical norms, for the following reasons. -First, tight credit means that a smaller fraction of potential borrowers qualify for a mortgage, making aggregate housing demand less sensitive to interest rates. Second, refinance activity has plunged in response to the rise in mortgage rates, easing the capacity constraints that we believe to have held down mortgage originations for home purchase to some degree in recent years. 1 Third, a smaller fraction of homebuyers are financing their purchases with mortgages, and buyers who use other sources of funding are probably less sensitive to the recent rise in interest rates.

The data on housing activity to date suggest that the rise in rates is beginning to have some effect. 2 Single family permits declined 2½ percent in July, while newly signed contracts for the -

purchase of new homes fell 13 percent, although these latter data are volatile. Meanwhile, the pending home sales index, which reflects newly signed contracts for existing homes, decreased 1 percent in July. In addition, applications for home purchase mortgages, which tend to occur soon after a sales contract is signed, declined modestly in July and August.

Readings on both sales of existing homes and house prices through July show little evidence of a rate related decline in demand because they are recorded when contracts are closed, and -contracts closed in July were primarily negotiated in May and June. In fact, existing home sales rose 4 percent in July. Part of this increase could reflect a pull forward of demand as some buyers -rushed to lock in rates in anticipation of further rate increases. Indeed, as shown in the right hand -figure on the previous page, the fraction of households in the Michigan survey that reported it is a good time to buy a home because 'interest rates will go up' or 'credit will be tighter later' jumped in July.

Of course, considerable uncertainty surrounds our housing projection. One downside risk is that the rise in rates could cause potential homebuyers to downgrade their house price expectations substantially. To date, survey based measures of house price expectations show little support for -this concern (see lower left figure). -Moreover, futures prices for the Case Shiller 10 city composite --index have moved up on balance since the close of the April Tealbook. However, we cannot dismiss this possibility going forward. A related downside risk is that the rise in mortgage rates could generate more general uncertainty about the housing market.

On the upside, the forces supporting the recovery-including pent up demand for housing, the -still low cost of housing in many areas, and improving labor market conditions-could buoy -demand by more than we expect. Even with the recent increases in mortgage rates and house prices, housing still remains affordable by most measures (see the lower right figure for one -example). And market participants do not seem particularly concerned about the rise in rates. Neither builders' nor Realtors' ratings of traffic of potential buyers or expectations of sales in the next six months have deteriorated since April, and lenders tell us that they still see solid prospects for home purchase mortgage originations going forward.

past several years.  The surge of newly completed apartment units entering the market this year and the deceleration in rents may be deterring builders from beginning new projects.  All told, growth in residential investment is expected to slow from an average annual rate of 13 percent in the first half of 2013 to 7 percent in the second half.

Business Investment

Real private investment in equipment and intangibles (E&amp;I) is projected to increase at a modest annual pace of only about 4½ percent during the second half of the year.  To be sure, readings on business sentiment have improved significantly of late, and capital goods orders remain above shipments.  Nevertheless, shipments of nondefense capital goods were quite soft in June and July, the recent rise in corporate bond rates will likely act as a drag on investment, and business output has decelerated to a modest pace on average in recent quarters.  Moreover, near-term earnings expectations for capital goods producers remain lackluster.  Our projection for the growth of investment spending this year, which incorporates the methodological changes introduced with the comprehensive revision of the NIPA, is weaker than in the July Tealbook. 3

Averaging through some large quarterly swings, real nonresidential investment excluding drilling and mining was flat over the year ending in the second quarter as high vacancy rates, low commercial real estate prices, and tight financing conditions have continued to weigh on demand for new buildings.  The information received since the July Tealbook points toward more of the same over the next two quarters, as nominal outlays for nonresidential construction remained low in June and July and the architectural billings index through July stayed at a level consistent with only tepid gains over the rest of the year.  Meanwhile, we expect that the level of oil and gas prices and continued deployment of new drilling technologies will support a moderate increase in real investment in drilling and mining structures in the near term.

In the comprehensive revision to the NIPA, nonfarm inventory investment is shown as having added ½ percentage point more to real GDP growth in the first half of this year than earlier estimated.  However, the level of inventory investment was still

fairly modest.  Moreover, inventory-to-sales ratios from book-value data and the staff's flow-of-goods system, as well as inventory indexes from regional and national manufacturing surveys, do not point to significant inventory imbalances.  We expect inventory investment to provide only a small boost to GDP growth in the second half of this year.

Government

The ongoing decline in real federal government purchases slowed unexpectedly in the second quarter, as these outlays fell at an annual rate of only about 1½ percent, following a decrease of 8½ percent in the first quarter.  We nevertheless continue to expect that the sequestration and other factors, including the drawdown of overseas defense operations, will depress these purchases going forward and that they will drop 6½ percent in the second half of the year.

Real state and local government purchases edged lower in the first half of the year, largely because of a continued fall in outlays for construction.  In contrast, the contraction in state and local government employment appears to have ended as net hiring has been slightly positive this year.  In the second half of 2013, we expect that the resources available to these jurisdictions will not change much, as a continued increase in tax receipts is partially offset by a reduction in grants-in-aid from the federal government caused by the sequestration.  Accordingly, we expect real purchases of state and local governments to be about flat.

Foreign Trade

Following three quarters of lackluster performance, both real exports and imports rebounded strongly in the second quarter.  Exports rose at an annual rate of 8 percent, pushed up in part by a resumption of Boeing 787 shipments following previous delays. We expect export growth to step down to a 3¾ percent rate in the second half of 2013, a pace more consistent with still-subdued foreign growth and some drag from prior dollar appreciation.  Meanwhile, imports rose at an annual rate of 6¼ percent in the second quarter; however, we expect import growth to fall to a mere 2¼ percent pace in the second half as real oil imports decline at a faster pace and U.S. growth picks up only a little.  Altogether, the external sector is expected to contribute a little less than ¼ percentage point to the growth rate of real GDP in the second half, modestly greater than in the July Tealbook, as lower projected U.S. demand holds back import growth.

The Industrial Sector

Manufacturing output edged down in July and has been about flat, on net, since early this year.  However, data on worker hours and physical production suggest that factory output posted a solid gain in August.  Moreover, indicators of near-term manufacturing activity, such as the national and regional manufacturing surveys, are, on balance, consistent with moderate gains thereafter.  We expect manufacturing production to expand at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the second half of the year, broadly similar to our forecast in the previous Tealbook.

THE MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK FOR REAL GDP

We have trimmed our projection for real GDP growth over the medium term, as the changes to our key conditioning assumptions have been negative on net.  On the downside, financial conditions have become somewhat less supportive:  The exchange value of the dollar has increased, and interest rates are somewhat higher than we anticipated in the July Tealbook.  On the upside, though, we have made small upward revisions to our estimate of both actual and potential GDP growth over the medium term in response to the inclusion of additional intangibles in measured GDP.  Folding in these changes, we now forecast real GDP growth to step up from 2¼ percent this year to 3 percent next year and to 3½ percent in 2015, about ¼ percentage point lower in both 2014 and 2015 than in our previous projection.  In 2016, we project an additional year of above-trend growth of 3¼ percent.

As has been the case for some time, our projection of an acceleration in real GDP over the next two years reflects the expectation that a number of the headwinds that have been holding back the growth in economic activity in recent years will ease.  In particular, we believe the restraint from federal fiscal policy is beginning to wane, and we look for European financial and economic conditions to continue their gradual improvement.  In addition, we think that mortgage credit will become more broadly available.  Given the still highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, these factors are expected to produce a growing sense among households and firms that downside risks to the recovery have diminished, which should, in turn, reduce asset risk premiums and gradually lead to greater consumer spending and more business investment and hiring.

These dynamics are particularly evident in our forecast for consumer spending. Real PCE is projected to rise 2½ percent this year before accelerating to increases of 3½ percent in 2014 and 3¾ percent in 2015.  This projected acceleration reflects the

fading effects of this year's tax increases, gains in household wealth produced by rising house and equity prices, and improved consumer confidence.  Nonetheless, our trajectory for consumer spending is a little lower than in the July Tealbook, reflecting higher interest rates and some endogenous response to the weaker economic outlook.

Rising income and confidence are also expected to boost residential construction, although these effects will likely be damped by the further rise in mortgage rates we anticipate to occur over the next several years.  We expect the growth in residential investment to run at a solid rate of around 15 percent in 2014 and 2015.

Real outlays for E&amp;I are expected to rise roughly 5½ percent per year in 2014 and 2015.  Although faster than the tepid 3 percent pace of growth expected this year, our medium-term projection for E&amp;I growth is modest by historical standards and reflects our expectation that business output will increase at only a moderate pace over this period. Similarly, we expect only subdued gains in nonresidential structures over the medium term.

As foreign growth recovers and the dollar begins to depreciate, we expect real exports of goods and services to accelerate from a 3½ percent growth rate in 2013 to 6 percent in 2015; this forecast is a bit weaker than the July Tealbook due to the recent dollar appreciation.  Real import growth is expected to pick up from 2¾ percent this year to 5 percent in 2015, supported by the ongoing domestic recovery.  This projection is also down slightly from the July Tealbook as the boost from the stronger dollar is more than offset by the drag from the weaker outlook for domestic growth.  Overall, net exports are expected to be about neutral for U.S. GDP growth in 2013 and then to be a slight drag through the end of 2015.  With roughly offsetting revisions to exports and imports, the net export contribution is little changed relative to the July Tealbook.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LABOR MARKET AND INFLATION

Recent Developments and Near-Term Outlook for the Labor Market

While the incoming data continue to suggest a gradual improvement in labor market conditions, the news has not been uniformly positive.  Total payroll employment growth is currently estimated to have averaged 137,000 in July and August, about 45,000

less per month than we had anticipated in the July Tealbook.   These readings, combined 4 with the downward revisions to employment in May and June, leave the level of total payrolls in August about 130,000 lower than our projection in the previous Tealbook. The news from the household survey was somewhat more upbeat, as the unemployment rate moved down to 7.3 percent in August, 0.2 percentage point lower than we expected in the most recent Tealbook.  However, the labor force participation rate also ticked down 0.2 percentage point in August-compared with our July Tealbook projection of no change-somewhat tempering the positive message from the decline in the unemployment rate.   That said, the broader U-5 and U-6 measures of unemployment 5 also declined in July and August.

Other indicators of labor market activity received since the July Tealbook also send somewhat mixed signals about improvement in the labor market.  Initial claims for unemployment insurance have continued to edge lower and the hiring plans of small businesses rose substantially in July and August.  However, there has been little change, on net, over the past few months in measures of job openings, hiring rates, and household and consumer expectations for future labor market conditions.  Finally, the staff's labor market conditions index, which summarizes the movements in 19 labor market indicators, improved slightly over July and August.

On the basis of this evidence, we now expect nonfarm payroll gains of around 155,000 in September and 165,000 per month in the fourth quarter; both figures are down 20,000 from the July Tealbook.  We now project that the unemployment rate will edge down further to 7.2 percent in the fourth quarter, 0.2 percentage point lower than in our previous projection.

Potential GDP and the Natural Rate of Unemployment

We have made two adjustments to our estimates of potential output.  First, the comprehensive revision of the NIPA contained an upward restatement of real GDP growth, reflecting in part the incorporation of additional intangibles into the definition of fixed investment.  As the comprehensive revision did not substantially alter the

relationship between the unemployment rate and output in the recent cycle, we passed this upward adjustment to past actual output growth into our estimate of past potential output growth, and we carried the intangibles portion of this adjustment forward into our projection for potential output growth.

Second, the decline in the unemployment rate since mid-2012 in the face of only modest output gains led us to reduce the growth of potential output in 2012 and early 2013 relative to the higher rate implied by the comprehensive revision.  This change narrows the estimated GDP gap and implies that the unemployment rate has a little farther to fall to come back into line with GDP, and thus admits the possibility that we may see additional declines in unemployment in an environment of modest GDP growth. All told, the growth in potential output is unrevised in 2012 and is revised up 0.1 percentage point thereafter relative to the July Tealbook.  Nonetheless, at a bit more than 2 percent per year, the average rate of potential output growth over the medium term remains broadly similar to our July forecast.

We have also made small downward adjustments to our projections of the natural rate of unemployment and trend labor force participation.  We made similar adjustments in the June Tealbook, but in light of the additional downward surprises in the unemployment and labor force participation rates in recent months, we have moved a little further in the same direction in the current projection-we revised down our estimate of the level of the natural rate and the trend rate of labor force participation by 0.1 percentage point each from early 2013 onward. 6

The Medium-Term Outlook for the Labor Market

Our projected path for gains in total payroll employment over the medium term reflects the acceleration in real GDP that we have in this forecast.  In particular, total job gains are projected to step up from 155,000 per month in the second half of this year to about 190,000 per month in 2014 and 240,000 per month in 2015-a trajectory that is somewhat weaker than in the July Tealbook.  As noted above, the unemployment rate is 0.2 percentage point lower at the start of the forecast period as a result of the incoming data.  From this lower starting point, the unemployment rate declines to 5.8 percent at the end of 2015.

Note:  In September 2012, judgmental projections were prepared through 2015 for the Summary of Economic Projections variables, including the unemployment rate, while projections for other variables, including the labor force participation rate and payroll employment, were prepared only through 2014. This exhibit therefore reports a 2015 projection from the September 2012 Tealbook only for the unemployment rate.

The top-right figure of the 'Labor Market Developments and Outlook' exhibit compares our current unemployment rate projection with our projection from September 2012, when the Committee first tied its asset purchase decisions to an improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions.  By the end of 2013, the unemployment rate is projected to be 7.2 percent, nearly 1 percentage point lower than the 8.1 percent rate that prevailed in August 2012 (the last observation that the Committee had in hand for the September 2012 FOMC meeting); through the end of 2015, our forecast for the unemployment rate averages about 1 percentage point lower than the September 2012 Tealbook's projection.  Meanwhile, the outlook for total payroll employment growth past the third quarter of this year has changed relatively little, on average, since our forecast one year ago.  However, our current projection for the level of total payroll employment at the end of this year is ¾ percent, or 1.1 million jobs, above what we projected in September 2012, partly due to faster-than-expected job growth during the first half of this year and partly due to the benchmark revision which boosted the estimated level of employment one year ago. 7

Resource Utilization

We estimate that real GDP in the second quarter of this year was 3½ percent below its potential level-a ½ percentage point narrower output gap than we estimated in the July Tealbook; this revision reflects the changes made to our supply-side assumptions, as well as the upward revision to GDP growth in the first half of this year. Despite this narrower starting point, with GDP rising less quickly than in our previous projection and potential output rising more quickly, the output gap shrinks by less over the medium term.  By the final quarter of 2015, the projected level of GDP stands 1¼ percent lower than potential GDP, unchanged from our previous projection.  The labor utilization gap is also narrower at the start of the projection, as our downward adjustment to the natural rate only partially offsets the lower-than-previously-projected unemployment rate.  At the end of 2015, the unemployment rate is a little more than ½ percentage point above the natural rate-a gap that is slightly narrower than in our July projection.   In the manufacturing sector, capacity utilization is currently almost 8

The Outlook for Prices and Compensation

Headline PCE prices rose at an annual rate of only ½ percent in the first half of this year as consumer energy prices dropped sharply and core prices decelerated.  Over the second half of this year, though, total PCE price inflation is projected to increase to 1½  percent as energy prices rebound and core PCE price inflation edges up.  Compared with the July Tealbook, our projection for total PCE inflation in the second half of this year is up about ¼ percentage point, reflecting the recent rise in imported crude oil prices.

After running at a very subdued 1 percent annual pace over the first half of this year, core PCE price inflation is forecast to pick up to just under 1½ percent in the second half as transitory influences from medical prices and nonmarket prices ebb.  Although recent data on core consumer prices have come in as expected, this near-term projection is nevertheless down a touch from the July Tealbook due to lower-than-expected data on import prices.

We have marked up our projection for consumer energy price inflation in the second half of this year to around 6 percent because of the increase in oil prices; we had expected these prices to move sideways in the July Tealbook.  Nevertheless, given the downward tilt in our projected oil price path, we continue to expect that PCE energy prices will edge lower over the medium term.

Consumer food prices are projected to increase 1 percent this year and then decelerate to an increase of about ¾ percent next year, as this year's steep declines in farm commodity price futures show through to the retail level.  In 2015, we expect that these prices will rise 1¼ percent, a little below core inflation.

Falling core import prices are damping domestic inflation.  After declining at an annual rate of 2½ percent in the second quarter, prices of imported core goods are

expected to decline at a similar pace in the current quarter, reflecting recent dollar appreciation as well as the continued pass-through of the fall in commodity prices earlier in the year.  Relative to the July Tealbook, the third-quarter forecast has been revised down by 2 percentage points, reflecting a weaker-than-anticipated reading for July.  We have also marked down our projection for the fourth quarter; core import prices are now expected to be little changed, compared with the ½ percent increase we had projected in the July Tealbook.  For the remainder of the forecast period, core import price inflation is expected to run about 1½ percent per year, consistent with the relatively flat projected trajectory for commodity prices and our assumed pace of dollar depreciation.

Readings on long-term inflation expectations remain stable.  Median 5-to-10-year-ahead inflation expectations from the final August Michigan survey stood at 2.9 percent-well within the relatively narrow range seen in recent years.  Expectations for PCE price inflation over the next 10 years, as measured by the median of the Survey of Professional Forecasters, were unchanged at 2 percent in the third quarter.  Similarly, TIPS-based measures of inflation compensation are little changed, on balance, since the previous Tealbook.

With stable long-run inflation expectations, a small projected acceleration in commodity and import prices beyond this year, and a gradually diminishing margin of slack-as well as our judgment that the softness earlier in the year in core inflation reflected transitory factors-we expect core PCE inflation to rise from 1.2 percent this year to 1.5 percent in 2014 and then to edge up further, reaching 1.7 percent in 2016. This contour is 0.1 percentage point lower than in the July Tealbook owing to a downward adjustment to our projection for nonmarket prices. 10 Given the projected trajectory for energy prices, total PCE inflation is expected to be marginally lower than core inflation over the medium term.  Thus, through 2015, the PCE inflation projection remains below the Committee's long-run objective of 2 percent.

Increases in labor compensation remain subdued.  For the second half of this year, we expect compensation per hour in the nonfarm business sector to rise about 2½ percent, unchanged from our July Tealbook projection.  Over the medium term, we expect the

gradual tightening of the labor market to push hourly compensation growth up to 3 percent by 2015.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK

We have extended the staff's forecast beyond the medium term using the FRB/US model and our assumptions about long-run supply-side conditions, fiscal policy, and other factors.  The contour of the long-term outlook depends on the following key assumptions:

-  Monetary policy seeks to stabilize PCE inflation at 2 percent over the longer term, consistent with the Committee's policy strategy statement.  As noted earlier, the Committee's unemployment rate threshold is crossed in the baseline projection in the first quarter of 2015.  Thereafter, the federal funds rate is set according to the inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule.
-  The Federal Reserve's holdings of securities continue to put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, albeit to a diminishing extent.  The process of returning the SOMA portfolio to a normal size is expected to be completed in 2021.
-  Risk premiums on corporate equities and bonds continue to decrease gradually to normal levels, and financial institutions further ease their lending standards.
-  The federal budget deficit begins to widen after 2017, primarily reflecting fast-rising transfer payments for retirement and health-care programs.  Federal debt remains a little below 75 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018 before beginning to rise later in the decade.
-  The real foreign exchange value of the dollar stays constant from 2017 onward.  The price of crude oil holds steady in real terms.  Foreign real GDP growth slows from 3½ percent in 2016 to an annual rate of about 3 percent later in the decade.
-  The natural rate of unemployment is 5.2 percent throughout the longer-term outlook.  Potential GDP rises at an average pace of 2¼ percent per year from 2017 to 2020.

The economy is projected to enter 2017 with output still slightly below its potential level, unemployment slightly above its natural rate, and inflation below the long-run objective of the Committee.  In the staff's long-term forecast, the small remaining gaps in activity relative to potential are absorbed as a consequence of real GDP

rising 2½ percent in 2017.  Thereafter, the pace of gains in real GDP slows to the rate of potential growth, in large part reflecting the progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation.  The unemployment rate falls through 2017 to near its natural rate of 5.2 percent and remains close to that level thereafter.  Long-run inflation expectations are assumed to remain well anchored, and, with slack in labor and product markets having been taken up, consumer price inflation moves up to 2 percent by 2019.  The nominal federal funds rate is 3¾ percent at the end of this decade and eventually stabilizes at around 4 percent in the middle of the next decade. 11

International Economic Developments and Outlook

Foreign real GDP expanded at an annual rate of only 2 percent in the second quarter, a little higher than in the first quarter but still quite subdued by historical standards.  Although economic activity accelerated in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) from its very weak pace earlier this year, growth barely increased in the emerging market economies (EMEs), held back by a significant contraction of output in Mexico. Economic growth strengthened in many other EMEs, particularly in Asia, but generally remained below trend.

We project foreign economic growth to rise to 2¾ percent in the second half of this year and strengthen further over the forecast period to reach 3½ percent in 2016.  In the AFEs, encouraging data from the euro area support our conviction that the region has exited recession.  However, we anticipate that the recovery there will remain sluggish in the face of continued fiscal and financial headwinds.  Elsewhere in the AFEs, still accommodative monetary policies should help sustain the improvement in activity.  And a firming recovery in the United States, along with stronger activity in the AFEs, should support external demand and an acceleration of output for the EMEs despite some near-term drag from tightened financial conditions (as discussed in more detail later).

Our outlook for aggregate foreign growth is revised down a bit in the second half of this year and the first half of next year but about unchanged thereafter.  Although we revised up near-term growth in Europe and China based on more promising indicators, this revision was more than offset by markdowns elsewhere.  We extended forward some of Mexico's surprising first-half weakness.  Perhaps more importantly, financial conditions in a number of EMEs worsened further of late, as outflows from emerging market funds accelerated again, interest rates moved up, and currencies depreciated.  All told, these developments should restrain economic activity, and in response we marked down our forecast for economic growth in EMEs by about ¼ percentage point in the near term.  Nonetheless, this revision is tempered by the positive effects of currency depreciation.  Those economies with the weakest macroeconomic fundamentals, such as Brazil and India, have experienced the greatest financial turmoil, and we revised down their growth the most.  (See the box 'Financial Distress and Vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies.')

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Financial Distress and Vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies

The financial stresses experienced in May and June by many emerging market economies (EMEs) have re emerged after a brief respite. -Outflows from emerging market bond and equity funds, shown in the upper left figure on the next page, have accelerated again in -recent weeks, although they remain smaller than the large outflows seen in June. At the same time, as can be seen in the upper right figure, the currencies of several EMEs -resumed their depreciations against the dollar in mid July and have declined a substantial -amount since then. Additionally, emerging market bond yields have moved up further (not shown).

Nevertheless, financial conditions have not deteriorated uniformly across the EMEs. Since mid July, for example, the currencies of Korea and Taiwan have been quite stable, -even as those of Brazil, India, and Turkey have moved down further despite significant interventions in these countries. This variation suggests that even though the emerging market selloff has been driven in part by common factors, such as changes in market perceptions regarding the future policies of the Federal Reserve or cloudier prospects for EME growth, investors are distinguishing among EMEs.

Weinvestigated the importance of economic vulnerabilities to this variation in investor response. To do so, we first ranked each economy from least vulnerable to most vulnerable according to four macroeconomic indicators: (1) the ratio of the current account to GDP, (2) the ratio of government debt to GDP, (3) the average inflation rate since the beginning of 2012, and (4) the rise in domestic credit to the private sector as a share of GDP in recent years. Averaging each country's rankings across these four categories, we created an index with larger values indicating greater relative vulnerability. Based on this index (lower left figure on the next page), the most -vulnerable economies are Brazil, Turkey, and India, and the least vulnerable are Korea, Chile, and Taiwan. Wethen examined the relationship between the extent of vulnerability and one measure of financial market stress-how much the exchange rate has changed since the end of April. As can be seen in the lower right figure, more -vulnerable economies, according to our criteria, have indeed experienced more currency depreciation. Wealso verified that greater vulnerabilities are associated with larger increases in interest rates since the end of April, further suggesting that country specific -factors have contributed to recent market pressure on EMEs.

Although currency depreciations should offer some macroeconomic stimulus over time, our sense is that the increase in interest rates and declines in confidence associated with financial stress will constitute a net negative for economic activity in EMEs. Accordingly, we substantially revised down our activity outlook for Brazil and India because of increased financial stress and reduced to a lesser degree our outlook for other EMEs.

Moreover, there is some chance that the interaction of domestic vulnerabilities with rising global interest rates and increased investor jitters could trigger a financial crisis in an EME. Were such an event to occur, there might well be serious contagion effects among other EMEs, possibly pushing them into crisis as well. Under those circumstances, economic activity in the EMEs more generally could slow sharply, leading to serious consequences for U.S. growth, a scenario described in the Risks and Uncertainty section. This is not our baseline scenario, but the risk of such an outcome has increased.

Our baseline forecast assumes that financial stresses in EMEs level off in coming months.  However, the recent deterioration in investor sentiment toward vulnerable economies indicates that the risk of greater financial turbulence has increased, potentially involving contagion to other EMEs and engendering a broad-based slowdown in foreign economic activity.  Another downside risk is that an escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East could push oil prices up, undermining the already tepid global recovery. (We explore both of these scenarios in the Risks and Uncertainty section.)  Finally, notwithstanding the more positive tone of news from the euro area and China, risks remain that financial and economic conditions in these economies could deteriorate sharply.

Inflation in the AFEs should pick up to 1¾ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year, nearly ½ percentage point more than in the previous Tealbook, amid higher energy prices.  Further out, inflation is expected to hover around this pace, little changed from our previous Tealbook forecast.  EME inflation is also expected to pick up a bit, to 3¼ percent over the forecast period, in some cases boosted by pass-through effects of recent currency depreciations.

With still large output gaps and limited price pressures, monetary policy in the AFEs is slated to remain accommodative.  In contrast, a number of central banks in vulnerable EME countries have tightened policy and intervened in foreign exchange markets to stem capital outflows and depreciation pressures.  As financial stresses persist, we expect additional tightening measures in these countries.

ADVANCED FOREIGN ECONOMIES

Following a modest expansion in the first quarter, AFE output rose at nearly a 2 percent pace in the second quarter, ½ percentage point above our July Tealbook estimate.  GDP in Europe rebounded more vigorously than expected and recent indicators point to stronger momentum, leading us to mark up the outlook for the region.  In contrast, the weaker U.S. projection is expected to weigh a little on near-term prospects for Canada.  On net, we anticipate that AFE GDP growth will remain just below 2 percent in the second half of 2013, a bit higher than projected in July.  Thereafter, as euro-area financial pressures ease further, fiscal drag wanes, and monetary policy remains accommodative, we continue to project AFE growth to edge up throughout the forecast, reaching almost 2½ percent in 2016.

Increases in consumer energy prices led us to revise up our forecast for AFE inflation in the current quarter by ½ percentage point to nearly 2 percent.  Inflation should moderate to 1½ percent next quarter, as energy prices stabilize, and remain around that rate through the end of 2015 (excluding the effects of the Japanese consumption tax hikes).  Consistent with a somewhat improved economic outlook for Europe, we now expect the European Central Bank (ECB) and the Bank of England (BOE) to raise their policy rates one quarter earlier than previously projected, in the second half of 2015, and to implement further rate hikes in 2016.

Euro Area

The recession in the euro area appears to be at an end.  After six consecutive quarters of contraction, euro-area GDP expanded 1.2 percent at an annual rate in the second quarter, much better than the zero growth we had estimated in the July Tealbook. This figure may somewhat overstate the underlying momentum in the economy, as output was boosted by temporary factors, including a rebound in construction activity from a weather-related slump in the first quarter.  That said, recent data point to continued positive growth.  In July, euro-area retail sales moved up, supporting the view that consumption is gradually firming, and the unemployment rate held steady at 12.1 percent. In August, the composite PMI finally moved into expansionary territory and consumer confidence reached its highest level in two years.  We now project that euro-area GDP will expand ¼ percent in the current quarter and nearly 1 percent in the next, a bit faster than we had previously anticipated.

We see the recovery strengthening modestly next year but continuing to face significant headwinds, including tight fiscal conditions, distressed balance sheets, and limited credit availability.  Therefore, we project that euro-area GDP growth will edge up to just 1¼ percent in 2014 before rising to 2 percent in 2016.  Compared with the July Tealbook, this projection is a tad higher in 2014-mostly reflecting a lower expected path for financial stresses-and unchanged thereafter.

Amid rising energy prices, euro-area inflation is projected to increase to 1½ percent in the second half of this year from ¾ percent in the first half.  As the output gap slowly closes, inflation should tick up to 1¾ percent by the end of the forecast period, as in the July Tealbook.  At its September meeting, the ECB kept the benchmark policy rate at 50 basis points and reiterated its intention to maintain low rates for an extended period.  Consistent with our revisions to the euro-area outlook, we now expect

the ECB to raise the benchmark rate in the third quarter of 2015, one quarter earlier than in the July Tealbook, and to bring it to 1¼ percent by the end of the forecast horizon.

United Kingdom

Second-quarter U.K. GDP rose 2.9 percent, ½ percentage point more than we had estimated in the July Tealbook, with upside surprises in net exports, government spending, and investment.  Recent indicators suggest ongoing strength.  Retail sales grew 1.1 percent in July, and PMIs for construction and manufacturing rose sharply in August. Accordingly, we revised up our forecast for GDP growth in the second half of this year ¾ percentage point, to 2¾ percent.  Our projection for output growth in 2014 is also a touch higher, at 2¼ percent, partly reflecting better growth prospects in the euro area. We expect GDP growth to reach 2½ percent in 2015 and to remain at that rate in 2016, nearly unchanged from the July Tealbook.

We estimate that the recent upswing in oil prices and a planned hike in university tuitions will lift quarterly inflation in the second half of this year to an average of 2¾ percent, a bit higher than in the July Tealbook.  Thereafter, our inflation forecast is unchanged as we project that inflation will settle down to about 2 percent.  Consistent with the BOE's recently announced forward guidance (see the box 'Forward Guidance by the Bank of England') and our forecast for the unemployment rate, we expect the BOE to keep the Bank Rate at 0.5 percent through the third quarter of 2015 and to maintain the current size of its asset holdings for some time beyond then.  Our forecast for the first rate hike is one quarter earlier than in the July Tealbook, reflecting the stronger outlook for the U.K. economy.

Japan

Real GDP rose 3.8 percent in the second quarter following similarly strong performance in the first, driven by further gains in private consumption and net exports. Indicators for activity in the third quarter have been mixed.  Industrial production rebounded in July and the manufacturing PMI points to further expansion in August, but in July merchandise exports plunged and real consumption edged down, leading us to mark down third-quarter GDP growth by ½ percentage point.  That said, growth should average a solid 2¾ percent in the second half of the year, owing to highly accommodative fiscal and monetary policies.  We expect that two planned consumption tax hikes and diminishing stimulus from past yen depreciation will cause output growth to slow to an average rate of about 1 percent in 2014 and 2015.

Consumer prices rose sharply in June and July, largely reflecting the effect of yen depreciation and higher oil prices.  Accordingly, we forecast that inflation will jump from 0.8 percent in the second quarter to 3 percent in the current quarter.  As energy prices stabilize, inflation should hover just above ½ percent over the next two quarters. Thereafter, with the Bank of Japan (BOJ) assumed to maintain its asset purchase program through the end of 2015, inflation should gradually rise to 1 percent by 2015 (net of the effect of consumption tax hikes) and to 1½ percent in 2016.  With inflation approaching its 2 percent target, we expect the BOJ to implement its first rate hike in late 2016.

Canada

Real GDP growth in Canada slowed as expected to 1.7 percent in the second quarter from 2.2 percent in the first.  This slowing reflected temporary factors, including the effect of flooding in Alberta and Toronto in June.  Recent data support our projection that growth will rebound to an average rate of 2¼ percent in the second half of the year. Employment and the manufacturing PMI were above their second-quarter levels through August.  Going forward, we see Canadian output growth at 2½ percent in 2014, increasing gradually to 2¾ percent in 2016.

We expect inflation to average 1¾ percent in the second half of the year, a little higher than in the July Tealbook because of higher energy prices.  Thereafter, we project that firming economic activity will gradually push inflation to the 2 percent target by the end of the forecast period.  We continue to assume that the Bank of Canada will start raising its policy rate in the second half of 2014.

EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES

Aggregate second-quarter growth for the EMEs came in at an annual rate of only 2¼ percent, about ¾ percentage point lower than projected in the July Tealbook and some 2 percentage points below its trend pace.  This revision was driven almost entirely by data from Mexico, which saw a surprisingly large contraction in activity.  In contrast, a number of other emerging economies (particularly in Asia) finally showed in the second quarter the moderate pickup of growth that we had been forecasting.  In addition, third-quarter indicators point to a firming of growth in China.

We expect EME growth to step up to 3¾ percent in the second half of the year and to rise to a trend-like pace of 4½ percent by the middle of next year, as Mexico returns to positive growth in the current quarter, Chinese activity picks up, and the

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Forward Guidance by the Bank of England

On August 7, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of England (BOE) announced forward guidance on its policy. 1 The MPC said that it intends to keep the policy rate (the Bank Rate) at its current level of 0.5 percent and the stock of assets purchased at £375 billion at least until the unemployment rate has fallen to 7 percent, which the MPC expects to occur around mid 2016. -

That guidance would cease to hold if any of the following three 'knockouts' were breached:

- 1. The MPC projects consumer price inflation 18 to 24 months ahead to be 0.5 percentage point or more above the 2 percent target.
- 2. 'Medium term inflation expectations no longer remain sufficiently well anchored.' -
- 3. 'The Financial Policy Committee judges that the stance of monetary policy poses a significant threat to financial stability. . . .'

In addition to providing greater clarity about the MPC's reaction function, the guidance was intended to keep market participants from 'revising up excessively their expectations of the future path of Bank Rate' as the economic recovery gains traction. However, the market implied path of U.K. policy -rates, shown in the upper left figure on the next page, has risen significantly since early August, -appearing to price in a rate hike in early 2015.

Part of the explanation for the failure of the BOE's guidance to restrain the run up in rates may lie with -the strength of recent data on the U.K. economy. Part may also be driven by global factors such as anticipations of Federal Reserve policy. However, on the day of the announcement, U.K sovereign yields edged up, the British pound appreciated, and stock prices fell. That immediate market reaction may have reflected concerns that the unemployment threshold or any one of the three knockouts might bring about a rate hike earlier than in the BOE's forecast, despite the BOE's statement that there is 'no presumption that breaching any of these knockouts would lead to an immediate increase in Bank Rate or sale of assets.' 2

On the eve of the guidance release, market expectations appeared to have coalesced around a range of 6½ to 7 percent for the unemployment rate threshold. The announced 7 percent threshold was at the high side of market expectations and therefore did not signal a commitment to greater policy accommodation. Moreover, as shown by the BOE's fan chart in the upper right figure, the speed at -which the unemployment rate is projected to fall to the threshold is quite uncertain. Although the BOE sees around a 50 percent probability that the rate will remain above 7 percent through mid 2016, -the outlook also includes a significant chance that the threshold will be reached much earlier. The BOE is counting on a rebound in labor productivity, which collapsed after the recession, to slow the fall in

unemployment, even as GDP growth picks up. However, market participants may expect productivity to underperform and the unemployment rate to fall more rapidly.

Markets also may be assigning some probability to the prospect that one of the inflation knockouts could be triggered before the unemployment rate crosses the 7 percent threshold. In particular, the BOE's current inflation forecast, shown in the lower left figure, has a central tendency within the -18 to 24 month window of just above 2 percent. However, with U.K. inflation running persistently ---above 2½ percent, markets may be concerned that inflation could fall more slowly than currently forecast. In addition, as shown in the lower right figure, the BOE's forecast for inflation 18 to -24 months ahead, which over the past six years has almost uniformly underpredicted actual inflation, has been rising over time and is currently quite near the 2½ percent knockout level.

Our projection for the path of the U.K. policy rate falls between that of the market and that implied by the BOE's forecast for the unemployment rate. In our baseline forecast, which assumes some pickup in labor productivity, the unemployment rate falls below 7 percent in 2015, and we see the first BOE rate hike late that year.

recovery in the advanced economies continues to boost external demand.  Reflecting recent positive indicators, we marked up our outlook for China and some other  emerging Asian economies.  Nevertheless, our near-term outlook for growth in the EMEs is ¼ percentage point lower than in the July Tealbook.  We downgraded the outlook for Mexico significantly in light of the second-quarter downward surprise and a markdown to U.S. manufacturing activity.  In addition, to account for the recent heightening of financial stresses, we have revised down growth in some especially vulnerable EMEsBrazil, India, and Indonesia-by around ½ percentage point, and in several others by lesser amounts.  Although, over time, the cumulative depreciations of their currencies should provide some offset via net exports, the rise in interest rates and capital outflows should restrain activity through increased financing costs and a falloff in credit growth.

Our baseline forecast does not call for any of the EMEs to enter into a crisis. Despite the markets' focus on economies with pronounced vulnerabilities, economic fundamentals and policy space generally remain much better than they were during the crisis periods of the 1980s and 1990s.  However, the downside risk of much greater financial turbulence, which could push one or more of these economies into crisis, has increased.

We see inflation in the EMEs remaining at an annual rate of about 3 percent in the current quarter.  EME inflation is expected to pick up a bit to 3¼ percent over the remainder of the forecast period, as recent currency depreciations in some economies pass through to consumer prices.  Over the intermeeting period, the central banks of Brazil and Indonesia raised their policy rates, citing concerns about currency depreciation and its implications for inflation.  Some other countries, such as India and Turkey, also implemented measures to tighten policy.  In contrast, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate in response to the surprisingly weak GDP data.

China

In China, data since the July Tealbook indicate that GDP growth has picked up from the soft 7 percent pace in the first half of the year.  In July and August, industrial production accelerated, and investment and retail sales growth remained relatively strong. The PMI also moved higher in August, with a large increase in the new orders subindex, suggesting that the positive momentum should continue in the coming months.  Thus, we marked up GDP growth in the second half of this year about ¼ percentage point, to a little more than 7½ percent in the third quarter and nearly 8 percent in the fourth.  GDP

growth is projected to remain around that pace in the first half of 2014-about our estimate of Chinese potential-before gradually slowing to 7½ percent by the end of the forecast period as trend growth declines.  Chinese authorities enacted some targeted stimulus measures in late July, such as tax cuts for smaller enterprises, but with the improved outlook for the economy, larger-scale stimulus policies are unlikely as authorities remain focused on economic reforms.

Other Emerging Asia

Real GDP growth stepped up to 3¾ percent in the second quarter, 1 percentage point higher than what we had estimated in the July Tealbook, reflecting surprisingly strong data releases in many countries.  An exception was India, where growth disappointed, led by a sharp contraction in the manufacturing sector.  We expect growth for these economies will average about 3¾ percent in the second half of the year.  We marked down our estimate of growth in Indonesia and India given recent financial turbulence and weak incoming data such as PMIs, but these revisions were offset by stronger exports and output data elsewhere in the region.  Over the medium term, we have growth rising to 4½ percent, as external demand from the advanced economies picks up.

We expect inflation in emerging Asia to increase from 1¾ percent in the second quarter to 3¾ percent in the third quarter, in part as Indonesia reduces its subsidy on energy prices and food prices rise in Korea.  We expect inflation to stabilize around 3½ percent over the rest of the forecast period.

Latin America

Mexican real GDP fell nearly 3 percent in the second quarter, a whopping 4½ percentage points below our July Tealbook estimate, and first-quarter GDP growth was also revised down to about zero from an already tepid 1¾ percent.  Although GDP components will not be released until late September, other second-quarter data pointed to weakness in domestic demand that appeared to reflect a combination of factorshigher uncertainty about future taxes, softness in housing construction, and shortfalls in some categories of U.S. manufacturing production.  However, the auto sector remained a bright spot, as vehicle production and exports expanded.

We anticipate a modest economic recovery in Mexico, with growth rising to 2¾ percent in the second half of this year and to about 3½ percent thereafter.  Incoming

data support this view, with exports up in July and the manufacturing PMI moving into expansionary territory in August.  Nevertheless, the forecast is revised down ½ percentage point in the second half of this year, as we have taken on board some of the weakness in the first half, and just a bit thereafter because of a lower path for U.S. manufacturing production over the forecast period.

Inflation in Mexico jumped to an annual rate of 5¼ percent in the second quarter as administered prices for public transportation were increased.  We estimate that inflation will moderate to about 2 percent in the current quarter, reflecting declines in food prices through August.  Once these transitory factors play out, we see Mexican inflation hovering near 3½ percent over the forecast period.  In response to concerns of growing economic slack, the Bank of Mexico cut its policy rate 25 basis points.

Brazilian real GDP jumped 6 percent in the second quarter, 3½ percentage points above our July Tealbook estimate, boosted by a sharp rebound in exports.  But recent indicators have worsened-exports contracted in July and August and PMIs weakened further through August.  Moreover, there are signs that recent financial stresses are weighing on the economy.  In July, consumer confidence fell sharply, credit growth slowed, and the cost of credit rose further for households and firms.  Accordingly, we expect real GDP growth to average 1¼ percent in the second half of the year before gradually rising to 3¾ percent by 2016, as financial conditions slowly improve and growth in the advanced economies strengthens further.  This projection is marked down from the previous Tealbook, especially in the near term, on higher financial stresses and tighter monetary policy conditions.

We estimate that inflation in Brazil moderated further to an annual rate of 4¾ percent in the current quarter from almost 6 percent in the second quarter, reflecting a decline in food prices after earlier increases.  Despite this moderation and a further tightening of monetary policy, we project inflation to pick up again to 5¾ percent over the next few quarters-a somewhat higher forecast than we wrote down in the July Tealbook-because of the pass-through from substantial past depreciation of the real. Thereafter, we see inflation settling at about 5¼ percent.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

Financial Developments

Market expectations that the Committee will begin to cut the pace of asset purchases at the September meeting appeared to increase over the intermeeting period.  In addition, the implied path for the federal funds rate priced into derivatives markets shifted up, apparently reflecting in part wider term premiums associated with increased uncertainty about the monetary policy outlook.  Reflecting these developments, interest rates moved up and the foreign exchange value of the dollar increased slightly.

-  Responses to the Survey of Primary Dealers suggest that market participants have marked up somewhat the odds that the FOMC will begin to cut the pace of asset purchases at the September meeting.  Views on the likely size of the reduction (conditional on its occurring) were unchanged, with a $10 billion reduction for Treasury securities and a $5 billion reduction for MBS seen as most likely.
-  Five- and 10-year Treasury yields rose about 40 basis points and 35 basis points, respectively, over the period.  Increased uncertainty about the policy outlook, along with investors' apparent tendency to view a lower path for asset purchases as likely to be associated with a higher path for the federal funds rate, reportedly contributed to the rise in yields.  Yields on corporate bonds and agency MBS rose about in line with those on Treasury securities. Concerns about the U.S. debt limit have left no significant imprint in markets thus far.
-  Equity prices over the period were fairly volatile but, on net, little changed.
-  The foreign exchange value of the dollar increased a bit less than 1 percent over the period, with most of the gains coming against emerging market currencies.  Many emerging market economies continued to experience financial turbulence, partly in response to the heightened expectations of policy normalization in the United States and other advanced economies.
-  The available data suggest that aggregate borrowing by households and nonfinancial firms has been fairly resilient in the face of higher interest rates, but the full effects of higher rates on borrowing have probably not yet shown through.

TREASURY AND OTHER BENCHMARK YIELDS AND POLICY EXPECTATIONS

Five-, 10-, and 30-year Treasury yields increased about 40, 35, and 25 basis points, respectively, over the intermeeting period.  These increases came amid somewhat higher expectations among market participants that the FOMC will begin to cut the pace of large-scale asset purchases at its September meeting and greater uncertainty about the outlook for monetary policy.

The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of financial market quotes steepened notably during the period, and intermediate-horizon forward interest rates showed pronounced increases.   A staff model that accounts for the zero lower bound on 1 nominal interest rates attributes a substantial portion of the shift in the implied federal funds rate path to higher term premiums, consistent with the rise in option-implied measures of uncertainty about the future trajectory for the federal funds rate.  Market commentary suggested that a portion of this increased uncertainty may be attributable to investors' sense that potential changes in Federal Reserve leadership could influence the Committee's approach to monetary policy.  Moreover, some investors apparently continued to revise up their expectations for the federal funds rate, as they placed higher odds on a reduction in asset purchases.

In contrast to the market-based quotes, the results from the Open Market Desk's September Survey of Primary Dealers showed little change in the projected liftoff date for the federal funds rate and the subsequent path of the policy rate relative to the July survey.  The median expectation of the mostly likely time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate remained at the third quarter of 2015.  Compared with the July survey, the median dealer is a bit more confident that the FOMC will begin to cut the pace of asset purchases at its September meeting.  Among those who expect a reduction in September, the median dealer now expects a cut of $10 billion in Treasury securities and $5 billion in MBS purchases, unchanged from the July survey.  In a special question, dealers were asked to rate the importance of a range of factors that potentially contributed to the recent increase in the 10-year Treasury yield.  Dealers rated 'change in market perception of appropriate policy rate path,' 'uncertainty over monetary policy,' and 'uncertainty over Federal Reserve leadership succession' as the most important factors driving the increase in the 10-year yield.

In addition to these developments, heightened tensions in Syria reportedly triggered intermittent flight-to-safety flows, resulting in some downward pressure on Treasury yields.  The perceived odds and potential scale of a U.S. intervention have fluctuated but seemed to have diminished significantly by the end of the period.

Market dynamics such as deleveraging, convexity hedging, and crowded trades that were thought to have amplified the increases in longer-term interest rates earlier in the summer appear to have moderated in August and September.  Indeed, mortgage convexity-hedging flows have reportedly been small, and the pace of net redemptions from bond funds-though still significant-slowed over the intermeeting period.  That said, anecdotes from some market participants suggest that the rebalancing process that has been associated with the recent increase in interest rates may not yet be complete.

Agency MBS yields and interest rates in the primary mortgage market rose about in line with the 10-year Treasury yield, ending the period approximately 30 basis points higher at about 3.7 percent and 4.55 percent, respectively.  Yields on investment- and speculative-grade corporate bonds also rose about in line with those on Treasury securities of comparable maturity.  In addition, yields on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS) followed those on nominal Treasury securities, leaving TIPS-based inflation compensation little changed, on net, over the intermeeting period.

TREASURY AND AGENCY FINANCE AND MARKET FUNCTIONING

The Treasury continued to operate under a 'debt issuance suspension period,' which allows it to use accounting measures to remain below the statutory debt limit while issuing new securities.   Consistent with the staff's view, the Treasury announced on 2 August 26 its expectation that these accounting measures will be exhausted in mid-October, and that thereafter, the Treasury would be forced to fund the government only with the cash on hand on any given day.  Yields on Treasury bills maturing after October 15 suggest that market participants have not thus far priced in any financial

market disruptions from the potential debt-limit breach (see the box 'Debt Subject to Limit').

The Desk continued outright purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS as liquidity in the latter market improved modestly but remained below long-term averages. 3 The spread between the executed and the second-most-favorable price offered in Federal Reserve MBS operations-a measure of liquidity-narrowed a bit compared with the widest level reached during the preceding intermeeting period.  That said, the average MBS trade size continued to be smaller than it was at the start of the year amid continued volatility in the market, fewer mortgage originations, and light summer trading.  Dollarroll implied financing rates for 30-year Fannie Mae 3.5 percent and 4.0 percent coupon securities stayed near their recent high levels, suggesting limited settlement pressure in the TBA market for these securities, and the Desk engaged in less dollar roll activity during the July and August settlement cycles than earlier in the year. 4

DOMESTIC EQUITY MARKET DEVELOPMENTS

Equity prices trended down, on net, in August, as investors appeared to have been focused primarily on the tighter outlook for monetary policy and the risks associated with a wider conflict in Syria.  However, the decline was fully retraced later in the period as concerns about Syria ebbed and the news on economic activity in China improved on net. The VIX, an index of options-implied volatility for one-month returns on the S&amp;P 500 index, was little changed, on net, during the period, and the equity risk premium-as measured by the difference between the staff's estimate of the expected equity return for the S&amp;P 500 index and the expected real 10-year Treasury yield-was also about unchanged.  Gross equity issuance by nonfinancial firms remained solid, boosted in part by a surge in initial public offerings.

FOREIGN DEVELOPMENTS

Over the intermeeting period, investors continued to pull back from exposure to the emerging market economies (EMEs) against a backdrop of higher interest rates in the

Debt Subject to Limit

The U.S. Treasury is operating under a debt issuance suspension period (DISP) and using extraordinary measures to avoid breaching the statuatory debt limit of $16.699 trillion. 1 The Board staff estimates that $29 billion remain of the roughly $305 billion in extraordinary measures, implying, as shown in the top figure on the next page, that the Treasury can continue operations and not breach the debt ceiling until at least mid October. -2 Consistent with this projection, in a letter to the Congress on August 26, Secretary of the Treasury Lew noted that the Treasury expects to exhaust extraordinary measures in the middle of October. However, forecasts for the breach date are inherently uncertain, in part reflecting difficulties in predicting Treasury nonmarketable debt issuances and September corporate tax payments. 3

Market participants do not thus far appear to be pricing in any financial market disruptions as a result of the looming debt limit breach. For example, as shown in the bottom figure on the next page, Treasury bill yields around the projected breach date do not exhibit noticeable spikes around mid October. -Similarly, spreads on one year -and five year U.S. credit default swaps are little changed over the intermeeting period. -That said, in past debt limit episodes, stresses in these measures usually did not emerge until a debt limit breach appeared imminent.

Fitch Ratings recently stated that failure to reach agreement on raising the debt limit in a timely manner would prompt a review of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. However, S&amp;P raised the outlook on the U.S. government's credit rating from negative to stable in June, under the assumption that the debt limit would be raised without any market disruptions. Similarly, Moody's changed the outlook on its U.S. sovereign bond rating from negative to stable in July, with no mention of debt limit concerns.

advanced economies, some improvement in the outlook for Europe, and slowing growth in the EMEs themselves.  As a result, flows out of EME bond and equity funds, which had been substantial in June, continued through early September, though at a more moderate pace.  On a trade-weighted basis, EME currencies have depreciated a bit less than 1 percent against the dollar since the July FOMC meeting.  The currencies of Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Turkey continued to depreciate sharply against the dollar through August but have since retraced some of these declines.  In response to market pressures, some governments took actions to support their currencies, including tightening monetary policy, modifying capital controls, and purchasing their currencies in foreign exchange markets.  EME sovereign yields and CDS premiums on sovereign debt increased over the period, particularly in those countries experiencing the sharpest currency depreciations. EMEs that have experienced disappointing growth, high inflation, or large current account deficits have come under the greatest market pressure (see the box 'Financial Distress and Vulnerabilities in Emerging Market Economies' in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).

Sovereign yields in the United Kingdom and Germany continued to rise as data on economic activity in Europe generally came in above market expectations.  As in the United States, the rise in yields appears to have reflected increases in both policy expectations and term premiums.  OIS rates at the one- to two-year maturity rose in the euro area and the United Kingdom despite the recent provision of forward guidance by central banks in both economies that seems to preclude any near-term rise in policy rates (see the box 'Forward Guidance by the Bank of England' in the International Economic Developments and Outlook section).  Sovereign yield spreads in Spain and Italy declined during the period and European equity markets rose modestly.  On net over the period, the dollar was up slightly against the major currencies.

Foreign official investors, including those from the EMEs facing currency depreciation pressures, made substantial sales of U.S. securities, especially Treasury securities, in June.  However, July data indicate smaller sales of Treasury securities that were more than offset by purchases of agency debt, and recent data on custody holdings at the FRBNY suggest that foreign official investors continued buying agencies in August.  Foreign private investors bought small amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and sold U.S. corporate securities in both June and July.

SHORT-TERM FUNDING MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

Conditions in short-term dollar funding markets remained generally benign during the intermeeting period.  The spread between three-month LIBOR and comparablematurity OIS rates was about unchanged, and forward-looking measures of funding stress were quiescent.  Although rates on U.S. unsecured financial CP stepped up a bit in early September, they ended the period about unchanged.  In secured funding markets, overnight GCF repo rates continued to be low across collateral types, consistent with a reported scarcity of available collateral and reduced financing activities of dealers.

Responses to the September 2013 Senior Credit Officer Opinion Survey on Dealer Financing Terms generally suggested little change over the past three months in the credit terms applicable to most classes of counterparties covered by the survey.  One notable exception was that nearly one-fourth of the dealers reported tightening nonprice terms offered to trading REITs.  Respondents noted that the use of financial leverage by most classes of counterparties remained largely unchanged during this period.  That said, a moderate net fraction of respondents reported a decline in financial-leverage use by hedge funds, and a more substantial net fraction of dealers reported a decrease in financial-leverage use by trading REITs.  About one-fourth of respondents also indicated that demand for funding for agency MBS had decreased somewhat.  In response to special questions in the survey, dealers indicated that liquidity and functioning deteriorated in a number of fixed-income markets during the period of heightened volatility from May to early July.  These markets included those for Treasury securities and agency MBS, which are typically perceived to be the most liquid and deep, as well as those for TIPS and corporate bonds.

Stocks prices for financial-sector firms underperformed the broad equity market somewhat over the intermeeting period.  That said, CDS spreads for the largest bank holding companies remained stable at levels near the bottom of their range over the past five years.

BORROWING BY THE NONFINANCIAL SECTORS

The available data suggest that aggregate borrowing by nonfinancial businesses, households, and municipal governments has been fairly resilient in the face of higher longer-term interest rates.  However, the full effects of higher rates on borrowing have probably not yet shown through.

Credit flows to nonfinancial businesses remained robust, as the overall credit quality of nonfinancial corporations stayed solid.  Relative to typical summer lulls, gross issuance of corporate bonds and leveraged loans was robust in August, while commercial and industrial (C&amp;I) loans on banks' books continued to expand moderately, on average, in July and August.  Moreover, available reports from firms on their bond-financing plans suggest that gross issuance will likely pick up further in the coming months.  Commercial real estate (CRE) loans at banks accelerated over the summer, and CMBS issuance remained strong despite a slight widening of CMBS spreads.

News about the home mortgage market has been mixed.  While refinancing applications plunged with the rise in longer-term interest rates, applications for purchase mortgages declined modestly.  Anecdotes from the mortgage industry are broadly consistent with the aggregate applications data:  Although several lenders have announced layoffs in response to the decline in refinancing activity, lenders reportedly do not anticipate a persistent decline in purchase mortgage originations, which appear to have been supported by labor market improvements and pent-up housing demand. Indeed, although the pace of home price appreciation moderated a bit in July, it has so far remained robust despite higher interest rates, with national house price indexes increasing between 6 and 12 percent from a year earlier.  A better read on the full effects of higher interest rates on household borrowing is expected to be available in the fall.

In terms of nonmortgage credit, auto and student loans both continued to expand rapidly in recent months, while revolving credit balances stayed about flat, reflecting still-tight credit conditions in many segments of the credit card market.  Consumer ABS issuance remained robust in July and August as ABS yield spreads stabilized at levels somewhat wider than earlier this year.

Regarding the municipal bond market, despite persistent outflows from tax-exempt bond funds, ongoing bankruptcy proceedings for Detroit, and greater scrutiny of Puerto Rico's significant fiscal problems, few signs of widespread distress emerged during the intermeeting period.  Broad market sentiment was reportedly buoyed by a further modest easing of budget pressures for many other states and localities.  Gross issuance of long-term municipal bonds remained solid in August, and yield ratios on general obligation municipal bonds over comparable-duration Treasury securities were, on balance, about unchanged.

COMMERCIAL BANKING AND MONEY

Bank credit declined in July and August amid the ongoing rise in longer-term interest rates.  Growth in loan categories such as C&amp;I, CRE, and auto that are more likely to have floating interest rates or relatively short maturities-and therefore less duration risk-has tended to hold up in recent months.  Indeed, according to the August Survey of Terms of Business Lending, interest rates and loan rate spreads on newly originated C&amp;I loans declined amid ongoing competition among banks for such assets.  In contrast, assets with longer duration-including residential mortgages and some securities-have decreased.  Net unrealized gains on banks' holdings of available-for-sale securities decreased somewhat further in July and August.

M2 expanded fairly rapidly in July and August as the sharp selloff in fixedincome markets that began in June, along with the associated outflows from bond funds, likely continued to support reallocations to M2 assets.  The monetary base continued to expand rapidly, primarily reflecting the increase in reserve balances resulting from the Federal Reserve's asset purchases.   The accumulation of reserve balances over the 5 period left the stock of balances last month about evenly split between those held by domestic institutions and those held by U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.

Risks and Uncertainty

ASSESSMENT OF RISKS

We continue to view the uncertainty around our projection for economic activity as roughly normal relative to the experience of the past 20 years (the benchmark used by the FOMC), a period that includes considerable volatility.   We see a number of risks 1 attending our forecast, including those posed by an intensification of economic and financial stresses in emerging market economies (EMEs) or the euro area; the need to lift the federal debt limit and settle on annual budget appropriations in the coming months; and the possibility that the tightening in financial conditions in recent months will exert greater restraint on the recovery, particularly in the housing sector, than we project.  A related concern is the ability of the economy to weather future negative shocks, as monetary policy has a limited capacity to counteract the effects of any new adverse developments.  Given these considerations, we continue to believe that the risks to domestic economic activity are skewed to the downside.

Our view of the risks to the economic outlook has been informed by the staff's recently completed quantitative surveillance (QS) assessment of vulnerabilities in the financial system, which concluded that developments over the summer had mixed and largely offsetting implications for financial stability.  On the one hand, the sharp rise in interest rates and the associated outflows from bond funds eased concerns about overvaluation in some fixed-income markets and reduced some of the momentum toward greater risk-taking.  On the other hand, some developments this summer-including continued strong demand for risky business credits, forced asset sales by some levered investors, and reduced liquidity provision by dealers during the period of market volatility-highlighted the presence of channels that could amplify future shocks.  The September QS assessment reiterated the financial system's vulnerabilities stemming from

the complexity and interconnectedness of large financial institutions and from structural issues in wholesale short-term funding markets.  Nonetheless, it suggested that current vulnerabilities in the U.S. financial system are not unusually pronounced, in large part because, relative to the period before the crisis and regulatory reform, loss-absorbing capital has increased, and the reliance on short-term funding and the exposure of financial institutions to household credit risk have decreased.

With regard to inflation, we see significant uncertainty around our projection but do not view the current level of uncertainty as unusually high.  Longer-run inflation expectations appear to have remained stable in recent years despite large fluctuations in the prices of crude oil and other commodities and persistently wide margins of slack in labor and product markets.  Furthermore, we still view the risks to our inflation forecast as broadly balanced.  On the downside, there is the possibility that the soft readings on inflation seen earlier this year could reemerge if low levels of resource utilization or subdued increases in unit labor costs persist longer or have larger effects than we currently project.  On the upside, an increase in inflation expectations, potentially related to concerns about the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the ability to execute a timely exit from the current stance of policy, could cause inflation to rise, as could a stronger-than-expected recovery or a larger amount of damage to the supply side of the economy than assumed in the baseline.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIOS

To illustrate some of the risks to the outlook, we construct a number of alternatives to the baseline projection using simulations of staff models.  In the first scenario, long-term interest rates are persistently higher than in the baseline, restraining activity in the housing sector and boosting the dollar relative to the baseline.  The second scenario considers the possibility that the substantial decline in the unemployment rate seen over the past year is a more accurate signal of the pace of the recovery than the modest gains in real GDP, and that going forward GDP accelerates more markedly.  In the third scenario, by contrast, the combination of steady declines in the unemployment rate and tepid GDP growth seen over recent quarters reflects greater damage to the supply side than assumed in the baseline.  The fourth scenario considers the risk that the softness in consumer price inflation seen earlier this year will prove to be more persistent than expected.  The final two scenarios explore risks to the U.S. economy from foreign economic developments-in the fifth scenario, recent financial stresses experienced by

EMEs escalate into a full-blown crisis, and in the sixth, geopolitical tensions lead to a sharp run-up in oil prices.

We generate the first four scenarios using the FRB/US model and the last two using the multicountry SIGMA model.  In the FRB/US simulations, as in the baseline forecast, the federal funds rate follows an inertial version of the Taylor (1999) rule, subject to the FOMC's thresholds for the unemployment rate and projected inflation.  For the SIGMA simulations, we use a broadly similar policy rule, subject to the same thresholds, but employ an alternative concept of resource utilization.   In all cases, we 2 assume that the size and composition of the SOMA portfolio follow their baseline paths.

Higher Interest Rates with Housing Spillovers

Over the past six months, longer-term interest rates have moved markedly higher than we had expected.  In this scenario, we assume Treasury yields once again surprise us.  Specifically, longer-term interest rates are assumed to run persistently above the baseline and are about 75 basis points higher by early next year, causing the dollar to appreciate about 2½ percent relative to the baseline by 2014.  Moreover, and in contrast to the baseline forecast, we assume that these increases in yields have a sharp depressing effect on housing activity.   House prices decelerate sharply through late 2015 and are 3 10 percent below baseline by 2016.  These developments shave about ¾ percentage point off the average annual growth rate of real GDP through 2015.  The unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent until late 2015, at which point total inflation is still running below 1½ percent.  The shortfall in economic performance relative to the baseline causes the first increase in the federal funds rate to be delayed until the second quarter of 2016.

Faster Recovery

Real GDP has grown only modestly over the past few years, and yet the unemployment rate has declined substantially.  In the staff baseline projection, we have interpreted the weak readings on GDP as resulting from headwinds that will continue to restrain aggregate demand going forward.  An alternative possibility is that the recent

gains in real GDP growth have been understating the true strength of the economy, and other indicators-such as GDI and labor market conditions-have in fact been sending a clearer signal.  In this scenario, the improvements seen in household wealth and consumer sentiment over the past year lead to a more rapid pickup in consumer spending than in the baseline projection.  Real GDP rises at an annual rate of 4 percent in the second half of this year and about 3½ percent on average over 2014 and 2015; the unemployment rate falls below 6½ percent by mid-2014 and reaches its natural rate of 5.2 percent by early 2016.  With resource slack decreasing more rapidly, wages and unit labor costs accelerate gradually relative to the baseline; however, with long-term inflation expectations assumed to remain well anchored, consumer price inflation rises to only 2 percent by 2018.  The federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound by the third quarter of 2014.

Supply-Side Damage

In this scenario, the observations of sluggish real GDP growth and a falling unemployment rate in recent years indicate not that the estimates of GDP understate the strength of the economy, as in the previous scenario, but rather that the damage to aggregate supply during the past several years is greater than is assumed in the baseline. Accordingly, potential output is assumed to have expanded at an annual rate of only 1¼ percent since 2011, ½ percentage point lower than in the baseline, and continues to rise more slowly than in the baseline through 2018.  As a result, the current output gap is 1½ percentage points narrower than in the baseline.  Real GDP rises at a rate of 2½ percent per year, on average, through 2015, but the unemployment rate nonetheless continues to decline at roughly the same pace as it has since late 2010 and falls below 6½ percent by the third quarter of 2014.   With resource slack substantially narrower and 4 productivity gains smaller than in the baseline, inflation rises to 2 percent by 2016, and the federal funds rate begins to rise from its effective lower bound in the fourth quarter of 2014, two quarters earlier than in the baseline.

Low Inflation

In the baseline forecast, the low readings on core inflation seen earlier this year are assumed to have been partially transitory, and over the next few years, inflation gradually moves back toward 2 percent.  In this scenario, the recent performance of

inflation proves to be a harbinger of a longer-lasting decline in actual inflation, bringing down longer-run inflation expectations and thereby leading to a mutually reinforcing downward dynamic.  Inflation is below 1 percent next year and edges down further thereafter, falling close to zero.  In this environment, investors become increasingly concerned that the economy is mired in a weak state with price behavior verging on deflation and monetary policy remaining constrained by the effective lower bound for the federal funds rate.  As a result, bond premiums rise and put upward pressure on real longterm interest rates, modestly restraining household and business spending and boosting unemployment relative to the baseline over the next few years.  While the unemployment rate falls below its 6½ percent threshold in the third quarter of 2015, the policy rule does not prescribe the first increase in the federal funds rate until the third quarter of 2016.  By then, the unemployment rate is nearly at its natural rate.  But given the persistent downward shift in inflation expectations, inflation remains well below the FOMC's longrun objective.

Financial Crisis in the Emerging Market Economies

Financial conditions in the EMEs have deteriorated over the past several months as EME growth has come in weaker than anticipated and interest rates have risen in the advanced economies.  In our baseline, we expect these stresses to remain manageable, but the likelihood of more disruptive events has risen.  This scenario considers the possibility that financial stress in the EMEs intensifies markedly, precipitating a financial crisis in one or more of the most vulnerable economies which then spills over to EMEs more broadly.  Sovereign and private borrowing costs in the EMEs soar, and the confidence of EME households and businesses weakens significantly.  These events cause EME currencies to depreciate more than 5 percent on average relative to the baseline, even though EME central banks are assumed to raise policy rates in order to attenuate capital outflows.  All told, real GDP in the EMEs declines 4½ percent relative to the baseline by the end of 2014.

The financial stress in the EMEs is assumed to have some financial spillovers to the rest of the world, including the United States:  Corporate bond spreads rise and equity prices decline relative to the baseline, while flight-to-safety flows push down term premiums on government bond yields.  In addition, weaker foreign economic activity and the stronger exchange value of the dollar depress U.S. net exports.  As a result, U.S. real GDP growth drops to a meager 1¾ percent in 2014, and the unemployment rate stays above 7 percent through 2014 before beginning to gradually decline.  With substantially

greater resource slack and lower import prices, overall U.S. consumer price inflation slows to ½ percent in the second half of 2013 and to nearly zero in 2014.  Under these conditions, the federal funds rate remains at its effective lower bound two quarters longer than in the baseline, until the end of 2015.

Higher Oil Prices

The escalating tensions in Syria and the political turmoil in Egypt have elevated the risk of an abrupt reduction in global oil supply.  In this scenario, we assume that greater geopolitical stresses and supply and transportation disruptions temporarily increase oil prices $35 per barrel above baseline at the end of this year, but that prices then partially recede, leveling out at $15 per barrel above baseline. 5 U.S. domestic demand falls relative to the baseline because higher oil prices reduce households' real income and lower the return on firms' investments, while real exports also decline because of weaker foreign economic activity.  U.S. real GDP rises at an annual rate of about 2½ percent, on average, in the second half of this year and next year¼ percentage point below baseline-and the unemployment rate is roughly 6¾ percent at the end of 2014, about ¼ percentage point higher than in the baseline.  Reflecting the rise in energy costs, overall PCE inflation jumps to 4½ percent at an annual rate in the second half of this year.  However, because the public recognizes that the direct impetus of higher oil prices to inflation is only temporary, inflation expectations remain well anchored and actual inflation subsequently moves back to baseline.  In response to the partly offsetting implications for policy of higher inflation and weaker real activity, the federal funds rate lifts off from its effective lower bound at the same time as in the baseline but rises more gradually thereafter.
