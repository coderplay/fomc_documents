Monetary Policy Alternatives

Data received since the Committee met in February indicate that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace and that inflation moved closer to the FOMC's 2 percent longer-run objective.  There are two key questions for the Committee at this meeting:  first, whether the available information warrants raising the federal funds rate; and second, whether the economic outlook and associated risks indicate that the funds rate path suggested by recent FOMC statements remains appropriate or call for signaling a somewhat different path of rate hikes.  The employment report for February will be released after this Tealbook is published but before the FOMC meeting; consequently, this Tealbook includes four draft statements.  Alternatives A, B, and C are intended for consideration if the employment report shows that the labor market has developed broadly in line with expectations or that it has strengthened more than expected. Alternative Bʹ is intended for consideration if the employment report falls significantly short of expectations.

-  Alternatives A, B, and C all characterize recent economic activity as having continued to expand at a moderate pace.  The Alternatives differ somewhat in their interpretation of the incoming data on inflation, unemployment, and business fixed investment.
- o These three Alternatives recognize that inflation has increased, moving 'toward' (Alternative A) or 'close to' (Alternatives B and C) the Committee's 2 percent objective.  At the same time, Alternative A states that the rise 'largely reflected the temporary effects of recent increases in energy prices' while Alternative B indicates that 'excluding energy and food prices, inflation is little changed and continues to run somewhat below 2 percent.' When discussing longer-term inflation expectations, Alternatives A and B characterize market-based measures of inflation compensation as remaining low, while Alternative C states that such measures are little changed.  All three Alternatives note that survey-based measures of expected inflation are little changed.
- o With respect to the labor market, Alternative A indicates that it 'strengthened somewhat in recent months,' while Alternatives B and C note that the labor market 'has continued to strengthen.'  Moreover, Alternative A, unlike Alternatives B and C, states that 'the unemployment rate and other indicators

of labor utilization have changed little, on balance,' and that 'wage pressures have remained subdued.'

- o All of the Alternatives indicate that consumer spending has continued to rise moderately.  Whereas Alternatives B and C state that business fixed investment 'appears to have firmed somewhat,' Alternative A says it 'has risen modestly.'  Inasmuch as the Committee now has information indicating how consumer and business spending have evolved since the election, the draft Alternatives no longer reference recent improvements in measures of consumer and business sentiment.
-  In describing the medium-term outlook for inflation, Alternatives B and C anticipate that inflation 'will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term,' whereas Alternative A preserves the language of paragraph 2 of the February statement, predicting that inflation 'will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.'  The language concerning the medium-term outlook for economic activity and labor market conditions is unchanged in the three Alternatives.  Alternatives A and B continue to condition the outlook on 'gradual adjustments' in the stance of monetary policy; Alternative C uses 'further gradual adjustments.'
-  All of the Alternatives retain the assessment that near-term risks to the economic outlook 'appear roughly balanced.'
-  Alternatives B and C raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ¾ to 1 percent, whereas Alternative A maintains the current target range.  The Alternatives repeat the formulation from earlier statements indicating that the stance of monetary policy 'remains accommodative.'  All of the Alternatives state that such a stance supports 'a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.'
-  The Alternatives differ somewhat in their description of the prospects for future increases in the federal funds rate.
- o All of the Alternatives delete the February statement's reference to the 'current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent.'
- o Alternatives A and B emphasize that the inflation goal is 'symmetric.'  The combination of 'stabilize around 2 percent' and 'symmetric' may be seen as a signal that the Committee will be neither more nor less concerned when it

sees inflation running temporarily above 2 percent than when it sees inflation running temporarily below 2 percent.

- o Alternatives B and C strike the word 'only' in describing gradual rate increases.
- o Alternative C indicates that the Committee 'currently' expects that the federal funds rate will remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
-  None of the three Alternatives changes the description of the Committee's policy concerning reinvestment.
-  Inasmuch as Alternative Bʹ is predicated upon the release, on March 10, of a quite weak February employment report, it declares that 'the pace of improvement in the labor market diminished in recent months.'  Moreover, it indicates that 'job gains slowed sharply and the unemployment rate rose.'
- o Alternative Bʹ maintains the current target range for the federal funds rate and indicates that the Committee will be assessing 'whether incoming information is consistent with the Committee's current economic outlook.'

JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2017 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.  Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft.  Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. Inflation increased in recent quarters but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.  Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

MARCH 2017 ALTERNATIVE Bʹ  (CONTINGENCY DRAFT)

- 1.

Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. Although growth in employment slowed recently, the Committee continues to expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.

This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE B

Economic Conditions and Outlook

-  Available data indicate that the labor market has continued to strengthen.  Total payrolls rose 227,000 in January; the three-month moving average of total payroll gains was 183,000, well above projected trend growth in the labor force.  Also indicative of a tightening labor market, the labor force participation rate has remained unchanged on net since late 2013, and thus has risen cumulatively about 1 percentage point relative to its trend, as shown in the box 'Labor Force Participation and Labor Market Flows' in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section in Tealbook A.  Although the unemployment rate ticked up in December and January, it is at or near most participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level.
-  Real GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2016 is estimated by the staff at 2 percent, a touch above estimated potential growth.
-  Private domestic final purchases continue to grow at a solid pace, with gains in household income and wealth supporting growth in consumer spending.
-  Data received over the intermeeting period indicate that total PCE price inflation has increased relative to its pace last year.  Twelve-month headline PCE inflation, at 1.9 percent in January, has moved further toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective. The increase over recent quarters in large part reflects rising consumer energy prices; 12-month core PCE inflation, at 1.7 percent in January, has been essentially constant since the middle of last year.  The trimmed mean PCE inflation measure published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas stands at 1.9 percent.
-  Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation are little changed; 5-year, 5-year-forward CPI inflation compensation remains close to 2 percent, which is low by historical standards.  Survey based measures of longer-term inflation expectations also are basically unchanged:  The first-quarter Survey of Professional Forecasters median 10-year inflation projection for PCE prices ticked up a tenth of a percentage point after being essentially flat at 2 percent since early 2013.  The 3-yearahead measure of inflation expectations in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Survey of Consumer Expectations increased a tenth to 3 percent in February.
-  The staff's view of the economic outlook for the next few years-and of the risks to the outlook-has not changed appreciably since the Committee last met.

- o Real GDP is projected to rise at a 2 percent rate this year, and then to pick up to a 2¼ percent pace in 2018 as the assumed fiscal policy changes kick in, before moving back down to 2 percent in 2019.
- o Labor market conditions are projected to strengthen somewhat further over the medium term, with the unemployment rate declining to 4.1 percent by the end of 2019.  Average monthly payroll gains are expected to slow from 170,000 in 2017 to 120,000 in 2019-just a little faster than the range of gains that is consistent with no change in labor market slack.
- o Total PCE price inflation is expected to move a bit above 2 percent in coming months, and then to drop back to a touch below 2 percent during the second half of the year.  Core PCE price inflation is expected to remain close to 1¾ percent this year, and then to move up to 2 percent by 2019 as the restraint from earlier declines in energy prices and non-energy import prices dissipates and the labor market tightens further.  With consumer food and energy prices projected to rise roughly in line with core prices beyond the near term, the staff expects total PCE price inflation to run at about the same pace as core inflation over the next few years.

Policy Strategy

-  If the February employment report is not too far below expectations, policymakers may judge that they have accumulated sufficient evidence that the real economy and inflation are evolving about as expected to warrant an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.  Given an expectation that the neutral rate of interest will gradually increase toward its longer-run level, policymakers might continue to expect that the appropriate pace of further increases in the target range will also be gradual. As shown in the special exhibit 'Optimal Control Using a Projection Consistent with the SEP' in the Monetary Policy Strategies section of Tealbook A, such a gradual path would be consistent with optimal control simulations that take the median responses to the December SEP as the baseline outlook.
-  Given the uncertainty about the timing, size, and composition of prospective changes in fiscal policy, policymakers may still consider it premature to communicate that they see an appreciable change either in their modal economic outlook or in the associated path of the federal funds rate that would be consistent with achieving their statutory goals.  Or, even if they judge that the appropriate path for the federal funds

rate has steepened, participants may still see the pace of likely rate increases as gradual by historical standards.  To the extent this is so, participants may see paragraphs 2 and 4 of Alternative B as appropriately preserving the Committee's flexibility going forward.

- o In contrast to the February statement, paragraph 2 of Alternative B expresses the expectation that inflation 'will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term' (rather than 'will rise to 2 percent over the medium term'), and paragraph 4 acknowledges progress toward the 2 percent inflation goal by striking the reference to the 'current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent.' These changes, combined with the deletion of the word 'only' in describing gradual rate increases in paragraph 4 of Alternative B, may be seen as suggesting greater confidence in a pace of rate hikes that is faster than that observed in 2016.
-  As shown in figure 1 of the box 'Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty,' financial market quotes embed a probability of about 90 percent that the Committee will raise the target range at this meeting.  Respondents to the Desk's latest Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants (figure 2) concur in this assessment. Looking ahead, respondents expect three rate hikes this year (of 25 basis point each) but, importantly, they do not seem to have revised their estimates for the number of rate hikes in 2018 (with a median estimate of three hikes) and 2019 (two hikes).

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE C

Economic Conditions and Outlook

-  Labor market conditions are strong and have continued to strengthen.  Despite a recent uptick, the unemployment rate is at or near participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level and below the staff's estimate of the natural rate.  Total payroll gains in January as well as their three-month moving average are well above estimates of the pace needed to maintain a constant unemployment rate over time. Given a declining trend in the labor force participation rate of about 0.3 percentage point per year (the staff's current estimate), the flat participation rate over the past three years represents a cyclical improvement of nearly 1 percentage point, as shown in the box 'Labor Force Participation and Labor Market Flows' in the Domestic Economic Developments and Outlook section in Tealbook A.

Monetary Policy Expectations and Uncertainty

Market participants' perceptions of the odds that the next increase in the target range for the federal funds rate will occur at the March FOMC meeting rose notably over the intermeeting period (figure 1). The market implied probability of the next rate hike -occurring in March moved up from about 25 to 90 percent, with most of the increase occurring toward the end of the intermeeting period following comments by various FOMC participants. The Desk's March Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants showed similarly high odds on a rate increase at the March meeting (figure 2).

Looking further ahead, the probability distribution of the federal funds rate that will prevail at the end of 2017 implied by quotes on Eurodollar futures options (figure 3) shifted to the right; it now shows about equal odds of two, three, or four (or more) rate hikes (of 25 basis points each) this year. The distribution from the March Desk Surveys (figure 4) also shifted to the right and now attaches the highest odds to three rate hikes in the federal funds rate by year end. -Similarly, the median of respondents' modal expectations (not shown) suggests that respondents now view three rate hikes over the course of 2017 as the mostly likely outcome, up from two hikes in the January survey. Beyond the current year, median estimates suggest that respondents continue to see three rate hikes in 2018 and two in 2019 as the most likely outcome.

The federal funds rate path implied by a straight read of OIS quotes (the black lines in figure 5) moved up about 20 basis points over the intermeeting period. Assuming zero risk premiums, these market implied forward rates imply about two and a half rate hikes in -2017 and two in 2018, with the target rate reaching a little less than 2¼ percent by the end of 2020. The staff's OIS based term structure model, which takes the effective lower -bound into account and incorporates information from Blue Chip survey forecasts of the federal funds rate, provides an estimate of the expected federal funds rate that is adjusted for term premiums. The expected path from the model (the light blue lines in figure 5) rose a touch; it suggests that the federal funds rate will rise at a somewhat faster pace of about four hikes per year in 2017 and three hikes in 2018, with the funds rate nearing 3¼ percent by the end of 2020. The difference between the term premium adjusted and -unadjusted paths narrowed somewhat over the intermeeting period, suggesting that OIS rates beyond six months now contain slightly less negative term premiums.

As shown in figure 6, the model based path for the federal funds rate (the light blue line) --continues to lie above the modal path from the Desk Surveys (in brown) but is roughly consistent with the staff's March baseline projection through 2018 (in dark blue).

Results from the model and the surveys also shed light on market participants' expectations of the longer run level of the federal funds rate (the far right dots in --figure 6). The staff's term structure model continues to estimate that the federal funds rate will reach about 3¾ percent over the next five to ten years, about in line with the average of the target funds rate in the staff's March baseline projection over that same time period, but about ¾ percentage point above the median projected longer run federal -funds rate in the March Desk Surveys.

Median of the respondents' modal paths for the federal funds rate

-  Growth in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2016 is estimated at 2 percent, the same as in the January Tealbook.  With the survey measures of consumer confidence still elevated from the respective pre-election levels, and with household wealth having increased appreciably in recent months with the rise in equity prices, participants may see some upside risk to the outlook for real PCE and hence for real GDP.
-  Spending data received during the intermeeting period point to some firming of business fixed investment.  Indicators of business sentiment have been favorable lately, with the headline indexes in the Manufacturing and Non-manufacturing ISM reports, and the Manufacturing Business Outlook Survey from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia all signaling expansion.
-  Twelve-month headline PCE inflation has continued to rise toward the FOMC's 2 percent objective in recent quarters and is expected to run above 2 percent in the near term.
-  Market-based measures of longer-term inflation compensation suggest that downside risks to inflation receded during the fall of last year.  Moreover, the drop in surveybased measures seen late last year proved transitory.

Policy Strategy

-  Policymakers may conclude that the information accumulated since the February meeting, in combination with earlier data, provides ample evidence that the real economy and inflation are evolving about as expected and thus warrants a further reduction in policy accommodation at next week's meeting.  They might note that with stock prices having climbed substantially in the past few months, and business and consumer confidence at elevated levels, there is now a noteworthy risk of 'falling behind the curve' in tightening the stance of monetary policy.
-  In addition, policymakers might regard it as prudent for the Committee's statement to include language signaling that the federal funds rate may rise more quickly than previously expected, though still at a gradual pace.  To that end, paragraph 4 of Alternative C suggests deleting the word 'only' and paragraph 2 adding the word 'further' when describing gradual adjustments in the federal funds rate. Additionally, paragraph 4 uses the phrase 'The Committee currently expects' when describing prospects for future increases in the federal funds rate.

-  Policymakers may be concerned that, with an economy projected to be operating above its long-run potential, inflation might well increase more than the staff expects. This view is consistent with the predictions of models that emphasize nonlinear effects of economic slack on inflation, a possibility that is explored in the alternative scenario 'Steeper Wage Phillips Curve and More Sensitive Long-Run Inflation Expectations' in the Risks and Uncertainty section of Tealbook A.
-  Policymakers might also be worried that maintaining the federal funds rate at its current low level, or raising it too slowly, will lead to excessive risk-taking in financial markets that could eventually endanger financial stability.
-  Responses to the Desk's latest surveys, like financial market quotes, indicate that market participants now see an approximately 90 percent probability that the Committee will raise the target range at this meeting.  However, the recent jump in the perceived probability of a rate hike at this meeting has not been accompanied by the expectation of a steeper path for the federal funds rate going forward. Consequently, signaling that the federal funds rate may rise more quickly, as done in this Alternative, could induce financial market participants to revise upward their policy path expectations, which in turn might trigger a drop in stock prices and inflation compensation as well as a strengthening of the dollar.

THE CASE FOR ALTERNATIVE A

Economic Conditions and Outlook

-  The incoming data suggest that the pace of improvement in the labor market moderated in recent months.  In particular, average job gains slowed relative to the summer months of last year, and the unemployment rate ticked up.  Even though the labor force participation rate is unchanged, on net, since 2013, measures of labor compensation have shown hardly any acceleration in recent years.
-  GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2016 is estimated to have increased at an annual rate of 2 percent, the same as in the January Tealbook.  However, real personal consumption expenditures declined in January.
-  Although total PCE price inflation has increased in recent months, the increase largely reflects rising consumer energy prices; core inflation has been essentially constant at 1.7 percent.  In addition, the projected divergence between domestic and foreign monetary policies could generate greater appreciation of the dollar than

assumed in the staff's baseline, holding down core inflation.  Furthermore, part of the recent rise in headline inflation might not be sustained because it reflects a transitory step-up in energy prices.

-  Survey measures of longer-run inflation expectations and readings on longer-term inflation compensation are still low by historical standards.  Policymakers may be concerned that if forecasts of a pickup in inflation prove too optimistic, longer-run inflation expectations could decrease.  If this were to occur now, after a lengthy period of underperformance on inflation, the Committee's reputation could suffer.

Policy Strategy

-  Policymakers might view information received since the February FOMC meeting as indicating not only that progress in the labor market has slowed but also that opportunities remain for further improvement in labor market outcomes, particularly for those marginally attached to the workforce.  In light of how long inflation has been running below 2 percent, they might elect to defer any additional increases in the federal funds rate until there is more evidence of sustained progress toward the Committee's inflation objective in order to maintain the credibility of the Committee's 2 percent inflation goal.
-  Policymakers might also judge that inflation dynamics in recent decades demonstrate that the Phillips curve is fairly flat, implying that greater resource utilization will have only a muted effect on inflation.
-  Policymakers might estimate that the neutral federal funds rate is currently well below its longer-run level, reflecting restraint on U.S. economic activity from economic and financial developments abroad, a sustained period of low productivity growth, or borrowing conditions that remain tight for some households and businesses.  Policymakers may see such headwinds as unlikely to subside in the near term.
-  Some policymakers might regard the prospects for, and composition of, fiscal stimulus as still highly uncertain.  They might therefore think that the optimism that recently has been built into asset prices is overdone and likely to be reversed, at least in part.
-  Market participants would be surprised by a decision to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate:  Responses to the Desk's latest surveys, like financial market

quotes, indicate that market participants now see an approximately 90 percent probability that the Committee will raise the target range at this meeting.  Going forward, market participants attach notably smaller probabilities to federal funds rate outcomes at or below 1 percent at the end of 2017.

- o Financial market participants would likely push further into the future the expected date of the next rate increase, the expected path for the federal funds rate would likely flatten, and longer-term yields would likely decline.
- o If the statement is primarily interpreted as signaling a more accommodative stance than anticipated, equity prices and inflation compensation would likely rise, and the dollar would depreciate.  Conversely, if investors read the statement as reflecting an unexpectedly downbeat assessment of the economic outlook, equity prices and inflation compensation could fall.

THE CASE FOR CONTINGENCY ALTERNATIVE B′

Economic Conditions and Outlook

-  The unemployment rate in January was at or near many participants' estimates of its longer-run normal level, and staff made no material changes to its near-term labor market forecast in reaction to the January employment report and other recent indicators.  Staff currently projects that total payroll employment will increase 182,000 in February, roughly in line with private sector forecasters.  These predictions are notably above the pace estimated to be consistent with the longer-run trend in labor force growth-between 75,000 and 125,000 per month.  However, if the employment report for February is significantly weaker than anticipated, the Committee might want to consider Alternative Bʹ.

Policy Strategy

-  Should the employment report turn out to be particularly disappointing, policymakers may be concerned that the combination of sharply slowing employment growth and a rising unemployment rate in recent months could signal that the economy is not evolving as expected.  Accordingly, the Committee might choose to leave unchanged the target range for the federal funds rate as well as its communications about the likely future path of that rate 'while assessing whether incoming information is consistent with the Committee's current economic outlook.'

-  Even if they anticipate that the appropriate path for the federal funds rate might be somewhat steeper or somewhat less steep than suggested by the December SEP, policymakers may still see the pace of likely rate increases as 'gradual' by historical standards.  If so, they may see paragraph 4 of Alternative Bʹ, as appropriately preserving the Committee's flexibility going forward.
-  Current pricing of federal funds futures and options suggests that financial market participants attach only a small probability to a decision to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate.  Of course, the perceived probability could increase substantially if the March 10 employment report turns out to be quite weak.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE

If the Committee decides to raise the target range for the federal funds rate, an implementation note that communicates the changes the Federal Reserve decided to make to its administered rates-the interest rates on required and excess reserves, the offering rate on overnight reverse repurchase agreements, and the primary credit rate-would be issued.  If the Committee decides to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate, an implementation note that indicates no change in these three policy tools would be issued.  Draft implementation notes that correspond to these two cases appear on the following pages; struck-out text indicates language deleted from the February directive and implementation note, bold red underlined text indicates added language, and blue underlined text indicates text that links to websites.

Projections

BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME

The staff has prepared two projections of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and key elements of the associated income statement.  The projections are distinguished by the assumed longer-run level of reserve balances.  Both projections are consistent with the interest rate paths incorporated in the staff's baseline economic outlook presented in Tealbook A. 1

-  In the 'March Tealbook baseline' scenario, the longer-run level of reserve balances is assumed to be $100 billion.   In this scenario the federal funds rate is projected to rise 2 to 4 percent by the end of 2021, before moving down to 3 percent by the end of the projection period.  Longer-term interest rates generally follow a similar pattern, reaching peak levels slightly earlier before declining somewhat throughout the remainder of the projection period.
-  In the '$500 billion reserves' scenario, the longer-run level of reserve balances is assumed to be $500 billion.  The interest rate paths associated with this scenario are very similar to those in the baseline scenario.

The key policy assumptions associated with the two projections are highlighted below.

-  Reinvestment policy: We continue to assume that the FOMC will cease reinvestments of principal repayments on securities in the System Open Market Account when the target range for the federal funds rate reaches 1¼ to 1½ percent. (See the accompanying box for a summary of when and how respondents to the Desk's surveys expect the Committee's reinvestment policy to change.)  As in the previous Tealbook, reinvestments cease in full at the end of the third quarter of 2017 under both scenarios.  Thereafter, the SOMA portfolio shrinks passively until reserve

Expectations for Changes to Reinvestment Policy

The Desk's latest Surveys of Primary Dealers and Market Participants indicate that respondents hold diffuse views, within certain ranges, of when the Committee will first announce a change in its reinvestment policy and of what the level of the federal funds rate will be at that time.

The March survey asked respondents to provide a point estimate and probability distribution for the level of the federal funds rate expected to prevail when the Committee first announces a change to its reinvestment policy. 1 The median point estimate was 1.625 percent, but, as shown in figure 1, respondents on average assigned only a 30 percent probability to the federal funds rate being between 1.51 and 1.75 percent when a change in reinvestment policy is announced. 2 The reported probabilities of the federal funds rate falling within any particular range varied considerably across respondents, except that nearly all respondents saw a 5 percent or lower probability of an announcement occurring before the federal funds rate exceeds 1 percent.

Figure 2 plots respondents' point estimates of the expected level of the federal funds rate at the time of a change in reinvestment policy, as reported in the March surveys, against their responses to the January surveys. 3 A majority of the dots in the scatter plot lie above the 45 degree line, indicating that most respondents now expect a -higher level of the federal funds rate to prevail when reinvestment policy is first

changed. When asked to explain the factors behind changes in their views, two factors commonly cited were an expected earlier start or faster pace of rate hikes in 2017, and recent Federal Reserve communications.

Figure 3 summarizes respondents' probability distributions for the timing of the first announcement of a change in reinvestment policy. Respondents on average assigned a 44 percent probability to an announcement occurring in the fourth quarter of 2017 or the first quarter of 2018, and the vast majority of respondents assigned a 5 percent or lower probability to a policy change announcement occurring before the third quarter of 2017. The reported probabilities of a policy change announcement occurring at any particular time, however, were diverse. Figure 4 plots respondents' expectations for the most likely timing of a policy change announcement derived from their responses to the March and January surveys. 4 While a majority of respondents revised earlier their modal expectations, the average expectation did not change significantly. 5

The Desk's surveys also asked for respondents' views on whether the Committee will cease reinvestments all at once, phase out reinvestments over time, or not change its reinvestment policy during the process of policy normalization. The median respondent attached roughly a 75 percent likelihood to the Committee phasing out reinvestments over time, little changed from recent surveys. The median expectation was that reinvestments of Treasury securities and MBS would each be phased out over 12 months, the same as in the December Primary Dealer Survey. 6

balances reach their assumed longer-run level of either $100 billion, in the baseline scenario, or $500 billion, in the alternative scenario.

-  Use of policy normalization tools: We continue to assume that take-up of overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRPs) runs at $100 billion until the level of reserve balances is closer to its longer-run level.  More specifically, in each scenario, once the level of reserve balances is within $500 billion of its assumed longer-run level, ON RRP take-up declines to zero over the course of one year. 3

Key features of the two scenarios are described below:

-  Balance sheet. Under the Tealbook baseline scenario, normalization of the size of the balance sheet occurs in the first quarter of 2022, the same quarter as in the $100 billion reserve scenario in the January Tealbook (see the exhibit titled 'Total Assets and Selected Balance Sheet Items' and the table that follows the exhibit).   At 4 the time reserve balances reach $100 billion, total assets are projected to stand at roughly $2.4 trillion, with about $2.3 trillion in total SOMA securities holdings composed of $1.1 trillion of Treasury securities and $1.2 trillion of MBS.  Total assets and SOMA Treasury holdings rise thereafter, keeping pace with the projected increases in Federal Reserve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.

Under the $500 billion reserves scenario, the size of the portfolio is normalized in the first quarter of 2021, four quarters earlier than projected in the baseline scenario (see the dotted red lines and the corresponding table that follows), reflecting the higher longer-run level of reserve balances and the resulting need to hold a commensurately larger securities portfolio.  At that time, total assets are projected to be about $2.8 trillion, with total SOMA securities holdings of $2.6 trillion.

-  Federal Reserve remittances. Under both the baseline and $500 billion reserves scenarios, remittances are projected to decline from $92 billion in 2016 to about $74 billion this year (see the 'Income Projections' exhibit).  The step-down reflects increased interest expense resulting from the December 2016 increase in the target range for the federal funds rate and the staff forecast of further increases in that target range over the course of this year.   Annual remittances are projected to continue to 5 decline in coming years, reaching a low of roughly $36 billion in 2020 under the baseline scenario, as the size of the SOMA portfolio falls and the target range for the federal funds rate increases further.  Subsequently, remittances gradually increase as higher-yielding Treasury securities are added to the SOMA portfolio.  The remittance paths are similar for both scenarios, though underlying interest income and expense differ after 2020.  No deferred asset is projected under either scenario. 6
-  Unrealized gains or losses. The staff estimates that the SOMA portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of about $82 billion at the end of February.   Going forward, 7 the net unrealized gain or loss position of the portfolio will depend primarily on the path of longer-term interest rates.  Because these rates are assumed to rise over the next several years in both scenarios, the portfolio is projected to shift to an unrealized loss position in the third quarter of 2017, the same timing as in the January Tealbook. The portfolio is expected to record a peak unrealized loss of $197 billion in 2019, about $68 billion of which is attributable to holdings of Treasury securities and $129 billion to holdings of agency MBS.  The unrealized loss position then narrows through the remainder of the projection period, as the value of securities previously acquired under the large-scale asset purchase programs (LSAPs) returns to par as those securities approach maturity and new securities are added to the portfolio at prevailing market yields.
-  Term premium effects. As shown in the table 'Projections for the 10-Year Treasury Term Premium Effect,' under the baseline scenario, the securities held in the SOMA

portfolio as a result of the Federal Reserve's LSAPs and reinvestments are estimated to be depressing the term premium embedded in the 10-year nominal Treasury yield by 87 basis points in the current quarter.  The evolution of the estimated term premium effect depends importantly on the expected path of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet over coming years relative to a benchmark counterfactual projection for the balance sheet that excludes the effects of asset purchases.  The term premium effect under the baseline scenario gradually fades over time, reflecting the convergence of the balance sheet to the path implied by the counterfactual projection.

Under the $500 billion reserves scenario, the estimated term premium effect is a bit more negative than under the baseline projection.  Relative to the baseline scenario, the Federal Reserve permanently holds a larger securities portfolio after the size of the balance sheet normalizes, which depresses the term premium embedded in longer-term Treasury securities.  The difference in the term premium effects between the two scenarios peaks at about 8 basis points around the time the balance sheet has normalized under the baseline scenario.

-  SOMA characteristics. Portfolio characteristics are roughly the same under both scenarios until the start of 2021, when the size of the balance sheet normalizes under the $500 billion reserves scenario.

Approximately $195 billion in SOMA Treasury holdings have already matured or will mature this year, and a total of nearly $1.3 trillion will mature between 2017 and 2020 (see the top panel of the exhibit, 'Projections for the Characteristics of SOMA Holdings').   The amount of Treasury securities maturing each month will vary 8 considerably over time, while projected MBS paydowns implied by the staff's prepayments model vary less.  Realized MBS paydowns will reflect the evolution of

interest rates and other factors, and thus could be significantly more volatile than projected. 9

The weighted-average duration of the SOMA Treasury portfolio is currently about 6¼ years (see the middle panel, 'SOMA Weighted-Average Treasury Duration'). The weighted-average duration is projected to decline slightly this year, as the securities in the portfolio approach maturity, and to rise subsequently until the size of the balance sheet is normalized. 10 After reaching its peak, duration is projected to again decline as the Desk restarts open market purchases of Treasury securities to keep pace with the increase in Federal Reserve notes in circulation and Federal Reserve Bank capital.  The duration contour in this latter portion of the projection is based on the assumption that the Federal Reserve will limit its purchases to Treasury bills until they account for one-third of the Treasury portfolio, similar to the pre-crisis composition of the portfolio (currently SOMA holds no Treasury bills).  Thereafter, purchases of Treasury securities are assumed to be spread across the maturity spectrum (see the bottom panel, 'Maturity Composition of SOMA Treasury Portfolio'). 11
