NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 21-22, 2011.

- 1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

You  may  also  include  below  any other  explanatory  com m ents  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent  1:

I  expect  the convergence process will be similar to that outlined in the long-run Tealbook projection.  That is,  it  will  likely to take  a decade  for the  large  unemployment  and output gaps to close  and PCEPI inflation to converge to its long-run target of 2 percent.

Given my projection of very slow unemployment decline, convergence of unemployment to its long run value could take more than 5-6 years.

Respondent  6:

By  2016,  the  unemployment  rate  is  about  1   percentage  point  above  the  assumed  NAIRU,  and  inflation remains below the  2  percent  target. Full  convergence  to  full  employment  and  a  2  percent  inflation  rate  is expected to take  6 to 7 years.

Respondent  9:

Respondent  10:

Our  current  estimate  of the  economy' s  potential  growth  rate  is  in  the  2%  to  2  ½ %   range. By 2015-16  we anticipate  potential  growth  of around  2  ¼   %. A reasonable  estimate  of the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is 4% to 6%.  Assuming appropriate policy and no further significant shocks, we expect the unemployment rate to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2016.

We assume that long-term inflation expectations will continue to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a CPI  basis and that  the  FOMC' s  inflation objective is  and  will  remain  at  about  2%  for  the  PCE deflator  and  around 2.5%  for the  CPI.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated to  be  near  zero,  we  expect inflation as measured by the  PCE deflator to be around 2%  in 2016.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Respondent  1:

This  is  a  close  call,  but  uncertainty  about  our  projection  for  economic  activity  appears  to  be  somewhat elevated relative to its  average over the past  20  years,  in part  because  of ongoing developments in Europe. Inflation,  however,  has been anchored by quite stable inflation expectations.

Respondent  2:

Volatility/uncertainty was unusually low over the past twenty years.

Respondent  3:

N/A

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

The US has not had a comparable recession/recovery in the postwar period.  Uncertainty about the factors restraining  recovery,  and  the  pace  at  which they will  recede,  remains  high;  reasonable  possibilities  include a  lost  decade  and  an  acceleration  of the  expansion  to  above-trend  rates. Uncertainty in  PCE  inflation  is driven by the unusual volatility in commodity prices,  which in turn is  affected by uncertainty about  global growth as well as supply conditions.  Uncertainty about the pace of recovery also affects projections of core PCE inflation; however,  with core inflation low and inflation expectations well anchored,  the uncertainty in this case is more comparable to the past  20 years.

While recent data releases point  to  a reduced near-term risk of a recession,  the  medium-term risks remain considerable.

Respondent  9:

While the incoming data has been somewhat  weaker than my June projection,  financial market  conditions continue to improve  and the  economic recovery will continue  to gain momentum.  However,  the possibility that the European debt crisis is not resolved in an orderly fashion is a concern.  It remains the case that the effect of the extraordinary monetary policy in place and uncertainties surrounding the future path of policy, including the timing of the exit  from accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

Quantitative judgment based on the difference between the central projection and the expected value from the FRBNY forecast distribution.

Respondent  11:

The potential failure to resolve the European crisis is  a major downside risk to the U.S.  economic outlook. Furthermore, many businesses appear to have made plans to promptly cut spending on labor and capital at the first  sign of a downturn in final  demand,  so there is  a downside risk that  some modest  but  unexpected weakness in household sector spending or in exports could be magnified into  a more meaningful reduction in U.S.  production.

Respondent  12:

The  current  highly  accommodative  stance  of monetary policy,  combined  with  long-term  fiscal  imbalances, poses an upside risk to inflation.

It  has  become harder  to rule  out  the  possibility that  the  cumulative  effect  of regulations  that  significantly raise business costs and reduce hiring and output,  and the uncertainty concerning the exact nature of future taxes and regulations will materially reduce growth over the medium term.  More specifically, my concern is we may not return to the historic trend,  but  that  the growth rate  will  remain stuck  around the  trend rate of growth and activity will track a new lower trend line,  regardless of the stance of monetary policy.

Appropriate  M onetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of the  appropriate  path  for  m onetary  policy  differ  m aterially from  that  assum ed  by  the  staff in  th e  Tealbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent  1: No

N/A

Respondent  2: Yes

I  anticipate that it will be appropriate to reduce accommodation earlier than is estimated by the Tealbook.

Respondent  3: No

N/A

Respondent  4: Yes

My path for monetary policy is more accommodative than that  assumed in the staff forecast.  I would hold the  funds rate in its current range until the last  quarter of 2014 and communicate an intention to raise the funds rate, once lift-off commences, more gradually than is assumed in the Tealbook baseline  (which follows the  outcome-based rule)  and  is  presumably now  incorporated  in  market  expectations. Therefore,  my path for  long-term  nominal  interest  rates  is  lower  than  in  Tealbook. In  addition,  inflation  in  my  forecast  runs below, but somewhat closer to my 2% target, than in Tealbook, so the path of real interest rates is also lower for  this  reason.

Respondent  5: No

N/A

Respondent  6: Yes

The target  federal funds rate is raised later than in the Tealbook.  With inflation running below target,  the first increase in the federal funds rate occurs when the unemployment rate declines to a level in the range of 7 to 7.5 percent.  Such a range is reached over the course of 2015.

The  baseline  forecast  is  conditioned  on  no  further  portfolio-related  policies  in  addition  to  the  ones  agreed upon at the September 2011 FOMC meeting.  Since the unemployment rate is expected to remain above the NAIRU and inflation below 2 percent  for more than 5 years,  there is  scope  for  additional  portfolio-related policies.  For these policies to materially affect the outlook, they would have to be of very sizable magnitude.

Respondent  7: Yes

I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  to  maintain  price  stability  we  will  have  to  increase  the current target range for the funds rate and allow the SOMA portfolio to run off sooner than assumed in the Tealbook.  In  the  interim,  depending  on  how  the  economy evolves,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  accelerate  or slow down the growth of the SOMA portfolio.

Respondent  8: No

N/A

Respondent  9: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the

appropriate monetary policy as one that begins raising the  funds rate  and/or shrinking the balance sooner than mid-2013.

Respondent  10: No

N/A

Respondent  11: Yes

We expect the period of exceptionally low policy rates will extend into 2015.  We also assume that the Com­ mittee will undertake some action to clarify the forward guidance currently in the statement.  Such forward guidance could be complemented by additional  asset purchases if, as we move through the  forecast period, progress towards the dual mandate objectives is slower than we project.

Respondent  12: Yes

Given the current slow growth of the economy,  I project right now that firming would not occur until 2015. However, if enhanced forward guidance or another commitment strategy were to be undertaken in early 2012 with the goal of achieving more proximity to longer terms objectives, then I could contemplate more robust growth and a lift-off as early as late 2014.

Respondent  13: Yes

In my view, the appropriate path for monetary policy would call for a lift-off of the federal funds rate target from its current range of 0 to 25 basis points to 50 basis points by the end of 2013.  In 2014,  the funds rate target would be increased gradually.

Respondent  14: No

N/A

Respondent  15: Yes

I  believe  that  in  order  to  achieve  an  inflation  rate  of  1.5  percent  we  would  want  to  begin  raising the  funds rate in September 2012.

Respondent  16: Yes

Our  ability to keep long-run inflation  expectations  well  anchored  and  the  recovery of the  real  economy on track depends more than usually on our ability to formulate and communicate a coherent strategy for fundsrate adjustments in the years beyond the Tealbook forecast horizon.  Since my long-term inflation objective is lower than the  2-percent Tealbook rate,  I believe it will be necessary to begin removing monetary-policy accommodation earlier than is assumed by Board staff,  and to pursue normalization more vigorously.  I  am very skeptical of the usefulness of additional purchases of Treasury securities and of ongoing changes to the maturity distribution of our Treasury portfolio.

Respondent  17: No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  econom ic  outlook and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent  1:

The  economic  recovery  appears  to  have  lost  considerable  momentum. However,  monetary  stimulus,  im­ provements in banking and financial market conditions, and further household de-leveraging should support a  moderate  expansion  over  the  next  few  years,  even  as  firms  and  households  adjust  to  higher  food  and gasoline prices and fiscal policy at all levels turns increasingly contractionary.  Still, it will take several years of robust growth to return the economy to full employment.  Inflation has been boosted by jumps in energy and commodity prices;  however,  significant  slack in labor  and goods markets will keep underlying inflation low. Well-anchored  inflation  expectations  should  help  avoid  significant  pass-through  of higher  inflation  to wages.

Respondent  2:

Growth will continue to be constrained by both demand and supply.  On the demand side, household spend­ ing will grow but only slowly,  as households continue to engage in balance sheet repair.  On the supply side, I  believe  that  the  changes  over  the  past  four  years  (to  the  financial  sector,  anticipated  taxes/regulations, and the nature of jobs at firms) have had a significant  and adverse impact on the  ability of the economy to exploit  its  available  resources.  For  that  reason,  I  believe  that  the  output  gap is  larger  (less  negative) than the Tealbook estimates it to be.

Both  demand  and  supply  forces  push  down  on  growth  and  up  on  unemployment. However,  they  oper­ ate in opposite directions on inflation.  On balance,  my forecast for core inflation has emphasized the supply effect,  which  gets  relatively  short  shrift  in  FRB/US  and  in  the  DSGE  models. However,  I  cannot  fully discount the effect of demand (which leads to my judgement that the risks to inflation are to the downside).

Respondent  3:

A confluence of forces will restrain the growth rate of the economy over the forecast horizon.  Deleveraging within  most  sectors  of the  domestic  economy  continue  to  play  out  and  are  likely  to  adversely  affect  the pace  of the  expansion  for  several  more  years. A slowing European  economy and shifts  in  the  growth  and composition of emerging economies is also likely to restrain demand for U.S. exports in the coming year and perhaps in  2013.  Weak  confidence  over jobs  and  the  economy are  likely to hold back the spending of U.S. households  and  the expansion plans of business over much of 2012.  Confidence in the economy will return only slowly as the expansion proceeds.

With  the  exception  of  food  and  some  energy  commodities,  cost  pressures  have  been  light  and  my  fore­ cast for inflation over the balance of 2011  and 2012 shows a significant deceleration in the headline measure. However,  I have assumed considerably less slack in the economy than conventional estimates would suggest and,  as  a result,  my inflation  forecast stays in the neighborhood of 2 percent over the  forecast horizon.

My assessment  of the  risk  to  the  growth  and  employment  outlook  is  weighted  to  the  downside. Notably, volatility in financial markets,  slow jobs growth,  and weak confidence make the economy vulnerable to any number of adverse shocks coming from Europe or elsewhere.

Regarding  inflation,  I  think  there  is  a  risk  that  the  influence  of  commodity  prices  and  other  pressures on  the  core  inflation  numbers  could  play  out  for  a  longer  time  than  I  have  assumed  and  that  inflationary sentiment could be adversely affected as a result.  At the same time,  there is a risk that the amount of slack is  actually greater than I have assumed.

Respondent  4:

U.S.  economic  growth  appears  to  have  strengthened  after  a  particularly  anemic  first  half. This  is  due,  in part,  to the reversal of the two largely transitory factors depressing growth during the first half of the yearsharp  increases  in  the  prices  of oil  and  other  commodities  and  the  shocks  that  struck  Japan,  disrupting global  supply  chains. These  same  shocks  boosted  inflation  during  the  first  half of the  year,  but  as  their influence has receded,  inflation has declined and should decline  further.  With an exceptionally high degree of slack in the labor market,  I expect inflation to decline  further below rates consistent with our dual man­ date. While  I  expect  the  pickup  in  growth  seen  during  the  third  quarter  to  persist  and  strengthen  over time,  the pace of the recovery will nevertheless be undesirably slow due to a range of other,  more persistent factors  that  are  restraining the recovery.  In particular,  the  pace of consumer spending seems  to be  weaker than can be  explained  by transitory  factors. It  is  apparently being  held  back  by slow  gains  in  wages  and income,  declines in the values of homes and financial  assets,  still elevated debt levels  and reduced access of households to credit.  Moreover,  consumer sentiment  dropped markedly over the summer  and has remained low  since  then,  reflecting  households'  concerns  and  uncertainty  about  their  future  income  prospects  and financial  situations. Weak  consumer  spending,  in  turn,  means  that  many  businesses  have  been  reluctant to  significantly expand  their  payrolls. Additional  drags  on  the  pace  of recovery  result  from  the  continued problems  afflicting residential  construction,  ongoing  pressures  on  state  and  local  government  budgets,  and the  likely  decline  in  fiscal  impetus  as  earlier  stimulus  policies  by  the  federal  government  wind  down. In addition,  I  now anticipate slower growth in the global economy,  particularly in Europe,  due to the financial stresses afflicting the financial sector,  which is likely to curtail credit growth,  and the substantial reductions in government spending and increases in taxes that some countries have had to put in place to address their fiscal problems.  Economic activity in many emerging market economies also looks to be moderating.  A final factor influencing my forecast is the tightening we have recently seen in financial markets reflected in higher volatility,  higher spreads,  lower equity prices,  and greater pressures on financial institutions.  The euro area appears to be making progress in addressing its sovereign debt and banking problems, so  'tail risk'  appears to have declined; but many details remain to be worked out and it is too soon to declare that the European financial situation has now been stabilized.

Respondent  5:

The economy has shown a bit of resilience in the second half, in part reflecting the reversal of the temporary factors (commodity prices, Japan) that slowed growth in the first half.  Final demand was surprisingly good in  Q3-both consumption and investment,  with a little  help from exports  as well.  Inventory declines bode well  for  the  near  term,  as  does  the  substantial  improvement  in  equity  and  credit  markets  associated  with the declining risk of recession  and the positive steps in Europe.  Still,  I  have marked down my growth pro­ jections going forward (and reduced slightly my estimate of potential growth).  In part this is an attempt to compensate for my persistent overprediction in past rounds,  i.e.,  it  appears that the structural and psycho­ logical headwinds are simply more powerful, and receding less quickly, than I had thought.  More specifically, I  worry  about  the  following: (1)  Europe' s  problems  are  not  solved  yet,  and  could  be  exacerbated  by  an economic  slowdown  there;  hence,  financial  stresses  are  likely  to  continue;  (2)  significant  fiscal  headwinds, together with political gridlock;  (3)  sentiment:  income has been growing only slowly and,  more importantly, income expectations are very depressed - businesses are also more downbeat;  (4) the housing and mortgage markets still  seem  far  from normal;  (5)  credit  conditions  remain  tight  for  consumers  and small  businesses; (6)  commodity  prices  remain  high  in  absolute  terms  (and  relative  to  2010). The  lack  of improvement  in unemployment is consistent with the slow pace of economic recovery;  as in the Tealbook, it seems reasonable to assume some reduction in measured unemployment if EEB is phased out, however.  I described above why these projections are more uncertain than usual;  the size of the recent revisions is testament to that.

Core  inflation  appears  to  be  receding  as  earlier  projected,  reflecting  the  decline  in  auto  prices  and  (more importantly)  the reduction in commodity cost pressures.  Wage gains remain very weak  (see the latest ECI reading),  slack is large,  and  both survey and market-based inflation expectations  are relatively low.  Hence I  have  core  inflation  falling  next  year  and  remaining slightly  below  target. Overall inflation  is  much  more uncertain,  given the difficulty of predicting commodity prices.

Respondent  6:

The economic recovery remains disappointingly slow.  The most recent data have allayed concerns about the economy slipping again into a recession, but uncertainty remains high and business and consumer confidence is low.  While unexpected adverse shocks have contributed to the slow recovery,  more persistent factors such as limited credit availability for some sectors of the economy, the residential and commercial real estate crisis, and fiscal retrenchment  at the state and local level,  have been exerting more restraint on the economy than previously thought.

We  continue  to  expect  an  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  growth  going  forward,  as  some  of  the  headwinds recede.  However,  the speed of the recovery remains sub-par by historical standards as federal fiscal policy is expected to turn  contractionary,  and  support  from monetary policy is  limited by the  presence  of the zerolower-bound.  In  all,  the  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  remain  above  7.5  percent  by the  end  of 2014. With considerable slack in the labor market,  wage and price inflation remain subdued over the course of the forecast horizon.

Risks  to  the  projection  for  real  activity  remain  skewed  to  the  downside. The  baseline  forecast  continues to be  predicated on European problems remaining contained and not  having a large impact  on the United States. While  some  progress  has  been  made  for  a  solution  to  the  fiscal  and  financial  stresses  in  the  euro area,  it  remains  to  be  seen  whether  a  framework  will  be  in  place  and  effective  should  a  tail  event  occur. Households also have a limited buffer stock of savings and remain especially vulnerable to adverse shocks.

The  potential  downside  risks  to  the  real  outlook  also  remain  costlier  than  the  potential  upside  risks,  as any worsening of the economy in the current situation would be aggravated by the limited scope for further fiscal  and monetary policy actions.

The  balance  of risks  to  inflation  is  skewed  to  the  downside. Several  inflation  models  would  predict  lower inflation than in our baseline outlook.  The projected path  for  inflation deviates  from these  models  by fac­ toring in an increased pass-through from commodities prices into core prices.

Respondent  7:

In  2011  through  2014  I  anticipate  that  real  growth will  occur  at  greater  than steady-state  rates,  reflecting normal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by the  substantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been  in  train  since  late 2008.  I  expect  that  beginning in  2013  real  growth  will  slow  and subsequently approach steady-state  rates. Real  growth  in  excess  of the  steady-state  rate  will  drive  down  the  unemployment  rate. I  expect  increases in  food  and  energy prices  to  keep  the  headline  rate  above  the  core  rate  through  2014. Under  appropriate monetary policy,  inflation should  approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent.  With available infor­ mation I expect that the core and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  8:

In  my  assessment,  the  recent  good  news  on  the  economy  points  to  some  improvement  in  the  near-term outlook:  a  slightly  stronger  pace  of growth  in  the  second  half of this  year  and  a  reduced  risk  of a  near­ term recession.  But  in the  absence of improvement in some key indicators of economic fundamentals (such as  personal  income),  I  don't judge  the  recent  good  news  as  signaling  a  stronger  pace  of growth  next  year and beyond.  For 2012-2014,  I  continue  to expect  the  economy to recover at  a slow pace.  The  slow pace of recovery reflects competing forces:  the economy's usual self-corrective forces and considerable monetary stim­ ulus versus various headwinds, including consumer de-leveraging and cutbacks in state and local government.

Similarly,  while  I  am  a  little  encouraged  by  September's  CPI  data,  it  provided  only  a  tentative  sign  of a  slowing in the  underlying price  trend. Trimmed mean measures of core inflation didn't  slow  as  much  as the CPI ex food and energy did, reflecting the influence of some unusual item-level price changes.  In light of these technical factors,  I don't believe the underlying trend in prices has changed.  With long-term inflation

expectations  stable  and  the  still-weak  labor  market  keeping  growth  in  labor  costs  subdued,  I  continue  to expect  core  inflation  of about  2  percent  for  2011-2014. As  pressures  from  energy  prices  continue  to  dissi­ pate, headline inflation should slow to about 2 percent in 2012 and remain around 2 percent in 2013 and 2014.

For  2012-2014,  I  continue  to see  the  outlook  for  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  as  highly uncertain. The key risk to growth (downside) and unemployment (upside) is a recession in Europe and the additional financial stress the recession would cause.  Consumer de-leveraging constitutes another key uncertainty:  the potential  for  yet  more  balance  sheet  adjustment  poses  another downside  risk  to growth  and  upside  risk to unemployment. While  I  don' t  think  that  significantly  faster  de-leveraging  is  the  most  likely  scenario,  it remains a risk.  For inflation, the weakness of the economy could create more disinflation than expected.  On the other hand,  I judge the surprise increases of earlier this year as pointing to the potential for surprise in­ creases over the medium term forecast horizon.  The potential for renewed volatility of commodity prices and extremely accommodative monetary policy are upside risks that further elevate the uncertainty surrounding the inflation outlook.

The  recent  economic  data  has  been  somewhat  weaker  than  what  I  expected  in  my  June  forecast. The persistence  of  negative  shocks  earlier  in  the  year  such  as  higher  oil  prices,  bad  weather,  sovereign  debt developments,  and  the  supply chain  disruptions  associated  with  the  Japan  disaster  has  been  greater  than I  anticipated. However,  I  expect  this  recent  weakness  is  now  waning  and  that  the  economy  is  poised  for moderately above-trend growth in 2012.

The  economy  has  a  bit  less  momentum  going  into  2012  than  I  anticipated  in  June,  but  as  the  recovery strengthens I expect a modest pace of 3.2 percent growth in 2012, down only slightly from my June forecast. For 2013 and 2014, I expect growth to run at a 3 percent pace, which remains slightly above my longer-term trend.  With  a moderate pace of growth over the  forecast horizon,  the  labor  market  recovery is gradual I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to move down to  about  6.8  percent  by the end of the  forecast horizon,  at which time it  remains  above  my estimate  of the  natural  rate  of unemployment.  I  anticipate  that  headline inflation will pull back to a 2.2 percent  pace in  2012  and then edge down  a bit  further in  2013  and 2014 in response to tighter monetary policy than that anticipated in the Tealbook.

In  my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk  that inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels  and  that  inflation  expectations  may  become  unan­ chored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time before mid-2013.

Respondent  10:

We have again lowered our growth projections from those of the last SEP. For 2011, we now expect real GDP growth to be under 2% compared to 3% in the June SEP.  While much of this reduction reflects the impact of past events,  including the downward revision of real GDP growth over 2011H1, we expect 2011H2 growth to be 2  ¾ %  (annual rate), well below the 4% growth we anticipated in June despite raising the forecast some over  the  past  month. We have  also  lowered  our  growth  forecast  for  2012  and  2013,  as  we  see  some  of the factors slowing growth this year as persisting into coming years.  Correspondingly, we now expect the unem­ ployment rate to average 9.0% in 2011Q4 rather than 8.4%, and to decline gradually over the forecast horizon.

The  pronounced  slowing  of growth  in  the  first  half of  2011  appears  to  have  been  due  in  part  to  a  num­ ber  of temporary  factors. Energy  and  other  commodity  prices  rose  sharply  over  the  six  to  seven  month period ending in  May of this year,  reducing consumers'   real  purchasing power:  real disposable income rose

at  an  annual  rate of just 0.9% in 2011H1.  Consumers responded to this loss of purchasing power through a combination of slower growth of real PCE and a reduction of the personal saving rate.

A second transitory factor  was  the  supply chain  disruptions  emanating  from  the  earthquake  and  tsunami that  occurred in  Japan in  March.  The effect  of these disruptions  has been  most  evident  in the  production and sales  of light  weight  motor vehicles, but  it  is  likely that  they  affected  other  sectors  of the  economy  as well.  Despite lean inventories, production of motor vehicles and parts as well as of computer and of electrical equipment declined in 2011Q2.  Sales of light weight  motor vehicles  also  fell during this period,  apparently because  prospective  buyers  decided  to  delay  purchases  until  inventories  and  prices  of popular  models  re­ turned to more normal levels.

The  advance  estimate  of 2011Q3  real  GDP  growth  indicates  that  these  temporary  factors  have  begun  to abate.  The rate of increase of energy prices slowed significantly over the third quarter,  greatly reducing the negative effect on real incomes and helping to support stronger growth of real PCE in the quarter.  Further­ more,  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers  grew  at  a  3.2%  annual  rate  in  2011Q3,  the  fastest  since  2010Q2, suggesting some momentum into 2011Q4.

Nevertheless,  the  US  confronts  significant  structural  problems  that  are  impeding  a  more  vigorous  recov­ ery.  In particular,  the legacy of the housing boom and bust continues to weigh on the economy.  Moreover, state and local governments are cutting back spending and reducing employment.  Finally, based on current law, federal fiscal policy is in the process of moving from providing significant stimulus to exerting substantial drag.

Despite  record  low  mortgage  interest  rates  and  quite  high  cash  flow  affordability,  housing  market  activ­ ity remains at quite depressed levels,  and thus is not providing the boost to economic activity.  The reasons for this are several, including a large inventory of homes, many of which are distressed, the continued pipeline of delinquencies  and foreclosures,  the large number of mortgages that  are  'underwater'  or close to it,  tight underwriting standards,  a weak labor market,  and general uncertainty about the future path of home prices. Furthermore, due to the loss of housing wealth stemming from the decline of home prices, consumer spending is more restrained than otherwise would be the case.

Both  employment  and  spending  by  the  state  and  local  government  sector  have  been  declining  for  some time,  and  the  rate  of decline  intensified  over  the  first  half of 2011. While  state  and  local  government  tax receipts  have recovered to their previous peak level,  grants in aid  from the  federal government  are now de­ clining.  Thus,  spending and employment at the state and local government level is likely to continue to fall over the near future.

At  the  federal  level,  fiscal  policy  is  evolving  from  being  highly  stimulative  in  2010  to  being  essentially neutral in mid-2011.  Based on current law,  in 2012 federal fiscal policy will begin exert a significant drag on growth.  The reduction of the employee's share of the OASDI payroll tax and the full expensing of qualified investment  in  equipment  and  software,  enacted  in  late  2010,  are  both  set  to  expire  at  the  end  of  2011. The recently enacted Budget  Control  Act of 2011  calls  for  a reduction of about  $25 billion of discretionary spending in  FY2012,  with  additional  deficit  reduction  measures  likely once  the  Congressional  Joint  Select Committee on Deficit Reduction releases its proposals later this year.

Finally,  the  events  in  the  Euro  area  and  elsewhere  indicate  weaker  global  growth  over  the  forecast  hori­ zon,  which would reduce the growth of US exports.  Given all of these factors,  projected growth of real GDP in  2012  and  2012  has  been  marked  down  to  2  ¾ %   (Q4/Q4)  and  3  ½   %   from  3.7%  and  4.5%,  respectively. With this lower growth trajectory,  the unemployment rate in is expected to average 8.7%  (versus 7.5%)  in 2012Q4 and 7.8%  (versus 6.5%)  in 2013Q4.

Both  total  and  core  PCE  deflator  inflation  have  been  somewhat  higher  than  anticipated,  such  that  total inflation is now expected to be 2.9%  (Q4/Q4)  in 2011  rather than 2.5%  and core inflation is expected to be 1.8% rather than 1.6%.  The bulk of the increase in headline inflation has been due to the direct effect of the run up of energy and other commodity prices,  the impulse behind which was external to the US.

Nonetheless,  core  inflation  also  moved  up  more  than  expected,  with  the  12-month  change  of the  ex  food and energy PCE deflator up 1.6% in October from below 1% at the end of 2010.  From an accounting sense, the bulk of that increase of core inflation is due to some faster increases in rents,  followed by unusually rapid gains  in  prices  for  apparel  and  new  vehicles. We suspect  that  as  rents  firm,  more  of the  quite  substantial stock of vacant housing will move into rental usage,  helping to limit  further rent increases.  The more rapid increase  of  apparel  prices  reflect  the  steep  increases  in  cotton  and  other  fiber  prices  over  the  past  year. Similarly,  the  unusually large increase  in new vehicle  prices  of the  past  six months or so appears to be  the result of the supply disruptions discussed earlier.

Fortunately,  energy  and  many  other  commodity  prices  have  declined  from  their  peak  levels. Motor  ve­ hicle  production  is  returning  to  more  normal  levels,  which  will  boost  inventories  over  the  coming  months. Thus,  barring  another  energy  price  shock,  it  appears  that  headline  and  core  inflation  measures  are  at  or near  their  peaks. Fundamentals remain consistent  with  a slowing in inflation.  Even if we  assume  that  the natural  rate  of unemployment  has  increased  somewhat,  the  economy  is  operating  with  substantial  slack. Profit  margins are wide,  allowing for greater price competition going forward,  which should help hold down overall inflation.  Moreover,  inflation expectations remain well anchored.  Accordingly, we expect inflation to slow to  1.4%  (Q4/Q4)  in 2012 before moving gradually higher to around the 2%  objective in 2014.

The  uncertainty  around  our  outlook  remains  sizable  and  the  balance  of  risks  to  both  real  activity  and inflation are to the downside.  The uncertainty engendered by the intensification of the European crisis  and reaction  of financial  markets  to  that  crisis  indicate  that  the  US  and  global  economies  as  well  as  financial conditions remain quite  fragile and susceptible to shocks,  indicating considerable downside risks to the real activity  outlook. In  addition,  there  is  considerable  risk  that  fiscal  consolidation  at  the  federal,  state,  and local levels-however necessary for the longer run-could occur too quickly given the fragile state of the econ­ omy. With  evidence  that  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored,  the  downside  real  risks  combined  with the  current  large  amount  of slack,  indicate  that  the  risks  to  the  medium-term  inflation  outlook  are  now somewhat to the downside.

Respondent  11:

Household  balance  sheet  repair  is  continuing  to  restrain  consumer  spending;  this  process  likely  has  been compounded as the failure of labor market conditions to improve noticeably and further concerns over future income and wealth prospects have increased the demand for precautionary balances.  Businesses see this lack of demand, making them hesitant to expand workforce and physical capacity.  These factors have resulted in liquidity trap conditions in which the zero lower bound prevents real interest rates falling enough to equate the supply of saving with the demand for investment.

Eventually, in the absence of major shocks and with the support of accommodative monetary policy, balance sheet  repair  will  reach  the  stage  that  household  sector  expenditures  will  gain  momentum  and  generate  an associated  lift  off in  business  spending. However,  the  fragility  of household  and  business  confidence  could slow this process relative to other economic fundamentals.

Even accounting for some slower growth in potential output over the recession and early stages of recovery, our forecast implies substantial resource slack even beyond 2014.  This slack is expected to exert  downward pressure  on  prices  throughout  the  projection  period. However,  accommodative  monetary  policy  provides an important  offsetting support  to inflation expectations.  A  critical element of this policy is  clear  forward

guidance with regard to the setting of the federal funds rate.

Respondent  12:

Growth in the economy,  while better  in  this  second  half of 2011  than earlier  in  the  year,  remains  modest. Supply  chain  slow-downs  from  Japan  have  eased,  but  demand  remains  hampered  by  the  housing  market which remains characterized by low equity values,  poor  servicing,  supply overhang  and  deteriorating qual­ ity. People have been  out  of the  labor market  for  longer  periods  of time.  The growth  of consumption  and aggregate  demand  are  further  depressed  by not  just  continued  unemployment  but  low  home  equity values and low levels of consumer confidence.

Respondent  13:

I continue to expect  a modest  economic recovery over the next several years,  with only a gradual improve­ ment in unemployment.  The temporary factors that damped growth in the first half of 2011-including rising energy prices and the supply disruptions associated with the Japanese earthquake and tsunami-have largely abated.  However, growth is still expected to remain subdued.  Financial headwinds, deleveraging, an anemic housing  market,  and  reduced  government  spending  will  hold  back  growth. In  contrast,  pent-up  demand, exports,  and  an  accommodative  monetary policy will  support  economic  growth. Considerable  uncertainty surrounds the outlook due to the European sovereign debt crisis and fiscal consolidation in the United States. But  the  outlook  for  inflation  has  improved. Inflation  has  begun  to  show  signs  of receding  and  should  fall below  2  percent  next  year. Nevertheless,  there  is  a  risk  of higher  inflation  if our  accommodative  mone­ tary policy stance  and  long-run  fiscal  imbalances  lead  to  an  upturn  in  inflation  expectations. In  addition, maintaining the current extraordinary level of monetary policy accommodation could generate financial im­ balances which could eventually destabilize the economy.

Respondent  14:

N/A

Respondent  15:

Real growth is gradually gaining momentum.  Consumer spending is firming, although sentiment is depressed. Business investment and exports are fairly robust.  Multifamily housing construction is expanding,  although single  family construction  is  depressed. Government consumption  and investment  are  gradually declining. Inflation has been high this year,  and energy prices remain elevated.

Respondent  16:

We continue to suffer from overhangs of housing and debt.  The sharp deterioration in the fiscal outlook that has  occurred  as  a result  of the  recession  means  that  fiscal  policy has  become  a drag  on  growth. The poor fiscal  outlook  has  also  increased  concerns  about  future  taxes. Consumers  are discouraged and  fatigued by the  slow  and  uneven  pace  of the  recovery,  and  have  been  squeezed  by  high  energy prices. Banks  are  also being squeezed-by the low,  flat yield curve-and some indicators suggest increased financial-system strains. Businesses,  however,  are generally flush with liquidity.  Yet,  despite rising labor costs overseas,  firms remain more interested in  foreign  than in  domestic  expansion.  The  potential  for job-creating  investment  and  eco­ nomic expansion within the U.S.  is stymied by uncertainty over fiscal policy and concerns about regulatory excess.  European sovereign debt  concerns  have  eased,  for now,  but  underlying structural  problems  remain unresolved.  Emerging markets may be shifting to a slightly slower growth gearing.  For all of these reasons, growth in coming quarters is likely to be subdued.

Respondent  17:

It appears as though the economy continues to be stuck in a quite slow-moving recovery, successfully warding off recessionary risks but not  showing any signs of achieving the kind of momentum that would lead to the kind  of sustained,  significantly  above-trend  growth  that  would  reduce  the  output  gap  appreciably  within

quarters,  rather than years.  It is hard to see where such momentum would come from,  at least until house­ hold debt,  most importantly including mortgage debt,  is substantially reduced.  There seems little prospect of that happening.

Major  downside  risks  continue  to  be  largely  external,  in  that  they  are  being  generated  either  abroad  or through  the  domestic  political  process. If Eurozone  leaders  do  not  follow  their  framework  announcement with credible details,  the market relief could reverse quickly, leading once again to a deterioration of financial conditions  and,  quite  possibly,  real  economy  performance  as  well. It' s  still  a  little  hard  to  see  significant upside  risks. At  some  point,  of course,  enough  debt  will  have  been  worked  off  and  enough  slimming  of employment  levels  completed  that  the  conditions  for  an  acceleration  in  the  economy  will  be  present.. At this juncture,  though,  a  'semi-lost'   decade seems as likely as the quickening of growth contemplated in the preceding sentence.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(c).  Please  describe  any  im portant  differences  betw een  your  current  econom ic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent  1:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection,  but  with weaker GDP growth in 2013  and  2014, as I  have grown more pessimistic about recent  and future potential output growth.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

My growth forecast is very similar to the Tealbook baseline through 2013, but is about  ½   a percentage point lower  than  the  Tealbook  in  2014. My projection  for  inflation  runs  about  ½   a  percentage  point  above  the Tealbook over the forecast horizon.

Respondent  4:

I  forecast  a  more  rapid  pickup  in  growth,  particularly in  2013  and  2014,  due  to  the  more  accommodative monetary policy I  have  assumed.  In addition,  my inflation  forecast  is  a bit  higher-closer to my 2%  targetthan  Tealbook as unemployment declines more rapidly than in the  Tealbook baseline.  Were it  not  for the difference  in  assumption concerning monetary policy,  my forecast would coincide closely with that  in  Teal­ book.

Respondent  5:

Continue to be more pessimistic than the TB about growth going forward.  Since June have seen considerable financial turmoil (Europe, debt ceiling), more fiscal gridlock, a substantial worsening in sentiment, continued very weak conditions in housing and mortgage markets, weak job numbers (with implications for the number of long-term unemployed and their skills and labor force attachment), renewed signs of slowdown in Europe, Japan, and EMEs.  Growth slowed between 2010 and 2011, so there is not much on which to base a projection of an accelerating recovery.

Respondent  6:

Both the outlook for real activity and the outlook for inflation are similar to the  Tealbook forecast.

Respondent  7:

Compared to the Tealbook forecasts, most differences between the point estimates in the Tealbook baseline forecast  and my projections  are minor.  However,  I  see  higher headline  inflation in the intermediate  period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent with appropriate monetary policy.

Respondent  8:

The key difference is  in the inflation outlook.  I  don' t  expect  core inflation to decline  as much  as  it  does  in the Tealbook forecast,  because I don't expect the weak recovery and decelerating commodity prices to have as much influence on inflation as they do in the Tealbook.

Respondent  9:

My forecast calls for  a tighter monetary policy path than the  Tealbook.

Respondent  10:

We continue to assume lower inflation persistence than does the Tealbook.  Given changes in both our forecast and the Tealbook forecast, this differing assumption has little impact for the 2011-13 forecasts.  However,  at the 2014 horizon and beyond, under the assumption of well anchored inflation expectations,  we project that core  and overall inflation will move more quickly toward the  2%  objective than does the Tealbook forecast.

We have a somewhat lower path for the personal saving rate than the Tealbook despite similar consumption paths.  Apparently this reflects a somewhat lower path of disposable income in our forecast as we expect the profit share to remain higher than in the Tealbook.

Based  on  our  assumptions  of modest  increases  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  average  weekly hours, we  expect  a somewhat  greater decline in the unemployment  rate than is  projected in the  Tealbook, particularly in 2013 and 2014.

Respondent  11:

Our projections for real economic activity are similar to the Tealbook's.  However, as noted above, we assume that  appropriate  policy keeps  rates  lower  for  longer  and  provides  more  explicit  forward  guidance  than  the Tealbook's policy assumption.  This additional accommodation contributes to our inflation projection being a touch higher than in the  Tealbook.

Respondent  12:

N/A

Respondent  13:

The key difference is the monetary policy path.  With a higher projection for inflation than Tealbook and the potential  for  a buildup of financial imbalances, I believe  an earlier move toward less  accommodative policy is  appropriate. With  a  less  accommodative  policy stance,  I  project  somewhat  slower  growth  in  2014  than Tealbook.

Respondent  14:

N/A

Respondent  15:

I  do  not  see  the  decline  in  energy  prices  in  the  current  quarter  that  the  Tealbook  projects. I  also  do  not expect core inflation to decline materially from its pace this year.

Respondent  16:

The Tealbook GDP and unemployment forecasts are not unreasonable,  but I anticipate a somewhat higher trajectory for inflation.  Given my inflation forecast  and my relatively stringent inflation objective,  I believe that policy stimulus will need to be withdrawn more rapidly than is assumed in the  Tealbook.

Respondent  17:

As usual,  I continue to be less confident that oil prices will remain subdued over the forecast period.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since  the previous  quarter's  projections.

Respondent  1:

The  data  on  growth  since  June  have  generally  surprised  on  the  downside,  and  we  have  revised  down  real GDP growth by almost  a percentage point  in  2011,  2012,  and  2013.  Besides  weak  near-term indicators  of real economic activity,  the July 2011  annual NIPA revision lowered that past few years of labor productivity growth.  It now appears that the mid-1990s acceleration in labor productivity has ended.  Coupled with weak business investment and labor market problems, it seems likely that potential output has grown more slowly recently.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

I have revised my 2011 growth forecast lower in light of the softer incoming data between July and September. I have also built in a somewhat weaker growth trajectory in 2012 and 2013 owing in part to the deterioration in the European economy and the increased likelihood of fiscal drag domestically.

Respondent  4:

I  have revised down my estimate of real GDP growth for the next several years and revised up my estimate of the  unemployment rate due to weak incoming data and an assessment  that the headwinds  to growth in output and recovery of the labor market are even more serious than I anticipated in June.  As a partial offset, I  have  assumed a more accommodative stance for monetary policy over the forecast horizon

Respondent  5:

See above.

Respondent  6:

Spending data have been considerably below expectations.  Deterioration in the labor market,  lower house­ holds' net worth, continued spending cuts at the state and local level, and no meaningful improvement in the housing sectors are all factors contributing to the downward revision to the near- and medium-term outlook for the real economy.  Increased uncertainty and low business and consumer sentiment also affect the outlook negatively.

Respondent  7:

My forecasts  for  near-term  real  growth  have  been  revised  downward  reflecting  slower  growth  to  date  this year than I  had previously expected.  My forecast  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  has been revised  up to reflect the weaker than expected growth this year.  My view of real GDP growth in 2012 has also been revised down,  with unemployment revised accordingly.  In light of the data revisions in late July and my view that some of the growth prior to the financial crisis and Great Recession was due to a bubble,  I have also revised downward my expectation of long-run GDP growth.  My projections of inflation are changed only slightly.

Respondent  8:

Since the June submission, I revised my forecast to reflect sharp revisions to the NIPA accounts that revealed a significantly slower pace of recovery in the first half of 2011 and incoming data that pointed to a slower pace of recovery in the second half of 2011  and a higher underlying price trend.  Compared to the June forecast of

GDP growth, my new projection shows a significantly slower pace of recovery in 2011  and a modestly slower pace  in  2012  and  2013. For inflation,  I  continue  to expect  prices  to rise  at  an  underlying  trend  of about  2 percent.  I continue to expect that dissipating pressures  from energy prices will slow headline inflation from about 2  1/2 percent this year to about the rate of core inflation next year.

Respondent  9:

Recent weaker-than-expected data have led me to revise down my near-term projection.

Respondent  10:

As noted earlier, the data generally have been weaker than expected since the June SEP. Although the latest spending data have been somewhat better, consumer confidence indicators and business survey data remain quite  weak. Furthermore,  the  subdued  growth  seen  so  far  in  2011  suggest  that,  although  the  transitory factors  discussed  earlier  were  a  factor,  more  structural  factors  probably  also  were  holding  down  growth, which  suggests  that  real  growth  could  continue  to  be  subdued  in  the  coming  quarters. In  addition,  the weaker  outlook  for  the  Euro  area  and  the  tightening  in  some  indicators  of financial  conditions  indicate  a more  subdued  outlook  for  real  activity. Because  of these  factors,  our  projected  real  GDP  growth  path  is lower throughout this period.

The  unemployment  rate  was  little  changed  since  the  June  SEP.  Other  labor  market  indicators  also  have not  improved  much during this  period.  Combined with our relatively subdued outlook  for real growth,  we have raised our projected path for the unemployment rate throughout the forecast horizon.

Because  the  inflation  data  have  run  somewhat  above  our  expectations,  we  have  raised  our  near-term  in­ flation forecasts.  However, given the large amount of resource slack and our forecast that it will shrink more slowly  than  previously  expected,  we  now  anticipate  that  it  will  take  longer  for  core  inflation  to  reach  the objective.  Accordingly,  our forecasts of inflation in 2012  and 2013 are below those in the June  SEP.

In regard to our risk assessment for real economic activity, the European sovereign debt crisis has intensified (despite  the  agreement  on  October  26)  and  there  is  a  higher  probability  of  a  greater  fiscal  consolidation (especially with the agreement following the debt ceiling crisis).  Furthermore,  the financial market reaction during the period since June indicates continued fragility of financial conditions,  which suggests some more downside risks to the real outlook over the medium term.  Consequently, our risk assessment for real activity is more skewed to the downside than it was in June,  reflecting an increase in downside risks.

For  the  inflation  risk  assessment,  the  decline  in  the  5-10  year  TIPS-implied  inflation  compensation  since June suggests a smaller probability that inflation expectations are becoming unmoored to the upside.  More­ over,  the  greater  downside  real  risks  combined  with  continued  significant  resource  slack  indicates  greater downside risks.  Therefore,  the inflation risks have shifted from a rough balance to a downside skew,  partic­ ularly at medium term horizons,  reflecting both lower upside risks and greater downside risks.

Respondent  11:

The incoming data indicate that the softness in some of the monthly indicators we were seeing at the time of our last  forecast  submission were  symptoms of a more general economic sluggishness rather  than a tempo­ rary soft patch due to the Japanese disaster and other transitory factors.  The weak 2011:H1 growth evident following the  annual revisions to the  NIPA were  an important  factor in changing this judgement.  We  have marked down our projection of growth throughout the projection period accordingly.  In addition, household and business caution has intensified with the heightened uncertainty and financial market  volatility associ­ ated with events in Europe and the U.S. debt ceiling showdown.

Respondent  12:

N/A

Respondent  13:

Because this is my first  submission of economic  projections,  my comparison will be  relative  to my forecast at  the  time  of the  last  FOMC  meeting. My outlook  for  2011  as  a  whole  has  improved  based  on  stronger reported GDP growth in the third quarter.  My longer-term outlook is little changed from a month ago.

Respondent  14:

N/A

Respondent  15:

The data flow on overall activity weakened considerably over the summer, but has improved in recent weeks. Inflation  has risen this year,  and with the  (Brent)  crude oil price still  fairly high,  it  is difficult  to see much disinflation ahead with policy settings unchanged.

Respondent  16:

Second-half growth  appears to be rebounding less strongly than I  had anticipated,  and the growth outlook generally has deteriorated, somewhat.  Uncertainty over fiscal policy is significantly retarding business confi­ dence.  In consequence,  I've made upward revisions to the forecasted path of unemployment  and downward revisions to the forecasted path of inflation.

Respondent  17:

Obviously the much-worse than expected performance in the months around the last set of projections,  but also the accumulating evidence that the momentum referred to in the preceding answer is not on the horizon (at  least  not  yet)
