Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  December  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  13-14,  2016. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  December  13-14,  2016,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  March  14-15,  2017,  meeting.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real GDP from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in Table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric, except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation is not intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in Table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if it has been truncated at zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  or  exceeded  by  2018.  However,  it  will  take  a  couple  more years  to  achieve  complete  convergence  to  our  longer-run  projections. The  effects  from  accommodative  fiscal  and monetary  policy  will  generate  some  overshooting  of  both  inflation  and  unemployment  before  dissipating  over  the longer  run.

Respondent 3: We  believe  convergence  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  its  long-run  level  is  likely  to  take  about  2 1

/ 2 years.

Respondent 4: The  economy  has  in  my  view  essentially  converged  to  its  longer-run  path.  My  projection  for real  GDP  growth  in  2017  is  near  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  the  unemployment  rate  has  moved  slightly below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  and  inflation  is  near  2  percent.  Barring  shocks,  I  anticipate  that  real  GDP growth  will  remain  close  to  its  longer-run  rate  over  the  next  three  years.  The  unemployment  rate  will  likely  decline somewhat  further  below  its  longer-run  rate  before  moving  back  toward  it.  I  expect  inflation  will  stabilize  around 2  percent  over  the  next  three  years.

Respondent 5: In  the  absence  of  shocks,  as  we  are  asked  to  assume,  12-month  inflation  should  converge  to 2.0%  and  unemployment  should  return  to  5.0%  within  a  year  or  two.  Real  GDP  growth  is  basically  at  1.8%  now.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Our  assumptions  for  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment are  the  same  as  in  the  December  submission.

The  current  unemployment  rate  is  slightly  below  its  longer-run  normal  level,  and  we  project  that  it  will  remain below  that  level  through  the  projection  horizon. Our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate  that  there  is  significant  probability  that  the  unemployment rate  will  fall  somewhat  further  below  its  longer-run  normal  level.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC  longerrun  objective.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  a  modest  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  normal  unemployment rate  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  mildly  above  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective  in  2018-19,  before  returning  to  that  level  afterwards.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Even  though  the  labor  market  is  more  or  less  back  to  normal  and  the  underlying  trend  in inflation  is  running  only  somewhat  below  2  percent,  the  convergence  process  is  likely  to  be  drawn  out  because  I anticipate  that  various  factors  currently  restraining  activity,  such  as  slow  productivity  growth  and  weak  global activity,  are  likely  to  diminish  somewhat  over  time.  As  a  result,  it  will  probably  be  five  or  six  years  before  real  GDP, unemployment,  inflation,  and  interest  rates  all  settled  down  at  their  longer-run  values.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  five  years.

Respondent 12: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of 2.0%,  an  unemployment  rate  of  4.7%,  and  inflation  of  2.0%. Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes, we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment. Calculating  an  average  for these  variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  ins  potentially  misleading.  We  do  provide  a  2.0%  longer-run  inflation projection,  which  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 13: Labor-force  participation  is  near  its  demographic  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  is roughly  at  its  longer-run  sustainable  level. With  negligible  labor-market  slack  and  with  the  restraining  effects  of oil-pricedeclinesandastrongerdollarhavingwaned,inflationisnowclosetoour2-percentlonger-runobjective.  So, we  have  very  nearly  achieved  our  dual  objectives.  But  with  monetary  policy  still  accommodative  and  expansionary fiscal  policy  in  prospect,  we  seem  likely  to  overshoot  both  full  employment  and  2-percent  inflation  in  coming  years-possibly  by  a  significant  margin. In  those  circumstances,  a  soft  landing  will  be  difficult  to  engineer. If we  are successful,  convergence  will  likely  take  5  years.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Current  economic  conditions  are  consistent  with  a  level  of  activity  that  is  very  close  to  (if not  at)  full  capacity.  Over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  projected  pace  of  growth  should  lead  to  an  economy  operating above  full  employment,  albeit  by  a  relatively  modest  amount. Despite  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  its longer-run  level,  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  close  to  the  2  percent  target  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  as further  dollar  appreciation  provides  some  o ffset  to  the  wage  pressures  associated  with  a  tightening  labor  market.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  three  to  four  years.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 3: The  size  and  timing  of  new  fiscal, trade, immigration,  and  regulatory  policies,  and  their corresponding  impact  on  household  and  business  spending,  remains  unresolved  and  highly  uncertain.  In  contrast, volatility  in  financial  markets  is  low  and  concerns  over  foreign  economic  growth  appear  to  have  diminished.  While the  incoming  news  on  inflation  has  been  positive,  the  uncertainties  surrounding  the  forecast  have  not  changed substantially. On  balance,  the  level  of  uncertainty  for  both  activity  and  inflation  remain  in  the'broadly  similar' uncertainty  bucket.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Fiscal, trade,  regulatory,  and  other  economic  policy  choices  are  likely  to  change  over  the forecast  period. At  this  time  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  size,  timing,  and  composition  of  the  policy  changes  that will  occur.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Ours  is  a quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are slightly  narrower  than  in  our  December  SEP  submission,  reflecting  that  the  economic  data  have  been  roughly consistent  with  our  central  projection. However,  continued  lack  of  clarity  concerning  potential  policy  changes imply  that  uncertainty  remains  high. Consequently,  the  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  and  core  PCE inflation  forecasts  remain  moderately  wider  than  the  SEP  standard  (for  inflation,  this  assessment  takes  into  rough account  of  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation).

Respondent 8: While  substantial  uncertainty  remains  as  to  the  direction  of  various  non-monetary  policies with  economic  implications,  the  interval  since  the  last  SEP  has  made  the  likelihood  and  scope  of  at  least  some  of those  possible  changes  rather  less  than  they  appeared  three  months  ago.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 11: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened  uncertainty  about  the  course  of  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  trade  policy. The  impact  on  inflation uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Uncertainty  is  roughly  average  over  the  next  three  years. Because  of  possible  fallout  from overshoot  of  our  full-employment  and  inflation  objectives,  uncertainty  beyond  2019  is,  in  contrast,  elevated.  Risks at  that  point  will  be  weighted  to  the  downside  for  GDP  growth  and  to  the  upside  for  unemployment.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: My  judgment  that  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projections  is  higher  than'normal'owes largely  to  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal,  trade,  and  regulatory  policy.

Respondent 17: N/A

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: Near-term  downside  risks  from  the  global  environment  have  diminished. Recent  indicators of  growth  in  China,  Europe,  and  Japan  have  been  favorable,  on  balance,  while  confidence  in  the  near  term  ability of  policy  to  support  growth  in  these  regions  (and  exchange  rate  and  financial  market  stability  in  the  case  of  China) has  increased.  In  the  U.S.,  continued  improvement  in  the  labor  market  and  inflation,  as  well  as  the  outlook  for  more expansionary  fiscal  policy  and  the  higher  funds  rate  path  it  implies,  have  reduced  to  some  extent  the  likelihood  that monetary  policy  will  be  constrained  by  the  effective  lower  bound  for  conventional  policy  over  the  medium  term. At  the  same  time,  recent  increases  in  equity  prices  and  household  and  business  sentiment,  along  with  possibility  of substantially  stronger  U.S.  fiscal  stimulus  than  in  my  baseline  projection,  have  increased  the  upside  risks  to  real activity  and  inflation.  As  a  result  the  risks  to  real  activity  and  inflation  are  balanced.

Respondent 2: Riskstoeconomicactivityappearbroadlybalanced.  Wehaveessentiallyreachedourobjective of  maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  likely  overshoot  full employment  for  the  next  couple  of  years.  The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long.  Despite  some  Q1 softness,  consumer  spending  is  on  track  for  solid  growth  this  year,  bolstered  by  a  stronger  labor  market  and  sizable equity  wealth  gains.

Fiscal  policy  is  likely  to  be  more  accommodative  in  2018  and  2019. However,  there  is  significant  uncertainty about  the  size,  composition,  timing,  and  effect  of  future  fiscal  policy  initiatives.

Uncertainty  about  growth  in  foreign  economies  appears  to  have  subsided  somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  some risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  remain.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced. A  tightening  of  resource  utilization  supports  the  continued  movement  of inflation  towards  2  percent  and  a  slight  overshooting  some  time  afterwards. In recent  months,  the  dollar  has maintained  its  strength,  which  will  hold  down  import  prices  in  the  near  term. On  the  other  hand,  oil  prices  have increased  somewhat  and,  if  sustained,  could  lead  to  higher  inflation.  The  size,  scope,  and  impact  of  expected  fiscal policy  measures  are  a  contributing  factor  to  inflation  risk.

Respondent 3: Our  forecast  assumes  a  modest  pick  up  in  growth  arising  from  fiscal  policy,  but  these  and  other potential  legislative  or  administrative  policy  changes  remain  speculative.  In  particular,  we  see  some  risk  that  the tax  and  spending  package  could  be  somewhat  larger  than  we  currently  assume,  but  with  some  o ffsetting  downside risk  from  potential  trade  and  immigration  policies.

We  now  see  the  risk  to  our  inflation  forecast  as  balanced. In  December,  we  assumed  inflation  risks  were  still modestly  tilted  to  the  downside.  Since  then,  some  stronger  inflation  numbers,  as  well  as  a  flattening  in  the  dollar, higher  commodity  prices,  and  a  small  uptick  in  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations  led  us  to  revise  our risk  assessment. Still,  we  remain  concerned  about  the  low  levels  of  financial  market  inflation  compensation  and household  measures  of  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: There  are  a  number  of  possible  policy  changes  that  could  have  beneficial  or  adverse  effects  on GDP  and  unemployment.  While  the  risks  are  tilted  toward  expansionary  fiscal  stimulus,  appropriate  monetary policywillbeo ffsetting and prevent morethanminordeviationsinrealgrowth. Oninflation, undertheappropriate policy  assumption,  we  will  react  quickly  and  forcefully  enough  to  keep  it  near  2  percent.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution.  With  little  resolution  concerning  U.S.  fiscal  and  trade policy  changes,  risks  remain  elevated  on  both  sides  of  the  real  activity  outlook.  Overall,  as  in  December,  they  are roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  remain  roughly  balanced  throughout  the  forecast  horizon.  Longer-run  inflation  compensation and  the  Michigan  long-run  survey  inflation  expectations  have  been  stable  at  still-low  levels,  consistent  with  continued  downside  risks. By  contrast,  global  disinflationary  forces  appear  to  have  abated  somewhat  and  our  SCE 3-year  inflation  expectations  have  moved  up,  as  have  a  number  of  measures  of  underlying  inflation,  pointing  to upside  risks  that  are  somewhat  greater  than  they  have  been  in  recent  years.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I  view  the  risks  to  the  near-term  outlook  as  roughly  balanced,  with  the  upside  potential  associated  with  post-election  increases  in  consumer  and  business  sentiment  more  or  less  o ffset  by  the  downside  potential associated  with  now  somewhat  rich  equity  valuations  (which  have  increased  the  odds  of  a  market  correction)  and upcomingEuropeanelections.  Asforthemedium-termoutlook,althoughtheoddsarenon-trivialthatfiscalpolicy will  turn  out  to  be  more  expansionary  than  assumed  in  my  baseline  outlook  (although  probably  not  before  2018), the  effect  of  this  factor  on  the  balance  of  risks  is  o ffset  by  the  asymmetric  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to cyclical  fluctuations  in  a  low  interest  rate  environment.

Respondent 10: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  tot  he  downside  because  the  effective  lower bound  limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a countervailing  risk  that  it  will  fall  more  rapidly  if  the  labor  force  participation  rate  resumes  its  downward  trend. Therefore,  I  see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 11: Fiscal  uncertainty  remains  high.  Some  stimulus  seems  likely  that  would  boost  demand,  raise output  growth  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further.  The  magnitude  and  timing  of  any  such  stimulus  remains uncertain.

Respondent 12: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity  growth  regime  is possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time.  We  do  not  see  the  fiscal  and  deregulation proposals  of  the  administration  as  sufficiently  concrete  or  close  enough  to  enactment  to  forecast  a  high  productivity regime.  Such  a  possible  switch,  however,  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion.  If  a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially.  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon;  however,  such  a  possibility  leads  us  to  allow  for  a  higher  unemployment rate. On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  some  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate.  We  see  the risks  as  broadly  balanced.

ForcorePCEinflation,weplacenegligibleweightontheprospectsofPhillipsCurveeffects.  Thereis,however,a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  that  inflation  moves  higher.  It  is  also  possible  that  inflation expectations  could  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored.  Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  this  variable  also  depends  on the  behavior  of  energy  and  other  commodity  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 13: China  continues  on  an  unsustainable  trajectory  and  proposed  U.S.  tax  and  trade-policy changes  could  strain  the  finances  of  some  emerging-market  countries  and  trigger  a  round  of  protectionist  counter measures.  On  the  other  hand,  with  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in  prospect  the  ELB  is  less  of  a  concern  than  before, and  financial  markets  are  signaling  robust  growth. Risks  over  the  next  few  years  seem  roughly  balanced,  on  net. Because  of  possible  fallout  from  overshoot  of  our  full-employment  and  inflation  objectives,  however,  post-2019 risks  will  be  weighted  to  the  downside  for  GDP  growth  and  to  the  upside  for  unemployment.

Respondent 14: I see  a  significant  chance  that  measured  unemployment  will  decline  faster  than  forecast  if labor  force  participation  moves  down  or  if  the  wedge  is  smaller  than  forecast  between  employment  in  the  household survey  and  employment  in  the  establishment  survey.

Respondent 15: Surveymeasuresofsentimentandactivityareatfairlyelevatedlevels,andcouldbeconsistent with  a  faster  pace  of  spending.  In  addition,  our  baseline  forecast  features  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in  the  form  of a  tax  cut  which,  as  in  the  Tealbook,  raises  the  primary  deficit  to  GDP  ratio  by  1  percentage  point. While  there  is considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  future  fiscal  policy,  our  assumption  may  prove  too  conservative. In  all,  we assess  the  risks  to  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  being  tilted  to  the  upside,  and  vice  versa  for  the  unemployment  rate. We  now  view  the  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  as  mirroring  the  risks  to  the  real  outlook. In  particular,  we  place some  weight  on  the  possibility  that  wages  are  becoming  more  responsive  to  the  unemployment  rate  gap  as  labor market  conditions  continue  to  tighten.

Respondent 16: I have  not  incorporated  any  potential  changes  in  fiscal,  trade,  or  regulatory  policy  into  my baseline  outlook. My  view  is  that  the  lack  of  clarity  over  the  potential  set  of  policy  options  and  the  attending probabilities  of  those  options  made  incorporating  them  untenable  at  this  point.

Any  changes  to  fiscal  policy  are  likely  to  be,  on  net,  expansionary  in  the  near-to-medium  term.  Expansionary fiscal measurescouldpushtheunemploymentratewellbelowitsfull-employmentlevel.  Wehavelimitedexperience in  such'high-pressure'regimes  and  the  possibility  for  either  a  non-linear  response  in  inflation  or  for  an  unanchoring of  inflation  expectations  cannot  be  dismissed.

Respondent 17: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced. However,  this  view  is based  on  a  monetary  policy  path  that  is  a  bit  steeper  than  the  median  path  in  the  December  SEPs.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  expect  there  will  be  changes  to  fiscal  and  other  economic  policies,  such  as  infrastructure  spending,  tax  code  changes,  immigration  policy,  trade  policy,  healthcare  policy,  and  regulatory  changes. The  timing  and  magnitudes  of  the  impacts  will  depend  on  the  details. My  baseline  forecast  incorporates  fiscal stimulus  in  line  with  the  size  and  timing  of  the  package  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.  But  there  are  upside  and  downside risks,  as  the  package  could  be  larger  or  smaller,  and  its  design  will  be  an  important  factor  in  assessing  the  expected impact.  I've  incorporated  a  modest  increase  in  output  growth  and  inflation  in  2018  due  to  fiscal  policy  effects. A larger  package  could  pose  upside  risks  to  growth  and  inflation,  especially  if  monetary  policy  does  not  appropriately respond.  Depending  on  how  it  is  financed,  a  larger  fiscal  policy  package  could  also  pose  some  downside  risks  over the  longer  run  because  of  the  implications  for  the  budget  deficit  and,  therefore,  for  long-term  interest  rates. A smaller  fiscal  policy  package  would  be  a  downside  risk  and  could  generate  financial  market  volatility  to  the  extent that  investors'  expectations  are  not  met.

Also,  policies  that  constrain  immigration  and  trade  would  have  negative  effects  for  the  U.S.  economy  over  the longer  run,  but  I  have  not  incorporated  these  into  my  projections.

The  global  outlook  has  improved  somewhat.  However,  some  risks  remain,  including  the  weak  banking  system in  Italy,  uncertainty  around  the  outcomes  of  the  elections  in  several  European  countries,  which  may  reshape  the political landscapethere, andthecontinuedrebalancingoftheChineseeconomy.  Accommodativemonetarypolicy in  many  countries  will  help  support  their  economies  but  divergence  between  monetary  policy  abroad  and  in  the U.S.  will  also  result  in  further  appreciation  of  the  dollar. Stronger  appreciation  than  I've  assumed  poses  some downside  risk  to  growth.

Sentiment  and  confidence  measures  from  consumers  and  businesses  are  at  high  levels.  I  have  not  incorporated  a separate  effect  on  spending  from  these  high  confidence  levels  beyond  what  is  reflected  in  income  and  wealth  effects. However,  if  these  beliefs  lead  to  a  sizable  pick-up  in  spending,  they  could  pose  an  upside  risk  to  my  outlook.

At  this  point,  I  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced. In  my  baseline,  growth  at  or  above  trend  and  stable inflation expectationskeepinflationnearourtargetof2percent.  Thelabormarketmayhavemoremomentumthan I've  built  into  my  forecast. This  could  result  in  a  larger  under-run  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  estimate of  its  long-run  level. Should  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve  steepen  as  economic  growth  picks  up,  the  tightness  in labor  markets  could  translate  into  higher  inflation,  especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is slower  than  I've  assumed.  Even  absent  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary accommodation  than  I've  assumed  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

Over  the  past  year,  oil  prices  have  risen,  but  supplies  are  increasing,  which  could  put  downward  pressure  on the  price  of  oil,  which  would  feed  through  to  headline  inflation  measures  for  a  time. The  value  of  the  dollar  has

strengthened  over  the  last  year,  and  I  expect  further  strengthening.  A  larger  appreciation  than  I've  assumed  poses a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far,  but  given  the  outlook  and the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an  appropriate  pace, these  risks  would  rise.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: The  economy  has  made  important  progress  in  recent  months  toward  the  Committee's  goals of  full  employment  and  2  percent  inflation. However,  there  may  still  be  some  room  for  improvement  in  the  labor market,  and  it  may  be  some  time  before  the  economy  achieves  a  sustained  inflation  rate  of  2  percent. Given  the likely  continued  gradual  pace  of  increase  in  economic  activity,  the  persistent  shortfalls  of  inflation  from  our  target, the  asymmetric  risks  induced  by  proximity  to  the  effective  lower  bound,  and  the  continued  presence  of  significant medium-term downside risks  from  abroad,  appropriate  policy  calls  for  the  funds  rate  to  rise  only  gradually  through the  medium  term.  My  expectation  of  a  gradual  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  also  influenced  by  my  expectation that  the  Committee  will  decide  to  begin  to  phase  out  reinvestment  of  principal  payments  once  the  funds  rate  rises above  1.5  percent. By  the  end  of  the  medium  term,  with  expansionary  fiscal  policy  raising  aggregate  demand beyond  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  and  with  2  percent  inflation  likely  to  be  achieved,  I  expect  the  funds  rate  to rise  somewhat  above  its  longer  run  level.  If  fiscal  expansion  is  significantly  stronger  than  in  my  baseline  projection, I would  expect  the  funds  rate  to  rise  even  further  above  the  longer-run  level  by  the  end  of  the  medium  term.

Respondent 2: The  labor  market  is  essentially  at  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  of  slack. Labor  markets  will  continue  to  tighten  this  year-with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  further  below  its  natural  ratebefore  gradually  returning  to  its  long-run  steady-state  value.  This  overshooting  partly  reflects  expected  additional fiscal  policy  stimulus.  On  inflation,  despite  some  transitory  factors  a ffecting  recent  data,  I  expect  inflation  to  rise gradually  and  reach  our  2  percent  objective  in  2018  and  overshoot  it  in  2019. Underpinning  this  path  is  my  view that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run  somewhat  above  its  potential,  and  that  the  slope  of the  Phillips  curve  is  non-negligible.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

ff My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  this  year  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest. This reflects  the  fact  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only  gradually  to  our  objective  from  below.  Beyond  the  near  term,  I envision  a  pace  of  normalization  of  the  fed  funds  rate  that  is  faster  than  that  derived  from  fed  funds  futures.  The  fed funds  rate  will  overshoot  its  long-run  level  a  bit  in  the  second  half  of  2018  and  in  2019  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in inflation  and  labor  market  conditions.  Similarly  to  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  the  SOMA  portfolio  to  start  to  gradually decline  before  the  end  of  this  year  as  reinvestments  begin  to  taper  o

Respondent 3: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  twice  in  2017,  4  times  in 2018, andthenreachingitslong-runneutralrateof3percentinthesecondhalfof2019.  Therecentnewsoninflation has  been  welcome  support  to  our  projection  that  inflation  is  on  a  gradual  upswing. But,  particularly  in  the  near term,  for  continued  improvement  we  still  see  the  need  for  ample  policy accommodation and  explicit  communication

that  our  rate  path  will  depend  on  sustained  progress  toward  achieving  our  symmetric  inflation  objective. Risk management  considerations  also  continue  to  argue  in  favor  of  tempering  policy  moves. If growth  proceeds  along our  forecast  path  and  inflation  also  solidifies  as  expected,  then  by  next  year  we  believe  normalization  will  be  able to  proceed  at  a  somewhat  faster  pace. With  events  generally  transpiring  in  line  with  our  earlier  projection,  our policy  assumptions  are  the  same  as  in  our  December  submission.

Respondent 4: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability.  My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  below its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  to  be  at  two  percent  in  2017.  Yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds rate  in  2017  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level.  In  my  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate  promotes economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 5: With  inflation  near  2  percent  and  unemployment  below  its  longer-run  level,  I  believe  that we  should  begin  converging  to  the  funds  rate  path  given  by  policy  rules  such  as  Taylor  (1999)  that  capture  our behavior  over  the  past  few  decades. Since  higher  budget  deficits  or  stronger  productivity  growth  would  raise  the natural  real  interest  rate,  we  should  be  prepared  to  adjust  the  parameters  accordingly. I also  believe  we  should begin  reducing  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  the  next  time  we  raise  rates.

Respondent 6: The  low  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  been  necessary  to  move  inflation  and  unemployment back  toward  our  targets.  This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low  rate  of  productivity  growth and  other  factors. Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring  a  low  federal  funds  rate  for  some time  in  order  to  deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 7: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The steepness  of  the  policy  path  also  depends  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

ff DSGE  model. Our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2017,  2018,  and 2019  at  1 1 4 / -1 1 / %,  2  -  2 2 1 / %,  and  2 4 3 4 / -  3%  respectively;  the  projected  ranges  are  25  bps  higher  in  2017  and  2018, and  50  bps  higher  in  2019  than  in  our  December  submission. The  upward  shift  in  our  appropriate  policy  path  is primarily  motivated  by  an  increase  in  our  inflation  projection  and  a  rise  in  the  upside  tail  risks  to  that  projection,  as well  as  an  assessment  of  some  reduction  of  the  costs  associated  with  the  downside  risks  to  real  activity  and  inflation. In  addition,  the  loosening  of  financial  conditions  since  December  indicates  that  a  somewhat  tighter  policy  stance is warranted. Even  with  this  shift,  the  policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  is  consistent  with  a  gradual  rising path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as  projected  by  the  sta

Despite  the  shift  in  the  medium  term  policy  path,  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate over  the  longer  run  remains  in  the  range  of  0  -  2%,  consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety  of models. Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2 -4%. Our  modal  projection  for  the  equilibrium  rate  is  in  the  lower  half  of  this  range  due  to  the  combination  of continued  subdued  productivity  growth,  still-low  longer-term  sovereign  yields,  continued  indications  of  a  global 'saving glut,'and demographic factors.  These  considerations  lead to  our  point  estimate  of 2 1 / %  in  the  response 2 to  question  3(a),  which  is  the  same  as  in  the  December  submission. Consequently,  our  appropriate  policy  path temporarily  overshoots  the  longer-run  FFR.

We  assume  that  full  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from the  effective  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible.  Based  on our  modal  economic  outlook  and  the  shift  in  the  appropriate  policy  path,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  by 2017Q4.

Respondent 8: The  fact  that  several  more  months  of  data  have  conformed  to  or,  in  some  instances,  exceeded, my  expectations  in  December  has  made  me  more  confident  in  the  trajectory  and  strength  of  the  economy.  Accordingly,  I  have  added  another  25  bp  to  my  expected  appropriate  rate  increases  for  this  year. I have  not  changed  my expectations  with  respect  to  the  amount  of  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  two  years.  Thus,  on  net, my  projection  of  the  appropriate  target  at  the  end  of  2019  is  25  bp  higher  than  in  my  December  submission.

Respondent 9: I anticipate  that  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  will  rise  gradually  over  time but  remain  below  its  longer-run  level  through  2019,  for  two  reasons. First,  the  underlying  trend  in  inflation  is still  somewhat  below  2  percent,  and  so  it  will  be  appropriate  to  keep  policy  moderately  accommodative  this  year in  order  to  promote  some  further  strengthening  in  labor  market  conditions,  thereby  helping  inflation  to  stabilize around  2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis  over  the  medium  term. Second,  I  anticipate  that  the  neutral  funds  rate, which  is  currently  near  zero,  will  rise  somewhat  over  the  next  few  years;  as  this  occurs,  it  will  be  appropriate  to raise  the  actual  federal  funds  rate  in  tandem.

Respondent 10: The  labor  market,  as  measured  by  the  unemployment  rate,  is  essentially  back  to  normal. But  secondary  measures  of  slack,  such  as  the  fraction  of  the  labor  force  working  part  time  for  economic  reasons, remains  slightly  elevated,  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime  working age  persons  remain  well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. In addition,  the neutral  funds  rate  is  expected  to  rise  from  its  currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several  years. As  a  result,  it  is  appropriate  to  raise  rates  gradually.

ff scenarios  given  low Respondent 11: My projection  for  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  unchanged  from  last  time. My  view  is  that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than  has  been  typical  in  past  lifto productivity  growth,  uncertainty  about  the  future  path  of  the  labor  force  participation  rate,  and  inflation  that  has been  running  below  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 12: To  reflect  an  upward  movement  in  the  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt, we  think  one  25-point  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in  2017,  with  no  additional  changes  in  2018 and  2019.  We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth and  a  still  low  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.

Respondent 13: Prospects  for  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  incentives  for  public  and  private  investment, and  lighter  regulation  have  combined  to  increase  the  neutral  real  funds  rate,  r*. This  increase  makes  the  current monetary  policy  setting  more  accommodative  and  reduces  the  chances  that  policy  will  become  constrained  by the  zero  bound  in  the  event  of  an  adverse  shock. In  response  to  these  developments,  in  December  I  increased  my estimate  of  the  longer-run  value  of  the  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points  and  assumed  a  steeper  path  for  the  funds rate  over  the  projections  horizon. I have  not  made  further  changes  to  my  policy  projections  in  this  SEP  round. However,  my  confidence  that  the  funds-rate  path  I  have  specified  will,  in  fact,  prove  to  be  appropriate  is  somewhat lower  than  usual.

Respondent 14: I see  a  gradual  path  of  3  rate  increases  in  2017  and  4  rate  increases  in  2018. Since  we  are quite  close  to  our  mandates,  it  is  appropriate  to  return  the  real  federal  funds  rate  to  a  neutral  level,  which  today I estimate  at  around  0. On  this  path,  the  fed  funds  rate  should  reach  that  level  in  about  a  year. I expect  that  it will  be  appropriate  to  begin  to  shrink  the  balance  sheet  in  mid-2018  and  that  will  also  tighten  financial  conditions. I see  unemployment  declining  below  estimates  of  the  natural  rate  for  some  time,  and  think  that  is  appropriate  to continue  to  support  labor  market  conditions.  It  seems  plausible  or  even  likely  to  me  that  the  natural  rate  is  lower than  current  estimates.

Respondent 15: The  tightening  of  monetary  policy  is  accompanied  in  this  projection  by  a  contraction  in the  SOMA  portfolio  starting  in  the  second  half  of  this  year. Over  the  earlier  part  of  the  forecast  horizon,  the projected  tightening  of  policy  assumes  an  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  that  is  below  our  longer-run  estimate  of 3 percent. Absent  this  temporary  effect,  the  projected  trajectory  for  the  federal  funds  rate  would  be  somewhat higher.  Monetary  policy  has  to  balance  the  need  to  probe  for  better  labor  market  outcomes  with  the  need  to  avoid overshooting  full  employment  by  a  large  amount. If the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  is  indeed  at  4.7  percent as we  are  assuming,  the  projected  stance  of  monetary  policy  pushes  probing  to  what  is  likely  the  limit  before the  probability  that  a  soft  landing  will  turn  into  a  recession  rises  sizably. When  taking  such  a  risk  into  account, appropriate  monetary  policy  could  well  entail  more  than  the  four  25  basis  points  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate that  we  feature  in  our  outlook  for  2017.

Respondent 16: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate.

Respondent 17: My  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  unchanged  since  December,  as the  incoming  data  have  been  generally  in  line  with  my  expectations  and  my  medium-run  economic  outlook  has changed  little.  I  assume  reinvestments  will  end  later  this  year.

In  2017  and  2018,  I  project  that  growth  will  be  somewhat  above  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  somewhat below  my  estimates  of  their  longer-run  levels.  I  anticipate  that  labor  compensation  measures  will  firm  moderately, in line with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  a  variety  of  data showing  that  wage  and  compensation  gains  have  picked  up  over  time. However,  these  gains  will  likely  be  slower than  in  past  expansions  reflecting  slower  growth  in  productivity.

Inflationisnearourgoalof2percent.  Reasonablystableinflationexpectationscoupledwithcontinuedstrength in  labor  markets  and  ongoing  economic  growth  suggest  that  inflation  will  remain  near  our  goal  of  2  percent  over the  forecast  horizon.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Based  on  the  outlook,  I  believe  it  will be  appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  move  rates  up  over  the  course  of  2017  and  2018.  I  assume  that  the  funds  rate  will end  2019  at  a  level  slightly  higher  than  my  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent.  But  admittedly  there  is  considerable uncertainty  around  this  path.  With  the  high  level  of  uncertainty  around  fiscal  and  other  government  policies,  and with  labor  markets  already  at  full  employment  and  inflation  already  near  2  percent,  upside  or  downside  surprises may  require  more  variation  in  our  forecasts  and  appropriate  policy  paths  over  the  next  couple  of  years  than  we  saw over  the  past  couple  of  years. Forestalling  rate  increases  for  too  long  increases  the  risks  to  financial  stability  and has  the  potential  to  require  even  sharper  rate  increases  in  the  future,  which  poses  its  own  risks  to  the  outlook.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: The  recovery  from  the  housing  collapse  and  financial  crisis  is  essentially  complete,  and  incoming  data  indicate  that  the  economy  is  expanding  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  the  slow  pace  of  potential,  which  has pushed  the  unemployment  lower.  Going  forward,  the  strength  in  the  labor  market  hiring,  faster  wage  growth,  and gains  in  household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth. The  climate  for  future  fixed  business investmentappearstohaveimprovedgiventhelikelyhigherafter-taxcorporatecashflow, alikelylighterregulatory burden,  and  improving  prospects  abroad.

The  expected  fiscal  stimulus  is  likely  to  boost  economic  growth  over  the  next  few  years. Similarly  to  the Tealbook,  I  expect  some  new  measures  to  be  approved  by  the  end  of  this  year,  contributing  to  growth  in  2018  and 2019  by  about 1 / 4 percentage  point,  which  is  partly  o ffset  by  less  accommodative  monetary  policy. Due  to  the substantial  uncertainty  about  the  composition  of  the  stimulus  it  is  premature  to  adjust  the  longer-run  outlook.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  a  bit  above  potential.  Output and  unemployment  gaps  were  closed  in  2016.  With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  place  and  renewed  fiscal stimulus,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for  the  next  few  years  before  closing  at  the  end  of  2020.  This  overshooting should  lead  to  faster  inflation  over  the  next  few  years. I expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  the  first quarter  of  2018,  and  to  overshoot  slightly  in  2019. Tighter  monetary  policy  will  bring  inflation,  growth,  and unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the  end  of  2020.

Respondent 3: We  expect  growth  to  run  moderately  above  potential  through  2019. Although  consumer spending  weakened  in  January,  we  read  this  development  as  a  temporary  lull  and  expect  that  the  usual  factors  accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  and  improved  household  and  business  balance  sheets -will  continue  to  support  consumer-driven  growth  in  the  near  future. Business  spending  at  last  appears  poised to grow  at  a  healthier  pace. Moreover,  we  expect  the  drag  from  net  exports  to  wane  through  the  projection period. Fiscal  policy  is  assumed  to  provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth  beginning  in  late  2017. At  4.7  percent,  the unemployment  rate  is  at  our  estimate  of  the  current  natural  rate,  and  we  expect  to  slightly  overshoot  neutral  as  we move  through  this  year.  We  project  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  4.3  percent  in  2019,  about  a  quarter  percentage point  below  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

This  outlook  incorporates  roughly  the  same  degree  of  fiscal  stimulus  as  in  our  December  forecast,  but  differs in  its  timing.  In  total,  we  expect  policy  changes  will  increase  the  primary  deficit  by  a  little  over  a  percentage  point of  GDP,  and  that  their  direct  impulse  on  consumption  and  government  purchases  will  boost  the  level  of  GDP  by about 1 / 2 percentage  point.  We  assume  some  of  this  impulse  is  crowded  out  by  higher  interest  rates  and  a  stronger dollar,  and  accordingly  boosted  our  projection  for  GDP  by  only  0.3  percentage  point.  We  see  about  a  tenth  of  this growth  arising  in  2017  from  increases  in  defense  spending  late  in  the  year  (the  first  quarter  of  FY2018).  But  in  light of  the  lack  of  legislative  momentum,  we  now  assume  tax  cuts  will  not  become  effective  until  CY2018,  and  therefore see  the  remaining  two  tenths  of  fiscal  stimulus  to  GDP  occurring  next  year.

Our  forecast  has  core  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  by  2019.  The  incoming  data  on  total  inflation  have  moved us  closer  to  target. The  eventual  overshooting  in  resource  slack  and  the  stabilization  of  the  dollar  and  energy prices  should  provide  a  further  lift  to  inflation  going  forward. In  addition,  we  assume  the  shallow  path  for  policy normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  will  further solidify  inflation  expectations  and  help  return  actual  inflation  to  target. This  forecast  is  the  same  as  we  made  in December.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 4: Modal  forecast:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  growth  near  trend  in  the period  from  2017  to  2019.  As  the  stimulus  from  accommodative  financing  conditions  and  gains  in  household  wealth graduallydiminishes,  Iexpectgrowthtobecomemoreself-sustaining, basedonmodestincreasesinaggregatehours worked  and  a  moderate  recovery  in  the  pace  of  productivity  gains.  After  the  rapid  reductions  in  economic  slack  in

the  past  few  years,  I  view  the  economy  as  currently  operating  near  full  capacity. I expect  the  unemployment  rate to  move  somewhat  lower  this  year,  before  gradually  moving  back  toward  its  longer-run  rate  in  2019.  My  inflation outlook  projects  an  inflation  rate  at  2  percent  from  2017  onwards,  an  increase  from  its  recent  level  that  reflects tightening  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  effects  of  past  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  energy  prices.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors,  the  current  economic  problems in  major  regions  around  the  world,  and  economic  and  policy  uncertainty  at  home.  The  risks  to  economic  growth, inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly  balanced. On  the  downside,  risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  emanate from  Europe  and  China.  The  possibility  that  an  overly  expansive  monetary  policy  could  lead  the  unemployment rate  to  significantly  undershoot  its  natural  level  is  another  downside  risk,  as periods  of overheating  have  historically often  ended  with  a  recession.  Upside  risks  to  my  forecast  are  related  to  the  resilience  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  the possibility  of  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance.

Fiscalpolicy:  Myprojectionincorporatesnochangeinfiscalpolicy,asanypossiblechangesintaxes,government spending,  or  regulations  remain  highly  uncertain. The  likelihood  of  a  more  accommodative  fiscal  policy  stance poses  upside  risk  for  growth  and  inflation  and  downside  risk  for  the  unemployment  rate.  Considering  this  risk  in  the context  of  the  array  of  possible  changes  to  fiscal,  trade,  health,  and  regulatory  policies,  however,  I  view  uncertainty as  broadly  similar  to  the  past  20  years  and  the  risks  around  my  outlook  as  broadly  balanced. With  no  marked changes  in  the  modal  outlook  or  my  assessment  of  uncertainty  and  risks,  I  have  not  changed  my  projection  for  the appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 5: With  unemployment  a  bit  below  its  longer-run  value,  my  forecast  begins  with  trend  growth  in real  GDP.  I  agree  with  the  Tealbook  that  expansive  fiscal  policies  are  unlikely  to  take  effect  this  year.  I  have  added a  bump  of  two  tenths  in  real  GDP  growth  for  2018,  for  the  portion  of  initial  fiscal  stimulus  that  is  not  o ffset.

Respondent 6: My  central  economic  outlook  is  based  on  the  performance  of  the  economy  in  the  past  few  years and  my  attempt  to  foresee  future  policies.

Respondent 7: We  raised  our  projected  growth  of  real  GDP  for  2017H1  by  0.1  percentage  point  to  1.8  percent (annual  rate). We  expect  real  PCE  growth  over  the  first  half  of  2017  to  be  somewhat  lower  than  we  anticipated in  December,  but  we  now  see  this  reduction  being  more  than  o ffset  by  higher  growth  of  business  fixed  investment, residential  investment,  and  inventory  investment.

We  expect  real  GDP  growth  for  2017  to  be  2  percent  (Q4/Q4),  up  from  1.9%  in  the  December  submission.  As in  that  submission,  we  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  slow  to  around  1.8%  in  2018  and  2019,  with  this  slowing  driven by  a  combination  of  an  aging  business  cycle  and  a  tightening  of  financial  conditions  as  the  policy  rate  continues  to rise. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  decline  to  4.6  percent  in  2017Q4  and  then  to  4.5  percent  in  2018Q4  and 2019Q4,  which  is  moderately  below  our  point  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  and  reflects  our  view  of  typical labor  market  dynamics  in  long  expansions.  Also  underlying  the  unemployment  projection  is  a  gradual  increase  in productivity  growth  toward  its  long-run  trend  and  a  slight  downward  trend  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate over  the  forecast  horizon.

We  project  some  slowing  in  real  PCE  growth  in  both  2017  and  2018  due  to  tightening  financial  conditions  and modest  slowing  in  real  disposable  income  growth. As  in  previous  submissions,  we  anticipate  the  personal  saving rate  to  be  essentially  flat  over  the  projection  horizon.  We  anticipate  some  firming  of  business  fixed  investment,  and that  housing  starts  will  remain  on  a  gradual  uptrend  despite  rising  mortgage  interest  rates. Overall,  we  project growth  of  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers  to  be  slightly  stronger  in  2017  than  in  2016,  but  we  also  anticipate  the net  export  real  GDP  growth  contribution  to  be  -0.5  percentage  point  in  2017,  down  from  -0.2  percentage  point  in 2016.  In  2018,  growth  of  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers  slows  a  bit,  so  that  the  net  export  growth  contribution is  projected  to  be  -0.4  percentage  point.

Regardinginflation,weanticipatetotalPCEdeflatorinflationtobe2.1percentin2017,whilecorePCEinflation is projected  to  be  1.9  percent,  with  the  difference  reflecting  the  impact  of  the  rise  in  energy  prices  in  the  latter part  of  2016. With  the  economy  operating  near  or  modestly  beyond  full  employment  and  inflation  expectations anchored  at  the  FOMC's  objective,  core  PCE  inflation  is  projected  to  rise  to  2.1  percent  in  2018  and  2.2  percent  in 2019.  Overall  PCE  inflation  is  similar  in  those  two  years.

Since  the  presidential election there  have been  significant  moves in financial  asset prices  resulting  in  some easing of  financial  conditions  as  measured  by  the  Goldman  Sachs  Financial  Conditions  Index.  In  our  view,  the  change  in

underlying  financial  conditions  is  too  modest  to  warrant  a  meaningful  change  in  our  modal  forecast;  instead,  we incorporate  this  development  into  our  risk  assessment.

As  in  December,  we  believe  that  there  is  insufficient  information  regarding  the  nature,  magnitude,  and  timing of  future  changes  in  fiscal  policy  to  attempt  to  incorporate  them  into  our  modal  forecast.  In  addition,  the  amount of  stimulus  such  actions  could  deliver  with  the  economy  at  or  near  full  employment  is  not  clear.

Respondent 8: The  most  important  factor  since  December  is  precisely  that,  taken  as  a  while,  the  economy has  continued  to  grow  in  roughly  the  way  we  expected. The  labor  market  continues  to  improve,  further  reducing remaining  slack,  although  wages  have  yet  to  move  upward  in  the  sharper,  sustained  way  that  many  have  long expected. The  prospect  for  inflation  reaching,  and  then  stabilizing  around  2%  also  looks  to  have  improved. A general  diminution  in  downside  risks  from  economic  performance  abroad  (though  perhaps  not  from  political  and geopolitical  risks)  also  removes  some  negative  uncertainty  from  the  outlook.

Respondent 9: My  forecast  is  conditioned  on  several  key  assumptions. First,  I  continue  to  assume  that  the forces  which  are  currently  restraining  growth  -  slow  productivity  growth,  an  elevated  exchange  rate,  weak  foreign growth,  and  restrictive  mortgage  credit  -  will  abate  only  gradually. Second,  as  a  placeholder  I  now  assume  that there  will  be  no  significant  change  in  fiscal  policy,  in  contrast  to  the  modest  additional  stimulus  I  incorporated  into my  December  projection.  However,  the  contractionary  effects  of  this  change  in  fiscal  assumptions  on  my  projection are  essentially  o ffset  by  a  gradual  boost  to  consumer  spending  from  recent  stock  market  gains. Third,  I  assume that  the  federal  funds  rate  will  gradually  rise  over  time  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  (rising)  neutral  rate. Finally,  I assume  that  headline  inflation  will  edge  back  to  around  1.8  percent  later  this  year  as  the  transitory  effects  of  recent increases  in  energy  abate,  but  then  will  edge  up  over  the  next  two  years  to  2  percent,  aided  a  bit  by  modestly  tight labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 10: The  improvement  in  secondary  measures  of  labor  market  slack  we  had  seen  has  slowed. Because  room  remains  to  further  reduce  slack,  core  inflation  continues  to  run  below  target  and  it  is  likely  to  take several  years  before  it  returns  to  target. The  continued  low  level  of  core  inflation,  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of allowing  further  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  and  potential  risks  to  the  US  economy  from  international  policy divergence  all  suggest  a  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy.

My  outlook  does  not  include  any  assumptions  about  potential  forthcoming  fiscal  policy  changes.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  calls  for  output  growth  of  about  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.  I  continue to expect  that  some  fiscal  stimulus  may  be  forthcoming  over  the  next  few  years,  but  because  the  timing  and magnitude  is  so  uncertain  it  is  not  meaningfully  a ffecting  my  point  forecast. However,  I  see  some  upside  risk  to output  growth  over  the  medium  term. The  unemployment  rate  falls  modestly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural rate  as  the  economy  grows  at  about  its  trend  pace  and  the  labor  force  participation  rate  edges  down. Headline inflation  moves  up  to  the  2  percent  target  by  the  beginning  of  2018. With  inflation  and  output  growth  running near  my  longer-term  trends  and  the  unemployment  rate  slightly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  monetary policy  becomes  less  accommodative  over  the  forecast  horizon.  However,  accommodation  is  removed  at  a  gradual pace  in  light  of  the  economic  uncertainties  surrounding  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  and  trade  reform,  productivity growth,  and  inflation  dynamics.

Respondent 12: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  medium  and  long-term  outcomes for the U.S.  economy.  In our conception, there are multiple regimes and we appear to have converged to one of them. The  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the forecast  horizon. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent,  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  some  of  the  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher  productivity growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession.  If  the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these states,  all  variables  may  be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  rate  would  require adjustment.  However,  we  have  no  way  of  predicting  when  these  transitions  may  occur,  and  so  we  forecast  that  we will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 13: As  we  have  discussed  at  previous  meetings,  transitions  to  sustainable,  non-inflationary growth  are  difficult  once  the  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  below  the  natural  rate. (Over  the  past  60  years  there

are  no  gradual  increases  in  the  unemployment  rate  of  any  appreciable  size.) The  exact  mechanisms  are  unclear, but  probably  revolve  around  levels  of  debt,  physical  capital,  and  staffing  that  suddenly  become  problematic-inducing  sharp  cutbacks  in  spending  and  hiring-when  it  becomes  apparent  that  the  growth  outlook  must  be revised  downward.  Substantial  unemployment  undershoot  now  seems  all  but  inevitable,  and  it  will  take  unusual skill  and  a  good  measure  of  luck  to  engineer  a  soft  landing.

The  transition  to  sustainable  growth  will  be  complicated  by  a  further  significant  slowing  in  labor-force  growth as  our  (and  the  world's)  population  ages.

Respondent 14: The  economy  is  on  solid  footing  today,  with  growth  above  potential  and  strong  hiring  at  a time  of  low  measured  unemployment.  Inflation  is  near  mandate.  Ebullient  confidence  surveys  and  booming  asset prices  represent  upside  if  they  are  sustained.  Fiscal  policy  will  likely  turn  accommodative  next  year.  Risks  abroad have  diminished  but  are  still  to  the  downside.  Overall,  risks  to  our  economy  are  balanced  or  perhaps  skewed  to  the upside  in  my  view.

Respondent 15: Incomingdatahavebeenmixed,buttheyhavenotledtosignificantchangesinourassessment oftheoutlook.  Thelabormarketcontinuestoimproveroughlyinlinewithexpectations.  Householdspendingatthe beginning  of  the  year  was  less  than  expected,  but  fundamentals  for  consumption  remain  positive.  The  possibility of  residual  seasonality  in  the  BEA's  national  accounts  data,  which  works  in  the  direction  of  understating  growth  in the  first  half  of  the  year  and  overstating  it  in  the  second  half,  should  be  kept  in  mind  when  assessing  this  information and  comparing  it  with  the  signal  from  the  labor  market.  Conditioning  assumptions  are  now  more  favorable,  largely because  the  stock  market  has  appreciated  more  than  expected  since  December. Uncertainty  surrounding  the timing,  nature,  and  size  of  the  Trump  Administration's  fiscal  policy  measures  is  still  present. For  comparison purposes,  we  continue  to  work  with  the  same  assumptions  as  in  the  Tealbook. The  ultimate  impact  of  the  fiscal stimulus  is  o ffset  to  some  extent  by  higher  longer-term  interest  rates  and  additional  dollar  appreciation.

The  broad  contours  of  the  forecast  have  not  changed  materially. Activity  in  the  near  term  is  sustained  by continued  improvements  in  the  labor  market  and  by  gains  in  household  net  worth,  which  translate  into  a  relatively fast  pace  of  growth  in  consumer  spending.  In  2018,  fiscal  policy  provides  additional  support  to  disposable  income at  a  time  when  the  effect  on  consumption  from  net  worth  appreciation  is  starting  to  wane.  The  consumption  gains also  raise  business  spending,  though  the  outlook  for  investment  is  muted  by  rising  interest  rates. Overall,  the upbeat  outlook  for  consumption  supports  a  forecast  for  GDP  growth  modestly  above  potential  over  the  period 2017-19.  This  pace  of  growth  is  associated  with  a  modest  overshooting  of  full  employment,  as  the  unemployment rate  is  expected  to  reach  4.3  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. The  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  projected  path  for  the federal  funds  rate  that  balances  the  need  for  probing  for  better  labor  market  outcomes  with  the  risk  of  overshooting full  employment  by  a  larger  amount.  Our  federal  funds  rate  assumption  is  coupled  with  a  contraction  in  the  SOMA portfolio  starting  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  when  we  begin  to  taper  the  reinvestment  of  maturing  securities. We  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  remain  close  to  target  over  the  forecast  period.

Downside  risks  emanating  from  abroad  are  still  present  but  appear  to  have  receded  somewhat.  On  the  upside, the  increase  in  household  and  business  sentiment  since  November  of  last  year  could  signal  a  stronger-than-expected acceleration  in  activity. Moreover,a  composition  of  the  projected  fiscal  stimulus  package  that  is  tilted  towards spending  rather  than  tax  cuts  would  imply  a  larger  fiscal  multiplier,  and  thus  a  larger  simulative  effect,  than  what we  are  currently  assuming. In  all,  we  assess  the  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  as  tilted  to  the  upside. As  concerns prices,  with  the  economy  expected  to  overshoot  full  employment  and  upside  risks  to  growth,  there  is  the  risk  of  a nonlinear  response  of  inflation.  These  upside  risks  reinforce  the  need  for  a  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  that  keeps the  economy  close  to  full  employment.

Respondent 16: My  outlook  consists  of  modestly  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  two  years  and  inflation that  remains  at  2  percent  throughout  the  forecast  horizon.

Growth over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  a  moderate  pace  of  consumption  growth  and  a  strengthening  in  investment  growth.  Support  for  domestic  demand  comes  from  further  firming  in  the  labor  market  alongside continued  growth  in  household  incomes.

I view  the  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  as  weighted  to  the  upside. This  tilt  rests  primarily  on  the  assumption that  whatever  set  of  fiscal  policy  changes  are  eventually  enacted,  are  likely  to  be,  on  net,  expansionary  in  the near-to-medium  term.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  weighted  to  the  upside.  The  prospect  for  additional  fiscal  stimulus  at a  time  when  the  unemployment  rate  is  near  its  full-employment  level  suggests  upside  risk.  Recent  history  suggests

that  the  response  of  inflation  to  changes  in  resource  slack  is  somewhat  muted  (perhaps  owing  to  well-anchored inflation expectations).  However, thatmaynotremainthecaseiftheunemploymentratefallswellbelowitsnatural level.

Respondent 17: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  relatively  low  oil  prices. Business  investment  has  begun  to  strengthen.  Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in finding  qualified  workers,  and  some  increased  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations.  Global growth  prospects  have  improved  somewhat  and  inflation  rates  here  and  abroad  have  firmed,  supported  by  highly accommodative  monetary  policy.

In  the  U.S.,  there  will  likely  be  some  form  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  although  the  details  are  still  unknown. I've  incorporated  fiscal  policy  assumptions  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  and  I  expect  that  fiscal  stimulus  will provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth  and  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon. There  is  considerable  uncertainty surrounding  my  fiscal  policy  assumptions.  In  addition,  there  is  uncertainty  about  whether  policies  that  constrain immigration  and  trade  will  be  enacted.  While  I  have  not  incorporated  such  effects  into  my  baseline  forecast,  these would  have  negative  effects  for  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  longer  run.

The  U.S.  economy  has  been  growing  at  a  moderate  rate  and  labor  market  conditions  have  strengthened  over the  last  year. From  the  perspective  of  what  monetary  policy  can  do,  I  believe  we  have  achieved  the  maximum employment  part  of  the  dual  mandate.

Inflation  is  near  our  2  percent  goal.  Inflation  rates  have  moved  up  from  their  year-ago  levels  as  the  effects  of  past declines  in  oil  prices  and  the  appreciation  of  the  dollar  have  faded. This  path  is  consistent  with  what  the  FOMC has  been  expecting. I view  inflation  expectations  as  reasonably  well-anchored. This,  coupled  with  continued strengthening  in  labor  market  conditions  and  ongoing  economic  growth,  suggest  that  inflation  will  be  near  our  2 percent  goal  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Although  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  fiscal  and  other  government  policies,  I  view  overall  uncertainty  as roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years.  As  described  above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: AkeydevelopmentsinceDecemberhasbeenadelayintheexpectedfiscalstimulus.  Mymodal projection  now  assumes  that  fiscal  policy  will  not  impact  growth  in  this  year  but  will  push  up  growth  by  a  tenth  or two  in  each  of  the  next  two  years  after  factoring  in  some  o ffset  from  higher  interest  rates  and  a  stronger  dollar.  The effects  of  this  delay  in  fiscal  stimulus  have  been  o ffset  by  the  sizable  run-up  in  broad-based  equity  market  indexes, which  should  boost  consumption  later  this  year. Therefore,  my  projection  for  growth  in  this  year  is  unchanged compared  to  December.

My  inflation  projection  is  revised  a  bit  higher  for  this  year  due  to  stronger  than  expected  data  in  the  first quarter.  I  expect  this  to  be  mostly  due  to  transitory  factors  and  did  not  change  my  projections  for  inflation  in  the following  years.

Respondent 3: The  spending  and  production  data  since  our  December  submission  have  come  in  pretty  much in  line  with  expectations  and  therefore  we  made  no  material  change  to  our  GDP  or  unemployment  rate  forecasts. We  did  shift  a  tenth  of  GDP  growth  from  2017  to  2018  to  account  for  a  later  enactment  of  tax  cuts;  we  previously distributed  the  impact  of  tax  reform  equally  between  2017  and  2018. The  incoming  inflation  data  have  solidified our  belief  that  core  inflation  is  on  the  gradual  path  to  target  that  we  projected  in  December-we  have  not  changed our  modal  expectation  of  the  inflation  path,  but  have  changed  our  risk  assessment  from  down  to  balanced.

Respondent 4: I have  made  minor  revisions  to  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate, and  headline  and  core  inflation  based  on  the  incoming  data.

Respondent 5: My  forecast  is  almost  identical  to  the  December  submission.  I  did  postponed  the  fiscal  policy effect  on  GDP  by  one  year,  and  I  changed  the  unemployment  forecast  slightly  in  response  to  recent  labor  market data.

Respondent 6: I judge  uncertainty  around  the  outlook  for  fiscal  policy  to  be  large. While  I  believe  fiscal policy  will  likely  be  more  expansionary  than  I  had  previously  thought,  I  remain  with  considerable  uncertainty about  future  policies.

Respondent 7: Even  though  our  real  GDP  growth  projections  have  not  changed  significantly,  we  now  project that  the  unemployment  rate  will  remain  modestly  below  our  point  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  for  a longer  time  than  in  our  December  submission. This  change  reflects  our  current  assessment  of  the  implications  of recent  labor  market  dynamics  for  the  near- and  medium-term  outlook.

The  overall  and  core  inflation  forecasts  for  2018  and  2019  are  a  bit  higher  than  they  were  in  our  December projections,  and  now  display  a  small  overshoot  of  the  inflation  objective. This  overshoot  helps  to  ensure  that inflation  expectations  do  not  begin  to  fall  below  the  FOMC's  longer-run  inflation  objective  and  thus  helps  to achieve  the  Federal  Reserve's  mandated  objectives  over  the  longer  run.

As  noted  and  explained  in  the  response  to  3(b),  we  have  moved  up  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy path. The  higher  near-term  policy  path  reflects  the  combined  effects  of  the  easing  in  financial  conditions,  some greater  upside  risks  to  the  real  activity  and  inflation  outlooks,  and  the  generally  strong  survey  data  seen  in  recent months.  The  policy  path  over  the  medium  term  is  higher  to  ensure  that  the  overshoot  of  inflation  and  undershoot of  unemployment  are  temporary,  helping  to  lead  to  the  achievement  of  the  longer-run  objectives  in  the  early  2020s. With  the  higher  policy  path,  we  now  assume  that  the  end  of  full  reinvestment  will  occur  in  2017Q4  rather  than sometime  in  2018.

Respondent 8: See  above.

Respondent 9: My  forecast  no  longer  assumes  (as  a  placeholder)  that  Congress  will  enact  a  modest  tax  cut later  this  year. However,  my  outlook  is  little  changed  on  net  because,  due  to  recent  stock  market  gains,  I  have factored  in  a  modest  boost  to  consumer  spending  from  higher  household  wealth.

Respondent 10: Near-term  core  inflation  has  come  in  a  bit  higher  than  I  expected,  so  I  increased  my  2017 forecast  a  touch.  Because  of  the  recent  increases  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate,  I  expect  the  labor  market  to be  able  to  accommodate  robust  employment  gains,  but  at  a  slightly  lower  rate.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Our  forecasts  are  unchanged  for  2017,  2018,  and  2019.

Respondent 13: My  projections  are  almost  unchanged  from  those  I  submitted  in  December.

As  before,  I  implicitly  assume  that  the  most  extreme  anti-immigrant  and  anti-trade  campaign  rhetoric  does not  translate  into  policy  action.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Changes  to  the  real  and  the  inflation  outlook  have  been  minor. However,  given  the  more favorable  developments  in  households  net  worth  since  December,  the  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  modestly tighter  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate.  The  unemployment  rate  bottoms  out  at  4.3  percent,  slightly  above  the  level projected  in  our  previous  forecast.  This  revision  is  the  result  of  a  somewhat  more  cautious  approach  to  probing  for a  lower  equilibrium  unemployment  rate,  since  recent  wage  and  price  inflation  developments  could  be  interpreted as  consistent  with  an  economy  that  is  currently  at  full  employment.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: My  modal  forecast  is  little  changed  since  December. The  recent  inflation  data  have  been a bit  stronger  than  anticipated,  and  my  inflation  forecast  in  2017  is  slightly  higher  as  a  result. Otherwise,  the incoming  data  have  been  generally  in  line  with  my  expectations.

I have  not  made  changes  to  my  expectations  for  fiscal  policy  since  the  last  SEP  and  continue  to  await  further details  on  the  composition,  timing,  and  magnitude  of  any  package. At  this  point,  my  fiscal  policy  assumptions remain  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  and  I  expect  that  expansionary  fiscal  policy  will  provide  a  modest  boost  to growth  and  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon.  I  have  not  incorporated  changes  to  other  economic  policies  such  as immigration  policy  and  trade  policy,  but  view  these  as  risks  to  the  outlook  over  the  longer  run.

I view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as  appropriate  given  that  unemployment  is  expected  to  remain below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  is  near  our  goal  of  2  percent. My  path  is  unchanged  since  my  December projection.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the unemployment rate declining  to  4.1  percent at the  end  of  2019,  and with inflation  returning  to  the  2  percent target  only  very  gradually. In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output through  2019,  and  those  gaps  close  in  2020.  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  4.6  percent  this  year.

The  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  effects  of  expected  fiscal  stimulus  are  fairly  front-loaded  in  2018  with  some smaller  impact  to  growth  in  2019.  Additionally,  the  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  permanent  changes  to  fiscal  policy lead  to  an  increase  of  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate. In  my  projections  I  assume  that  the  expected  fiscal policy  stimulus  is  also  somewhat  concentrated  in  2018  with  a  smaller  contribution  to  growth  in  2019,  but  no  change to  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate.

The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows growthtobelowpotentialin2019.  Thispushesuptheunemploymentrateto4.8percentbytheendof2019.  Finally, the  persistent  overshoot  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  in  2018  and  a  slight  overshooting for  some  time  afterwards.  Tighter  monetary  policy  brings  inflation  back  to  target  and  unemployment  back  to  its long-run  sustainable  level  in  2020.

Respondent 3: Our  Federal  Funds  rate  path  is  about  40  bps  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  period, ending  2019  at  3  percent,  which  is  our  view  of  its  long-run  equilibrium  level.  Our  projection  for  GDP  growth  over 2017-2019  averages  0.2  percentage  point  per  year  higher  than  the  Tealbook,  largely  reflecting  our  somewhat  higher assumption  for  potential  output  growth  (the  size  of  our  assumed  fiscal  policy  package  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook). We  do  not,  however,  expect  output  to  overshoot  potential  as  much  as  the  Tealbook  does  because  of  our  somewhat different  view  of  labor-market  neutrality. We  assume  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  currently  is  about  4.7 percent  and  that  it  will  trend  down  to  4.5  percent  by  the  end  of  2019  (in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's  constant 5 percent  assumption);  our  trend  for  the  labor  force  participation  rate  is  also  a  bit  higher  than  the  Tealbook's. Despite  our  differences  in  resource  gaps,  our  outlook  for  inflation  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  as  we  feel  our more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  be  successful  at  buoying  inflationary  expectations,  firming  the inflationary  attractor  and  therefore  providing  a  larger  boost  to  actual  inflation.

Respondent 4: Unlike  Tealbook,  my  forecast  does  not  incorporate  a  change  in  the  stance  of  fiscal  policy. Consistently,  my  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2018  and  2019  is  lower  and  my  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  flatter  than  in  Tealbook. My  forecast  for  headline  inflation  in  the  period  from  2017  to  2019  is modestly  above  Tealbook's  forecast,  with  the  difference  narrowing  over  time,  but  my  forecast  for  core  inflation  is essentially  the  same  as  Tealbook's  forecast.

Respondent 5: I continue  to  believe  that,  in  the  absence  of  shocks,  core  inflation  will  trend  higher  this  year and  reach  our  target  next  year. Headline  inflation  may  sag  a  bit  mid-year,  but  should  return  to  almost  2.0%  by year  end.

Respondent 6: I have  not  attempted  to  make  a  precise  assumption  about  future  fiscal  policy  changes  (e.g.  1 percent  of  GDP  increase  in  the  deficit.)

Respondent 7: As  in  the  December  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast andourprojectionsforthekeySEPvariables.  Inpart,thesedifferencesreflectdivergencesinsomeoftheunderlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts.  In  particular,  the  Tealbook  forecast  incorporates  a  substantial  fiscal  stimulus  in the  form  of  a  personal  income  tax  that  commences  in  2018Q1.  As  we  said  in  our  answer  to  4(a),  we  do  not  attempt at  this  time  to  incorporate  changes  in  fiscal  policy  in  our  modal  forecast  as  there  still  is  not  enough  information regarding  their  nature,  magnitude  and  timing.

The  two  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017  are  similar, but  the  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2018  than in  our  outlook,  as  it  did  in  December. Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential  GDP  growth,  which  is below  our  assumption  in  2017-19,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to  a  notably  positive  output  gap  in  2017-19. Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  there  is  at  most  a modestly  positive  output  gap  at  that  time.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption. The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2017  -  19  than  in  our  projection;  this  is  a  long-standing  difference between  the  two  forecasts,  which  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  Tealbook's  fiscal  policy  assumption  that  helps to  boost  the  Tealbook  projection  of  consumption  growth  in  2018. Another  effect  of  the  Tealbook's  fiscal  policy assumption  is  a  higher  projected  saving  rate  in  2018  that  is  above  our  projection.

Another  notable  difference  between  the  projections  is  the  underlying  assumptions  on  the  longer-run  natural rate  of  unemployment: the  Tealbook  assumption  of  5.0%  is  above  our  assumption  of  4.8%. Combined  with  our growth  projections,  we  anticipate  that  unemployment  will  only  modestly  undershoot  its  natural  rate  over  the projection  period;  in  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects  that  unemployment  significantly  undershoots  the  longer-run natural  rate.  This  pattern  is  a  counterpart  of  the  sizable  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: in  our projection  the  participation  rate  declines  only  very  gradually  from  its  current  level  while  in  the  Tealbook  it  declines more  substantially  to  62.3%  at  end-2018. This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  differ  notably  on  the  dynamics  over  the  projection  period.  We  project  inflation to  rise  modestly  above  2  percent  in  2018  -  19  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade  whereas  the Tealbook  projects  core  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  only  in  2019,  despite  a  sizable  undershooting  of  unemployment. The  considerable  persistence  of  inflation  and  flat  Phillips  curve  within  the  Tealbook  framework  appear  to  require a prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  in  order  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation goal.  As  mentioned  previously,  the  overshoot  of  inflation  in  our  projection  occurs  to  prevent  inflation  expectations from  falling  below  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  a  few  differences  between  the  two  projections. On the  real  side,  we  continue  to  see  somewhat  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  in  the  projections  of  real  activity  and unemployment,  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view that  the  unusual  nature  of  the  current  expansion  and  the  atypical  policy  environment  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad keep  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard.  However,  we  see  the  risks  to  real  growth  as  roughly balanced,  in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's  assessment  of  a  downside  skew  to  the  risks.  As  for  inflation,  we  see  higher uncertainty  than  in  the  Tealbook,  but  we  see  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced,  as  does  the  Tealbook.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  somewhat  below  the  Tealbook  path  for  2017-19.  In  addition,  our  assumption  for  the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  50bps  below  that  of  the  Tealbook,  as  we  take  a  somewhat  stronger signal  from  the  still-low  sovereign  yields  and  potential  growth  rate  estimates  across  the  advanced  economies.  Both policy  paths  have  a  mild  overshooting  of  the  longer-run  FFR  in  2019.

Respondent 8: I do  not  assume  enactment  of  any  fiscal  stimulus  package.

ff projects  a  higher  level  for  both  the  unemployment  rate  and  the  federal  funds ff assumes  that  a  more  pronounced  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate Respondent 9: The  Tealbook  implicitly  incorporates  a  faster  rise  in  the  neutral  funds  rate  over  the  next  few years  than  I  do.  In  addition,  the  sta rate  in  the  longer  run.  Finally,  the  sta over  the  next  few  years  will  be  necessary  to  stabilize  inflation  at  2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis,  reflecting  their assumption  that  inflation  expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  a  level  that  is  somewhat  below  2  percent.

Respondent 10: My  forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  except that  I believe  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  keep  the  labor  force  participation  rate  from  falling, minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job  growth  on  the  unemployment  rate.  This  would  lead  to  less  upward movement  for  wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the  path  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. Removing monetary  accommodation  more  gradually,  as  in  my  projection,  would  produce  a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the Tealbook.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  closer  to  the  natural  rate  in  2018  and  2019 compared  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: For  GDP  growth  and  inflation,  our  forecast  is  virtually  identical  to  the  one  in  the  Tealbook. Differences  arise  because  the  Tealbook  incorporates  the  idea  of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the  economy  transitions  toward  the  longer-run  steady state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. The  regime  conception  we  use,  in  contrast,  views monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  hose  regimes  cannot  be  forecasted. This  suggests a  flat  path  for  the  policy  path  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook. The  Tealbook forecast  also  has  an  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  before  returning  to  its  long-run  value.

Respondent 13: My  projected  paths  for  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  over  2017-2019  remain similartothoseintheTealbookbaselineforecast.  However,atthispointIseeroomforaslightlyflatterupwardpath for  the  funds  rate. Also,  I  anticipate  a  more  rapid  return  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  than  is  forecasted  by Board  sta  . In  my  view,  the  longer-term  inflation  expectations  relevant  to  wage  and  price  setting  remain  anchored at  2  percent.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: The  Tealbook's  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  at  5.0  percent,  is  higher than  our  estimate,  which  stands  at  4.7  percent. Therefore,  while  the  two  forecasts  are  qualitatively  similar  on  an unemployment  rate  basis,  the  Tealbook  forecast  implies  a  more  pronounced  overshooting  of  full  employment  than our  forecast.  Our  forecast  is  also  conditioned  on  a  steeper  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 16: Despite  some  differences  in  assumptions,  my  growth  forecast  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook through  2019. My  projection  has  a  higher  long-run  growth  trend  owing  to  a  somewhat  stronger  productivity assumption.  Myforecastfortheunemploymentratedeclinesmoremodestly,owingtoasomewhatslowerprojection for  employment  growth. I have  inflation  remaining  effectively  at  its  longer-term  target  and  I  am  assuming  that inflation  expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  policy-consistent  levels.

Respondent 17: As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace  and  labor  market conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen. I see  somewhat  greater  inflationary  pressures  than  in  the  Tealbook,  with inflation  expected  to  be  near  our  2  percent  longer-term  objective  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  while  Tealbook anticipates  a  more  gradual  return  of  inflation  to  2  percent  in  2019-2020.  As  a  result,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate to  have  a  somewhat  steeper  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  compared  with  the  Tealbook,  which  limits  the  extent  to which  the  unemployment  rate  undershoots  its  longer-run  value  in  my  forecast  compared  to  that  in  the  Tealbook. My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook,  but  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around these  assumptions.
