Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds rate at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  September  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee on  September  16-17,  2015.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: I expect the unemployment  rate  to reach its longer-run sustainable level in the first quarter of 2016, and then fall below  that level. In 2017, with the labor market  tight and the restraining  eff ects  of  oil-price  declines  and  a  stronger  dollar  having  waned,  I  expect  inflation  to  reach our 2 percent longer-run objective and then, in 2018, to rise above that objective. In the absence of new  shocks, the unemployment  rate  eventually  converges  to  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  from below, and the inflation rate converges  to 2 percent from above. Full convergence  is likely to take 5-to-6  years.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: All measures  converge  in  six or fewer years. GDP  growth  will  converge  in  2018, inflation will converge in 2017, and unemployment  will converge in 2020. Prior to convergence, I expect  the unemployment  rate  to  decline  further  below  its  long-run  value  of  5.8%  and  the  inflation measures  to  slightly  overshoot  2.0%.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: We  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  its  longer-run  level  by  mid-2016, and  that it will remain  near  that  level over the rest of the forecast horizon. However,  our  scenario analysis  of  labor  flows  as  well  as  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions indicates  that  there  is  a  notable  probability  of  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  our  point  estimate of its longer-run  normal  level  during  some  period  of  the  forecast  horizon.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  (2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI,  based on  the  longer-term  average  of  the  diff erence  between  CPI  and  PCE  inflation). Under  these  conditions and  with the resource  gap anticipated  to dissipate over the forecast horizon, we expect  inflation as measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  (on  a  quarterly  basis)  to  be  about  2%  by  late  2017.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  at  the  end  of  2017. Accordingly, all of the  major  economic  projections  for  2018  are  at  their  longer-run  values.

Respondent 7: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projections  in  about three  years.

Respondent 13: I think  that  unemployment  and  inflation  will  reach  mandate  consistent  levels  in 2016  and  2017,  respectively. Unemployment  will  then  dip  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  for  3 or 4 years. The  FFER  will  take  about  3  - 4  years  to  converge  to  its  long  run  level.

Respondent 14: Convergence  to  full  employment  is  expected  to  occur  by  the  end  of  2016. Convergence  to  the  inflation  target  is  projected  to  follow  later  in  2018,  as  inflation  expectations  gradually revert  back  to  2  percent.

Respondent 15: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  takes  less than 5 years. Specifically, I expect real GDP  growth  to  slow  to its longer-run rate after 2018 and inflation to rise to close to 2 percent in 2016. The  unemployment  rate  reaches  my  estimate  of its longer-run  level in the fourth quarter  of 2015, and  I expect  it will fall below  its longer-run  level in 2016,  2017,  and  2018,  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

I lowered  my  estimate  of the longer-run  unemployment  rate  to  5.0  percent  from  5.2 percent, in light of the rapid  declines  in the unemployment  rate  since  the  last  recession,  and  reflecting  my  view that  a  large  share  of  workers  who  left  the  labor  force  in  the  aftermath  of  the  recession  are  unlikely  to return  even  when  labor  markets  tighten  further.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: In my  projection, although  inflation is back to 2 percent  by 2018, that pace of convergence  depends  in  part  on  the  unemployment  rate  running  modestly  below  my  estimate  of  its longer-run  sustainable  level  over  the  next  three  years;  in  addition,  I  expect  that  the  federal  funds  rate will still be a bit below  its longer-run  normal  level  at  the  end  of  2018. As  a result, I anticipate  that it will take  about  six  years  or  so  for  the  economy  to  return  to  full  equilibrium.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: I'm  more  uncertain  about  productivity  growth  than  I  was  in  the  past,  which  is  why I show  uncertainty  about  GDP  growth  as  greater.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Quantitative  judgment  based  on the width of the probability intervals from the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. The  widths  of  these  intervals  have  narrowed  modestly  at  shorter-term horizons  since the September  SEP,  as  the  recent  data  largely  have  been  consistent  with  our  central forecast and  financial market  volatility has subsided. The  probability  intervals for the real activity forecasts  still remain  wider  than  the  SEP  standard,  as  was  the  case  in  September;  beyond  the  more recent  developments,  the  extraordinary  economic  and  financial  environment,  including  the  prospective policy  divergence  across  advanced  economies,  point  to  significant  uncertainty  about  the  real  activity outlook. The  forecast  intervals for core PCE  inflation  still appear  broadly  consistent  with  the  SEP standard,  taking  rough  account  of  the  diff erences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation and  core  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: I also judge the uncertainty surrounding inflation as 'higher.' This is due to recent  disparate  readings  of  underlying  PCE  inflation  coming  from  various  measures  and  uncertainty regarding  how  inflation  expectations  are  reacting  to  a  prolonged  period  of  below-target  core  inflation readings,  especially  in  light  of  inflation  compensation  measures  that  remain  near  cyclical  lows.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Persistently  low  inflation  may  have  had  an  adverse  eff ect  on  inflation  expectations. If so, raising  inflation  back  to  its  target  level  may  prove  harder  than  anticipated.

Respondent 11:

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is similar to its average level  over  the  past  20  years. Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at the  FOMC's  stated  goal  of  2  percent. Inflation  expectations  have  been  well  anchored  for  the  past  two decades,  so  I  see  the  magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  outlook  as  broadly  similar  to past  levels.

Respondent 4: Although  there  are  good  reasons  to expect  the eff ects of dollar appreciation  and commodity  price  declines  on  PCE  inflation  to  wane  over  time  (my  baseline  projection),  there  are  also risks  of a renewed  bout  of  currency  appreciation  and  commodity  price  declines.

In addition,  the  recent  edging  down  in  some  survey-based  measures  of  longer-run  inflation  expectations and  the continued  low  level of market-based  expectations  introduce  some  risk  that  inflation expectations  could  drift  lower.

Finally,  the  weakness  and  fragility  in  foreign  activity,  combined  with  the  economy's  proximity  to the  zero  lower  bound,  make  downside  risks  to  economic  activity  particularly  prominent.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  diff erence  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Despite  some  stabilization  of  domestic  and foreign  financial  markets  as  well  as  in  the  foreign  economic  outlook  since  September,  we  see  the  risks to real activity  and  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  downside. Although  the  near-term  inflation  risks  are fairly balanced,  the  decline in market-based  inflation  compensation  to  near  historical  lows, declines in some  survey  measures  of  household  inflation  expectations,  the  general  decline  in  commodity  and import  prices,  and  continued  low  levels  in  various  measures  of  underlying  inflation  (including  our  signal component  [SiCo]  measure  of  PCE  inflation)  indicate  significant  downside  risks  in  the  medium  term. The  downside  risk  assessment  for  real  activity  also  reflects  some  of  the  factors  discussed  in  the  inflation risk assessment. In addition, even though  the immediate  outlook  in  a number  of emerging  market economies,  most  prominently  China,  has  stabilized  somewhat,  we  still  see  a  number  of  latent  risks  in the  EMEs  that  could  weigh  on  U.S.  real  activity  more  than  anticipated  in  the  modal  forecast. Other downside  risks  include  the  continuing  constraints  that  monetary  policy  faces  at  or  near  the  eff ective lower bound in a number  of major economies. One countervailing factor that limits the amount of downside  risk we have in our outlook  is the possibility that the economy  has  greater  underlying strength  than  anticipated  in our projection, which  is consistent  with  the continued  improvement  in labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 7: I have  made  only  minor  adjustments  to  my  outlook  since  September. I continue  to view  the  risks  to  my  projections  as  broadly  balanced.

There  has been sustained improvement  in  labor  market  conditions, and there are nascent signs of increased pressure in labor compensation. Low  gasoline prices are also a positive for household spending. The  combination  of  these  factors  alongside  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy  could mean faster spending growth than I've incorporated into my growth outlook. On the downside, softness  in  energy  and  other  commodity  prices  and  the  rising  dollar  could  weigh  more  heavily  on  the energy  sector and other parts of the industrial sector exposed  to the dollar and commodity  prices, posing  a  downside  risk  to  my  growth  projection.

Inflation  risks  are  balanced. The  most  recent  declines  in  oil  and  gasoline  prices  and  the  strengthening  of the dollar will weigh  on  inflation  measures  in  the  near-term. However,  the  pace  of  declines in oil prices and  appreciation  of  the  dollar  will likely be less than  those  seen  last year. Should  that not be the case -e.g., if divergence  of  monetary  policy  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  results  in  a  stronger appreciation  of  the  dollar  -  this  would  be  a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  projection. I view  inflation expectations  as  being  relatively  stable  despite  some  recent  small  moves. Should  inflation  expectations show  a  more  significant  downward  move,  this  would  pose  a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  projection. On  the other hand, too slow a withdrawal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  has  the  potential  to create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium  run.

Risks  to financial stability from  zero  interest  rates appear  to  be  contained  and  I  expect  them  to remain  so  as we  gradually  normalize  interest  rates. Despite  the  fact that market  participants  put  a high  probability  on  the  FOMC  raising  interest  rates  at  the  December  meeting,  I  would  expect  some volatility  in  financial  markets  but  it  should  not  be  significant  enough  to  materially  change  the  outlook.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: We think the risks to our GDP  and unemployment  rate forecasts are roughly balanced. On  the  downside,  the  somewhat  softer  tone  of  the  incoming  spending  data  suggests  that weak  global demand  and  the  appreciation  in the dollar may  be exerting greater headwinds  on  the U.S.  economy  than  we  have  assumed. On  the  upside,  further  improvements  in  the  labor  market,  some signs that wage  growth  may  be  picking  up, and  continued  low  energy  prices  could lead to stronger household  spending  than  we  are  expecting.

We  think  the  risks  to  our  projections  for  both  total  and  core  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside. While  we  still believe  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  eventually  prevail  and  put  inflation  on  a gradual uptrend, we have yet to see any evidence of a pick-up in core inflation and there is a risk that  the pull from  our  appropriate  policy  path  could  be  weaker  than  we  have  assumed. The  further decline  in oil prices, persistently  low  inflation  breakevens,  and  the  slight  softening  in  some  measures of inflation  expectations  highlight  other  downside  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 10: The  zero  lower  bound  makes  it  difficult  if  not  impossible  to  respond  to  negative shocks  to  the  economy.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  at  a  more  rapid  rate  than  expected  given  relatively  modest  real  GDP  growth. In addition,  projections  for  the  path  of  the  labor  force  participation rate remain  highly  uncertain. This  raises the risk that the unemployment  rate  may  undershoot  my estimate  of  its  longer-run  average. Inflation  expectations  appear  to  moving  down  slightly,  which  rases the  risk  of a timely  return  to  our  target.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Risks to economic  activity appear broadly balanced. GDP  over  the past year has grown faster than potential, and we are very close to our objective of maximum  sustainable employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures. Fiscal  policy  developments,  such  as  the recent  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  and  the  5-year  highway  funding  act,  also  have  reduced  uncertainty  and provided  a  fillip  to  growth. On  the  other  side,  while  many  economic  headwinds  and  risks  have  abated, some  significant  ones  remain. In particular,  foreign  growth  continues  to  be  weak  and  the  dollar  has appreciated  a  bit  further.

The  zero lower bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no longer appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light of the apparent eff ectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs  and  greater  potential  scope  for  negative  interest  rates  if necessary.

Inflation risks are also balanced. Although  disinflationary pressures from abroad continue, the labor market continues to strengthen and is close to full employment, increasing the likelihood of wage  pressures  mounting  and  feeding  through  to  higher  inflation.

Respondent 17: Given  that  the  risks  to  US  growth  from  global  conditions  appear  to  have  diminished  over  the  past  several  months,  and  given  further  improvements  in  the  labor  market,  I  now  view the  risks  to the  outlook  for  both  real  activity  and  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Despite a variety of headwinds, many  of which are related to weakness in the overseas  economic  outlook,  U.S.  monetary  policy  remains  sufficiently  accommodative  to  support  job growth  that  is  well  above  trend. A  transition  to  a  less  accommodative  policy  stance  is  appropriate.

Looking  ahead, policy will have to be nimble: The  near-term  neutral  policy rate is sensitive to overseas developments,  and  with  interest rates starting at a low base and with minimal  remaining resource slack, there is little margin  for error on either side. A good measure  of vigilance will be needed  if  we  are  to  successfully  negotiate  the  passage  between  the  Scylla  of  excess  ease  and  Charybdis of excess  restraint. The  main  danger  from  excess  restraint  is  that  we  fall  back  against  the  ELB.  The main  danger  from  excess  ease  is  that  business  people  and  investors  make  unwise  decisions  that  cannot easily be unwound  when  accommodation  is  eventually withdrawn. The resultant dislocations and financial  strains  reduce  the  chances  for  a  smooth  transition  to  sustainable  growth.

I've assumed  a  cautious  initial  series  of  funds-rate  increases,  reflecting  what  I  think  is  likely  to  be a gradual  easing  of headwinds  and  a  desire  to  give  the private  sector a chance  to  adjust  to positive rates  after 7 years  at the zero  bound. The  pace  of  rate  increases  picks  up  in  2017  as  the  Committee seeks  to  limit  overshoot  of  its  employment  and  inflation  objectives. I've  shifted  slightly  downward  my estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate-previously  between  3.5  and  3.75  percent-to  3.5  percent.

Respondent 2: We  are  still  in  the  process  of  exiting  the  GFC  and  do  not  want  to  create  excessively large  changes  in  asset  prices  that  may  create  excessive  financial  market  volatility.

Respondent 3: I have  altered  my  path  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. Rather than  increasing  the federal funds  rate 200 basis points in the first year after lift-off (i.e., 2016)  and 100  basis  points  in  the  second  year  (i.e.,  2017),  I  have  reversed  the  increases  so  that  the  federal  funds rate  increases  100  basis  points  in  2016  and  and  200  basis  points  in  2017. My  2016  federal  funds  rate  is similar  to  that  of  the  Tealbook. With  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  long-run  rate,  the  more  rapid increase  in  2017  is  necessary  to  prevent  a  substantial  overshooting  of  the  2%  inflation  target.

Respondent 4: Although  we  have  seen  continued  improvement  in  U-3  unemployment  and  continued moderate  growth  in  domestic  demand,  weak  foreign  demand,  and  the  associated  appreciation  of  the dollar,  continue  to  weigh  on  net  exports  and  import  prices. Moreover,  weak  and  fragile  foreign  demand,

together  with the economy's  proximity  to  the  zero lower bound,  and  the  persistence  of lower-thandesired  inflation,  skew  the  risks  to  activity  and  inflation  to  the  downside. As  a  result,  risk  management considerations  argue  for  a  very  gradual  normalization  in  monetary  policy.

In addition, low potential output  growth, high risk premiums  for  capital investment, and weak foreign demand  suggest that the neutral rate is low and will remain considerably below historical norms  for  some  time. As  a  result,  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  will  also  remain  quite low,  relative  to  historical  norms,  throughout  the  medium  term.

Respondent 5: A  case  for  raising  rates  at  the  current  meeting  can  be  made  based  on  the  continued moderate  growth  in  GDP,  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  expectation  that  transitory  factors  that are  holding  inflation  down  will  diminish  over  time. There  are,  however,  factors  arguing  against  a  funds rate  increase  at  the  present  meeting,  including  the  fact  that  the  presumptively  transitory  factors  of  low energy  prices  and  a  stronger  dollar  look  set  to  persist  longer  than  may  have  been  generally  expected  at the  time  of  the  last  SEP,  that  there  is  still  no  movement  of  core  inflation  back  towards  the  Committee's stated  target,  and  that  at  this  time  the  Committee  has  fewer  tools  to  deal  with  unexpected  weakness in the  economy  than  with  unexpected  strength.

Respondent 6: The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path  for monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communicate clearly to the public  that  these  factors  will dictate  the  path  of the policy  stance. The  developments along  these  dimensions  since  the  September  SEP  were  such  that  we  now  assess  as  appropriate  a  slower pace  of  normalization  after  liftoff  than  in  our  September  submission.

In regard to liftoff , we still judge that the December  FOMC  meeting  is  the  appropriate  timing. Foreign conditions, both in terms of global asset prices as well as global economic  activity, appear to have stabilized somewhat. The October  and November  labor  market  reports indicate sufficient improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  over  the  course  of  the  year  as  well  as prospects  for further improvement.  Even  though  inflation  remains  well  below  the  longer-run  goal,  the  strengthening  of  the labor  market  and  indications  of  faster  compensation  growth  are  just  sufficient  to  meet  the  'reasonable confidence'  criterion. Given  these  developments  and  the  signals  that  FOMC  participants  have  given, a decision  to  not  lift-off  likely  would  be  very  costly,  both  in  terms  of  the  financial  market  reaction  as well  as the  impact  on  FOMC  credibility.

As for the pace of normalization after liftoff , it will depend upon our assessment of economic conditions  and  the  outlook, longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  the  response  of  overall  financial conditions to policy tightening. Currently, the still-low levels of inflation and longer-term  inflation compensation,  the  continued  significant  uncertainty  surrounding  both  the  real  activity  and  inflation outlooks, the downside risks to those outlooks, and the still-low projected path of the short-term neutral  rate (r*) all point  to a more  gradual  pace  during  normalization  than  was  our  assessment  in September.  Therefore,  our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the end  of  2016,  2017,  and  2018  at 3 4 / - 1%,  1 3 4 / - 2%,  and  2 3 4 / - 3%  respectively;  these  projected  ranges are 25 -50bps  below  the  corresponding  ranges  in  our  September  submission. We  thus  do  not  expect that  the  FFR  will  reach  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  until  after  2018. We  believe  that this  gradual  path  is  necessary  to  provide  insurance  against  the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced  by the  U.S.  economy  (including  those  stemming  from  global  economic  and  financial  developments)  and  to address  the  uncertainty  about  the  equilibrium  real  FFR.  Our  modal  forecast  has  the  unemployment rate falling to our 4 3 4 / % estimate of the longer-run normal  rate by mid-2016, although  there is a sizable  probability  that  it  could  fall  further  below  the  longer-run  rate,  which  would  provide  additional insurance  against  the  risk  of  being  caught  in  a  low  inflation  trap.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate, which  we  maintain  in  the  range  of 1 2 / -3%  that  we

had  in  September: this  range  is  modestly  below  our  assessment  of  1%  - 3%  for 'normal  times.'  Adding the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2.5 - 5.0%. We  assess  that  the  equilibrium  rate  is  more  likely  to  be  further  in  the  lower  half  of  the  latter range, leading to our point estimate  of 3 1 4 / %, as seen in the response  to question  3(a). Estimates of the equilibrium  rate  using DSGE  models  and  the  Laubach-Williams  model  also  suggest  that  the equilibrium  rate  remains  low.

We would also note that we assume that reinvestment continues until economic and financial conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the  zero  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of a reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to occur  sometime  in  2017.

Respondent 7: I project growth  returning  to an above  trend  pace next year. The  labor market has already  made  a  great  deal  of progress  toward  our  goal  of  full employment,  and  I  expect  further gains  going  forward  in  terms  of  employment  growth  and  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate. Measures  of  underemployment  have  improved  significantly  since  the  end  of  the  recession. In  my  view, the economy is at or nearly at full employment, broadly defined-indeed, the current level of the unemployment  rate  is  about  a  quarter  of  a  percentage  point  below  my  point  estimate  of  its  longer-run level. In  this  scenario,  labor  compensation  measures  will  eventually  firm,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports of increasing wage  pressures. Over  time, I expect  the eff ects on inflation of previous  and the most recent  declines  in  oil  prices  and  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  to  fade. Stable  inflation  expectations, solid labor market  readings, and my  forecast of above-trend  growth  make  me  reasonably  confident that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  medium  run. In  my  projection,  I  expect this to occur  in 2017,  a bit later than  in my  September  projection,  reflecting  the  further  drop  in  oil prices  and  dollar  appreciation  that  have  occurred  since  that  time.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should reflect both actual and projected progress toward the Committee's  goals. The economy  is already  at  or close to full employment,  and  I  anticipate  inflation  to  reach  the  Committee's  goal  of  2 percent  in  2017. In  my  view,  this  combination  of  factors  suggests  that  it  is  appropriate  to  increase  the fed  funds  rate  at  this  meeting. Based  on  my  current  economic  outlook  and  risks  around  that  outlook, I believe it will be appropriate  for the federal funds  rate to move  up  over  the forecast horizon  at a gradual  pace,  not  reaching  its longer-run  level, which  I project  to be 3.5 percent,  until sometime  in 2018. However,  the  policy  path  will  be  adjusted  to  reflect  changes  in  the  economic  outlook  over  the forecast  horizon.

The  funds  rate path in my  projection  is somewhat  less  gradual  than  the path in the Tealbook, partly  reflecting  the  fact  that  my  longer-run  fed  funds  rate  is 1 4 / percentage  point  higher  and  partly reflecting  the  somewhat  stronger  growth  and  somewhat  faster  return  of  inflation  to  our  2  percent  goal.

Respondent 8: My  outlook  has  liftoff  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015  (to  a range  of  25-50  basis  points),  followed  by  what  averages  out  to  be  25  basis  point  increases  at  every  other meeting  through  2018. This  trajectory  is  consistent  with  a  gradual  rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium rate  (r*)  as  some  transitory  headwinds  dissipate,  along  with  a  closing  of  the  resource  gap  and  a  path for inflation  that  gradually  returns  to  2.0  percent.

However,  I  also  lowered  my  projection  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to 3.5%  after  digesting  the  material  presented  at  the  October  meeting.

ffer Respondent 9: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  lifting  off  at  this  FOMC meeting  and  then  increasing  25  bps  two  times  in  2016. We  believe  such  a  gradual  path  is  necessary to support  a  return  of  inflation  to  target  and  to  provide  some  extra  boost  to  aggregate  demand  as  a risk  management  bu against  future  downside  shocks. In the  absence  of  such  shocks,  we  think  that by  late  next  year  core  inflation  will  finally  be  making  some  visible  progress  rising  towards  target  and

that  real  economic  activity  will  have  continued  to  grow  moderately  above  trend. These  developments should  give  us  more  confidence  that  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  is  moving  up  as  well. Accordingly, we  think  it  will  be  appropriate  to  increase  the  pace  of  rate  increases  to  about  100  bps  per  year  in  2017 and  2018,  leaving  the  funds  rate  at  3  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

Unconstrained, we would have assumed  liftoff in mid-2016, as we currently don't have enough confidence that inflation is beginning to move  back towards target and don't expect to have such confidence before then. However, given the prevailing sentiment on the Committee, we built in a December  liftoff  in  order  to base  our forecast  on a more  realistic  monetary  policy  assumption. Furthermore,  given  the  strong  communications  from  FOMC  participants  that  improvements  in  economic activity  and  labor  markets  appeared  to  justify  an  increase  in  the  funds  rate  at  this  meeting,  waiting longer to begin raising rates would involve credibility risk to the Committee. Taking such a risk does  not  seem  warranted  as  long  as  we  also  assume  that  the  FOMC  statement  adequately  describes  a sufficiently  shallow  expected  path  for  the  funds  rate  so  that  the  economic  implications  of  the  earlier move  are  minimal. We  feel the current  language  in  the  December  Tealbook's  Alternative  B  satisfies this requirement.

Respondent 10: The labor market, as measured by the unemployment  rate, is nearly back to normal, but inflation remains well below its target. In addition, the neutral federal funds rate is expected  to  rise  from  its  currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several  years. As  a result,  it would  be  appropriate  for  interest  rates  to  rise  gradually.

Respondent 11: I believe  that  we  should  raise  the  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  this  meeting, and  that it would  be  appropriate  to  begin  reducing  the size of the balance  sheet very soon. Labor markets  have  tightened  significantly,  which  puts  the  unemployment  rate  at  its  longer-run  normal  level. Inflation is likely to move  toward  the FOMC's  2  percent  objective next year. Consumer  spending growth  has  risen  to  3  percent,  which  suggests  the  need  for  higher  real  rates. Private  fixed  investment is growing. Further  delay  would  depart  from  our  beneficial  past  behavior.

Respondent 12: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  reflects  my  view that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than  has  been  typical  in  past  liftoff  scenarios  given low  productivity  growth  and  inflation  that  has  been  running  below  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 13: My  forecast  is  for  liftoff  at  this  meeting,  three  additional  25  bp  increases  in  2016, three increases  in 2017, and  four increases  in 2018. I assume  that  growth  in  2016  will  be  2.0%, not 2.5%. I think  that  this lower  path  of rate increases  will be needed  to  support  US  economic  activity through  an  extended  period  of  slow  global  growth.

I believe that it will be necessary  to raise rates gradually  in order to support  the  economy,  and that  rates  will  remain  below  their  longer  run  normal  levels  for  some  time.

Respondent 14: The  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  features  a  gradual  removal  of  policy accommodation,  as  the  headwinds  to  the  recovery  gradually  abate. This  path  keeps  the  economy  close to full employment,  and  allows  inflation  to  return  to  2  percent  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 15: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment rate to be below its longer-run level and inflation close to two percent in 2016. Yet I view the appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2016  and 2017.

The  economy  has  faced  a number  of  headwinds  after  the last recession, such as deleveraging  in the household  sector, underwater  homeowners,  a  period  of  contractionary  fiscal  policy, temporarily

low productivity  growth,  and  periodic  bouts  of  uncertainty  related  to  global  economic  and  financial conditions. The  eff ect  of  such  headwinds  has  been  apparent  as  the  near-zero  level  of  the  federal  funds rate  has  produced  only  a  moderate  economic  recovery. I anticipate  that  these  headwinds  will  dissipate slowly  and  so  continue  to  restrain  economic  activity  in  2016  and  2017. Therefore,  I  anticipate  that  a federal  funds  rate  below  its  longer-run  level  will  be  appropriate  for  the  next  two  years.

Respondent 16: The  conditions  that  warrant  an  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  from  the  zero lower  bound  are  being  within  sight  of  full  employment  and  being  reasonably  confident  that  inflation will return  to  our  2  percent  objective  in  the  next  few  years.

These  conditions  have  now  been  met. The  labor  market  is  at  or  very  near  full  employment  and  I expect  any  residual  labor  market  slack  to  dissipate  by  early  2016. On  inflation,  transitory  factors  are significantly  damping  current  inflation  readings. I expect  inflation  to gradually  rise  and  reach  our  2 percent  objective  by  2018  as  the  economy  continues  to  improve  and  transitory  eff ects  from  the  dollar appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices  dissipate. My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following liftoff , my  fed funds path through the end of 2016 remains flatter than some simple rules  would  suggest. My  view  is  based  on  the  following: The  economy  continues  to  face  headwinds  in 2016,  including  constraints  on  credit  availability  for  some  borrowers,  weak  growth  abroad,  and  recent appreciation  of  the  dollar. These  continue  to  depress  the  shorter-term  equilibrium  real  interest  rate relative  to  its long-run  value.

Respondent 17: I judge that, after an increase in the target range of the federal funds rate at the  current  meeting,  monetary  policy  will  remain  accommodative. As  a result,  the  labor  market  will improve  further,  thereby  speeding  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation. Over  the  medium  term,  however, I expect  that  economic  conditions  will  evolve  in  a  manner  that  will  call  for  a  gradual  rise  in  the  federal funds  rate. In particular,  I  anticipate  that  a  modest  pickup  in  trend  productivity  growth,  somewhat easier  fiscal policy, further  recovery  of  the  housing  market,  stabilization  of  the  dollar,  and  somewhat faster foreign economic  growth  will, on net, cause the economy's  equilibrium  real rate to rise over time. In addition,  as trend  inflation  gradually  moves  back  to  2  percent,  the  nominal  funds  rate  will need  to  rise  in tandem  to  prevent  the  eff ective  stance  of  policy  from  inadvertently  easing.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Although  sharp  changes  in  the  relative  price  of  traded  goods  (related  to  weakness in the  overseas  outlook)  and  in  the  price  of  oil  (partly  supply  driven  and  partly  demand  driven),  have created  challenges  for  some  sectors  of  the  U.S.  economy,  these  challenges  have  so  far  not  substantially altered  the  trajectories  of  aggregate  output  and  employment. Risks  to  the  modal  outlook  are  significant on both sides: Headwinds  could  lift more  rapidly than currently seems likely, resulting in a sharp acceleration  in  the  pace  of  the  expansion;  or  financial  strains  in  the  emerging-market  economies  and in the  energy  industry  (and  among  energy-industry  lenders)  could  take  a  turn  for  the  worse. Secular influences  on  the  outlook  include  demographic  changes  in  the  U.S.  and  around  the  world,  and  potential deleveraging.

Asset valuations are historically high (as measured  by  U.S. market  cap divided by U.S. GDP), and  investors  are  somewhat  uncertain  about  the  path  of  the  economy  as  well  as  the  ultimate  path  of Fed  policy. Some  amount  of  financial-market  volatility  is  to  be  expected  in  these  circumstances,  and some  amount  of  revaluation  may  even  be  healthy  for  markets. I would  suggest  that  policy  makers  not overreact  to  (or  over-read)  these  market  movements.

Respondent 2: The  key  factor  is  uncertainty  as  we  are  embarking  on  the  use  of  a  new  interest  rate control mechanism,  and  with  a  population  that  is  probably  still  shell-shocked  by  the  experiences  of the  last 7 years.

Respondent 3: The  absence  of  robust  growth  in  conjuction  with  declining  unemployment  during this  recovery  are  the  key  factors  shaping  my  outlook. Changes  in  oil  and  commodity  prices  have  made inflation  forecasting  especially  challenging.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: My  baseline  expectations  have  not  changed  significantly  over  the  course  of  the  last few  SEPs  -  modestly  above  trend  growth  supported  by  continued  recovery  of  the  labor  market  (though still not  of  wages)  and  generally  improved  household  balance  sheets. Global  developments  continue  to pose  only  very  limited  upside  risks,  but  still  significant  downside  risks  (though  somewhat  less  dramatic than  seemed  possible  in  September  following  the  Chinese  financial  turbulence  of  the  late  summer).

Respondent 6: From  2.1%  (Q4/Q4)  in 2015, we expect growth to pick up modestly  to around 2 1 4 / %  in 2016. The  firming in growth  reflects an end of the current inventory  correction by early 2016, continued solid growth  of consumer  spending, some  firming in residential and business fixed investment, and somewhat  stronger  growth  of federal spending in 2016 due to the recently signed budget  agreement. These  positive  developments  are  off set  to  a large extent  by  continued  drag  from net exports. By  2017  we  expect  growth  to  slow  to just below  2%  due  to  a combination  of  aging  of the business  cycle and  gradual  tightening  of financial conditions  generated  by  our  assumed  upward path for the FFR.  The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  decline  to 4.7%  by the end of 2016 and then level out at 4.8%-our  estimate  of  the longer-run  normal  rate-through  2018. This path of the unemployment  rate  assumes  that  the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  move  gradually  higher  from  the recent  62.5%  to  just  shy  of  62.7%,  while  productivity  growth  reverts  to  its  longer-run  trend. Inflation moves  gradually  up  close to 2%  by the end of 2017 as slack continues  to decline and the eff ects of dollar  appreciation  fade. The  broad  parameters  of  this  forecast  are  in  line  with  the  September  SEP.

There  are  several  critical  assumptions  underlying  this  projection. Domestically,  we  expect  lending standards to gradually ease, allowing for more growth in the credit sensitive sectors, particularly residential investment. The assumed  level of the exchange  value of the dollar is somewhat  higher in this projection, though  we  continue  to expect it to change  little from end-2015  to end-2017. In addition,  foreign  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  gradually  improve  in  2016  and  2017. Based  on  futures markets,  we  anticipate  a  gradual  uptrend  of  energy  prices  over  the  course  of  2016  and  2017. Finally, fiscal  policy  was  already  expected  to  move  to  a  modestly  stimulative  stance  in  2016  after  several  years of restraint. With  the  passage  of  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  of  2015,  we  expect  fiscal  policy  to  provide a modest  boost  to  growth  in  FY2016.

Real  consumer  spending  is  expected  to  grow  around  2 1 2 / %  (Q4/Q4)  in  2016,  down  from  around 2 3 4 / % in 2015. Three  factors underlie this projection. First, we anticipate that the boost to real disposable  income  from  lower  energy  prices  will  wane. Second,  under  our  assumption  for  productivity growth, real disposable  income  growth  will  slow  in 2016. Third, the consumer  durable  goods  cycle is aging; we think it is very unlikely that light vehicle sales will continue  to increase at the pace of the past four quarters. For 2017, we expect consumer  spending  to slow to around 2 1 4 / % as real disposable  income  growth  slows  further. This  consumer  spending  path  will  require  some  decline  in  the personal  saving  rate  to  around  4 1 4 / %  by  end-2017. We  view  the  current  restrained  supply  of  credit to consumers  to  be  an  important  factor  behind  the  currently  elevated  saving  rate.

While  consumer  spending  slows, we expect the growth  contribution  from  residential investment to move  somewhat  higher  in  2016,  reflecting  evidence  of  greater  tightness  in  housing  markets  that  is pushing  rents  and  home  prices  higher. Supporting  housing  starts  is the recent increase in the pace of household  formations,  which  is  likely  to  move  higher  given  the  ongoing  improvement  in  the  labor market,  and  the  anticipated  easing  in  mortgage  underwriting  standards. By  2017,  however,  the  growth contribution  from  residential  investment  will  decline  somewhat  as  the  ongoing  tightening  of  monetary policy  begins  to  push  long-term  interest  rates  higher.

Given our assumptions  for the exchange value of the dollar and for foreign growth, we expect exports  to begin  growing  again  by  2016Q2. Along  with  the  end  of the current  inventory  cycle, this development  is expected  to result in a gradual improvement  in  manufacturing  output  and  a  rising capacity utilization rate. The  rising capacity utilization rate should in turn increase incentives for business  investment  in  new  capacity.

However, the net export growth contribution in 2016 is projected to be -1.0 percentage points versus  the  -0.6  percentage  points  of  2015. Growth  of  real  imports  is  expected  to  increase  from  around 3 1 2 / %  in  2015  to  around  7%  in  2016. Import  growth  this  year  has  been  weaker  than  expected  despite the  appreciation  of  the  dollar,  possibly  reflecting  the  relatively  elevated  level  of  domestic  inventories. For  2017  we  project  the  net  export  growth  contribution  to  improve  to  -0.5  percentage  points  as  export growth  strengthens  while  import  growth  slows.

The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  stabilize  near  our  estimate  of  the  longer-term  normal  rate of 4 3 4 / %  from  mid-2016  through  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon. Monthly  gains  in  nonfarm  payroll employment  are  expected  to  slow  to  around  175,000  in  2016  and  then  to  130,000  in  2017.

Respondent 7: The fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including highly accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  sustained  strengthening  in  labor  markets,  and  lower  oil  prices. Reinforcing  the  data,  business contacts  report  some  tightening  in labor markets  and  some  increased  wage  pressures. While  global growth  prospects  remain  subdued,  a  number  of  foreign  central  banks  have  added  accommodation  to promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad. Overall,  I  see  these  forces  contributing  to above-trend  growth  and  some  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. By  the end  of 2018, I project that  the  economy  will  essentially  be  at  its  steady  state.

Inflation  rates  remain  subdued,  as  oil  and  commodity  price  declines  weigh  on  headline  PCE  inflation  and  the  pass-through  of  lower  commodity  prices  and  import  prices  weighs  on  core  PCE  inflation.

I expect  that  the  recent  declines  in oil prices and  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  will have  a transitory  eff ect  on  inflation  measures. In my  judgment,  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored. Anchored inflation  expectations  along  with  an  improving  economy  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to the  2  percent  longer-run  objective  in  2017. As  the  expansion  continues  and  labor  markets  continue  to improve,  I  expect  wage  growth  will  pick  up  as  well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 8: My  outlook  consists  of  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  several  quarters,  a  further reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  gradually  converges  to  target.

Growth  over the medium  term  is primarily driven by a sustained pace of consumption  growth and  a  strengthening  in  investment  growth. This  growth  of  domestic  demand  is  supported  by  ongoing continued  firming  in  the  labor  market  and  of  household  incomes. The  decline  in  energy  prices  provide a modest  boost  to  near-term  consumption  growth. While  lower  oil prices negatively  impact  energyrelated investment in the near-term, conditions remain supportive of capital investment in other sectors. The  level of the dollar and  weakness  from  abroad  are  moderate  headwinds  in  my  outlook, further  slowing  export  growth  and  providing  some  restraint  to  domestic  industrial  activity.

The risks to my growth outlook are balanced. Further dollar appreciation and weaker global conditions  threaten  to  significantly  restrain  export  growth  and  domestic  industrial  activity,  with  some potential  for spill over onto  the broader  domestic  economy. On  the  other  hand,  domestic  indicators have proved  resilient in the face of these headwinds  that, once they diminish, could reveal a much more  rapid  pace  of  growth  than  I  currently  assume.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  remain  tilted  to  the  downside. The  eff ects  of  declining  commodity prices and  a stronger  dollar could  prove  to be more  of a drag  on inflation than  I have  built into by baseline outlook. This could be especially troublesome if inflation expectations un-anchor to the downside  as  a  result  of  the  prolonged  period  of  below  target  inflation.

Respondent 9: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  improved  household  and business  balance  sheets,  and  continued  low  energy  prices  should  allow  for  solid  consumer-led  growth in domestic  demand. We  assume  little change  in the dollar going forward, and  so project that the drag from  net exports  will wane  later in the projection  period. The  recent  budget  deal  also means aggregate  demand  will  be  getting  a  small  boost  from  fiscal  policy.

The  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over the next  2-1/2  years. We  assume  that  resource  gaps  will  be  close  to  zero  by  late  2017; although  we project the unemployment  rate  will  reach  our estimate  of the natural rate (4.9 percent) next year, we think it will take longer to close the gap between actual and trend labor force participation. Correspondingly,  we  are  projecting  only  a  slight  overshooting  of  potential  output  by  the  end  of the projection  period.

Changes  in  resource  slack, the assumed  stabilization  of the dollar, and some  upward  movement in energy  prices  all work  to  raise inflation. Furthermore,  as  noted  above,  we  assume  a  quite  shallow path  for policy normalization  and  that  the  Committee  strongly  communicates  its  (state-dependent) expectation  that  rates  will follow such a path. This  and  other  FOMC  communication  should  make clear  the  Committee's  strong  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target,  and  thus  solidify the upward  pull  on  actual  inflation  from  inflationary  expectations. Without  this  pull,  we  would  not expect  inflation  to  rise  close  to  target  over  the  forecast  period.

We  recognize significant uncertainty about how  international developments  might  influence the outlook  for  U.S.  growth  and  inflation. Furthermore,  the  apparent  moderate  growth  in  current-quarter consumption  against  the  backdrop  of  solid  labor  market  improvements  and  lower  energy  prices  highlights  uncertainties  surrounding  the  outlook  for  household  spending. The  linkages  between  Fed  policy

(including  communications),  inflation  expectations,  and  actual  inflation  also  are  important  uncertainties. As  noted  in section  2(b), our judgment  is  that  the  eff ects of these  uncertainties  on  the  growth forecast  are  on  balance  neutral,  but  add  up  to  a  net  downside  risk  to  the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 10: Continued  gradual  improvement  in  secondary  measures  of  labor  market  slack,  a slow  return  of  inflation  to  its  target  level,  and  a  gradual  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 11: Real GDP  per  worker  has risen slightly less than 1 percent annually in recent years; my  projection  incorporates  slightly  faster  growth  over  the  forecast  period. Population  growth for ages 16 to 64 is projected  to be 0.5 percent  per year. These  supply  side  factors suggest  longerrun growth  of 1 3/4 percent. My  projections  are  slightly higher in the near term, reflecting robust consumer  spending  growth  and  solid  growth  in  investment  spending.

Respondent 12: I expect  the  pace  of  output  growth  over  the  medium  term  to  be  somewhat  above my  longer term  trend of 2.3 percent  as the headwinds  that  have  been  holding  down  growth  recede further. With  moderate  headline  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon  and  a  fairly  robust  labor  market, I anticipate  that the unemployment  rate  will  edge  down  further  from  its  current  level  of 5 percent. However,  with  a  cyclical  rebound  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  appropriate  monetary  policy firming,  the  unemployment  rate  goes  only  modestly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate. Headline inflation  has  been  held  down  by  falling  energy  prices. As  energy  prices  stabilize  and  dollar  appreciation wanes, I anticipate that inflation will begin to rebound  in  2016  and  rise toward  the  Committee's  2 percent  target  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 13: My  outlook  is  for continued  growth  at  roughly  the  average  level  of  the  past  6.5 years, or 2%. While  domestic  demand  should  continue  to  gradually  strengthen,  the  external  sector will remain  a  significant  drag  thanks  to  global  weakness  and  the  strong  dollar. I see  it as desirable  to allow  unemployment  to  drop  below  the  longer  run  natural  rate  to  support  inflation  returning  to  2% and  the  realization  of  maximum  employment.

Respondent 14: The  pace of economic  growth  in the second half of this year is roughly in line with expectations thus far, and so is the evolution of the unemployment  rate. Other measures  of labor  market  underutilization  have  been  improving,  too. We  expect  GDP  growth  to  pick  up  slightly next year, as fiscal policy at the federal level is somewhat  less  restrictive than previously thought. The  pickup  in  activity  is  sustained  by  strength  in  the  domestic  components  of  demand. In particular, we expect  consumer  spending  to  benefit  from  earlier  increases  in household  net  worth. The  release of pent-up demand  should support further improvements in the labor market, which in turn are expected  to  spur  growth  in  disposable  income. In  the  near  term,  consumer  spending  is  also  supported by a decline in energy  prices. The  acceleration  in consumer  expenditures  and  further  labor  market improvements  should  raise residential investment  to levels that are more  in line with demographic trends. Net  exports,  in  contrast,  are  expected  to  exert  a  noticeable  drag  to  growth  in  the  near  term, as a result  of the  dollar  appreciation  and  relatively  weak  demand  abroad.

The projected pace of GDP  growth  should lower the unemployment  rate to 4.7 percent -our estimate  of  the  natural  level  -  by  the  end  of  2016. Over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  relative  to  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  is  attenuated  by  more  individuals  re-entering  the labor  force. With  the  unemployment  rate  projected  to  stay  near  its  natural  level,  inflation  gradually reaches  2  percent. In  this  context,  the  removal  of  policy  accommodation  is  expected  to  be  gradual,  as the headwinds  progressively  abate  and  the  pent-up  demand  that  has  accumulated  so  far  is  being  released. The  gradual  removal  of  policy  accommodation  provides  monetary  policy  with  the  opportunity to probe  for  a  lower  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest  than  we  are  currently  assuming. It also  provides

room  for  a  faster but  disciplined  pace  of  tightening  should  inflationary  pressures  occur  more  rapidly than  expected,  or  should  vulnerabilities  to  the  financial  system  become  more  pronounced.

The  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  are  roughly  balanced. On  the  downside,  a  financial  crisis  in  China triggered  by  a more  pronounced  economic  slowdown  remains  a  concern. The  expected  tightening  of U.S.  monetary  policy  could  also  increase  financial  stability  risks  in  some  emerging  markets  economies, with potential spillovers to the rest of the world. On the upside, the recent increase in the pace of growth of final sales to domestic purchasers could signal a stronger-than-expected acceleration in activity. Risks to the unemployment  rate  outlook are somewhat  tilted to the downside, as the stronger  rebound  in  labor  force  participation  that  we  are  envisioning  remains  a  forecast  at  this  point. Even  though  we  have  lowered  out  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  slightly,  we  continue to perceive downside  risks to the inflation outlook. In particular, we see risks associated with the possibility  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below  the  2  percent  target.

Respondent 15: My  forecast  for  real GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  in  the period  from  2015  to  2018. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising  employment and  wages,  past  gains  in  household  wealth,  accommodative  financing  conditions,  and  increased  purchasing  power  from  lower  energy  prices. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  slow  in  2017  as the economy operates  at full capacity. I see the unemployment  gap  as  closed  in  the  fourth  quarter  of 2015  after the rapid  reduction  in  economic  slack  in  the  past  few  years. My  inflation  outlook  projects  a  gradual rise in inflation  reflecting  improving  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  of  transitory  eff ects of dollar  appreciation  and  lower  energy  prices.

I see the  risks  to the  economic  outlook  as  broadly  balanced. Downside  risks  for  real  GDP  growth and inflation, stemming  from the weakness in global economic and financial conditions this year, are roughly  off set by upside  risks related  to the resilience of the U.S. economy. Consumer  spending and  inflation  could  rise  faster  than  expected,  especially  given  the  rapid  improvement  in  labor  market conditions  and  the  potential  for  faster  wage  gains.

Respondent 16: The  economy  has  mostly  recovered  from  the  severe  housing  collapse  and  financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand  through  a  variety  of  channels,  which  policy  has  only  partially  off set. Many  of  the  associated remaining  headwinds  are  slowly  easing:

- · Single-family housing construction has been and continues to be depressed. However, with household balance sheets as well as consumer credit conditions improving, I expect this to abate;
- · The  relatively  strong  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year  compared  with  that  of the  rest of the  world,  the  subsequent  monetary  easing  in  Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  the  recent depreciation  of the renminbi  resulted  in a sharp  appreciation  of the dollar. This appreciation has been a drag on net exports and GDP  growth. The  potential for further deterioration of foreign  economic  and  financial  conditions  represents  a  downside  risk.

In this environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace. And  with substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  play  I  expect  output  and  unemployment  gaps  to  close  by  the  end of this  year  and  to  overshoot  somewhat  next  year. In  terms  of  inflation,  the  lagged  eff ects  of  remaining slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets,  combined  with  subdued  commodity  and  import  prices,  should  keep inflation below  the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation  target  over  the  next  year  and  a  half. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and  above-trend  growth  eventually  pull  inflation  back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 17: My  outlook  for  real  activity  assumes  that  increases  in  the  underlying  strength  of the  economy  will  enable  real  GDP  to  grow  at  a  pace  slightly  faster  than  potential  on  average  even  as the federal funds  rate  rises gradually,  thereby  generating  further  improvements  in  the  labor  market. This increasing strength partly reflects a gradual diminution of the drag on net exports from the

dollar and  foreign  growth,  continuing  recovery  of  the  housing  market,  somewhat  easier  fiscal  policy, modestly  faster  productivity  growth,  and  a  bottoming  out  of  the  contraction  in  oil  drilling. A  tighter labor  market  (including  a  modest  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment), combined  with  a  fading  of  the  transitory  inflation  eff ects of dollar appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices, should  enable  headline  inflation  to  move  back  to  2  percent  by  2018.

The  key  risk to this forecast is that the headwinds  currently  restraining  real  activity  will  fail to dissipate  as rapidly  or by as much  as  I anticipate. I am  also  concerned  that  the  return  to  2  percent inflation  may  prove  to  be  slower  than  I  anticipate,  reflecting  the  risk  that  the  dollar  could  move  higher or that  labor  market  slack  is  greater  than  I  estimate.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Real  GDP  growth  appears  likely  to  be  a  bit  weaker  in  the  second  half  of  2015  than I had  anticipated. As a result, I've revised slightly downward  my  growth  projection  for  2015. The recent  dynamics  of  unemployment  and  inflation,  as  well  as  demographic  considerations,  suggest  that the  long-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate  may  be  marginally  lower  than  I  had  previously  thought. In the near-term, though, the unemployment  rate  appears  to  be  on  a  somewhat  steeper  downward trajectory  than  had  been  anticipated. The  net  result  is  a  slightly-more-rapid  projected  increase  in  the inflation  rate.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Recent  GDP  data  has  led me  to decrease my  forecast for GDP  growth  in  2015. Data  in  recent  years  suggests  that  even  moderately  above-trend  GDP  growth  has  an  important  eff ect on  unemployment.  As  a  result,  I  have  reduced  my  unemployment  rate  forecasts  for  2016-2018. Recent inflation  data  has  also  caused  me  to  reduce  my  forecasts  for  2015  for  both  inflation  measures.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: As  noted  above,  some  of  the  more  negative  global  economic  scenarios  that  seemed possible in September  have not materialized, and the fourth quarter has continued the prevailing pattern  of  mixed  data  that  supports  slightly  above-trend  growth.

Respondent 6: Our  macroeconomic  projections  relative  to  those  of  September  have  changed  only marginally, as most of the data releases during this period have been roughly consistent with our central  outlook. However,  as  noted  and  explained  in  the  response  to  3(c),  we  judge  that  a  lower  path of the  policy  rate  is  necessary  to  support  those  projections.

Respondent 7: I have  made  only  minor  adjustments  to  my  outlook  since  the  September  SEP.  The adjustments  were  mainly  to  the near-term  outlook, reflecting the incoming  data. Ongoing  declines in oil and gasoline prices and the appreciation  of the dollar caused  me  to revise down  my  forecast for headline  PCE  inflation  in  2015  and  slightly  down  in  2016. My  qualitative  outlook  is  unchanged from the September SEP. I continue to expect growth to pick up to somewhat  above trend next year. With  an  improving  economy  and  stable  inflation  expectations,  I  expect  further  declines  in  the unemployment  rate  and  an  inflation  rate  that  gradually  returns  to  our  target.

Respondent 8: I have  marked  down  my  growth  forecast  in  2015  by  0.3  percentage  points,  as  second half growth  has  come  in  weaker  than  I'd  projected  in  September. My  medium  term  outlook  remains largely  intact,  although  I  have  lowered  my  projections  for  growth  slightly  in  order  to  square  my  output gap  with  my  judgment  on  remaining  labor  market  slack.

I have  lowered  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  (throughout  the  forecast  horizon  and  into  the longer  run)  by  a  tenth. That  said,  I  judge  broader  measures,  such  as  the  U-6  measure  of  unemployment, as a more  complete  gauge  of  labor  market  slack  and  do  not  expect  a  great  deal  of  pressure  on  wage and  price  growth  even  if  the  U-3  measure  slightly  overshoots  my  longer-run  estimate.

On  inflation, I've lowered  my  headline  PCE  inflation  forecast  for 2015 by 0.1 percentage  points and  2016  projection  by  0.2  percentage  points,  reflecting  the  decline  in  oil  prices  since  the  September meeting.

Respondent 9: On  balance, the incoming  data  on spending  have  been  a bit softer than we had expected  in  September,  causing  us  to  pare  back  our  projection  for  growth  in  2015:H2  by  1/2  percentage point. The revision shows up in lower net exports, consumption, and business fixed investment. Looking  ahead,  we  lowered  our  forecasts  for  U.S.  GDP  growth  in  2016  and  2017  a  bit,  reflecting  some reduced  momentum  in  domestic  demand  and  a  somewhat  lower  assumption  for  potential  output. This latter  change  was  made  in  light  of  a  small  revision  to  our  projection  for  capital  expansion  and  to  better square the GDP  and  labor  market  data. These  downside  factors  were off set to some  degree  by an increase  in fiscal stimulus  from  the  recent  budget  deal  in  the  U.S.  The  stability  in  financial  markets since  the  volatility  last  summer  has  been  a  reassuring  development,  but  we  viewed  it  as  a  diminished downside  risk  and  not  a  factor  aff ecting  our  baseline  outlook.

We  made  no  material  changes  to  our  inflation  projection. The  incoming  inflation  data  have  been in line  with  our  expectations. The  apparent  pick-up  in  wage  inflation  since  September  was  a  welcome development,  but  this  was  balanced  on  the  downside  by  continued  low  inflation  breakevens,  a  slight softening  in  some  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations,  and  a  further  decline  in  oil  prices. Indeed, these  factors  reinforced  our  judgment  that  the  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  downside.

We  changed  our  assumptions  regarding  appropriate  monetary  policy  a  bit. We  now  have  liftoff occurring  in  December  2015  instead  of  June  2016,  but  then  assume  one  less  move  in  2016,  leaving  the funds  rate  at the end  of 2016  the  same  as  in our September  submission. As  noted  in  our comments about appropriate policy, we made  this change in order to have a more realistic monetary  policy assumption  and  because  given  the  strong  communications  from  FOMC  participants,  waiting  further to  raise  rates  could  involve  some  credibility  risk  to  the  Committee  that  does  not  seem  worth  taking  as long  as  the  December  FOMC  statement  adequately  describes  an  expected  shallow  path  for  the  funds rate. We  also  built  in  one  less  rate  hike  in 2017  than  in  our  last  SEP  to  be  more  consistent  with  the shallow  path  language.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Unemployment  has  fallen  more  rapidly  than  I expected, so I expect somewhat lower  unemployment  at  the  end  of  next  year  and  beyond. Energy  prices  have  fallen  more  rapidly  than I projected  since  the last SEP,  and  I have  lowered  my  inflation  projections  accordingly  for  the  first half of 2016.

Respondent 12: I have  lowered  my  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  to  show  a  more  gradual funds rate normalization  in  response  to uncertainties  about  potential  output  growth  and  the  speed with  which  inflation  will  return  to  target.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: The  projected  pace  of  GDP  growth  is  now  slightly  faster  in  2016-17. As  a  result, the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  decline  slightly  more  than  in  the  previous  forecast. Still, with the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  now  estimated  at  4.7  percent,  we  continue  to  project  the  economy to  remain  in  the  vicinity  of  full  employment  over  the  forecast  horizon. Revisions  to  the  projected  path of the  federal  funds  rate  have  been  minor,  and  the  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 15: The  information  received  since  September  has  led  me  to  revise  down  my  forecast of the unemployment  rate  in 2015-2018, as the recent declines in the unemployment  rate  indicate that  labor  markets  are  tightening  somewhat  faster  than  I  projected  in  September. However,  despite the removal  of  economic  slack  I  revised  down  my  forecasts  of  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation in 2015H2  and  2016,  reflecting  somewhat  softer  than  expected  inflation  data  and  the  changes  in  the exchange  value  of  the  dollar  and  oil  prices  since  September.

Respondent 16: Since  September,  I  have  made  few  changes  to  my  forecast. My  forecast  for  GDP growth  in 2016  (Q4/Q4)  is  a bit higher on the heels of the fiscal boost, while my  forecast for 2017 and  2018  growth  is  a  bit  lower  reflecting  the  recent  and  anticipated  tightening  of  financial  conditions. In  addition,  given  stronger-than-expected  labor  market  data  in  recent  months,  I  have  lowered  slightly my  forecast of the unemployment  rate  in  the  medium  run,  with  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming out at 4.5%  (previously  4.7%)  by  the end of 2016 before rising back  to my  estimate  of the natural rate,  5.0%,  by  the  end  of  2018.

In addition,  my  inflation  forecast  over  the  medium  term  is  a  touch  lower,  reflecting  the  eff ects  of recent  further  declines  in  import  and  commodity  prices.

Respondent 17: I have  revised  up  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  to  reflect  somewhat  easier  fiscal  policy. In turn,  stronger  GDP  growth,  coupled  with  a  reassessment  of  the  persistence  of  the  recent  strength of the  labor  market,  has  led  me  to  mark  down  the  path  of  the  unemployment  rate. In  addition,  I  have lowered  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  natural  rate  slightly,  to  4.8  percent.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: My  unemployment  and  GDP  projections  aren't  very  diff erent from those in the Tealbook. However,  partly  because  I  believe  inflation  responds  to  changes  in  the  unemployment  rate as well as its level, and  partly  because  I  believe  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations  are  anchored at 2 percent, I see inflation rising a bit faster and a bit farther than predicted in the Tealbook. Consequently,  I  believe  that  the  appropriate  funds-rate  path  is  slightly  steeper  than  that  assumed  in the  Tealbook  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: The  primary  diff erence  involves  inflation. My  forecast  is  for  an  increase  in  inflation to 2.1%  in  2016,  while  the  Tealbook  forecasts  a  less  rapid  return  to  2%.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: No  important  diff erences  -  in  September  I  was  slightly  more  optimistic  about  out years than the Tealbook; now  I am  slightly less optimistic. But in both cases, the diff erences are generally modest. I build in an expectation of a significant cyclical slowing in 2018, which is not reflected  in  the  Tealbook  but,  as  with  all  projections  several  years  ahead,  the  conviction  behind  that expectation  is  not  strong.

Respondent 6: The Tealbook forecast and our projections for the key SEP  variables are fairly similar over the SEP  forecast horizon. However, because of diff erences in some of the underlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts,  the  interpretations  of  these  projections  are  quite  diff erent.

Based on its assessment of potential GDP  growth, the Tealbook path of real GDP  leads to a fairly sizable positive output  gap  by  2017-18. Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  resource  slack  dissipates  by  2018  but  no  significantly  positive output  gap  develops  over  the  forecast  horizon.

The  other  notable  diff erence  in  the  underlying  assumptions  continues  to  be  the  longer-run  natural rate of unemployment: the Tealbook  has maintained  its assumption  of 5.1%, while we have maintained ours of 4.8%. Consequently,  unemployment  in  our  projection  falls only to the natural rate, consistent  with  our  assessment  that  slack  dissipates  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon. In contrast, the  Tealbook  path  means  that  unemployment  undershoots  the  longer-run  natural  rate;  this  pattern  is the  counterpart  of  the  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

One  other  diff erence  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: our projection has a slowly-rising participation rate path through 2017 while the Tealbook has it declining gradually to 62.3%  at end-2017. This diff erence reflects our assumption  of some  positive cyclical  eff ects on  participation  as  well  as  a  slightly  shallower  downward  trend  component.

Turning  back  to  real  growth,  we  note  a  few  diff erences  in  the  details  of  the  near- and  medium-term projections. One  diff erence  that  arises in this set of projections  concerns  the  impact  of  fiscal  policy. While both forecasts incorporate the passage of the Bipartisan Budget  Act of 2015, the Tealbook forecast appears  to anticipate a larger eff ect on real GDP  growth  in  2016  than  the expected  eff ect in our projection. This diff erence in the fiscal impact  largely accounts for the small divergence in projected  growth  rates  in  2016  between  the  two  forecasts.

The  other diff erences in the two projections are longstanding  ones. The  Tealbook  continues  to project slower growth in business fixed investment in 2016-17 than in our forecast; this diff erence

may  partly  reflect  the  Tealbook  assessment  that  the  capital  stock  is  fairly  close  to  steady-state  levels. This factor is off set by faster consumption  growth  in  the Tealbook  forecast, another long-standing diff erence  with  our  forecast,  which  in  part  reflects  stronger  wealth  eff ects  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

For inflation, the two forecasts diff er on how quickly inflation reaches the 2% objective: our projection has inflation near 2%  at end-2017  whereas  the Tealbook  projects that inflation will not reach  that  level  until  2018. The  Tealbook  has  this  slower  rise  even  though  there  are  a  positive  output gap and undershooting of unemployment  in its projection. This diff erence between the Tealbook and our projections reflects diff ering views about inflation dynamics. In the Tealbook, with the underlying  inflation rate below  the FOMC  longer-run  objective  and  considerable  persistence  in  the inflation process,  a prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  (and  a  positive  output  gap)  appears to be necessary to induce inflation to rise toward the longer-run inflation goal. The faster return of inflation to its goal in our forecast reflects our assumptions  of  less inflation persistence and of a stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation  expectations.

In terms of the uncertainty  and risk assessment, we see a few diff erences between  the two projections. On  the  real side, we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty at near normal  levels. This assessment reflects our view that the unusual nature of the current expansion,  the  atypical policy environment  in  the  U.S. and  many  foreign  economies, and  latent  foreign  risks leave uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard. However,  we agree  with  the  Tealbook  that  the  risks  to  real  growth  are  tilted  to  the  downside  for  many  of  the  same reasons  cited  in  the  Tealbook. As  for  inflation,  our  uncertainty  and  risk  assessments  are  similar  to  the Tealbook,  with  uncertainty  near  the  SEP  standard  and  risks  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 7: As in the Tealbook, I expect that GDP  growth  will pick up to an above-trend pace next year, the unemployment  rate  will  continue  to  decline, and  inflation will gradually  return to our 2 percent longer-term objective. The diff erences between my forecast for growth and the unemployment  rate  and  Tealbook's  forecast  stem  primarily  from  diff erent  estimates  of  trend  growth and  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment: My  trend  growth  rate  and  longer-run  unemployment  rate  are slightly  higher  than  the  Tealbook's,  so  my  forecast  for  growth  and  unemployment  are  a  bit  higher  than the Tealbook's. I see somewhat  greater  inflationary  pressures  than in the Tealbook, with inflation returning  to  2  percent  in  2017  compared  to  2018  in  the  Tealbook. As  a  result,  my  forecast  calls  for  a somewhat  steeper  path  for  the  funds  rate  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline;  the  diff erence  in  paths  also reflects the fact that my  estimate  of the longer-run fed funds rate is 3.5 percent compared  to  3.25 percent  in the Tealbook. Of course, given the confidence  bands  around  such  estimates, there is no statistical  diff erence  in  our  estimates.

Respondent 8: My  growth  forecast  is similar to that in the Tealbook  throughout  the  projection period. However,  my  headline  and  core  inflation  forecasts  run  about 1 4 / percentage  point  above  the Tealbook  over  the  medium-term.

Respondent 9: We  assume  fewer  increases  in  the  funds  rate  during  2016  than  the  Tealbook  doesour  end-of-2016  rate  is  65  bps  below  the  Tealbook. We  incorporate  roughly  the  same  pace  of  increase as the Tealbook  in  2017  and  2018, and  so this gap in funds  rate assumptions  is  largely maintained throughout  the  projection  period.

Our projection for GDP  growth  is 1 4 / percentage point below the Tealbook in 2016 but then averages  about 1 2 / percentage  point  above  the  Tealbook  in  2017  and  2018. Our  view  of  potential  output growth  is  a  few  tenths  higher  than  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  projection  period;  our  2016  forecast represents  less  strength  relative  to  potential  than  the  Tealbook  while  our  2017  and  2018  projections are  a  bit  stronger  relative  to  trend. Our  unemployment  rate  forecasts  are  a  tenth  higher  through  most of the  projection  period,  but  our  assumption  for  the  natural  rate  is  4.9  percent,  0.2  percentage  point below  the  Tealbook's. We  also  think  that  the  gap  between  actual  and  trend  participation  could  take

longer to close. Accordingly, our forecast does not have as much  overshooting  of  potential as does the Tealbook. Nonetheless,  our  outlook  for  inflation  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook's,  as  we  feel  our more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  provide  a  larger  boost  to  actual  inflation  through expectational  channels.

Respondent 10: The  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  except  that  monetary  accommodation  will  be  removed  more  gradually.

Respondent 11: I am  less  pessimistic  about  core  inflation  for  2016.

Respondent 12: My  forecast  calls  for  somewhat  stronger  output  growth,  a  higher  unemployment path,  and  faster  inflation  convergence  compared  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: The  two  forecasts  are  broadly  similar  both  in  terms  of  real  activity  and  inflation outcomes. The  Tealbook's  estimate  of the natural rate of unemployment,  at  5.1  percent, is higher than  our  estimate,  which  currently  stands  at  4.7  percent.

Respondent 15: My  projected paths of real GDP  growth  and  the unemployment  rate  in 20152018  are  close  to  those  of  Tealbook. While  the  projections  for  headline  GDP  growth  are  similar,  the contributions to growth  are diff erent as my  forecast calls for somewhat  softer growth  in consumer spending  and  somewhat  less  weakness  in  net  exports. My  forecasts  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE inflation are approximately 1 2 / percentage  point higher than Tealbook's  projection in 2016 and 1 4 / percentage  point  higher  in 2017. With  inflation expectations  well  anchored, I view inflation as less inertial  than  Tealbook,  and  therefore  expect  the  eff ects  of  past  dollar  appreciation  and  oil  price  declines to wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projection.

Respondent 16: The  Tealbook  projects  a  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment  and  a  protracted  return  of  inflation  to  2  percent. If the  Tealbook  forecast  from  2016  to  2022  were  compressed into the next three years-that  is, after a time deformation-it  would  be  fairly  close to mine. In my forecast,  the  economy  returns  to  steady  state  (closing  all  gaps  for  the  real  interest  rate,  unemployment, output,  and  inflation)  by  the  end  of  2018. In  2016,  I  anticipate  above-potential  growth  of  2.2  percent, which  lowers  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.5  percent. The  removal  of  policy  accommodation  tightens financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows  growth  to  below  potential  in  2017  and  2018. This  pushes  up the unemployment  rate  to  its  5 percent  natural  rate by the middle  of 2018. Finally, the persistent overshoot  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  the  second  half  of  2018.

Respondent 17: Because  I  judge  long-run  inflation  expectations  to  be  anchored  at  2  percent,  rather than  the  staff  estimate  of  1.8  percent,  my  forecast  shows  faster  convergence  of  actual  inflation  back  to the  Committee's  objective. In addition,  I  envision  a  somewhat  more  gradual  rise  in  the  federal  funds rate  over  the  next  three  years,  possibly  reflecting  my  assessment  that  the  longer-run  funds  rate  is  bit lower  than  the  staff  estimates,  and  that  the  labor  market  will  be  somewhat  less  tight  on  average  over the  next  few  years.
