Note: Projections  of  change  in  real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  from  the  fourth  quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE  inflation and core PCE  inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index  for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  and the price index  for PCE excluding food  and energy. Projections  for the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  March projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  19-20,  2013.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In March 2013, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 1, 4, 13, and 1. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 4 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 16: Our  current estimate of the economy's  potential  growth  rate is in the 2%  to 2 1 2 / %  range. By  2018  we  anticipate  a  potential  growth  rate  of  around  2 1 4 / %. A  reasonable  range  for an estimate  of the long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%. Assuming  appropriate  policy  and  no further  significant  shocks,  we  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  in  this  range  and  the  output  gap to be  around  zero  by  2017-18;  our  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  suggests  the  unemployment  rate could  be  modestly  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about 2.5% for the CPI based on longer-term average of the difference between CPI and PCE

inflation). Under  these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to shrink over the coming years, we expect  inflation as measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be close to 2%  by 2015 and remain near  that  level  thereafter.

Respondent 17: It will be  faster  under  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 18: I think the unemployment  rate  will  converge  to  its  long-run  value  in 2015, real GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  converge  to  their  long-run  values  in  2017.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: Uncertainty about  my projection for  economic  activity is similar to its average level over the past 20 years. Of  course, that period  was characterized by  considerable turmoil, including the Great  Recession,  the  European  (and  earlier,  Asian)  financial  crises,  the  Iraq  war,  9/11,  the  dot.com boom  and  bust,  and  so  on.

Inflation is anchored by quite  stable inflation expectations. The  stability of these expectations has been reinforced by the release in 2012 of an explicit 2 percent objective for inflation. Hence, uncertainty  about  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: At  this point, uncertainty  looks  to  be  broadly  similar  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20 years.

Respondent 4: As  with the Tealbook, because the experience of the past 5 years is now such  a large part of the comparison  period, we think the uncertainty  over the GDP  growth  and  unemployment rate forecasts  are  broadly  similar  to  the  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years. If not  for those years,  we'd  say  the  level  of  uncertainty  was  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9: In a post-crisis period, uncertainties remain about growth potential and after-effects of the  crisis  (including  Europe). U.S.  fiscal  policy,  including  the  debt  limit,  unconventional  monetary policies  (in  Japan  as  well  as  US),  and  developments  in  China  and  other  emerging  markets  (in  a  muchmore-integrated world)  are  all sources of relatively high uncertainty. On the  other hand, recession risk seems  low.

Core inflation is well anchored by  stable expectations and  commodity prices appear relatively  tame in a slowly-growing  world,  so  uncertainty  about  inflation  is  relatively  normal. Some  extra  uncertainty about  inflation  comes  from  imprecise  estimates  of  amount  of  slack  and  the  coefficient  on  slack  in  the Phillips curve; this is more  important now  than  on average because slack  is presumably  fairly  large and  thus  a  meaningful  factor  in  inflation  determination.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Estimates  of  the  current  long-run  trend  in  real  GDP  are  highly  uncertain. Also, the unemployment  rate does not provide a  clear signal of the degree of  economic slack. Consequently I believe that point forecasts for real GDP  and  unemployment are  more uncertain than usual. Inflation expectations are probably more firmly anchored following the FOMC's  consensus statement, and uncertainty  should  be  correspondingly  lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Uncertainty  about  domestic  fiscal  policy  continues  to  pose  risks  for  the  forecast. It remains  the case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and uncertainties surrounding  the  future  path  of policy, including  the timing  of the exit from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors  over  the  last 20 years. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are  not  substantially  different  from  those at the time of the March  SEP. These measures also reflect our view of the appropriate monetary policy stance providing  insurance  against  realizations of some  of the downside  risks; otherwise, the uncertainty would be even higher. In part, the probability intervals remain wide because of the extraordinary  economic  and  financial  environment, including the policy rate remaining  constrained by  its  effective  lower  bound. Moreover,  the  recent  increases  in  realized  and  implied  volatility  in  global financial  markets  suggest  that  uncertainty  continues  to  be  greater  than  usual.

Respondent 17: Uncertainty  was  unusually  low  in  the  past  20  years.

Respondent 18: N/A

Respondent 19: The  recent softness in inflation and the decline in long-term inflation expectations make  my  inflation projections  more  uncertain  than usual. In addition, the Federal  Reserve's unconventional policies  are a source of uncertainty  because they have no precedent.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: Since March, I have shifted my risk  weighting  on GDP growth to'broadly balanced.' There  are still clear downside  risks from  fiscal policy and the global economy,  but  these  risks have receded somewhat.  For  example, there  are  few signs of  major dislocations from sequestration. At the same  time, as headwinds  continue to abate, the upside risk of a virtuous cycle becomes  more plausible. Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

The  zero lower bound does somewhat  constrain our ability  to respond  to adverse shocks. However, this constraint has become  less of  an issue over  time, in  light of the effectiveness of  forward guidance (especially  with  the  threshold  language)  and  LSAPs. As  a  result,  I do  not  view  the  zero  lower  bound as a quantitatively  significant  source  of  downside  skew  at  this  point. This  lack  of  substantial  skew  is consistent  with  the  70- and  90-percent  forecast  confidence  intervals  shown  in  Tealbook  A.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: I believe the risks are weighted primarily to the downside  for GDP growth and to the  upside  for  unemployment,  due  to  ongoing  fiscal  challenges  in  the  United  States  and  the  potential for further  slowing  in  growth  abroad. I judge  the  overall  risks  to inflation  as broadly  balanced,  with downside risks that a  faltering  recovery  could pull down inflation and  upside risks that a large balance sheet  could  eventually  cause  inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn,  inflation  to  rise.

Respondent 4: For some  time, we thought  the risks to our forecasts for economic  activity were weighted to the downside, as the likelihood of greater-than-assumed  fiscal restraint, less favorable international developments,  and  fragile household  and business  confidence  outweighed  the probability that virtuous  cyclical dynamics  would  be  stronger  than  we  anticipated. We  still think  these  factors tilt towards a net downside risk  to growth, but we think the weighting  is  less pronounced than in the previous  couple  of  SEP  submissions. One  reason  is  that we  have  built more  fiscal restraint  into our baseline  forecast. In addition, the tail risk from  Europe  appears  to  be  smaller,  consumer  sentiment has  picked  up,  and  the  improvement  in  labor  markets  makes  us  more  confident  that  positive  cyclical dynamics are gaining traction. We still see the risks to the inflation forecast as weighted to the downside. The  pickup  in  inflation  in  our  projection  depends  heavily  on  inflation  expectations  pulling actual  inflation back  towards  target. However, we  may be overestimating  the  lift  from  expectations, or the degree to which they will remain well-anchored if we continue to see very low readings on actual  inflation  or  if the  public  perceives  some  wavering  of  the  FOMC's  commitment  to  a  symmetric 2 percent  inflation  target.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8: My  forecast assumes  a strong pickup in growth by the end of this year due, in part,  to  a normalization  of  credit  availability  and  continued  improvements  in  household  and  business confidence. Stronger  growth  results  from a pickup  in domestic  spending  coupled  with  waning  drag from fiscal policy. These assumptions could, however, easily prove overoptimistic, continuing the pattern of disappointments  pertaining  to growth  we've seen over the last several years. A further factor creating  downside risk is the  zero bound  constraint, which  limits the ability  of  monetary policy to respond  to negative shocks. In addition, unemployment  may  decline  less  than  in my  baseline if there  is currently,  as  I  suspect,  a  larger  cyclical  shortfall  in  labor  force  participation  than  assumed  in Tealbook. I continue  to  assess  the  risks  to  growth  as  weighted  to  the  downside,  but  see  the  extent  of downside risk  as having  diminished since  last  fall, when the  asset purchase program was put in place, largely  due  to  improvements  in  the  global  financial  situation.

Respondent 9: Fiscal policy, Europe, slow global growth, and financial volatility are downside risks to growth. We have also tended to over-predict output heretofore, possibly because we are somehow not capturing  structural changes, including persistent effects of the crisis.  The ZLB creates an asymmetric policy response  which  imparts some downside risk.  Modest upside risks  include strongerthan-expected housing, better  household  and business sentiment,  and  less-than-expected impact  of federal  fiscal  restraint. Downside  risks  to  growth  would  tend  to  imply  upside  risks  to  unemployment, except supply side factors (productivity, participation rates) have tended to reduce unemployment faster  than  a  simple  Okun's  Law  relationship  would  predict.

Risks  to inflation from  commodity  prices  are  broadly  balanced. Downside  risks  to  core  inflation from slack  are  offset by  the  likelihood  that special  factors  are  at work  and  generally  anchored  inflation expectations (though recent breakevens have  come  down a noticeable  amount).

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between the  central projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation  outlook  are  roughly  balanced,  as  has  been  the  case  in  the  previous  three  SEPs. The  risks to the real activity outlook  are roughly  balanced, as was the case in March. This rough balance is primarily the result of two factors. First, with sequestration and other fiscal restraints incorporated in our  central forecast, we have lowered the probability  of fiscal restraint beyond that in our central forecast. Second,  the  somewhat  more  encouraging  data  on  consumer  spending,  housing, and the labor market  in the face of continued headwinds  from  Europe  and  fiscal policy raises the probability  that the underlying  strength  of  the economy  is  greater  than  we  have  anticipated  in our central forecast. The  balance of risks for inflation and real activity also reflects our view that the appropriate  monetary  policy  stance  in  the  current  environment  provides  insurance  against  tail  risks; otherwise,  the  balance  of  risks  for  both  variables  probably  would  be  skewed  some  to  the  downside.

Respondent 17: I remain  concerned about  our ability  to respond effectively to a decline in inflation or inflation  expectations.

Respondent 18: N/A

Respondent 19: The  risks to near-term  inflation are skewed  to the downside  while the risks to medium-term  inflation are skewed to the upside. The medium-term  risks reflect monetary  policy being highly accommodative  for  a  long  time  and  the  possibility  that removing  accommodation  will begin  too  late.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: Output and unemployment gaps are large and persistent, and my outlook for inflation over the medium  term remains below  our 2 percent  objective. This situation  calls  for very accommodative  monetary  policy. Even  with  continuing  LSAPs,  appropriate  policy  calls  for  delaying liftoff from the  zero lower bound  until the third quarter of  2015, shortly  after the unemployment rate falls below  6-1/2  percent  in  my  forecast. My  judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  informed  by  looking at simple rules that adjust for the zero-lower-bound and for the effects of unconventional policy. In addition, it is informed by  my  expectations  of, and uncertainty  about, the costs and benefits  of continuing  unconventional  actions.

Respondent 2: 'Appropriate policy' cannot be captured by  a  time-path for the federal funds rate. An  important  part  of  'appropriate  policy'  is  communicating  a  long-run  strategy  for  monetary  policy that does a better job of resisting  imbalances  and  excesses than did past strategy,  and which  reduces the chances that policy will be zero-bound  constrained. A public commitment  to  such a strategy would  strengthen  the  recovery  more  reliably  than  our  current  form  of  forward  guidance,  allowing  us  to normalize  policy  more  quickly. It would  enhance  the  effectiveness  of  additional  asset  purchases  while reducing  the  need  for  them.

For purposes of this exercise, I considered the implications of a variety of simple policy rules, placing greatest weight  on the prescriptions  of the 1999  Taylor  rule with inertia. In simulating  the rule, I  assumed that the natural real rate of interest is  temporarily depressed  and I  reluctantly decided to respect the public commitment  made  by some of my colleagues to delay liftoff until after the unemployment  rate  reaches 6.5 percent. I don't think that this commitment  was  sufficiently well thought out, but I do think that it's important that each FOMC  try  to honor pledges made by previous  FOMCs  unless  the  reasons  for  abandoning  them  are  clear  and  compelling.

Respondent 3: I currently anticipate that conditions will warrant  raising the federal funds rate target in the second half of 2015. At that point, the unemployment  rate  will be below the 6 1 2 / percent threshold and  nearing  my  estimate of the natural rate, and inflation  will be moving  up  toward the 2 percent  long-run objective. With the  economic recovery  well-established, it  will be appropriate to begin  the  normalization  of  monetary  policy.

Respondent 4: Our judgments regarding the appropriate path for the federal funds rate are premised  on  interpreting  the  numerical  guidelines  in  the  FOMC  statement  as  'bona  fide  thresholds,' and  not 'de  facto triggers.' In our forecast, the unemployment  rate reaches 6-1/2 percent  some time in the first half of  2015. At that  time, the outlook for inflation over the next one to two years is still below 2 percent. Accordingly,  we  assume  the  Committee  keeps  policy  on  hold,  delaying  the  first  increase  in the funds rate until  late in the year. This patience upon hitting  the  6-1/2 percent unemployment rate threshold  should  be  a  strong  signal  to  markets  of  our  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation target, and thus should help support inflation expectations and buoy  actual inflation. Such  a delayed liftoff also is consistent  with  the  idea  that  optimal  policy  would  produce  inflation  rates  that  slightly overshoot 2 percent, though in  our projection this occurs  after the  end of the  current  forecast period.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Lift-off from  the zero-lower-bound  occurs  around  mid-2015,  when  the  unemployment rate is expected to  fall below 6.5 percent and the  economy  continues to grow above potential.

Respondent 7: I expect  the  federal  funds rate  to remain  in  the 0  to  25 basis point range  at  least  as long  as  the  unemployment  rate  exceeds  6 1 2 / percent, providing  that  inflation  is projected  to be  close to the Committee's  2 percent  objective  in  the  medium  term  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations continue  to  be  anchored.

Respondent 8: Mypath for the federal funds rate  accords closely with Tealbook although I assumed a lower  long-run equilibrium value of the funds rate,  consistent  with staff  estimates based  on the threefactor  model. The  reduced  value  of  the  equilibrium  funds  rate  reflects  persistent  drags  on  aggregate demand from fiscal policy, slow  global growth  and  somewhat slower growth in potential  output. Given the  zero lower bound  constraint, appropriate  monetary policy, in my  view, involves  committing  to hold the funds rate 'lower for longer' than would be prescribed by  standard  rules such  as Taylor  1999. The Committee's threshold based approach,  combined  with the staff assumption that the funds rate adjusts following  liftoff  according  to  inertial  Taylor  1999  captures  these  basic  principles.

Respondent 9: I project  unemployment  at  6.5  percent  and  inflation  near  2  percent  in  mid-2015. With  inflation  near  target,  I  assume  rate  increases  begin  in  the  second  half  of  the  year,  hitting  75  bp by  the  fourth  quarter.

Respondent 10: My  view of approporiate  monetary policy does not  match what is assumed in the teal book. In particular, I don't think that the labor market  has  improved  substantially  enough  to warrant  reducing  our  asset  purchases  at  this  meeting. I also  believe  that  we  are  moving  further  from our inflation goal. Accordingly, I think we should maintain the current flow of purchases at least through  the  fall  as  we  continue  to  monitor  labor  market  conditions,  inflation  and  financial  stability.

In addition, I have become  concerned that  communication  regarding  the unemployment threshold could be enhanced.  According to the  teal book forecast, the unemployement  rate  could  easily cross this threshold  earlier  than  the  time  in  which  it  would  be  optimal  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate. Because the unemployment rate has been revised downward by  the staff, this is pulling  foward the  time of  lift off, without  regard  to  whether  the  declines  in  unemployement  are  actually  bering  accompanied  by  a reduction  in  the  amount  of  slack  in  the  economy.

Respondent 11: I believe that by mid-2014  growth  will  be  slightly above  trend  with  little or no economic slack remaining; moreover, I believe that inflation will be near 2 percent. Under those conditions I believe that we  will want to raise the federal funds rate to prevent an unwelcome increase in inflation.

Respondent 12: I am  assuming  we  continue  to  follow  our  threshold  policy. Since in my  forecast unemployment  falls  below  6.5%  in  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  and  since  I  expect  inflation  to  be  in  the 2% range at that  time, it seems appropriate to begin raising the funds rate in the first quarter of  2015, and  resume  using  something  that  looks  broadly  like  the  inertial  Taylor  99  rule.

Respondent 13: Unemployment  reaches  6.5%  early  in  2015  and  lift-off  begins. This  is  roughly  two quarters  earlier than  in my  March  submission  but  I  raised  the  fed  funds  rate  at  the  end  of 2015  by only  .25%  to  indicate  either  a  slight  delay  in  lift-off  after  the  threshold  is  crossed  or  a  slower  pace  of rate  increases  once  lift-off  occurs.

Respondent 14: Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation.  Economic  growth  will  be  slightly  above  trend  in  2013H2  and  beyond;  unemployment will decline slowly. The  Committee  will  find  it necessary  to  adjust policies  to prevent  inflation  from rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 15: I assume  that  we  will raise the federal funds rate after the unemployment  rate declines  below  6.5%.

Respondent 16: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR are the current  state of the  economy, our  central  economic outlook, and  our balance of risks around  the  central  outlook. Overall,  the  indicators  since  September  still  point  to  a sluggish expansion.  In particular,  although the labor  market outlook has improved some, our assessment is that the improvement  has  not  reached  the  'substantial'  standard. Financial  conditions  are  still not fully normal  and  remain susceptible to sharp  reversals depending  upon developments  as  evidenced in recent weeks. Furthermore, we see the 'whatever it  takes' policy approach of the Federal  Reserve  and  other central banks  as  an important  factor behind the somewhat better  U.S.  economic data (particularly in the interest rate sensitive sectors of consumer  durables  and  housing),  while  the  recent  uncertainties that have crept up  about whether  central banks  will  continue to  follow such policies have  contributed to the  increased  volatility  and  pressures  seen  recently  in  financial  markets.

In these  circumstances  and  noting  that  the  economic  developments  since  September  have  been  in rough  accord  with  our September projection (when we had proposed the introduction of  an  outcomebased purchase program and policy stance), we thus see appropriate  monetary policy as 'doing  whatever it takes'  to strengthen the economic expansion; under such a policy, it will be the economic outcomes  and  outlook  that  will  dictate  the  path  of  the  policy  stance. Under  our  modal  outlook,  we still  anticipate that the  target FFR  will remain near  zero until the second half of  2015. We  expect that long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over  this  period. The  pace  of  renormalization of the  target FFR  following the period of near  zero policy rates  will then depend  upon our assessment of economic  conditions,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  overall  financial  conditions.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate  is  in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0  - 5.0%. Given the behavior of nominal and  real Treasury yields and productivity growth  since  the  end  of  the  recession,  we  currently  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to be in the lower  half  of the indicated  range,  which  results  in  the  point  estimate  given  in  the  response to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  our  assessment  of  economic  and  financial  conditions,  our judgement of the current 'neutral' FFR is below our estimate of the  longer-run FFR  and is expected to remain so for some  time.

As discussed in our answer to question 3(e), we anticipate that significant improvement  in  the labor market  outlook  will become  evident  around  the  turn  of  the year, so we expect  that the pace of purchases  under  the  current  program  will  begin  to  slow  in  2013Q4  and  that  purchases  will  end  in 2014Q1.

Respondent 17: Under  appropriate  monetary  policy, the FOMC  should  keep  the  fed  funds  rate extraordinarily low at  least  until the unemployment  rate  falls below  5.5%, as long  as the medium-term outlook  for  inflation  is  sufficiently  close  to  2%.

Respondent 18: Assuming  appropriate policy  and  my  views  on  the  convergence process,  my  judgment  is  that  the  lift-off  of the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in Q3/2014.

Respondent 19: Key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy are achieving  an inflation objective of 2.0 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that  reduces  unemployment.  To  maintain  the  stability  of  long-run  inflation  expectations  and  financial stability,  I anticipate  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  the  process  of  normalizing  the  federal  funds  rate  in 2014.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: No

My  view  of  appropriate  balance  sheet  policy  is  consistent  with  the  Tealbook,  Book  A  assumption  of $750  billion  in  asset  purchases  in  2013.

Respondent 2: Yes

The  outlook  for  the  labor  market  has  improved  sufficiently,  and  the  cost-benefit  calculus  has  shifted rapidly  enough,  that  tapering  should  begin  immediately.

Respondent 3:

No

N/A

Respondent 4: Yes

We  assume  that  the  current  LSAP  program  will  total  $1-1/4  trillion; this reflects a scaling back  of purchases to a $65 billion per  month pace in September of this year and the program being terminated in the first half of 2014. According  to the Tealbook  estimates  (footnote  1), this extra $500 billion would, by the end of 2015, reduce  the unemployment  rate  by  0.1  to  0.3  percentage  point  and  raise inflation by 0.0 to 0.2 percentage  point  relative  to  the  Tealbook's  assumption. Though  small,  these would  be  useful  gains  towards  both  of  our  dual  mandate  goals.

Respondent 5: No

N/A

Respondent 6: Yes

The cumulative asset purchases since the beginning of  2013 are expected to  total  $1.1 trillion. Tapering of monthly  purchases  occurs near the end of the year, once the decline in the unemployment  rate starts to be driven  by  improvements  in  the  employment-to-population  ratio. The  purchase  program is expected  to  end  in  the  first  half  of  2014.

Respondent 7:

No

N/A

Respondent 8: Yes

I have  assumed  an additional roughly  $250 billion in  asset purchases beyond that incorporated in the Tealbook  baseline. I would  gear  the  pace  of  purchases  to  actual  economic  outcomes;  in  my  baseline, however,  I maintain  the  current  pace  of purchases  until the fall, to insure that we see confirmation in the data  of my  forecast  pickup  in  the  growth  of  private  domestic  final  purchases. Assuming  that growth  continues  to strengthen  in Q4  as I anticipate, I would  further reduce purchases. If growth picks  up  in  2014,  as  in  my  forecast,  I  would  likely  end  asset  purchases  around  mid  year.

Respondent 9: Yes

I would expect asset purchases to begin to slow in September but to  continue through  2014:q1 before stopping  entirely,  resulting  in  closer  to  1T  total  purchases  from  Jan  2013  on.

Respondent 10: Yes

The staff is projecting  about  $150 billion less in asset purchases than I believe is appropriate. A  more gradual slowing in the pace of purchases over the second half of this year  might  result in in  cumulative purchases  of  about  $900  billion,  which  I  think  is  more  appropriate.

Appropriate  monetary  policy needs to include sharper communication  efforts. In particular, it would be appropriate  for the  Committee to use  its  communications  more effectively to help the public understand that liftoff need not move earlier just because the unemployment  rate declines. Such communication  could  occur  in  several  possible  ways. First,  we  could  communicate  to  the  public  that the unemployment  threshold  of  6.5  %  is  only one of several labor market  indicators  that we would be reviewing when we evaluate whether we are nearing the threshold. In this scenario we would indicate that other measures  of labor market  slack indicate that the threshold will not be reached just because the  6.5 percent number is being  reached. Second, we  could  more  clearly  communicate the post-threshold  reaction  function  that  we  have  in  mind,  making  it  very  clear  that  if  a  signficiant amount  of  slack  is  still present  when  we  approach  6.5 percent,  the  trajectory  of  the  federal  funds  rate is likely to be exceedingly  flat. Third,  we  could  reiterate  that  the  treshold  is  not a trigger and  note some  of  the  other  labor  market  indicators  that  we  are  likely  to  consider  when  we  contemplate  liftoff.

In sum, I think it is still appropriate to keep the substantial  accommodation that we have in place. Reducing the pace of purchases should be slower than the staff envisions and additional steps to  clarify and  strengthen  our  forward  guidance  about  the  thresholds  is  necessary  to  avoid  unwelcome  tightening in financial  conditions.

Respondent 11: Yes

I favor immediate  cessation of long-term asset purchases and reinvestment of maturing mortgagebacked  securities.

Respondent 12: No

N/A

Respondent 13: No

N/A

Respondent 14: Yes

I anticipate  following  the  Commitee's  June  2011  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path  is steeper  than  in  the  Tealbook,  I  anticipate  that  we  would  reduce  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet more  quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 15: Yes

I assume  that  the  balance  sheet  will  be  at  least  $250  bn  larger  than  the  June  Tealbook  suggests.

Respondent 16: Yes

As noted above, in part to reinforce the forward  guidance  on the target FFR,  we  assume  that  the FOMC  continues  its  current  outcome-based, open-ended  purchase  program  of  long-term  Treasuries and agency MBS. Based on our outlook, we currently expect that these purchases  will  continue at the current pace  through  2013Q3, and then proceed at a slower pace  through  2014Q1 for a  total of  little over $1 trillion in purchases  in 2013 and 2014. Because  our  outlook  has not changed  substantially from  that  in September  2012,  this  assumption  is  close  to  our  purchase  program  assumption  at  that time. Our  assumed  program  would  last  6  months  longer  and  total  about  $250  billion  more  than  the program  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. However,  that  path  and  the  total  could  change  depending  upon the progress  toward  the FOMC  objectives-it  is  the progress  toward  objectives  that  is  important  in our  assumed  policy  stance  rather  than  a  particular  size  of  the  balance  sheet. In our  overall  strategy for appropriate  monetary  policy,  we  believe  that  a  collective  emphasis  on  an  accommodative  stance based  on  a  portfolio  of  tools  would  enhance  the  efficacy  of  policy  in  these  circumstances.

Respondent 17: Yes

I actually wanted  to answer  'Maybe'. It really matters, I think, how we communicate  about  the reduction  in  purchases.

If we reduce the flow of purchases  and  say  that we're doing  so because there has been  a sufficient improvement in the labor market outlook, then markets will shift their beliefs about the FOMC reaction  function. In particular,  market participants  will begin  to believe  that we  are  likely  to raise the  fed  funds  rate  relatively  soon  (say,  as  soon  as  the  unemployment  rate  hits  6.4%).

If we reduce  the flow of purchases  and  say  that we're doing  so because  we  are  concerned  about possible  costs  of a big balance  sheet,  we  will  mitigate  the  above  problem  (perhaps  not  eliminate  it). (Pivoting  to  another  form  of  accommodation  would  help  too.)

So, communication  matters.

Respondent 18: No

N/A

Respondent 19: No

I agree  with the Tealbook assumption that asset purchases  will be reduced from $85 billion per  month to zero over the second half of the year. However, I would support beginning to dial back asset purchases  at  this  meeting.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes  are  associated  with  sustained weakness in  aggregate demand through  a  variety  of channels,  which  policy  has  only  partially  offset. Housing  has  finally  turned  the corner and become  a  tailwind  to recovery. In addition, other headwinds  are easing. For example, consumer  balance sheets as well as banking and credit conditions are improving, and uncertainty about economic and political prospects has diminished somewhat. Nevertheless, some headwinds remain  intense. Most  notably,  fiscal  policy  has  turned  increasingly  contractionary  this  year,  and  the global  economy  remains  weak.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us  to  continue  making  modest progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps over  the next few years. Even  with  substantial  monetary  stimulus,  it  will  take  many  years  of  above-trend  growth to return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity  and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2  percent inflation target for the next few years. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and diminishing  slack  eventually pull inflation back  to  our objective.

Respondent 2: The sequester's effects  are obscuring  a step up in the underlying pace of the recovery that is being driven by households'  increased  confidence  in their longer-term  prospects. Household wealth  is rising, access to consumer  credit  is expanding,  and  employment prospects  are  improving. U.S. corporations have locked in low-cost financing, enjoy high profit margins, and are flush with cash. While  regulatory  and  fiscal-policy  uncertainty  remain  a  drag  on  investment  and  hiring,  and  the economic  outlook  overseas  remains  cloudy,  demand  uncertainty  overall  has  eased.

Inflation  remains  tame. It is more  likely  to  move  up  than  down  from  current  levels.

Respondent 3: I expect the economy to recover at a moderate rate from 2013 through 2015, reflecting  a range  of forces. On  the  negative  side,  U.S.  fiscal  policy  and  slowing  growth  abroad  pose headwinds,  and  the  ongoing  sovereign  debt  situation  in  Europe  will contribute  to uncertainty. But these  forces should  abate  over  time,  and  growth  should  pick  up  as  low  interest  rates  and  expanding credit  availability  stimulate  interest-sensitive  sectors,  the  housing  recovery  continues  to  broaden,  and the  healing  labor  market  supports  the  economy's  usual  self-correcting  forces.

Recent inflation readings have been unexpectedly low,  and year-over-year  PCE inflation  measures have drifted down  toward  the  neighborhood  of 1 percent. There  appear  to be  a number  of  factors behind  this  disinflation,  including  slowing  global  growth  that  is  weighing  on  goods  inflation,  subdued labor  costs  that  are  limiting  services  inflation, and  technical  differences  that  explain  why  CPI-based measures have not fallen as much. Nevertheless, I expect that the combination of well-anchored inflation expectations  and  an  improving  economy  that strengthens  the  labor  market  and pushes up wage growth  will help bring inflation back  toward the 2 percent long-run objective over the next three years.

As to uncertainty  and  risks, uncertainty  is elevated due to the U.S. fiscal outlook  and  Europe's recession and ongoing  fiscal troubles, but it is comparable  to  historical norms  of the last 20 years. While a stronger-than-expected U.S. housing  recovery  could provide a  lift to growth, on net the risks are skewed  to the downside. For inflation, I believe the uncertainty  surrounding  the  forecast  to be consistent with historical norms  and  the risks to be balanced. As I noted above, if downside  risks to the pace of the recovery were to materialize, inflation could slow. Alternatively, the continued

expansion of our balance sheet  could eventually  cause inflation expectations and, in turn, inflation to rise.

Respondent 4: The key factors shaping our forecast are the same as they have been for some time. The diminution of fiscal restraint, support from  accommodative  monetary policy, and improved household  and  business  balance  sheets  should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move through the projection period. Pent-up demands  for  capital goods and consumer  durables should provide a further impetus to growth. Demand from abroad is projected to firm in  2014  and  2015  as Europe  emerges  from  recession  and  growth  in  emerging  market  economies  picks  back  up. Together, these  factors are assumed to produce above-potential growth in  2014 and 2015, though we project some modest  resource gaps  will still remain at the end of  2015. Resource slack thus is expected to exert  some downward influence  on inflation through much of the projection period. However, under  our view of appropriate  monetary policy,  enough  accommodation  will remain  in place  (and be  expected  to remain in place) to support inflation expectations and produce  an  updrift in inflation over the projection period. We  assume  this  accommodation  will  be  sufficient  to  produce  a  modest  overshooting  of  the  2 percent  inflation  target,  but  not  until  after  the  end  of  the  current  projection  period.

Respondent 5: Although  incoming  data  continues  to  be  somehat  mixed,  the  proposition  that  economic performace  is  on a steady,  if not particularly steep, upward  trajectory has been  strenghtened simply by virtue of the fact that there has not been any backsliding over the past nine months  or so. Household  deleveraging,  while  incomplete,  has  likely  proceeded  far enough  to create the conditions for moderate  self-sustaining  growth  of  a sort that has been  hard  to achieve over the previous four years. Serious downside risks have abated  somewhat in recent  months, though the potential  for tension around  fiscal and debt limit issues remains. If this decent economic  performance  continues over the next few  months, a period during which  sequestration is likely to be exerting  a  more negative effect, the  case  for  continued  improvement  will  be  even  more  convincing.

On  the  other  hand,  while  the  case  for  self-sustaining  growth  grows  more  convincing,  there  is  little sign  of  a  real  take-off. Fiscal  tightening  and  continued  uncertainty  over  budget  matters  constitute  one drag. There  is  virtually  no  sign  of  a  kind  of  wage  growth  that  could  accelerate  a  virtuous  cycle. And, while  the  chances  of  high  stress  in  Europe  have  diminished,  foreign  economic  performance  is  likely  to be  a headwind  rather  than  a  tailwind.

Respondent 6: Incoming data have been  roughly  in  line  with  expectations. Fiscal policy  is now tighter, as the previously anticipated compromise  to  avoid the effects of full sequestration has not materialized. The  tighter  stance  of  fiscal  policy  is offset, to some  extent,  by  faster  growth  in  private sector  demand. Consumer  expenditures  have  been  resilient  as  larger-than-expected  gains  in  houshold net worth  have compensated  for  the  slow growth  in disposable income  caused  by  the tightening of fiscal policy. Consumer  sentiment is improving, with households now expecting somewhat faster income  gains  going  forward. Residential  investment  activity  is  robust,  and  forward-looking  indicators point to a continuing upward  trend. Business investment, in contrast, has been subdued  as firms remain  cautious  in  their spending  decisions  despite  high  profit margins. Developments  in  the  labor market have been  about  as  expected,  with  modest  improvements  likely  to  continue  throughout  the year. The  still-large  amount  of  slack in  labor  markets  is  showing through  low  readings  of  core  inflation, which  is  running  well  below  target.

The  main  factors shaping the  contours of the forecast have not changed. Real  activity is  constrained significantly this year by fiscal policy, which  is expected  to subtract 1.3 percentage  points  to GDP growth. As the effects of the fiscal policy start to wane  later this year, the pace of  activity  is forecast to pick  up  and  generate  a  virtuous  cycle  in  terms  of  improved  confidence  and  spending. A  continued highly  accommodative stance of  monetary policy is needed to support such  an outcome.  We expect the current  assets  purchase  program  to  total  $1.1  trillion. With  this  policy  stimulus,  the  unemployment

rate is expected  to  fall  to  7.3 percent  by  the  end  of  this  year,  and  to  6.7  percent  by  the  end  of  2014. The unemployment rate is projected to reach 6 percent,  with inflation  running  still below  target, by the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Downside  risks  to the real economic  outlook have diminished but  are  still predominant because of the  limited  scope  for  policy  action. The  situation  in  Europe  remains  vulnerable  to  bouts  of  severe stress,  and  a  weaker  outlook  in  Europe  and  in  emerging  market  economies  than  we  are  factoring  into our baseline forecast is  more than a  tail risk. Core inflation readings have been low recently, and while these  low readings  may  prove  transitory  a  longer-lasting  period  of  low  inflation  cannot  be  ruled  out at this point.

Respondent 7: Government  spending  cuts  and  weakened  foreign  demand  will  continue  to  weigh against  near-term  growth. Modest  growth  expectations  will  likely  impede  expansionary  investment, and subpar demand  for workers will keep income growth in check. New business formation will continue  to  be  restrained  by  limited  access  to  credit.

These headwinds working against a stronger recovery  are expected to dissipate over  time,  allowing for a modest step-up in the pace of growth  later in the year and in  2014. Under this scenario, progress against  joblessness  proceeds  at  a  modest  pace  and  price  pressures  remain  muted.

The  forces  restraining  growth  could  prove  to  be  persistent,  delaying,  for  a  time,  a  significant  step up  in the  pace  of  growth. These  downside  risks  are  balanced  against  improving  household  confidence and wealth positions that could provide a boost consumer  spending. Favorable  corporate  liquidity and  credit  conditions,  combined  with  some  pent-up  demand  for  investment,  may  provide  greater  lift to investment  spending  should  business  optimism  improve.

Respondent 8: House  and equity prices have increased considerably more than I'd anticipated, generating  wealth  effects  that  are  apt  to  strengthen  consumer  spending  and  reduce  credit  availability constraints  over  time. The  recovery  in  housing  is  continuing  and  preliminary  evidence  suggests  that consumer spending has held up well in the face of the tax increases that went into effect at the beginning  of the year. Although  fiscal drag  is currently depressing  growth, my  expectation  is that growth  will increase in the second half of this year and  strengthen further next year. That said, recent data  has  been  mixed  with  weakness  evident  in  capex  and  manufacturing  output,  perhaps  reflecting  a slowdown in  emerging  market growth, including in China.  Although growth overall has been moderate and  trendlike, unemployment  has  declined  significantly  over  the  last  nine  months  by  far more  than I'd anticipated  at  the  start of our asset purchase  program. In part, this decline  reflects surprisingly sluggish productivity growth-a development that I do not expect to  continue as the  economy  recovers. This  means  that, unless growth  strengthens  notably,  the  progress  we've  seen  in  the  labor  market  is unlikely to be sustained. In addition, a portion of the decline in unemployment  appears  to  reflect a decline in labor force participation. Whereas  Tealbook  largely  interprets  this  as  a  steeper  decline in the labor  force participation  trend,  there  is  a distinct  possibility  that  it instead  reflects  a cyclical shortfall in an exceptionally weak  labor market. If so, the decline in the unemployment  rate  may considerably overstate the  actual improvement that's occurred in the labor  market. Inflation has been running  significantly  below  levels  consistent  with  our  inflation  target  and  the  inflation  surprises  have been to the downside. Such weakness in infation could, ina addition to transitory factors, reflect greater labor market slack than suggested by the decline in the unemployment  rate. Fortunately, inflation  expectations appear  to be stable thus far, a  factor that underpins my  forecast that inflation will gradually  pick  up  to  mandate  consistent  levels  as  the  recovery  proceeds.

Respondent 9: Underlying growth fundamentals are improving:  Housing activity (including prices) are strengthening,  state  and  local governments  are  no  longer  cutting, financial conditions  are fairly benign (monetary poliy, less stress in Europe, healthy US banking system). Labor markets have

improved  a  bit  faster  than  expected;  together  with  wealth  increases  (houses,  stocks)  stronger  employment  has  supported  consumer  confidence  and  household  spending. These  fundamentals  are  battling the restraint from  fiscal policy and, to a lesser extent, a somewhat  tepid  global  economy. As fiscal drag  wanes,  growth  should  pick  up  some. Higher  Treasury/mortgage  rates  pose  some  risk,  as  does  a stronger  dollar.

Recent disinflation bears watching, but I find plausible the story that there  are several special  and temporary  factors  at  work. Also,  all the  evidence  taken  together  suggests  that  inflation  expectations are pretty well anchored  although  the recent decline in breakevens  is reasonably  large. Downward wage  stickiness  and  low  productivity  (implying  a  lower  limit  to  unit  labor  cost  growth)  may  prevent further  declines  in  inflation  in  any  case.

Respondent 10: The  key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regardling  lift-off  in  2015  include  review of a set of financial  and  economic indicators that  together do not yet suggest that the  economy  could withstand  an  early  monetary polkicy  contraction. Firms appear to be hiring, but job quality  does not appear  strong  enough  to  fuel  an  increase  in real disposable  incomes. Households  are  enjoying  more wealth effects, and household  confidence has improved, largely driven by increases in home  equity prices.

Recent  volatility  in  financial  markets  is  sending  a  message,  in part,  that  the  Committee's  communications are  confusing. Increases in 10 year Treasury yeilds are not entirely reflective on an improivng economy, but are also reflective of the potential for  markets to draw forward in  time all the expected future contraction. In addition, turmoil in emerging markets suggests that better communication could  reduce  damaging  lurches  in  global  apital  flows.

Respondent 11: While  I  believe  the  extent  of  fiscal  drag  will  diminish  somewhat  over  the  forecast period, regulatory policies  will  continue to inhibit growth, firms  will  continue to  face  significant uncertainty  over  possible  future  tax  and  regulatory  actions,  and  households  will  remain  quite  cautious by  historical  standards.

Respondent 12: As  at the time  of the last SEP,  the  basic  narrative  I have  in mind  is one where the private-sector economy-and  particular  the  consumer  side  and  housing-is  showing  clear  signs  of forward  momentum. As the drag from  the sequester  fades, this underlying  strength  should  lead  to faster  growth  in  late  2013  and  beyond,  which  in  turn  should  help  boost  business  capital  spending  and manufacturing  output. In  terms of risks, as fiscal threats move to the background, one uncertainty that is coming  to  the  forefront  is  the  uncertainty  created  in  financial  markets  by  our  own  exit. I view  the increase  in  bond  yields  and  implied  volatilities  in  recent  weeks  as  a  largely  healthy  development,  but also  as a reminder  that  market  dynamics  are  hard  to  predict  and  can  be  more  violent  than  expected. The  risk  of  things  getting  disorderly  in  credit  or  MBS  markets  strikes  me  as  low  at  this  time,  but  not entirely  negligible.

Respondent 13: The  housing  market  continues  to  strengthen. Most  of  the  frictions  in  the  housing market  seem  to  have  moved  to  the  demand  side. At  the same  time  I  still expect  significant  pent-up demand  to  materialize from the extraordinarily low level of household formation  over the last 5 years. I believe that effects from the recent back-up in rates  will be offset by  continued improvement in credit conditions  that  is driven by  competition  for  loans  and demand  for  credit based  assets. Even  in the mortgage  market,  credit  conditions  may  ease  for purchase  mortgages  once refinance volume begins  to subside.

Respondent 14: As  uncertainty  over  U.S.  fiscal  policy  fades I expect  that  business  spending  will pick up. Although household deleveraging  continues, I  expect it to become less of a drag going forward as household  balance  sheets  improve.

I expect  3 percent  growth  over  the medium  term,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. With  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6  percent  by  the  end  of  2015,  at  which  time  it reaches  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will  rise to 2 percent  in  2014  and  2015. Inflation  stays  anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in  response  to tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary  policy  by  ending  purchases  sometime  this  year  and  then  beginning  to  raise  rates  in  the second  half  of  2013.

Respondent 15: I continue  to  expect  that  the  economy  will  strengthen  meaningfully  but  gradually over  the  rest  of 2013  and  2014.

Respondent 16: Other conditioning assumptions: We  expect the lower degree of inflation persistence evident  since  the early 1990s  to continue. Inflation expectations  remain  well  anchored. We project real foreign GDP growth (GDP weighted)  at  2.6% in  2013 and  3.0% in  2014, which  are slightly different from  March. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  dollar  exchange  rate  are  similar  to those in the Tealbook. Reflecting intermeeting  developments,  our  assumed  path  of  WTI  oil  prices, based on recent futures quotes, has moved up  modestly to  $93.50 for  2013Q4, but moved down modestly to $89.00 for 2014Q4. Unlike in March,  our  federal fiscal assumptions  are  similar to those in the Tealbook,  with  significant  fiscal restraint through  the  forecast  horizon. We  adopt  the  Tealbook assumptions  regarding  equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: Although  some  details  may  have  changed,  the  conceptual  underpinnings  of  our  forecast for growth  and  inflation in 2013 and 2014 are little changed  from  those  in March. We  continue  to expect that the fiscal drag  will be sizable in  2013, in large part because of the expiration of the payroll tax holiday, higher  tax rates for higher-income  taxpayers,  and  the  implementation  of  sequestration. Although real  PCE growth has been stronger so  far this year than we  anticipated at the beginning  of the year, private investment  and government  expenditures have been weaker. Overall, fiscal drag  and the  uncertainty  related  to  it  is  expected  to  hold  down  business  investment  spending  as  well  as  public expenditures  over  the  first  half  of the year. As  such, growth  of  real GDP  over  2013H1  thus  is  likely to be  around  2%  (annual  rate).

In 2013H2,  we  expect  growth  also  to  be  a  little  over  2 1 2 / %  (annual  rate),  reflecting  two  opposing factors. On the negative side  are the significant headwinds from fiscal drag (we  expect the impact from sequestration  to peak in Q2  and Q3) and  recent slow global  economic growth (which has restrained export growth  and production). On the positive side is the subsiding of headwinds  associated  with household  deleveraging  and  restricted  access  to  credit-in  fact,  household  leverage  and  net  worth  have improved  and  credit  standards  have  eased  over  the  first  part  of  this  year. Also  supporting  growth  is the  turnaround  in  the  housing  market,  leading  to  gains  in  residential  investment  as  well  as  to  greater confidence  that has a positive impact  on  consumer  spending. Over  the second  half of the year, we expect some subsiding of the global headwinds  with world growth beginnig to pick  up  as the Euro area emerges  from  recession  and  Japan  as  well  as many  emerging  economies  respond  to  policy  stimulus. Finally,  the  monetary  accommodation  in  the  US  and  other  advanced  economies  begins  to  have  a  more substantial  impact  on  the  US  economy. For all of 2013, we  expect  growth  of  real GDP  of  around  2 1 4 / %,  with  the  unemployment  rate  ending  the  year  around  7 1 2 / %.

By  2014, we expect the fiscal drag and the other headwinds to growth to diminish further,  allowing the full force of monetary  accommodation  and  the  natural healing of the economy  to be realized. Growth  in  that  year  is  likely  to  be  around  3 1 4 / %,  with  business  fixed  investment  providing  a  greater contribution  than  we  expect  for  this  year. The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  decline  by  almost

one full percentage  point  over the year to 6 1 2 / %. These  trends  continue  into 2015, with projected growth  a  little  higher  than  in  2014  and  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  6%.

Overall  and  core PCE  inflation  so  far in 2013  has been  below  our  projections. We  expect  lower inflation to persist over the near term so that both total and core PCE  inflation in 2013 are now expected  to  be  1.1%. In  2014,  we  anticipate  that  the  combination  of  the  economy  establishing  greater forward  momentum  and  reducing  slack,  global  demand  firming,  and  the  foreign  exchange  value  of  the dollar depreciating  to  start to firm core goods  inflation, which  has  been  an  important  source  of  the recent slowing of inflation. We  thus expect both total and core inflation to move  gradually  higher in 2014  to  2%  for  total  PCE  and  1.8%  for  core  PCE. With  inflation  expectations  anchored,  inflation remains  near  its  objective  in  2015.

Respondent 17: The economy  has been hit by a mix of shocks. Some  of these push down  on employment  and  inflation  - we  can  think  of  these  as  'demand'  shocks. These  shocks  present  no  dual mandate tensions: a  monetary policy that returns inflation exactly to target in the face of these shocks will also  return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

But there have been  other shocks that push  up  on inflation while pushing  down  on  employment  we  can think of these as 'supply' shocks. Typically, when responding  to these shocks using  a balanced approach  to  the  dual  mandate,  appropriate  monetary  policy  will  lead  inflation  to  be  above  target  for some  time.

In terms  of  risks:

- 1. The  main  risk  to  the  outlook  is  monetary  policy.

Will we continue to use all of our tools to mitigate deviations of employment  and  prices from their longer  run  levels? Or  will we  let fear of the  unknown  unknowns  lead  us  to  back  away  from  our September  'whatever  it  takes'  stance? If the latter, we  should  anticipate  that  households  and  firms will see the  economy  as  less  insulated  against  tail  risks  - and  so  reduce  their  current  spending.

- 2. Relatedly: we could see a continued decline  in inflation expectations. We have  few  tools to defend  against  this  possibility  - and  that  alone  increases  the  chance  that  they  could  decline  further.
- 3. As well, there are significant external risks. The European  recession  could well turn out to be even deeper than anticipated. Chinese  growth  could  well be a percentage  point or two lower than anticipated  in  the  medium  term. The  results  of  Abenomics  remain  unclear. All  of these  could  lead  to external  demand  for  US  goods  being  unexpectedly  low.

Respondent 18: I expect an improving  economy  in  the  near  term. I am  assuming  a  reasonable resolution  of  fiscal  issues  and  some  improvement  in  the  outlook  overseas.

Respondent 19: Despite  1-1/2 percentage point  of  fiscal  tightening this year,  the  economy continues to grow at a moderate  pace  of about 2 percent this year. Moreover, as the economy  continues  to recover, I expect growth  to pick up to about  2-1/2 percent next year and 3 percent in 2015. The pick-up  in  growth  reflects  an  improving  labor  market,  rising  household  net  worth  from  both  the  stock market  and  housing,  and  a  pickup  in  foreign  growth.

I continue to see sustained improvements  in labor market  conditions. The unemployment  rate has  fallen  fairly  steadily  since  2010  and  employment  continues  to  grow  faster  than  what  is  needed  to absorb population  growth. With  my  outlook  for  an  increase  in  growth  and  continued  improvement  in labor  markets,  the  unemployment  rate  should  continue  declining.

Although inflation is low and the 5y/5y-ahead measure of breakeven inflation has declined, I would  note  that  the  5y/5y-ahead  breakeven  inflation  rate  remains  within  historical  ranges. And  while wage  inflation remains  below  its historical average, it has remained  steady  and  has  shown  no  signs of deceleration over the last few years. Therefore, with an improving labor market and stronger growth,  we  should  see  an  increase  in  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon. Moreover,  if  we  maintain  our accommodative  monetary policy (federal funds rate, forward guidance, and  asset purchases), inflation

could  rise  above  2  percent  in  2015. Therefore,  I  think  ending  asset  purchases  this  year  and  an  earlier lift-off in the funds rate are needed to  maintain inflation  close to our 2 percent objective.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Since March,  the data  on  spending  and  labor  markets have,  on balance, been  in line with  my  expectations. The  unemployment  data  have  come  in  lower  than  I  had  anticipated,  and I have  revised  down  my  natural-rate  path  a  bit. These  factors  have  led  me  to  lower  my  path  for  the unemployment  rate. Incoming  data  have  also  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for  core  and  headline inflation. I now  expect inflation in the next  few years to be a bit further below  our 2 percent objective, and  to  remain  there  longer.

Respondent 2: So  far  this  year,  both  real  growth  and  inflation  have  come  in  at  lower  levels  than  I had expected, but I  see  little  reason to change my  forecasts for the second half of  2013 and beyond.

Respondent 3: Myforecast for GDP growth is  little changed on net since the March SEP, as positive developments affecting  consumers have been offset by  weaker growth prospects abroad. The strength of the labor market recovery has  once  again been  faster than  anticipated,  and I have  again  revised down  my path  for  the  unemployment  rate. At  this point,  my  unemployment  rate  forecast  is  about 1 2 / percentage  point  lower  starting  in  2013  and  continuing  through  2015  compared  with  my  September SEP submission, when the open-ended asset purchase program began.  Given the  combination of faster labor  market improvements but  little  change to growth, I have revised down my  estimate of potential output  growth,  both  in  the  near- and  long-term. At  the  same  time,  inflation  readings  have  surprised to the downside,  especially  for  PCE  measures,  and I have revised my  expected  inflation path down based  on  this  lower  starting  point. But  I  continue  to  anticipate  that  an  improving  economy  will  help pull inflation toward  our 2 percent  long-run objective over the next few years.

Respondent 4: GDP  growth  during  the  first  quarter  was  about  1/2  percentage  point  weaker  than we had anticipated. The miss had  little impact on our top line GDP  numbers for the rest of the year, but in light of sectoral errors and the incoming  higher-frequency  data, we lowered our outlook for business investment  and  raised our projection  for consumption. The  improvement  in  labor  market conditions, increases in household  wealth, and gains in consumer  sentiment  were  important  for  the PCE revision.  The lack of any  meaningful budget negotiations also has led us to take on board the full impact  of  the sequestration  into  our  forecast. The  inflation  data  have  been  softer  than  we  thought; since March,  many  of  our  inflation  models have revised down  1/4 percent over  the  entire projection period. We  have  brought  our  inflation  projections  down  by  a  similar  amount.

Respondent 5: Not  much  change  in  my  forecast  since  March. I have  marked  down  unemployment by a few  tenths  of a percentage  point  during  the  projection  period,  in  part  based  on  the  persistence of decent job growth numbers and in part by the increasing difficulty of ignoring the trend that unemployment  has  taken  in  the  last  nine  months. I also marked  down  inflation,  but  only  for 2013, on the assumption  the Tealbook's expectation that the factors that reduced inflation recently are transitory  is  likely  correct.

Respondent 6: Changes  to  the  forecast have been  relatively  minor. The projected path  for  core inflation  is slightly  lower,  as  we  took  some  signal  from  the  recent  lower-than-expected  readings  when assessing  the  near- to  medium-term  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 7: My  growth  forecast  is  unchanged  from  what  I  submitted  in  March. The  incoming data have caused  me  to reduce  my projection  for  the unemployment  rate  by  a  few  tenths per year over  the forecast  horizon. I have  significantly  reduced  my  2014  and  2015  inflation  and  core  inflation forecast  on  the  basis  of  the  softness  seen  in  the  retail  price  numbers  in  recent  quarters.

Respondent 8: My forecasts for GDP growth through  2015 are virtually unchanged since the March SEP  round,  but  I've lowered  my  forecast  for unemployment  in  light  of  the decline we've seen since that time. I've lowered  my  near-term  forecast  for inflation, again in recognition  of the surprises in incoming  data. In light of the downward  revision  to my  unemployment  rate  forecast, I've slightly moved  in  my  estimated  date  of  liftoff  for  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 9: Somewhat  more positive  flow  on  employment,  even  though  activity  data have been mixed. I was  concerned  in  the  last round  that  fiscal restraint might  be  larger  than  forecasted  (e.g., the full sequester  was  imposed)  but  thus  far  the  effects  of  that  restraint  have  been  relatively  muted. Inflation  data  have  been  lower  than  expected  but  I  haven't  taken  too  much  signal  from  that. Higher yields  and  greater  volatility  may  create  modest  drag  in  the  remainder  of  the  year.

Respondent 10: I have permitted my forecasts to incorporate the staff's technical corrections regarding  a  reduction  in  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I view  these  corrections  as  mostly  technical and  not  reflective  of  a  substantial  improvement  in  reducing  the  output  gap  or  labor  market  slack.

Respondent 11: After  4 years  of sluggish  growth  I  no  longer  expect  a  substantial  accelleration  in real GDP.

Respondent 12: My  forecasts for the labor market  and  for output  are very close to where  they were in the previous  SEP.  I have lowered  my  near-term  inflation forecast a bit, taking some  signal from  the  recent  data  readings.

Respondent 13: My  forecast is not substantially different from my  previous  submission. I have marked down the path  for unemployment in response to improvements seen since the  last submission. And  I  have  marked  down  my  estimate  of  near  term  inflation  to  account  for  recent  readings.

Respondent 14: Recent  weaker-than-expected  data  led  me  to  revise  down  my  forecast  for  output growth  and  inflation  in 2013. As a consequence,  my  forecast  for  the  federal  funds  rate path  is now lower  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 15: I have  not  changed  my  forecast  materially  but  have  gained  some  confidence  in  it. I take  some  heart  that  the  economy  has  kept  decent  momentum  despite  tight  fiscal  policy  this  year.

Respondent 16: Business  investment  indicators have been  weaker  than we  anticipated  in March, which probably partly reflects some knockdown effects from tighter fiscal policy and uncertainty associated with fiscal policy as well as somewhat softer  global economic  growth. We have  carried some  of  that  weakness  forward,  and  have  reduced  our  investment  forecasts  for  2013H2  and  2014.

Q1 real  PCE growth was above  our  expectations. We  only  take a small signal from the higher Q1 growth,  and  thus  only  modestly  adjusted  our  PCE  projection. On  net,  the  revisions  to  the business investment and  real PCE projections  lead to a small reduction in the  2014 real GDP growth forecast.

The  inflation data  so far in 2013 have been  lower  than  we projected  in March. In response, we have reduced  our near-term projections  for both  total  and  core  PCE inflation. However, because we still see  much  of  the  reduction  in  inflation  as  reflecting  temporary  factors,  with  inflation  expectations still fairly stable,  we  have  not  made  significant  changes  to  our  medium-term  inflation  forecasts.

Respondent 17: We've seen surprisingly low  levels of inflation. That's pushed down  - yet  again! -on  the  unemployment  rates  that  I  see  as  consistent  with  2%  inflation  in  the  near  and  medium-term.

As a result, under  appropriate  monetary policy,  my projected  unemployment  rate path  is  lower and  my projected  output path is higher than at the  last SEP.

Respondent 18: Recent  data  on  real  growth  and  inflation  have  caused  my  near-term  forecasts  for these variables to be reduced. These  data  have  also led me  to reduce  my  estimates  of inflation for 2014  and  2015. The peak  of  the  overshooting  of  inflation  is  now  forecasted  for  2016  rather  than  2015.

Respondent 19: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  has  not  been  revised. However,  I  have  taken  on board  the  decline  in the unemployment  rate  and  reduced  my  forecasts  by  0.1  percentage  point  over the forecast horizon. In addition, given recent declines in inflation (core and total), I reduced  my forecast  for  2013. I continue  to  see  an  increase  in  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon,  but  starting  from a lower  level.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: My  forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent 2: My  projections  for  2013  are quite similar to those in the Tealbook. In 2014  and 2015, I  expect slightly slower GDP growth, a bit  less progress in lowering the unemployment rate, and a more  rapid  return  of  inflation  to  target. I assume  somewhat  less  monetary-policy  accommodation.

Respondent 3: My  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook. I expect  that  GDP  growth  will  rise above trend in the second half of this year and  remain above trend through  2015, which  will bring the unemployment  rate  down  toward  its  natural  rate  in  2016  and  pull  inflation  up  toward  our  2  percent long-term objective. I also share the Tealbook's assumption that it  will be appropriate to wind down our  asset  purchase  program  sooner  than  market  participants  currently  expect.

Respondent 4: Our top-line GDP  forecast is similar to the Tealbook's, but our composition  of growth is different-our projection for consumption  is not as strong as the Tealbook, but we have somewhat  higher  BFI  and  a  smaller  decline  in  government  purchases. We  also assume  a  somewhat faster pace of potential  output growth than the Tealbook. Given the similarity  in  our GDP  forecasts, this leaves us with  a bit larger output  and  unemployment  gaps  at  the  end  of  the  projection  period. Our inflation forecasts are similar, however, reflecting our more accommodative monetary policy assumptions  (see  above).

Respondent 5: No  major  analytic  differences

Respondent 6: My  forecast  is  conditioned  on  somewhat  greater  policy  stimulus  than  in  the  Tealbook. Still, the  two  forecasts  are  similar,  both  on  the  real  and  on  the  inflation  side.

Respondent 7: My  growth  path  tracks  roughly 1 2 / percentage  point  under  the  Tealbook  over  the forecast horizon. This is a difference in perception about the pace of growth  for potential GDP, not a important disagreement  about  the  cyclical dynamics  of  the recovery. For a similar reason, my inflation projection  runs  somewhat  above  the  Tealbook  over  the  next  few  years. My  forecast  for the rate of unemployment  is  essentially  the  same  as  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Only  marginal  differences.

Respondent 10: My  forecast  assumes a  $900 billion  stock of  asset purchases rather than the lower amount  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 11: While I  share the Tealbook's belief that  trend  real GDP growth is near 2 percent, I believe  that  the  level  of  real  GDP  is  near  trend  and  thus  there  is  little  room  for  above-trend  growth. I believe inflation is likely to return to 2 percent  more  quickly  than the Tealbook  indicates. I also expect labor force participation to decline  more rapidly than in the Tealbook, and thus unemployment will decline  more  rapidly  than  might  be  suggested  by  my  GDP  forecast.

Respondent 12: In this round,  I  am  almost  on  top  of  the  Tealbook  forecasts. In the  previous  few rounds, I had been  a  few  tenths  more  optimistic  in terms  of my projections  for  the unemployment rate, but the adjustments  made  in  the Tealbook  to the labor-market  assumptions  have  brought  us almost  exactly  in  line  with  one  another.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: My forecast  calls for stronger growth, higher inflation, and tighter  monetary policy in 2013  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 15: I assume somewhat slower growth in  2014 and  2015, and therefore slower progress in reducing  unemployment.

Respondent 16: As stated in our response to question 3, we assume (based on our modal  economic forecast) that the asset purchase program lasts through  2014Q1 (with a slowing of the pace of purchases beginning  in  2013Q4)  rather  than  through  2013Q3  as  the  Tealbook  assumes. Because  of  the  greater size and  duration  in  the  balance  sheet  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  assume  that  term  premia  rise  to normal  levels  more  slowly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2014  is  similar  to  that  of  the  Tealbook,  but  the  composition of growth differs between  the two  forecasts. The Tealbook projects higher  consumption  growth  than in our  forecast;  the  difference  appears  to  reflect  a  stronger  wealth  effect  than  we  have  in  our  forecast. With higher  consumption growth from wealth effects, the Tealbook  also projects the saving  rate to decline  further,  while  our  forecast  has  the  saving  rate  rising  modestly  as  we  see  the  recent  decline  to be a transitory  movement associated  with the pulling  forward of income  into  2012Q4. The Tealbook projects slower growth in business fixed investment than in  our  forecast; the reason  for this difference appears  to  be  that  the  Tealbook  has  a  stronger  restraining  effect  on  investment  from  higher  corporate borrowing  rates  than  we  have  in  our  forecast.

With  the  changes  in the Tealbook  unemployment  rate projection  associated  with  its  changes  in supply side assumptions, the Tealbook unemployment  forecast is now similar to our projection.  However, the sources  of the decline in the two  forecasts  appear  to  have  some  differences. The  Tealbook sees the decline coming  in part from a more  rapid decline in the natural rate of unemployment  as well as more  marginally  attached  workers  deciding  to  move  out  of  the  labor  force  permanently. The Tealbook  thus  lowered  its labor force participation forecast and has it declining modestly  over the forecast horizon. We  see the decline in unemployment  as  the  result  of the labor market  flows and dynamics that  are  more typical  for this stage of  an  expansion, and we project that the  labor  force participation  rate  will  rise  modestly  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Compensation  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  is  above  that  in  our  forecast. The  source  of  that difference  is  not  yet  clear.

We see a stronger influence of  anchored inflation  expectations  on inflation dynamics than does the Tealbook. Consequently,  our  inflation forecast and the Tealbook  forecast are similar for 2013, but beyond  that  we  see  total  and  core  inflation  rising  more  quickly  to  near  2%  than  does  the  Tealbook. This difference may also partially reflect the differing  monetary policy assumptions in the two forecasts.

The  Tealbook  has  a  downside  balance  of  risks  to  real  growth,  while  we  assess  the  risks  as  roughly balanced. In part, this difference may  reflect divergent  views about the probability that the headwinds could  diminish  more  quickly  than  anticipated  and  lead  to  a  more  rapid  healing  process  for the real economy. For inflation, we agree with the Tealbook  that  the  risks are broadly  balanced. However, we see uncertainty  around  both  the  real activity and inflation forecasts as still higher than normal whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that the unusual nature  of  the  current  expansion  as well  as a policy  environment  that  is  constrained by  the effective lower bound  leaves  uncertainty  about  both  real  activity and  inflation above  normal  levels.

The  recent  volatility  in  global  financial  markets  seems  consistent  to  us  with  large  uncertainty  about the  economic  outlook.

Respondent 17: I see appropriate  monetary  policy  as  being  more  accommodative  than  the  TB's assumed  policy  stance. As  a result,  I'm  forecasing  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  more  rapidly and  the  inflation  rate  will  rise  more  rapidly  than  does  the  TB.

Respondent 18: I anticipate slower growth in  2014  and  a higher  long-run umpemplyment  rate than the Tealbook. Generally  speaking,  I  anticipate  higher  inflation  than  in  the  Tealbook. Plus,  I expect an  overshooting  of  inflation  before  its  convergence  to  2  percent.

Respondent 19: In comparison  with  Tealbook,  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  are  lower  and  my  forecasts  for unemployment  are higher. I expect inflation to be somewhat higher than Tealbook due to the continuation  of  the  currently  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy. In response  to  these  pressures that threaten the stability of  long-term inflation  expectations  and increase the risks of future  economic and  financial  imbalances,  my  views  of  appropriate  policy  would  call  for  a  lift-off  of  the  federal  funds rate  in 2014.
