Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  (rounded  to  the  nearest 1 8 / percentage  point)  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  June  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  June  16-17,  2015.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In June 2015, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, 2016, and 2017 were, respectively, 15, 2, and 0. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: By  2018,  I  expect  inflation  to  be  back  to  2  percent  but  the  unemployment  rate  to be  somewhat  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  (a  necessary  condition  for  getting  inflation  back  to  our objective  over  the  medium  term). As  a result, I anticipate  that  it will take  roughly  five  or six years for the  economy  to  fully  return  to  equilibrium.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: All measure  converge in less than 6 years. GDP  growth  will converge in 2017, inflation will converge in 2018, and unemployment  will converge in 2020. Prior to convergence, I expect  the unemployment  rate  to  decline  further  below  its  long-run  value  of  5.8%  and  the  inflation measures  to  overshoot  2%.

Respondent 4: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  takes  less than 5 years. Specifically, I expect real GDP  growth  to  slow  to its longer-run rate after 2018 and inflation  to  rise  to  close  to  2  percent  in  2016. The  unemployment  rate  has  reached  my  estimate  of  its longer-run  level  in  the  third  quarter  of  2015,  and  I  expect  it  will  fall  below  its  longer-run  level  in  2016, 2017,  and  2018,  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 5: No  comment

Respondent 6: NA

Respondent 9: Convergence  to  the  mandated  goals  is  expected  to  occur  over  the  2017-18  period.

Respondent 10: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  sustainable  rate  by  the  end of 2015  and  then  fall  past  that  level. The  unemployment  rate  is  likely  to  stay  below  the  sustainable rate  through  2018. To  avoid  creating  significant  economic  imbalances,  it  is  important  that  a  prolonged overshoot  of  the  sustainable  rate  be  avoided. I expect  inflation  to  near  our  2-percent  objective  in  2017 and  to  surpass  it  in  2018. Inflation  is  unlikely  to  return  to  target  until  2019  or  later.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: I expect the unemployment  rate  to  be close to 5 percent, its longer-run value, through  2018. I expect  real  GDP  per  worker  to  grow  at  about  a  1.3  percent  annual  rate  over  time. I expect  the  working  age  population  to  grow  at  a  1.0  percent  annual  rate,  and  I  expect  the  labor  force participation  rate  to  decline  by  0.2  percent  per  year. Accordingly  I  see  the  trend  in  real  GDP  growth at 1.8 percent,  which  is  my  projection  for  2018.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: As  is usual  following  the  annual  revisions  of  GDP  and  productivity,  we  have  reassessed  our  longer-run  assumptions  and  have  made  some  changes  to  those  assumptions. First,  we  now see  the  economy's  potential  growth  rate  as  within  a  range  centered  somewhat  below  2%;  consequently, we  have  lowered  our  point  estimate  to  1 3 4 / %  (rounded  to  1.8%  in  this  submission). We  discuss  our reasoning  for  this  change  in  4(b).

Second,  we  continue  to  assess  that  a  reasonable  range  for  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4% to 6%;  however,  we  have  lowered  our  point  estimate  to  4 3 4 / %  (rounded  to  4.8%  in  this  submission). This  change  is based  on  staff analysis  that has been  conducted  in  recent  months  that  we  discuss  in 4(b).

We  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  its  longer-run  level  by  the  end  of  2016,  and  that it will remain  near  that  level  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon. However,  our  scenario  analysis  of labor flows as well as the historical behavior  of the unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate that  there  is  a  notable  probability  of  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  4 3 4 / %  during  some  period of the  forecast  horizon.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  (2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI,  based on  the  longer-term  average  of  the  diff erence  between  CPI  and  PCE  inflation). Under  these  conditions and  with  the  resource  gap  anticipated  to  dissipate  over  the  forecast  horizon  (the  unemployment  gap still may  not  provide  an  accurate  measure  of  the  resource  gap), we  expect  inflation  as measured  by the  PCE  deflator  (on  a  quarterly  basis)  to  be  about  2%  in  late  2017  and  thereafter.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  at  the  end  of  2017. Accordingly, all of the  major  economic  projections  for  2018  are  at  their  longer-run  values.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 5: In the wake  of the market  turmoil of the past few weeks, oil price futures have remained  particularly  volatile,  raising  the  uncertainty  around  my  headline  PCE  projection  above  its 20  year  average. I also  judge  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  core  PCE  inflation  projection  as'higher.' This  is due  to recent disparate  readings  on  underlying  inflation  coming  from  various  measures,  and uncertainty  regarding  how  inflation  expectations  are  reacting  to  a prolonged  period  of  below-target core  inflation  readings,  especially  in  light  of  inflation  compensation  measures  that  remain  well  below year-ago  levels.

Respondent 6: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is  similar  to  its  average  level over  the  past  20  years. Inflation  remains  anchored  by  quite  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at the FOMC's  stated  goal  of  2  percent. Inflation  expectations  have  now  been  well  anchored  for  about 20 years, so I see the magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation outlook  as consistent with that  over  the  past  20  years.

Respondent 7: It is difficult  to  explain  the  persistently  low  levels  of  core  inflation  with  the  standard empirical  methods.  In  addition,  developments  in  international  markets  contribute  to  an  elevated  degree of uncertainty  around  oil  prices  and  commodity  prices.

Respondent 14: Inflation has been  fairly well behaved  over  the  last 25 years, and  I believe that uncertainty  has  probably  not  changed  much  in  recent  years.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors  over  the  last  20  years. The  width  of  these  intervals  have  widened  some  since  the  June  SEP,  as the  recent  financial  market  and  international  developments  point  to  a  more  uncertain  global  economic environment.  Consequently,  the  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  remain  wider  than the  SEP  standard,  as  was  the  case  in  June;  beyond  the  more  recent  developments,  the  extraordinary economic  and  financial  environment,  including  the  policy  rate  in  most  advanced  economies  remaining constrained  by  its  eff ective  lower  bound,  point  to  significant  uncertainty  about  the  real  activity  outlook. The  net  impact  on  real  activity  of  the  dollar  appreciation  we  have  seen  over  the  past  year  is  still  unclear, contributing  to  the  uncertainty. In contrast,  even  though  uncertainty  has  increased  to  some  degree, the forecast intervals for core PCE  inflation  still appear  broadly  consistent  with  the  SEP  standard, taking  rough  account  of  the  diff erences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core PCE  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: I view the risks to GDP  growth  as  skewed  to  the  downside  in light of increased uncertainty  about  the  foreign  economic  outlook  (particularly  EME  growth),  a  limited  ability  of  monetary  and  fiscal policy  to off set adverse  shocks  to  the  economy,  and  a  greater-than-even  chance  that productivity  growth  will  be  slower  than  anticipated  in  my  modal  forecast. ZLB  concerns  and  a  more uncertain  foreign  outlook  also  cause  the  risks  to  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  skewed  to  the  upside, although  this  skew  is  tempered  by  the  downside  risks  to  productivity  growth. Finally,  I  view  the  risks to inflation to be skewed  to  the  downside,  reflecting  not  only  the  upside  risks  to  the  unemployment rate  but  also  a  (small)  chance  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  may  have  slipped  given  the  renewed decline  in  inflation  compensation;  moreover,  I  worry  that  I  have  underestimated  the  actual  amount  of slack  that  still persists,  and  thus  the  amount  of  stimulus  needed  to  push  inflation  back  to  2  percent.

Respondent 2: The  risks  of  a  significant  slowing  in  global  growth  have  increased  in  the  last  month or so. Because  it is unclear whether  those risks will persist or dissipate, I have continued  for this round  to  see  the  risks  as  broadly  balanced..

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: My  judgment  of  'balanced'  on  the  unemployment  rate  projection  acknowledges  both the downside  risk  to GDP  and  the  recent  spate  of positive forecasting errors on my  unemployment rate  projection.

Respondent 6: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  balanced. Recent  data  point  to  a  strong  rebound in GDP  growth from the weak first quarter. In addition, recent employment data point toward continued labor market improvements. On the other side, while many  economic headwinds have abated,  some  significant  ones  remain. In particular,  foreign  growth  has  slowed  further  and  financial conditions  have  tightened. On  balance,  most  U.S.  economic  indicators  suggest  steady  improvements in conditions  going  forward.

The  zero  lower  bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no  longer  appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light  of the apparent  eff ectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs. Moreover,  normalization  of  monetary  policy  means  that  the zero  lower  bound  will  be  less  relevant  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation risks are also balanced. Although  disinflationary pressures from abroad continue, the labor market continues to strengthen and is close to full employment, increasing the likelihood of wage  pressures  mounting  and  feeding  through  to  higher  inflation.

Respondent 7: Although  there  are  good  reasons  to  expect  the  eff ects  of  currency  appreciation  and commodity  price  declines  on  PCE  inflation  to  wane  over  time,  there  are  also  risks  of  a  renewed  bout of currency  appreciation  and  commodity  price  declines.

In addition, the recent deterioration in market-based measures of inflation compensation  from already low levels along with the movement  of survey based measures into the lower end of their historical  range  introduce  some  risk  that  inflation  expectations  could  drift  lower.

Respondent 10: The risks to my projections are broadly balanced. I have made only modest adjustments  to  my  modal  forecast  in  light  of  signs  that  growth  abroad  is  slowing  somewhat  more  than anticipated. However,  slower  growth  abroad  has  increased  the  downside  risk  to  my  forecast  a  bit. A number  of  foreign central banks  have  been  increasing  the level of monetary  accommodation,  which should  help  stimulate  global  demand.

Looking  through  the recent volatility, the low level of oil and gasoline prices is providing some support  for  consumer  spending. The  U.S.  labor  market  continues  to  show  solid  gains,  and  tightening labor markets should eventually put upward pressure on labor compensation, which will support household  spending. While  businesses  tied  to  the  energy  sector  are  struggling,  indicators  point  to  a pick-up  in activity at businesses  outside  of  energy-related  sectors. The  combination  of  these  factors alongside  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy  raises  the  possibility  that  the  U.S.  economy  may  be poised  for  faster  growth  than  I  am  currently  projecting.

Inflation  risks  are  balanced. The  most  recent  declines  in  oil  and  gasoline  prices  and  the  strengthening  of the dollar will mean  inflation  measures  will  be  low  in  the near-term;  however,  these  eff ects should  dissipate  as the decline  in oil prices and  appreciation  of  the  dollar  slow, as we  saw  earlier in the  year. Survey-based  measures  of  inflation  expectations  have  been  relatively  stable. While  inflation compensation  measures  based  on  asset  prices  have  fallen  again,  models  that  separate  changes  in  inflation  expectations  from  inflation  risk  and  liquidity  premia  suggest  we  should  take  little  signal  about inflation  expectations  from  these  movements. A  broad-based  downward  drift  in  inflation  expectations would  pose  a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  projection. On  the  other  hand,  too  slow  a  withdrawal  of monetary  policy  accommodation  has  the  potential  to  create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium run.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  zero  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained,  but  those  risks  are  likely to be increasing  over  time. We  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  that the recent volatility in financial markets may have been exacerbated by investors having taken on risks they were ill-equipped to manage.

Respondent 11: The  unemployment  rate  has  continued  to  fall  at  a  more  rapid  rate  than  expected given relatively modest  real GDP  growth. In addition, projections for the path of the labor force participation rate remain highly uncertain. This raises the risk that the unemployment  rate  may undershoot  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  average. Inflation  expectations  appear  to  be  moving  down slightly,  which  raises  the  risk  of  a  timely  return  to  our  target.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Because  of the zero lower bound  and  the perceived costs associated with asset purchases,  it  is hard  for  the  FOMC  to  respond  eff ectively  to  low  inflation  and  low  growth  outcomes. This  means  that  these  outcomes  are  more  likely  to  occur.

Respondent 16: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  diff erence  between  the  central  projection  and the expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. We  have  interpreted  the  recent  financial market  and  international  developments  as  indicating  some  deterioration  in  the  risk  assessment. Consequently,  we  now  see  the  risks  to  real  activity  and  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  downside,  a  downgrade from the balanced risks in June. Regarding  risks to the inflation outlook, although the near-term risks are fairly balanced,  the  decline  in  market-based  inflation  compensation  to  near  historical  lows, the general decline in commodity  and  import  prices,  and  some  softness  and  continued  low  levels  in various  measures  of  underlying  inflation  (including  our  signal  component  [SiCo]  measure  of  PCE  inflation)  all indicate  significant  downside  risks  in  the  medium  term. Our  overall  assessment  then  is  that the inflation risks are to the downside. The  deterioration  of  the  risk assessment  of  the  real activity outlook  also  has  been  influenced  by  the  factors  discussed  in  the  inflation  risk  assessment. In  addition, the  indication  of  slowing  growth  in  a  number  of  emerging  market  economies,  most  prominently  China, is another  development  that  could  weigh  on U.S. real activity more  than  anticipated in the modal forecast. Other  downside  risks  include  the  possibility  that  stalemates  concerning  the  federal  budget and/or  debt  ceiling  could  weigh  upon  the  U.S.  economy  and  the  continuing  constraints  that  monetary policy faces under the eff ective lower bound  in a number  of major economies. One  countervailing factor  that  limits  the  amount  of  downside  risk  we  have  in  our  outlook  is  the  possibility  that  the  economy  has  greater  underlying  strength  than  anticipated  in  our  projection,  which  is  consistent  with  the continued  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 17: We  think  the  risks  to  our  GDP  and  unemployment  rate  forecasts  are  roughly  in balance. On  the  downside,  less global demand,  especially  in  emerging  markets,  may  trigger  further dollar appreciation and financial market  disruptions, negatively impacting  net exports and private domestic  spending. On  the  upside,  positive  household  sector  fundamentals  (the  better  job  market  and low  energy  prices)  and  ample  business  access  to  credit  could  lead  to  stronger-than-expected  growth.

While  we  still  believe  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  eventually  prevail  and  put  inflation  on a gradual  uptrend,  we  have  yet  to  see any  evidence  of a pick-up  in inflation, wages,  or the planned prices  of  our  business  contacts. And  the  additional  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  decline  in  oil prices  highlight  the  potential  persistence  of  downside  risks.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: I continue  to  anticipate  that  economic  conditions  will  likely  warrent  a  quite  gradual rise in the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years,  reflecting  several  considerations. First,  I do  not expect  the  various  foreign  and  domestic  headwinds  still  restraining  US  real  activity  to  fade  rapidly, so I therefore anticipate only a slow rise in the equilbirium  real interest rate. Second, because  the unemployment  rate  likely  understates  the  true  amount  of  slack  in  current  labor  markets,  policy  needs  to be  sufficiently  accommodative  to  enable  the  unemployment  rate  to  undershoot  its  longer-run  normal level for a time in order to eliminate slack along these other dimensions. Third, a gradual policy tightening  that allowed  the unemployment  rate  to  temporarily  fall  below  its  longer-run  level would speed  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation. And  finally,  a  cautious  approach  to  tightening  is  appropriate in light of the  asymmetric  risks  implied  by  the  ZLB.

Respondent 2: In my  forecast,  unemployment  runs  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  (4.9%) through the end of the forecast period, and the FFR  does  not reach my  estimate of the long run neutral  rate (3.25%)  until  2018. In my  view,  it will be necessary  to  allow  unemployment  to  decline below the natural rate and remain  there for some  time to get trend inflation back up to 2%  on a sustainable  basis.

Based  on  my  forecast  and  assumptions  about  global  risks,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  FFR at the  December  2015  meeting.

The  Committee  has  articulated  a  two  part  test  for  liftoff : 1)  some  further  improvement  in  the  labor market  and  2)  reasonable  confidence  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  its  2%  objective  over  the  medium term. In my  view,  the  first part  of the test is now  met. There  has  been  substantial  improvement  in the  labor  market  this  year. Unemployment  is  now  at  the  staff  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  although there  is likely some  additional  slack.

The  second  part  of  the  test  is  also  arguably  met,  but  the  case  is  weaker. In the  baseline  forecast, inflation  returns  to  1.9%  in  2018,  which  alone  is  enough  to  provide  a  basis  for  reasonable  confidence. Moreover,  my  forecast  calls  for unemploymetn  to  decline  to  4.5%  during  the  forecast  period, which should  put  further  upward  pressure  on  inflation. However,  since  the  last  meeting,  developments  have on  balance  created  downward  pressure  on  inflation  in  the  short  term. I think  there  would  be  significant communications  challenges  if  the  Committee  were  to  declare  the  inflation test to be met  at a time when  inflation  is  below  mandate  and  declining,  even  though  the  factors  involved  are  mostly  expected to  be  transient  (the  dollar,  energy  prices). As  a  result,  I  would  rather  wait  a  meeting  or  two  to  declare

the  inflation  test  to  be  met. I would  be  prepared  to  see  the  inflation  test  as  satisfied,  and  therefore  to lift off , as long  as growth  continues  on  roughly  its  expected  path,  the  dollar  and  energy  prices  show some  stability,  and  inflation  readings  do  not  decline  below  current  expectations.

The  intermeeting  period  has  also  seen  a  significant  increase  in  risks  of  a  global  slowdown,  stemming from  weakness  in  China  and  many  emerging  market  economies,  in  a  context  of  falling  commodities prices. I would  prefer  not  to  raise  rates  until  that  risk  diminishes.

I believe that it is likely that these conditions will be met later this year, by the time of the December  meeting. I do  not  believe  that  it  is likely that  they  will  be  met  for  the  October  meeting.

Respondent 3: I made  no  changes  to my  appropriate  path  of the federal funds rate. According to the  empirical  model  supporting  my  forecast,  lift-off  should  have  already  occurred. Such  an  action would  have  reduced  the  extent  of  the  undershooting  of  unemployment  and  the  overshooting  of  inflation.

Respondent 4: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on promoting sustainable long-run economic growth and price stability. My  forecast calls for the unemployment  rate  to  be  below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  close  to  two  percent  in  early  2016. Given uncertainty about how the economy  will respond to the removal of accommodation  after a prolonged  period of near-zero interest rates, I believe increases in the federal funds rate should be gradual  to  see how  the  economy  responds. Adjustments  should  be  data-dependent,  but  the  gradual approach  to normalizing  policy results in a funds rate below  my  estimate  of its longer-run  level in 2016  and  2017.

I reduced  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  from  4.25  percent  to  3.75  percent,  and my  estimate  of  longer-run  real  GDP  growth  from  2.3  percent  to  1.8  percent. The  revision  to  longer-run real  GDP  growth  reflects  demographics  that  I  now  anticipate  will  exert  a  bit  more  influence  on  trend growth  sooner  than  previously  estimated. Productivity  growth  has  also been  low, so I've taken on as part of my  forecast  a  slightly slower  trend  in productivity  growth. To  appropriately  reflect  lower longer-run  real  GDP  growth,  I  marked  down  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  real  federal  funds  rate.

- (1)  Brief  description  of  the  economic  conditions  (or  combination  of  conditions)  that,  in  your  judgment,  would  warrant  an  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate.

The  economy  is  performing  in  a  way  that  in  my  view  warrants  liftoff . Since  the  beginning  of  2011, average  real  GDP  growth  has  been  above  my  estimate  of  trend  and  nonfarm  payroll  employment  has averaged  over  200  thousand. The  labor  market  slack  caused  by  the  recession  has  largely  disappeared; the unemployment  rate  is near or below many  forecasters' estimates of the natural rate. With  an economy  near  full  employment,  stable  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  eventual  waning  eff ects of the  drop  in  oil  prices  and  the  stronger  dollar,  I  believe  starting  policy  normalization  now  would  be appropriate.

Given  the  lags  with  which  monetary  policy  works,  waiting  longer  risks  having  to  tighten  rapidly if inflation  pressures  build. I am  concerned  that  maintaining  the  zero-interest  rate  policy,  followed  by a later-and-steeper  federal  funds  rate  path,  raises  financial  stability  risks  considerably,  with  possible adverse  future  eff ects  on  inflation  and  employment.

- (2) Indicate  whether  you  now  see  the  likelihood  that  those  conditions  will  be  in  place  this  year  as appreciably  greater  than,  roughly  equal  to,  or  appreciably  less  than  the  likelihood  that  those  conditions will not  be  realized  until  after  this  year.

As  noted  above,  I  believe  the  conditions  for  liftoff  are  already  in  place.

Respondent 5: My  outlook  has  liftoff  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2015  (to  a range  of  25-50  basis  points),  followed  by  25  basis  point  increases  at  every  other  meeting  through  2016. The  trajectory  steepens  to  25  basis  point  increases  at  every  meeting  in  2017,  nearing  its  appropriate long-run  value  by  the  end  of  the  year.

I also lowered  my  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  3.75%  in  concert  with  my downward  revision  to  longer-run  GDP  growth.

In response  to  the  Chair's  request:

- (1) The  domestic  economic  conditions  that would  warrant  liftoff are similar to those prevailing now. I would  want  to  see  solid  job  gains  and  some  indication  that  we  will  get  output  growth  sufficient to sustain  those job gains. On  inflation, while I would  prefer  to see near-term  trends  in  underlying inflation  measures  moving  toward  2.0  percent  along  with  stable  inflation  expectations,  I  am  willing  to look  through  transitory  influences  of  lower  oil  prices  and  a  stronger  dollar  on  inflation.

(2) I judge  the  likelihood  of  those  conditions  being  in  place  this  year  as  appreciably  greater  than the  likelihood  that  those  conditions  will  not  be  realized  until  after  this  year.

Respondent 6: The  conditions that warrant  an increase in the federal funds rate from the zero lower  bound  are  being  within  sight  of  full  employment  and  being  reasonably  confident  that  inflation will return  to  our  2  percent  objective  in  the  next  few  years.

In my  view,  these  conditions  have  now  been  met. The  labor  market  is  at  or  very  near  full  employment  and  I  expect  any  residual  labor  market  slack  to  dissipate  by  early  2016. On  inflation,  I  judge  that transitory  factors  are  significantly  damping  current  inflation  readings. I expect  inflation  to  gradually rise and  reach  our  2 percent  objective  by  2017  as the economy  continues  to  improve  and  transitory eff ects  from  the  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices  dissipate. My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy is generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following  liftoff ,  my  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules would  suggest. My  view  is  based  on  the  following:

- · The  economy  continues  to  face  headwinds  in  2016, including  constraints  on  credit availability for some  borrowers,  weak  growth  abroad,  and  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar. These  continue to depress  the  shorter-term  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  relative  to  its  long-run  value.
- · From  a risk management  perspective, there are benefits to having optionality to respond to unexpected  events  by  altering  the  pace  of  policy  normalization. This  optionality  is  enhanced  by an  earlier  liftoff which  allows  for  a  more  gradual  path  towards  equilibrium.
- · An  additional  benefit of an earlier and  more  gradual  normalization  strategy  is a reduction  in uncertainty  among  market  participants,  both  domestic  and  global.

Respondent 7: Although  we  have  seen  continued  improvement  in  the  U3  unemployment  rate  and a welcome improvement  in growth, financial conditions have tightened considerably since the last meeting  largely  due  to  developments  in  China  and  associated  spillovers. In  addition,  core  PCE  remains stubbornly  low,  while  declines  in  commodity  prices  are  again  weighing  on  headline  PCE,  and  earlier glimmers  of  improvement  in  compensation  have  receded. Risk  management  considerations  associated with  the asymmetry  in  our  policy  toolkit  near  the  eff ective lower bound,  the  tightening  in  financial conditions  associated  with  foreign  developments  along  with  a  risk  of  further  deterioration  in  foreign conditions, and  the apparent  absence  of  wage  pressures  despite  the  continued  reduction  in  resource slack  argue  for  a  delay  in  liftoff  along  with  an  initially  cautious  path  once  tightening  is  initiated.

The combination of risk management  considerations and the likelihood of a continued strong feedback  loop between  expectations  of  policy divergence  and  financial tightening through  exchange rate and financial market  channels, suggest that economic  conditions  would  have  to improve  along three  dimensions  in  order  to  warrant  the  initiation  of  a  tightenng  cycle. First,  the  labor  market  should continue  to  improve  at  a  robust  pace  such  that  margins  of  slack  not  capture  in  the  U3  unemployment rate are diminished, and wage and compensation  measures  show  sustained improvement. Second, inflation should  show  signs  of turning  upwards,  and  inflation  expectations  should  firm. In addition, it is important  that  downside  risks from foreign economic  and  financial spillovers diminish. Faster progress  on  one  of  these  dimensions  would  lessen  the  amount  of  progress  needed  in  other  dimensions.

In light of the likely further adjustment  that  will be necessary in foreign markets  and  the ongoing restraining  forces on inflation, the likelihood that these conditions  will be realized later this year is smaller  than  the  likelihood  that  they  will  not  be  realized  until  after  this  year.

The  reduction  in  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  warranted  by  the  notable reduction  in  5- and  10-year  forward  rates  on  10-year  Treasury  yields  over  the  past  year  as  well  as  by ongoing  global  developments.

Respondent 8: I have  pushed  back  by  one  quarter  my  projection  of  when  it  will  be  appropriate  to increase  the  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate. In general,  my  outlook  for  the  U.S.  economy  has not  changed  much  since  the  last  SEP.  I  expect  growth  to  continue  at  a  moderate,  slightly-above-trend pace  while  the  labor  market  continues  to  improve,  though  perhaps  a  bit  more  slowly  than  in  the  last couple of years. The persistent absence of evidence for an acceleration of wage increases strongly suggests that we are not yet at the natural rate of unemployment  and, in fact, that the natural rate may  have  declined  moderately  below  its  longer  term  rate. Headline  and  core  infliation  are  both likely  to be  somewhat  lower  in  the  remainder  of  this  year,  and  there  is  no  indication  that  they  would accelerate  more  than  gradually  thereafter  even  in  in  the  absence  of  a  federal  funds  rate  increase. In these  circumstances,  the  argument  for  liftoff  in  the  next  several  meetings  seems  weaker  than  I  might have  expected  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  wuld  be  the  case  by  now.

Respondent 9: The  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  features  a  gradual  removal  of  policy accommodation,  so  that  policy  can  probe  for  the  possibility  of greater labor market  slack  and/or  a lower equilibrium  real  rate of interest than  what  is assumed  in  our  baseline  outlook. If our current estimates  for the longer run levels of the unemployment  rate  and  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate turn  out  to  be  correct,  the  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  would  be  consistent  with  achieving full employment  and  2  percent  inflation  by  2018.

Respondent 10: I continue  to  see  underlying  strength  in  the  economy  and  labor  markets. The  labor market  has  already  made  a  great  deal  of  progress  toward  our  goal  of  full  employment,  and  I  expect further  gains  going  forward. Measures  of  underemployment  have  been  steadily  declining  as  well. In my  view,  the  economy  is  at  or  nearly  at  full  employment  -  indeed,  in  my  forecast  the  current  level  of the unemployment  rate  is  below  my  point  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  (which  I  have  reduced  by 0.2 percentage  point  in  this  forecast). In this scenario,  labor  compensation  measures  will  eventually firm  (in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures),  but  I  do  not  see  this  as  a  necessary precondition  to  raising  the  federal  funds  rate. Over  time,  I  expect  the  eff ects  on  inflation  of  the  recent declines  in oil prices and  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  to  fade. Stable  inflation  expectations,  solid labor  market  readings,  and  above-trend  growth  (which  I  also  revised  down  0.2  percentage  point)  make me  reasonably  confident  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  medium  run. In  my  projection,  I  expect  this  to  occur  in  early  2017,  which  is  a  bit  later  than  in  my  June  projection, reflecting  the  further  drop  in  oil  prices  and  dollar  appreciation  that  has  occurred  since  that  time.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should reflect both actual and projected progress toward the Committee's  goals. The economy  is already at or close to full employment,  and  I  anticipate inflation to reach the Committee's  goal  of 2 percent  in early 2017. In my  view, this combination  of  factors  warrants  a  modest  increase  in  the federal  funds  rate  in  2015Q3,  with  a  gradual  upward  path  thereafter  over  the  forecast  horizon.

I believe that the FOMC  has  communicated  that  such  an  increase  is  nearing, and while it will likely  cause  some  reaction  in  financial  markets,  so  long  as  the  Committee  continues  to  emphasize  that the  fund  rate  path  will  be  a  gradual  one,  I  do  not  anticipate  any  deleterious  eff ect  of  liftoff .

Respondent 11: My  projection for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate is within the range  of  outcomes  given  by  the  monetary  policy  rules  reported  in  Tealbook  B.

Respondent 12: Deterioration  in  the  economic  outlook  abroad  poses  a  threat  to  GDP  growth  in the  U.S.  Major  economies  around  the  world-including  China,  Europe,  Brazil,  and  Japan-face  serious demographic,  fiscal,  and  structural  challenges. These  challenges  are  likely  to create  spillovers which impact the U.S. through a stronger dollar, potentially reduced corporate profits on international operations,  and  dampened  domestic  consumer  psychology  ('headline  risk'). The  potential  impact  of these  factors  is  the  primary  reason  that  the  funds-rate  path  I  project  isn't  steeper. Still, by  the  end  of 2018,  when  both  of  our  dual-mandate  objectives  are  fully  met  (or  exceeded),  I  project  that  the  funds rate  will settle  at its longer-run  sustainable  level.

I don't  see  the  risks  associated  with  too-much  and  too-little  accommodation  as  notably  asymmetric at  this  stage  of  the  business  cycle: Too  much  accommodation  maintained  for  too  long  can  be  as  risky  as too  little accommodation.  With  too  much  accommodation,  I  would  be  concerned  that  marginal  business investment  decisions, consumer  durables  purchases,  and  financial  commitments  create  excesses which  can't  be easily reversed  or unwound  when  policy  eventually  begins  to  normalize. It becomes more  difficult  to  achieve  smooth  convergence  in  an  economy  in  the  aftermath  of  a  period  when  capital has  been  misallocated,  creating  debt  and  capital  overhangs. The  longer  artificially  favorable  financial conditions  are  allowed  to  persist,  the  greater  the  potential  for  these  imbalances  to  become  significant.

Respondent 13: I believe  the  Committee  should  be  much  more  willing  to  tolerate  sharp  movements in the  federal  funds  rate. This  would  allow  the  Committee  to  act  much  more  aggressively  to  provide accommodation  now,  followed  by  a  sharper  liftoff  of  the  funds  rate  when  inflation  is  much  nearer  to target (currently  anticipated  in mid-2017). This approach  to  policy would  allow  the Committee  to return inflaton to target more  rapidly. I note too that recent movements  in  market-based  inflation expectations suggest that investors perceive an increased risk that the FOMC  will fail to achieve its inflation target in conjunction  with  low  growth  outcomes. Having  a  tighter linkage between  the inflation  data  and  our  actions  would  help  enhance  the  credibility  of  our  inflation  target.

My  preferred  policy  approach  involves  the  use  of  a  negative  target  range  for  the  fed  funds  rate. he experience  of  other  countries  indicates  that  it  would  be  possible  to  implement  such  a  range.

The  data  also  suggest  that  there  has  been  a  sharp  fall  in  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest  since  2007. We  remain  below  maximum  employment  and  below  target  inflation,  even  though  the  market  real  rate of interest (over any  horizon)  is much  lower  than  in  2007. This  means  that  the  neutral  real rate of interest  -  consistent  with  target  inflation  and  maximum  employment  -  has  fallen  by  even  more.

There  are  many  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  but  the  main  point  is that the change  islikely  to unwind  over  time  -  but  only  slowly  and  only  partially. This  judgment  is borne  out  by  the  real  yield  curve,  which  is  upward  sloping  (roughly  35  basis  points  over  the  next  five years,  and  rising  to  over  1.3%  from  2025  to  2035).

Put  another  way: I see the intercept  term  in  the  Taylor  rule  as  being  a  stochastic  process  with  a lot of persistence. That  intercept  is  very  low  and  is  likely  to  return  to  its  long-run  value  only  slowly.

Respondent 14: I believe  we  should  raise  the  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  this  meeting,  and that  it would  be  appropriate  to  begin  reducing  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  shortly  thereafter. The unemployment  rate  is  currently  near  or  at  its  longer-run  normal  level,  and  12-month  inflation  can  be expected  to  be  close  to  the  FOMC's  2  percent  objective  by  the  end  of  2016. I believe  current  conditions warrant  an  increase  in  the funds  rate for the following  reasons: Consumer  spending  has  accelerated to near  3  percent,  suggesting  the  need  for  higher  real  rates,  private  fixed  investment  is  growing,  labor markets  have  tightened  significantly,  and,  as  it  did  last  time,  inflation  will  move  back  toward  2  percent after the transitory eff ects of recent movements  in  energy  prices and the foreign exchange  value of the dollar have passed. Moreover, further delay would  represent a substantive departure  from our beneficial  past  behavior.

Respondent 15: The  'optimal'  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  exhibits  considerable  inertia.

Respondent 16: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communicate clearly to the public  that  these  factors  will dictate  the  path  of the policy  stance. The  developments along these dimensions  since the June  SEP  were  such  that we now  assess that a later liftoff and a subsequent  slower  pace  of  normalization  than  in  our  June  submission  is  now  the  appropriate  path  for the  FFR.

Based  on  our  modal  outlook  and  assuming  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored, we  anticipate  that  the  target  range  for  the  FFR  will  remain  at  its  current  level  until  December  2015. Nevertheless, it is important to communicate  to the public that the decision about the timing of liftoff is dependent  upon  the  data  and  the  FOMC's  assessment  of  the  outlook  and  risks  rather  than  a particular  calendar  date.

Regarding  the  conditions  that  would  warrant  an  increase  in  the  FFR,  let  us  first  discuss  the  conditions  stated  in  the July  FOMC  statement. Regarding  the  condition  of  'some  further  improvement in the labor  market,'  the  U.S.  economy  is  close  to  satisfying  it: the continued  payroll  gains  and  the decline  in the unemployment  rate  indicate  that  further  improvement  occurred  during  the  intermeeting period. Beyond  that, some  indications that the improvement  in labor market  conditions were beginning  to  be  translated  into  stronger  compensation  growth  would  be  an  important  benchmark  to determine  that  this  condition  has  been  met  sufficiently. In contrast  to  the  labor  market  condition,  we are  still a considerable  distance  from  satisfying  the  condition  of  'reasonable  confidence'  that  inflation will  rise  to  2%  over  the  medium  term. Here,  we  would  need  to  see  a  number  of  developments: (1)  various  measures  of  underlying  inflation  (core,  median,  trimmed  mean,  SiCo,  and  the  FRBNY  underlying inflation gauge)  beginning  to  firm  appreciably; (2) longer-term  inflation  compensation  moving  back toward  the  levels  of  mid-2014,  with  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations  remaining  stable;  and  (3) commodity  prices  stabilizing  (and  strengthening  in  some  cases). In addition  to  the  two  conditions  in the  FOMC  statement,  there  is  a  condition  that  would  need  to  happen  to  solidfy  the  case  for  increasing the FFR:  after tightening recently, financial market  conditions  would  need  to show  substantial  improvement  from  recent  readings. To  tighten  policy  in  the  current  financial  market  environment  would risk an  undue  further  tightening  of  financial  conditions  that  would  put  the  attainment  of  the  FOMC objectives  in jeopardy. Given  our  assessment  that  conditions  will  be  such  that  an  initial  increase  in the FFR  can  occur  in  December,  we  currently  judge  the  likelihood  that  the  conditions  for  liftoff  will be in place  this year  as roughly  equal  to  the  likelihood  that  they  will  not  be  realized  until  after  this year.

A more important factor than the timing of liftoff in determining the stance of policy will be the pace  of rate increases  following  liftoff . In general, this pace  will depend  upon  our  assessment  of economic  conditions  and  the  outlook,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  the  response  of  overall financial conditions to policy tightening. Currently, the still-low levels of inflation and longer-term inflation compensation, the somewhat  greater uncertainty surrounding both the real activity and inflation outlooks, the downside  risks to those outlooks, and  the uncertainty  about  the  level of the equilibrium  real  FFR  [discussed  further  below]  all  point  to  a  more  gradual  pace  during  the  early  stages of  normalization  than  was  our  assessment  in  June. Therefore,  our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2015,  2016,  and  2017  at 1 4 / -1 2 / %,  1 - 1 1 4 / %,  and 2 1 2 / -2 3 4 / %  respectively;  the  2016  and  2017  ranges  are  50bps  below  those  in  our  June  submission. We  thus do  not  expect  that  the  FFR  will  reach  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  until  2018. We  believe that  this  gradual  path  is  necessary  to  provide  insurance  against  the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced by the U.S. economy  (including  those  stemming  from  global  economic  and  financial  developments) and  to address  the uncertainty  about  the  equilibrium  real FFR,  which  in  turn  will help ensure  the attainment  of the FOMC's  objectives  over  the  longer  run. Moreover,  in current circumstances-low inflation  and  unemployment  near  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  level-unemployment  could  fall below  its  longer-run  normal  level  under  appropriate  policy,  thus  providing  more  insurance  against  the

risk of being  caught  in  a  low  inflation  trap. Our  modal  forecast  has  the  unemployment  rate  falling  to our  4 3 4 / %  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate,  although  there  is  a  sizable  probability  that  it  could fall further  below  the  longer-run  rate.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real short-term  interest rate. We  maintain  the  range  of 1 2 / -3%  that we had  in June: this range is modestly below our assessment of 1% -3% for 'normal times,'  reflecting the impact  of  the  protracted  period  of  low  global  interest  rates  and  resulting  continued  uncertainty  about the equilibrium real rate. Adding  the objective for inflation (2%) then gives our estimated range for the nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2.5  - 5.0%. However,  with  the  reduction  in  our  assumptions  for trend productivity growth and potential GDP  growth, we now assess that the equilibrium rate is more  likely  to be further  in the lower  half of that range,  leading  to  our  point  estimate  of  3 1 4 / %,  as seen  in the  response  to  question  3(a). Estimates  of  the  equilibrium  rate  using  DSGE  models  and  the Laubach-Williams  model  also  suggest  that  the  equilibrium  rate  remains  low.

We would also note that we assume that reinvestment continues until economic and financial conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the  zero  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of a reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to occur  sometime  in  the  second  half  of  2016.

Respondent 17: We  continue  to believe that under appropriate  policy, liftoff should be delayed until  core  inflation  has  clearly  begun  to  move  sustainably  higher. In our  projection,  it  will  take  until mid-2016  for this condition to be met. In particular, by that time, we are hopeful that the dollar and  energy  prices  will  have  roughly  stabilized  and  that  year-over-year  core  inflation  will  have  clearly moved  off  of  its  recent  lows. After  liftoff ,  we  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  for  the  path  of  rate  increases to be quite shallow, at least initially. This  would  give  the Committee  time  to  assess  the  economy's performance  under  less  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  to  observe  whether  inflation  is  indeed moving  up  to  target.

Furthermore,  we  believe that a mid-2016  lift off date and a shallow path for rate increases are appropriate  policy  from  a  risk  management  perspective,  as  we  view  the  costs  of  a  retreat  back  to  the zero  lower  bound  as  much  greater  than  those  of  inflation  running  modestly  above  2  percent  for  a  couple of years  if demand  is  unexpectedly  strong. Indeed,  given  the  normal  inertia  in  the  inflation  process, our  rate  assumptions  could  result  in  inflation  modestly  overshooting  2  percent  beyond  the  projection horizon. We  see  this  as  a  feature  of  an  optimal  policy  aimed  at  achieving  a  symmetric  inflation  target. Finally,  our  path  for  appropriate  policy  also  is  influenced  by  our  view  that  the  equilibrium  real  interest rate  currently  is  quite  low  and,  though  moving  up  over  time,  may  still  be  a  bit  below  our  assumption for the  long-run  neutral  rate  at  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 1: My  outlook  for  real  activity assumes  that  increases  in  the  underlying  strength  of the  economy  will  enable  real  GDP  to  grow  at  a  pace  slightly  faster  than  potential  even  as  the  federal funds  rate  rises,  thereby  generating  further  improvements  in  labor  market  conditions. The  increasing underlying  strength  partly  reflects  a gradually  diminishing  drag  on  net  exports  from  the  dollar  and foreign  growth,  a  quickening  housing  market  recovery,  and  a  modest  turn-around  in  drilling  activity, all of which  should  in  turn  help  to  bolster  employment,  consumption  and  investment  over  time.

My  outlook  for  inflation  assumes  that  the  restrictive  eff ects  of  low  oil  prices  and  dollar  appreciation should  wane  as  we  move  into  2016,  allowing  headline  inflation  to  move  up  to  1-1/2  percent  later  in  the year. Thereafter,  inflation should  continue  to rise-and  by 2018, reach 2 percent-in  an  environment of anchored  long-run inflation expectations, assuming  that the unemployment  rate  undershoots  its longer-run  normal  level  for  several  years. The  undershooting  is  necessary  to  help  pull  more  discouraged workers  back  into  the  labor  force  and  to  reduce  involuntary  part-time  employment,  thereby  speeding the  return  to  2  percent.

The  key  risk  to  the  outlook  for  real  activity  is  that  the  domestic  and  foreign  headwinds  that  still restrain real activity may  not abate as quickly as I expect. That  concern  is also a key risk to the inflation  outlook;  in  addition,  I  worry  that  inflation  may  become  stuck  at  a  level  appreciably  below  2 percent  because  our  standard  model  of  inflation  could  be  flawed  in  some  way. For  example,  readings on  inflation  expectations  may  be  consistent  with  inflation  stabilizing  at  less  than  2  percent,  similar  to the  Japanese  experience  in  which  actual  inflation  ran  peristently  below  measures  of  expected  inflation for many  years.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: My  view  is  that  lift-off  will  be  tardy.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  in  2015  2018. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising  employment  and  wages,  past  gains in household  wealth,  accommodative  financing  conditions,  and  increased  purchasing  power  from  lower energy  prices. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  slow  in  2017  as  the  economy  operates  at  full  capacity. I see  the  unemployment  gap  as  closed  in  the  third  quarter  of  2015  after  the  rapid  reduction  in  economic slack in the past few years. My  inflation outlook projects a gradual rise in inflation reflecting the reduced  slack  in  the  economy  and  the  dissipating  of  transitory  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation  and  lower energy  prices.

I see the  risks  to the  economic  outlook  as  broadly  balanced. Downside  risks  for  real  GDP  growth and  inflation  stemming  from  the  deterioration  in  global  economic  and  financial  conditions  appear  to have  increased  since  the  beginning  of  the  year. However,  they  are  roughly  off set  by  upside  risks  related to  the  resilience  of  the  U.S.  economy. Consumer  spending  and  inflation  could  rise  faster  than  expected, especially  given  the  rapid  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  and  the  potential  for  faster  wage gains.

Respondent 5: My  outlook  consists  of  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  several  quarters,  a  further reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  gradually  converges  to  target.

Growth  over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  stronger  consumption  growth,  supported  by ongoing  improvements  in  the  labor  market  and  a  robust  pace  of disposable  income  growth,  further improvement  in  consumer  sentiment,  and  a  modest  stimulus  from  lower  energy  prices. While  lower  oil

prices  negatively  impact  energy-related  investment  in  the  near-term,  conditions  remain  supportive  for capital  investment  in  other  sectors. Strength  in  the  dollar  and  weakness  from  abroad  remain  modest headwinds  in  my  outlook,  slowing  export  growth  and  providing  some  restraint  to  domestic  industrial activity.

The  risks to my  growth  outlook  are  tilted  to the downside  and  have  intensified  in  recent  weeks. Market  volatility,  touched  off  by  fears  over  a  material  slowdown  in  China,  and  further  dollar  appreciation  threaten  to  significantly  restrain  export  growth  and  domestic  industrial  activity. While  I  view the direct eff ect of a slowdown  in  China  to be relatively modest,  knock-on  eff ects could destabilize our important  trading  partners and pose a significant risk to domestic  output  growth  through  the export  sector. Additionally,  this  new  found  uncertainty  that  has  roiled  markets  could  spill  over  onto the  broad  economy  if  it  changed  firms'  investment  or  hiring  decisions.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  have  also  shifted  to  the  downside. Lower  oil  prices  and  a  stronger dollar could  prove  to be more  of a headwind  to  inflation  than  I  have  built  into by baseline  outlook. This  could  be  especially  troublesome  if  inflation  expectations  un-anchor  to  the  downside  as  a  result of the  prolonged  period  of  below  target  inflation.

Respondent 6: The  economy  is mostly  recovered  from the severe housing  collapse and financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand  through  a  variety  of  channels,  which  policy  has  only  partially  off set. Many  of  the  associated remaining  headwinds  are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  construction  has  been  and  continues  to  be  depressed. However,  with  household  balance sheets  as  well  as  consumer  credit  conditions  improving,  I  expect  this  to  abate;
- · The  relatively  strong  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year  compared  with  that  of the  rest of the  world,  the  subsequent  monetary  easing  in  Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  the  recent depreciation  of the renminbi  resulted  in a sharp  appreciation  of the dollar. This appreciation has been a drag on net exports and GDP  growth. The  potential for further deterioration of foreign  economic  and  financial  conditions  represents  a  downside  risk.

In this environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace. And  with substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  play  I  expect  output  and  unemployment  gaps  to  close  by  the  end of this year. In terms  of inflation, the lagged  eff ects of remaining  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets, combined  with  subdued  commodity  and  import  prices, should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2 percent inflation target over the next year and a half. Well-anchored inflation expectations and diminishing  slack  eventually  pull  inflation  back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: In  addition  to  the  factors  noted  in  my  response  to  3(c),  the  recent  volatility  in  global markets,  along  with  increased  uncertainty  about  the  economic  prospects  and  policies  of  a  number  of important foreign economies, pushes risks to the downside. While I have not much changed my baseline expectations  for the U.S. economy  from  the  perod  prior to that volatility, it's hard to see global  developments  boosting  those  prospects,  while  it's  reasonably  easy  to  see  how  they  could  take  a few  more  tenths  of  a  percentage  point  off  U.S.  growth  and/or  have  further  disinflationary  eff ects.

Respondent 9: The  pace  of  growth  in  economic  activity  during  the  first  half  of  the  year  was  stronger than  previously  thought. Similarly,  labor  market  improvements  as  measured  by  the  U-3  unemployment rate  have  exceeded  expectations,  though  the  cyclical  rebound  in  labor  force  participation  remains  weak by  historical  standards. Recent  developments,  however,  are  less  supportive  of  growth  going  forward. A weaker  outlook  for  emerging  market  economies  and  further  appreciation  in  the  trade-weighted  dollar imply more  drag from net exports. Downward  revisions  to the savings rate provide less scope for pent-up  demand  to  support  consumer  expenditures. Moreover, the decline in asset valuations and

increased  uncertainty  are  also  expected  to  negatively  impact  activity. Given  the  deterioration  in  some key conditioning  factors,  the  removal  of  policy  accommodation  is  now  projected  to  occur  somewhat more  slowly  than  in  previous  forecasts. This  allows  GDP  growth  to  exceed  potential  on  average,  albeit modestly,  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Given our outlook for real economic activity, we project a small decline in the unemployment rate. The weak cyclical pickup in participation so far could signal a more pronounced  downward trend  in  labor  force  participation. While  in  this  forecast  we  continue  to  expect  that  more  individuals will be drawn into the labor market, our current estimates of the output and the unemployment rate gap  provide  a  more  similar  assessment  of  the  activity  gap. As  a result, the projected  decline  in the unemployment  rate  is  more  closely  tied  to the projected  pace  of GDP  growth  than  in  previous forecasts. The  closer  alignment  between  our  current  estimate  of  the  output  gap  and  the  unemployment rate gap was achieved  in part by lowering  the longer-run  estimate  of the unemployment  rate,  from 5.0 to 4.8 percent. We  see the lack of significant wage  pressures so far, even for occupations  that have  shown  stronger  growth  in  employment,  as  signaling  a  lower  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  than previously thought. We  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  reach  its longer run equilibrium  level in 2017  and  flatten  at  that  level  in  2018  as  GDP  growth  reverts  to  potential.

The  gradual  removal  of  policy  accommodation  in  our  baseline  outlook  achieves  several  objectives. In  the  near  term,  it  provides  some  insurance  against  the  possibility  that  the  drop  in  commodity  prices, asset  valuations,  and  the  associated  volatility  in  financial  markets  signal  more  weakness  in  the  global economy  than  what  we  are  assuming  in  our  baseline  outlook. It also reduces  the risks of monetary policy  adding  to  an  already  high  level  of  uncertainty. If recent  market  developments  turn  out  to  find little support  in  the  lagging  real  activity  data,  the  process  of  removing  accommodation  can  then  start in a less uncertain  environment. In the medium  term,  the  gradual  removal  of  accommodation  gives monetary  policy  the  opportunity  to  probe  for  the  possibility  of  greater  labor  market  slack  and/or  a lower equilibrium  real rate of interest than we are currently assuming. It also provides room  for a faster but disciplined  pace  of tightening  should  inflationary  pressures  materialize  more  rapidly  than expected.

The  risks  to the growth  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  downside. Our  baseline  outlook  features  only  a modest  slowdown  in  China  and  other  emerging  market  economies,  with  financial  market  volatility  and risk  spreads  returning  to  more  normal  levels. However,  the  risks  of  a  more  broad-based  crisis  in  China, with  significant  spillover  eff ects  to  the  rest  of  the  world,  have  increased. Since  our  unemployment  rate projection  is  now  more  closely  tied  to  projected  GDP  growth,  the  risks  to  the  unemployment  rate  are tilted  to  the  upside. Even  though  we  have  lowered  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate, we  continue  to  perceive  downside  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  . In particular,  we  see  risks  associated with  the  possibility  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below  the  2  percent target.

Respondent 10: Notwithstanding  the volatility in financial markets since our last meeting, the fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative  monetary policy, household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  sustained  strengthening  in labor  markets,  and  lower  oil  prices. Financial  market  volatility  has  increased  since  our  last meeting  -  ostensibly  reflecting  expectations  of  slower  growth  abroad  -  but  I  do  not  take  a  great  deal of signal  from  this  volatility  at  this  point. Weakening  activity  abroad  is  likely  to  have  only  a  modest adverse  impact  on  the  overall  U.S.  economy,  and  a  number  of  foreign  central  banks  have  scope  to  add accommodation  to  promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad. Data  revisions  show that  the  economy  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  was  stronger  than  I  had  anticipated,  and  labor  market readings  have  also  been  generally  better  than  I  had  expected. Reinforcing  the  data,  business  contacts report  tightening  labor  markets  and  some  increased  wage  pressures. Overall, I see these forces contributing to above-trend  growth  and  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. By  the end of 2018, I project  that  the  economy  will  essentially  be  at  its  steady  state. (Note: in this  projection,  I've  revised

down  my  estimates  of  long-run  growth  from  2.5  to  2.3  percent,  long-run  unemployment  from  5.5  to 5.3 percent,  and  the  long-run  fed  funds  rate  from  3.75  to  3.5  percent.)

Inflation  rates  remain  subdued,  as  oil  and  commodity  price  declines  weigh  on  headline  PCE  inflation  and  the  pass-through  of  lower  commodity  prices  and  import  prices  weighs  on  core  PCE  inflation. I expect  that  the  most  recent  declines  in  oil  prices  and  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  -  which  are  smaller than  the  previous  moves  over  the  last  year  -  will  have  a  short-lived  impact  on  inflation  measures. In my  judgment,  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored. Anchored  inflation  expectations  along  with  an improving  economy  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to  the  2  percent  longer-run  objective  by early  2017. As  inflation  increases  and  the  expansion  continues,  I  expect  wage  growth  will  pick  up  as well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 11: I expect  the  pace  of  output  growth  over  the  medium  term  to  be  somewhat  above my  longer  term  trend  of 2.3 as the headwinds  that  have  been  holding  down  growth  recede  further. With  fairly modest  headline  growth  over the forecast horizon, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will edge down  further  from  its current  level of 5.1 percent. However,  with  a  cyclical rebound in the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  appropriate  monetary  policy  firming  the  unemployment  rate only  goes  modestly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate. Headline  inflation  has  been  held  down  in the  first half of 2015  by  the  fall  in energy  prices. I anticipate  that  inflation  will  rebound  in  2016  and rise toward  my  2  percent  target  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon. Inflation  stays  anchored around  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: Financial  conditions  remained  highly  accommodative  through  the  second  quarter of 2015  despite  a  strong  dollar  and  foreign  economic  and  geo-political  uncertainties. Since  then,  we've seen  deterioration  in  the  emerging-market  outlook  and  a  (potentially  healthy)  correction  in  U.S.  equity prices. At  this  point,  neither  creates  a  serious  threat  to  the  U.S.  expansion. The  benefits  to  the  U.S. from  a  favorable  shift  in  the  terms  of  trade  will  help  to  off set  reductions  in  demand  for  U.S.  exports, and  I expect  U.S.  output  growth  to  continue  to  outstrip  growth  in  potential,  further  reducing  labormarket  slack. These  reductions  give  me  confidence  that  trimmed-mean  inflation  will  near  2  percent within  two  years.

Potential  additional  adverse  international  economic  and  financial  developments  are  the  main  source of near-term  downside  risks.

Respondent 13: There  is  a  risk of a premature  tightening  of  monetary  policy  that  would  degrade our  performance  on  inflation  and  employment.

Respondent 14: Real  GDP  per  worker  has  risen  at  a  1.3  percent  annual  rate  from  2007  to  2014; my  projections assume  that productivity continues to grow at the same rate through 2018. I am projecting  that  through  2018  the  working  age  population  grows  at  1  percent  per  year,  the  labor  force particpation  rate  falls by 0.2 percent  per  year, and  the unemployment  rate  remains  near  5  percent. These supply-side factors suggest longer-run growth of 1.8 percent. My  GDP  projections  through 2017  are  higher  than  that,  primarily  reflecting  robust  consumer  spending  growth  and  solid  growth  in business  fixed  investment  and  residential  investment.

Respondent 15: The  key  factors: expectations  of  the  FOMC's  interest  rate  decisions,  against  the background  of  future  developments  in  the  US  and  foreign  economies.

Respondent 16: Growth  of  real  GDP  over  the  first  half  of  2015  is  now  estimated  to  have  been  at a 2.2%  annual  rate,  up  from  the  1 1 4 / %  we  expected  in  the  June  SEP,  but  still  a  full  percentage  point below  the  pace  of growth  over  2014H2. Looking  forward,  we  anticipate  that  2015H2  growth  of  real final sales to domestic  purchasers  will  be  a  relatively  healthy  3 1 4 / %;  however,  substantial  drag  from both  net exports  and  inventory  investment  will  keep  the  overall  real GDP  growth  rate  at  around  1 3 4 / %. For  2015  as  a whole  that  would  result  in  growth  of  real  GDP  of  around  2%,  below  the  2 1 2 / % pace  of  2013  and  2014. Consistent  with  the  slower  growth  rate  over  2015H2,  the  pace  of  employment gains  is expected  to  slow  from  the  213,000  average  monthly  increase  of  nonfarm  payroll  employment that  occurred  over  2015H1.

Turning  to  the  near-term  inflation  outlook,  the  twelve-month  changes  of  the  overall  PCE  deflator are projected  to  remain  quite  low  over  2015H2  due  to  the  further  decline  of  oil  prices  that  occurred over  July  and  August  as  well  as  expectations  that  margins  on  refined  petroleum  products  will  narrow. Core  PCE  deflator  inflation  is  expected  to  be  in the 1 1 4 / %  to 1 1 2 / %  range  that  has  prevailed  over the  past  year,  as  pass-through  from  declines  in  energy  prices  and  non-energy  import  prices  as  well  as anticipated  subdued  increases  in  medical  care  services  provide  restraint  on  core  inflation.

For 2016  and  2017  our  modal  projections  of  the  key  SEP  variables  have  not  changed  much  from June, though  we  have  adjusted  some  of  the key parameters  of  the forecast. First, taking on board the information  contained  in the annual  NIPA  revision, we have lowered our estimate of the economy's  potential  growth  rate  to  1 3 4 / %  from  our  previous  estimate  of  2%  (1 1 4 / %  to  1 1 2 / %  growth  of productivity  in  the  nonfarm  business  sector, 1 2 / %  to 3 4 / %  growth  of  hours  worked). In addition,  we have  lowered  our  estimate  of NAIRU  to  4 3 4 / %  from  5%  as  an acknowledgment  of  the  aging  of  the population. We  discuss  these  changes  in  more  detail  in  4(b).

Given these changes, we continue to project growth to pick up in 2016, but to around 2 1 4 / % rather  than  the  2 1 2 / %  of  the  June  SEP.  Real  PCE  are  anticipated  to  continue  to  grow  at  a  solid  pace, reflecting  further  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  decent  income  growth,  relatively  high  consumer confidence, and improving  access  to consumer  credit. In addition, the personal saving rate is high relative  to  household  net  worth,  providing  room  for  a  gradual  decline  of  the  personal  saving  rate  over the forecast horizon. That  being  said, we anticipate growth  of consumer  spending  in  2016  to slow somewhat  from  its  recent  3%  pace. The  consumer  durable  goods  cycle  is  well  along  at  this  point,  so that  durable  goods  are  unlikely  to  provide  the  support  for  consumer  spending  that  they  have  over  the past  few  years. For  example,  while  light  vehicle  sales  have  continued  to  move  higher  in  recent  months, the  12-month  growth  rate  of  that  series  has  clearly  slowed.

Outside  of consumption,  we  project  housing construction to continue to move  higher, aided by ongoing  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions,  gradual  easing  of  mortgage  underwriting  standards, and  emerging  tightness  in housing  supply. Indeed, household  formation  moved  notably  higher  over the past three quarters. Beyond  that, the rental vacancy  rate appears  to be below  its equilibrium level, as rent  inflation  has  moved  higher. In another  indication  of  some  tightening  in  housing  supply, after slowing  over  the  year  ending  in  February  2015,  the  12-month  change  of  the  CoreLogic  national home  price  index  has  moved  up  to  6.9%  as  of  July.

We  also  anticipate  that  business  fixed  investment  (BFI)  will  gradually  strengthen  over  the  course of 2016. On the positive side, given our assumption of a gradual firming of oil prices, the steep contraction  in  investment  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector  should  be  largely  over  by  the  second  half  of  2015. On  the  negative  side,  the  economy  will  continue  to  adjust  to  the  steep  dollar  appreciation  of  the  past year, and  we  project  the  drag  from  net  exports  to  be  around  a  full  percentage  point  in  2016. Thus, while a bit stronger in 2016 than over the past three years, growth  of BFI  still will likely be only around  7%  (Q4/Q4). Growth  of  government  expenditures  is  projected  to  be  relatively  sluggish  over the  year,  as  we  assume  that  the  sequester  will  remain  in  eff ect.

In  2017  we  anticipate  that  growth  of  real  GDP  will  slow  to  just  under  2%,  due  to  a  combination  of further  aging  of  the  business  cycle  and  gradual  tightening  of  financial  conditions  as  the  federal  funds rate continues  along  its  assumed  normalization  path. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  fall  to

its longer-run  natural rate by the end of 2016 and then stabilize at that level with the labor force participation  rate  relatively  stable  in  the  62.6%  to  62.7%  range,  although  there  is  still  some  remaining overall  resource  slack  at  that  time. Accordingly,  inflation  moves  gradually  up  to  2%  by  the  end  of  2017 as slack  continues  to  decline  and  the  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation  fade. With  slack  largely  dissipated by the beginning  of 2018 and inflation expectations  anchored  at the FOMC's  longer-run  objective, real  GDP  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  are  all  projected  to  be  at  the  longer-run  levels  in  2018.

Respondent 17: Accommodative  monetary  policy, a healthy labor market, improved  household and  business  balance  sheets,  increased  access  to  credit,  and  continued  low  energy  prices  should  allow for solid growth  in domestic  demand. We  assume  little change  in the dollar going forward, so that the  constraint  on  net  exports  will  wane  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period. We  recognize  the large  uncertainty,  though,  about  how  international  developments  might  influence  the  outlook  for  U.S. growth  and  inflation.

The  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over the  next  2-1/2  years. As  monetary  policy  normalizes  and  cyclical  dynamics  run  their  course,  growth moderates  back  towards  potential  by  2018. We  assume  that  resource  gaps  will  be  close  to  zero  by  the second  half of 2016. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  reach  4.7  percent  by  the  end  of the of the  projection  period,  0.2  percentage  point  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  and  any  additional labor market  slack  not measured  by  the  unemployment  rate  gap  should  have  dissipated  by  then  as well.

Under this forecast, changes in resource slack and the assumed  stabilization of the dollar and energy  prices  work  to  boost  inflation. Furthermore,  as  noted  above,  we  assume  policy  normalization does  not  begin  until  mid-2016  and  that  rates  then  rise  along  a  quite  shallow  path  for  the  bulk  of  the projection period. We  also assume  that the Committee  will strongly communicate  its expectation that  rates  will  follow  such  a  path. We  feel  this  communication  is  necessary  to  reinforce  the  perception that  the Committee  is  firmly  committed  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target,  and  thus  solidify the upward  pull  on  actual  inflation  from  inflationary  expectations. Without  this  pull,  we  would  not expect  inflation  to  rise  close  to  target  over  the  forecast  period.

See  the  description  of  uncertainties  and  risks  in  section  2(b)  above.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Revisions  to  the  shorter-term  outlook  for  real  activity  and  inflation  largely  reflect the annual  revisions to the national accounts, the incoming  data  on  spending  and  production, and the more restrictive financial conditions implied by recent dollar appreciation, lower equity prices, and  higher  risk  premiums. I also  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  normal  long-run  level  of  the  real  federal funds rate in response to less favorable financial conditions, including the dollar. In addition, the disappointing  readings on wages  published  after the July meeting  suggested  to me  that there may be a bit more  labor market  slack than I previously  estimated, and so I edged  down  my  forecast  of the  longer-run  uneployment  rate. On  net  these  various  changes  meant  that  the  projected  path  of  the federal  funds  rate  needed  to  be  lowered  in  order  to  generate  the  slack  necessary  for  returning  inflation to 2 percent  over  the  medium  term

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: The  delay  in lift-off and  the momentum  in  the  economy  have  led  me  to  decrease my  estimates  for  unemployment  in  2016  and  2017.

Respondent 4: The  information  received  since  June  has  led  me  to  revise  up  my  forecast  for real GDP  growth  in  2015,  as  higher  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2015  more  than  off set  a  downward  revision for  the  second  half  of  the  year. I revised  down  my  forecast  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  2015  - 2017,  as the  recent  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  indicate  that  labor  market  slack  is  diminishing  somewhat faster than  I projected  in  June. However,  despite  the  diminishing  slack  I  revised  down  my  forecasts of PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  in  2015,  reflecting  the  temporary  eff ects  of  the  declines  in  oil prices  and  the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  since  June.

Respondent 5: I have marked  up  my  growth  forecast in 2015 by 0.3 percentage  points, though that is largely arithmetic,  given  the  upward  revision  to  first  half growth. My  medium  term  outlook remains  largely  intact,  as  the  incoming  domestic  evidence  have  come  in  consistent  with  my  outlook. My  longer-run  real  GDP  growth  projection  has  been  lowered  by  0.2  percentage  points,  reflecting  my judgment  that  a  fraction  of  the  lower  productivity  growth  we've  experienced  during  the  recovery  will persist.

Given  the  recent  surprise  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  to  5.1  percent,  it's  close  to  my  judgment of  its  longer-run  level. My  projection  is  for  the  (U-3)  unemployment  rate  to  fall  slightly  below  my  longrun  estimate  in  2016. However,  I  judge  the  more  elevated  level  of  the  U-6  measure  of  unemployment as a more  reliable  gauge  of labor market  slack  and  do  not  expect  much  pressure  on  wage  and  price growth  even  if  the  U-3  measure  slightly  overshoots  my  longer-run  estimate.

On  inflation, I've lowered  my  headline  PCE  inflation  forecast  for 2015 by 0.3 percentage  points reflecting  the  decline  in  oil  prices  since  the  June  meeting.

Respondent 6: Since  June,  I  have  made  few  changes  to  my  forecast. My  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in 2015  (Q4/Q4)  is  a  touch  higher,  primarily  due  to  the  stronger  than  expected  rebound  in  GDP  growth in the second  quarter. However,  my  medium  and  longer  run  forecasts  for  GDP  growth  are  slightly lower,  partly  because  the  output  gap  is  now  closer  to  zero  and  partly  because  of  indications  of  slower trend productivity growth. In addition, I have lowered slightly my forecast of the unemployment rate in the medium  and  longer  run  based  on  the  recent  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  and  some analyses  pointing  to  a  slightly  lower  natural  rate.

In addition,  my  inflation  forecast  for  the  next  two  years  is  a touch  lower,  reflecting  the  eff ects of lower  import  and  commodity  prices.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: As  just noted,  the  late  August  developments  in  global  markets  have  injected  considerable  uncertainty  into  the  expected  path  of  the  global  economy

Respondent 9: The  projected  pace of GDP  growth  is  now  somewhat  slower, mainly  as a result of revisions to the foreign growth  outlook  and  a more  appreciated  value of the dollar. In order to off set at least in part the deterioration  in  some  key  conditioning  factors, the forecast is conditioned on a somewhat  more  accommodative  policy  stance. Such  a stance also provides an opportunity  to better  assess  whether  the  recent  turbulence  in  financial  markets  represents  a  temporary  phenomenon, or whether  it signals a deterioration in fundamentals  that  is not adequately  captured  in our baseline outlook. The lower than expected starting point for the unemployment  rate  implies that the unemployment  rate  is  on  a  lower  trajectory  than  previously  thought. The  downward  revision  to  the equilibrium  unemployment  rate,  however,  means  that  full  employment  is  still  reached  by  the  end  2017. The  outlook  for  inflation  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 10: The  primary  factor  causing  my  forecast  to change  since the last SEP  is my  reassessment  of  the  long-run  rates  of  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate. Based  in  part  on  revisions  to past  productivity  growth,  I  have  reduced  my  estimate  of  potential  growth  slightly. At  the  same  time, the  tepid  pace  of  wage  growth  and  the  disconnect  between  moderate  growth  and  sharp  declines  in  the unemployment  rate  have  caused  me  to  slightly  reduce  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment rate. Admittedly,  the  statistical significance of these changes  is very small. These  revisions  largely explain  the  quantitative  changes  to  my  forecast;  qualitatively,  my  outlook  is  little  changed  from  the previous  SEP.  I  continue  to  expect  growth  to  pick  up  to  above-trend  levels. With  an  improving  economy  and stable inflation expectations, I expect further declines in the unemployment  rate  and  an inflation  rate  that  gradually  returns  to  our  target.

Respondent 11: NA

Respondent 12: First-quarter GDP  growth  has  been upwardly  revised since June and it's now clear that second-quarter  growth  was quite strong, off setting residual first-quarter weakness. As a result, our staff has revised  their 2015  growth  forecast  upward  and  their  end-of-2015  unemployment forecast  downward. Their  core  inflation  forecasts  are  largely  unchanged: They  project  that  inflation will approach  our 2-percent objective in 2017 and overshoot that objective in 2018. Their assessment  of  the  policy  path  likely  to be appropriate  has  shifted  modestly  downward  as  a  result  of  small downward  revisions  to  estimated  longer-run  equilibrium  unemployment  and  federal-funds  rates,  and because  broad  financial  conditions  (particularly  outside  the  U.S.)  have  deteriorated  somewhat  since the  previous  projection.

Respondent 13: After  long  consideration  and  much  consultation  with  staff  here  in  Minneapolis,  I have  decided  to  lower  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment.

Respondent 14: GDP  growth  is  0.3  percentage  points  higher  this  year,  due  to  the  upward  revisions in first half growth. Also,  I no  longer  assume  a  June  rate  increase.

Respondent 15: The  sense  that  economic  growth  is  becoming  more  robust.

Respondent 16: The  most  significant  changes  to  our  projections  concern  our  long-run  assumptions, which  was  part  of  our  usual  reassessment  of  those  assumptions  following  the  annual  revisions  to  the NIPA  and  productivity  data.

As we have noted a number  of times already, we have reduced our estimate of the longer-run potential GDP  growth  rate  from  2%  to  1 3 4 / %. Two  pieces  of analysis underlie this change. First, given  the downward  revision  to  real  GDP  growth  in  the  previous  few  years,  a  regression  analysis  of the  change  in  the  unemployment  rate  and  real  GDP  growth  in  the  expansion,  accounting  for  changes in labor  force  participation  in  this  period,  suggests  that  potential  real  GDP  growth  is  around  1 3 4 / %. Second,  a  separate  analysis  indicates  that  there  is  a  very  high  probability  that  the  U.S.  economy  is  in a low  trend  productivity  growth  state-on  the  order  of  1 1 4 / %  to  1 1 2 / %  in  the  nonfarm  business  sector (1%  to 1 1 4 / %  on  a GDP  basis). Given  common  estimates  of  trend  hours  growth,  this  analysis  also indicates  potential  real  GDP  growth  of  about  1 3 4 / %.

The other important change to our long-run assumptions is a reduction in the point estimate of the longer-run  natural  rate  of unemployment  from  5%  to  4 3 4 / %-we  would  note  that  we  still  see a reasonable range of estimates as 4% to 6%. Three arguments  underlie the change in the point estimate. First, estimates of the staff 's two-state model of labor market flows indicate that the steady-state  unemployment  rate  is  now  4.8%. Second,  another  piece  of  staff  analysis  shows  that  based on changes  in  demographics,  a  5%  unemployment  rate  in  2005  (a  reasonable  estimate  of  NAIRU  at that  time)  would  be  equivalent  to  4.7  - 4.8%  in  2020  (the  period  for  which  the  longer-run  refers  to  in the  SEP).  Third,  because  of  the  increase  of  involuntary  part-time  employment  and  other  factors,  the staff assesses  that  current  labor  market  slack  is  wider  than  suggested  by  the  standard  unemployment gap (if one used 5%  as NAIRU).  Consequently,  we  anticipate  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall below  5%  in  order  for  labor  market  slack  to  dissipate.

Turning  to  the  near- and  medium-term  projections,  for  real  GDP  growth,  the  first  half  was  stronger than  we  anticipated  in  June. Part  of  the  reason  for  the  stronger  growth  in  2015H1  was  robust  inventory investment. With  inventories-sales  ratios modestly  higher  than  they have been recently, we expect that inventory investment will slow in the second half, leading to a sizable negative GDP  growth contribution. This  factor  contributes  to  slower  growth  in  2015H2  than  we  projected  in  June,  with  the result that 2015  growth  is  little diff erent from  the  June  projection. Diff erences in real GDP  growth in this projection  from  the  June  projection  in subsequent  years  are  minor  and  primarily  reflect  our lower  potential  GDP  growth  assumption.

The  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  we  had  projected  in  June. With  little  change  in  our  economic growth  forecast,  our  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  slightly  lower  than  that  of  our  June SEP  submission. One  diff erence  is  that  the  unemployment  rate  does  not  fall  below  our  point  estimate of the longer-run  natural  rate  in this submission,  although  there  is  still a sizable probability  (based on  historical  patterns)  that  it  may  do  so  sometime  in  the  forecast  horizon.

Both  overall  and  core  inflation  in 2015H1  were  slightly  above  our  previous  projections;  however, with  the further  decline  in oil and  commodity  prices,  our  projection  for  total  PCE  inflation  in  2015 is lower  than  in  June. Beyond  that  horizon,  the  changes  in  the  inflation  projection  are  minor  and  we project  inflation  to  be  at  2%  at  the  end  of  2017.

Respondent 17: On  balance,  the  incoming  data  on  domestic  economic  activity  have  been  stronger than  we  expected  in  June. The  economy  appears  to  be  growing  above  trend,  with  clear  and  consistent progress  in the labor market. Accordingly,  we  raised  our forecast for 2015  real GDP  growth  about 0.3 percentage  point  higher  than  in June. However,  we  made  only  marginal  changes  to  our  growth outlook  for  2016  and  2017,  as  our  previous  forecast  already  incorporated  solid  momentum  in  private domestic  spending. We  also  lowered  our  unemployment  rate  forecast  by  roughly 1 4 / percentage  point throughout  the  projection  period  to  be  consistent  with  its  surprisingly  large  decline  since  June.

Although  we  have  not  appreciably  changed  our  forecast  for  actual  GDP  growth  beyond  the  current year,  we  have  altered  our  view  of  the  growth  path  for  potential  output  to  reflect  BEA's  annual  revisions

to  the  national  accounts  and  to  better  align  our  estimates  of  the  output  and  unemployment  rate  gaps. We  now  see  potential  output  growth  rising  from  about  1 1 2 / percent  per  year  during  2013-15  to  roughly 2 percent  in 2016  and  2017. We  have  also  reduced  our  assumption  for  potential  long-run  growth  to 2.2 percent. The revisions to potential imply the output gap is eliminated somewhat  sooner  than we  projected  in  June. We  assume  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  currently  is  5  percent,  but  that demographic  factors  will cause it to edge down  roughly  0.05  percentage  point  a year over the next several  years. As  a  result,  our  neutral  rate  of  unemployment  averages  4.9  percent  over  the  projection period.

As we noted earlier, the incoming  news  regarding  the  inflation outlook has been disappointing. The  dollar  has  appreciated  and  oil  prices  declined,  earlier  indications  of  a  pickup  in  wage  growth  have weakened,  inflation  break-even  rates  have  returned  to  recent  lows,  and  we  still  are  not  hearing  of  any price pressures  from  our business  contacts. Our  forecast for top-line PCE  inflation  has come  down a bit in 2015  while  our  forecast  for core inflation is unchanged. We  left our 2016  and  2017  inflation forecasts the same  as in June, as our reassessment  of supply  side factors off set other developments that  would  have  lowered  the  inflation  outlook.

We  left  our  policy  liftoff  date  at  mid-2016  and  marginally  lowered  the  funds  path  in  2017  to  reflect our belief that a touch more  accommodation  will  be  needed  to  return  inflation to 2 percent in the medium  term. Given  our changes to potential output, we reduced  our long-run federal funds rate assumption  to  3.25  percent.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: I continue to expect more rapid GDP  growth  in 2015 and 2016 than is in the Tealbook  forecast. I also expect  lower  unemployment  in  2016  than  the  Tealbook  and  a  much  higher long-run value. Finally, while the Tealbook  anticipates a steady convergence to inflation of 2%, I expect  an  overshooting  to  2.4%  before  a  convergence  to  2%.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016,  2017  and  2018  is  above  that  of  Tealbook, largely  because  I  am  less  pessimistic  than  Tealbook  about  net  exports  and  the  eff ects  of  lower  equity prices. My  outlook  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  is  several  tenths  of  a  percentage  point above Tealbook's projection in 2016 and 2017. With inflation expectations well anchored, I view inflation as less inertial than Tealbook, and therefore expect the eff ects of past dollar appreciation and  oil  price  declines  to  wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projection.

Respondent 5: After  making  similar  adjustments  to  the  near-term  path,  my  growth  forecast  continues  to  run  roughly 1 2 / percentage  point  above  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  mostly due  to our  diff ering perspectives  on  potential  GDP  growth. My  headline  and  core  inflation  forecasts run  about 1 4 / percentage  point  above  the  Tealbook  over  the  medium-term,  as  it  is  still  my  view  that inflation  expectations  remain  at  a  target-consistent  level  of  2  percent.

Respondent 6: My  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection. One  notable  diff erence  is that  the  Tealbook  has  a  more  protracted  return  of  inflation  to  the  FOMC's  stated  2  percent  objective. Also,  the  Tealbook  has  somewhat  slower  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2015  than  I  do,  though  I broadly  share  the  Tealbook's  view  on  GDP  growth  after  2015. Lastly,  while  I  have  a  similar  assessment of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  to  that  of  the  Tealbook,  I  have  a  somewhat  diff erent  forecast  path for the unemployment  rate  in  the  medium  run. Both  forecasts  have  the  unemployment  rate  dipping somewhat  below  the  natural  rate  in  2015  and  2016,  but  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  return  to the natural rate in 2017 whereas  the  Tealbook  projects  it to continue  falling at least through  2018 before  moving  back  toward  the  natural  rate.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: I am  modestly  more  optimistic  about  growth  over  the  next  couple  of  years.

Respondent 9: Our  forecast  is conditioned  on  a  more  gradual  increase  in  the federal funds  rate. The  two  forecasts  have  very  similar  outcomes  both  in  terms  of  economic  activity  and  inflation. Still, our lower estimate of the equilibrium unemployment  rate  provides less scope for overshooting full employment  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 10: My  growth  forecast  is  somewhat  stronger  than  the  September  Tealbook  forecast, but  the  diff erence  primarily  reflects  diff erent  estimates  for  trend  growth. As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect that GDP  growth will proceed at an above-trend pace in 2015 and 2016 and the unemployment rate will continue  to  decline. My  forecast  calls  for somewhat  more  inflationary  pressure  than  in  the Tealbook  forecast: I expect  that  inflation  will  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term  objective  by  early 2017. Compared  with  Tealbook,  this  firmer  path  for  inflation  calls  for  a  somewhat  steeper  path  for the  funds  rate.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  calls  for  stronger  growth  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: Even  though  our  forecast  has  moderated  somewhat  from  our  last  projection,  we still expect  faster  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2015  than  does  the  Tealbook,  and  more  strength in 2016  as well. This  extra growth  should  be  sufficient  to drive the unemployment  rate  down  more quickly than is projected in the Tealbook. Partly because of a lower unemployment  path, partly because I believe inflation is likely to respond to changes in the unemployment  rate  at this level, and  partly  because  I  believe  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations  are  well  anchored  at  2  percent,  I see inflation rising up  to and  then  past  our  2-percent  goal  within  the  projections  horizon. With  the unemployment  rate  falling  faster  and  farther  than  in  the  Tealbook, inflation rising somewhat  faster and  farther,  and  a  higher  long-run  equilibrium  interest  rate,  I  believe  that  the  funds-rate  path  should tend  to  be  somewhat  steeper  than  that  assumed  in  the  Tealbook  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 13: More  aggressive  use  of  monetary  policy  enables  the  Committee  to  return  inflation to its target  more  rapidly  than  under  the  policy  path  envisioned  in  Tealbook  A.

Respondent 14: I expect  higher  inflation  next  year  and  slightly  stronger  real  GDP  growth.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: The  Tealbook  forecast  and  our projections for the key SEP  variables  are fairly similar over the SEP  forecast horizon. However, because of diff erences in some of the underlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts,  the  interpretations  of  these  projections  are  quite  diff erent.

Because  the  Tealbook  has  lowered  the  level  of  potential  GDP  in  2015  and  reduced  the  near-term growth  rate  of  potential  GDP  over  much  of  the  forecast  horizon,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads to a fairly sizable positive output  gap  arising by 2017-18. Even  though  our  potential  GDP  growth assumption  is  now  a  little lower than  the Tealbook's  longer-run  potential  GDP  growth  assumption, near-term  growth  of  potential  in  our projection  is higher  than  that of the Tealbook. Consequently, even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  resource slack  dissipates  by  2018,  but  that  there  is  not  a  significantly  positive  output  gap  at  that  time.

The  other  notable  diff erence  in  the  underlying  assumptions  concerns  the  longer-run  natural  rate  of unemployment:  the  Tealbook  has  reduced  its  assumption  only  slightly  since  June  to  5.1%;  whereas  we have  lowered  our  assumption  by  a  somewhat  larger  amount  to  4.8%. Consequently,  unemployment  in our  projection  falls  only  to  the  natural  rate,  consistent  with  our  assessment  that  slack  dissipates  by  the end  of the forecast horizon. In contrast, the Tealbook  path  means  that  unemployment  undershoots the  longer-run  natural  rate;  this  pattern  is  the  counterpart  of  the  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the Tealbook  forecast. One  other  diff erence  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor force  participation: our  projection  has  a  flat  participation  rate  path  through  2017  while  the  Tealbook has it declining gradually to 62.3% at end-2017. This diff erence reflects our assumption of some positive  cyclical  eff ects  on  participation  as  well  as  a  slightly  shallower  downward  trend  component.

Turning  back  to  real  growth,  we  note  a  few  diff erences  in  the  details  of  the  near- and  medium-term projections. One  longstanding  diff erence regards business fixed investment. The  Tealbook  projects slower  growth  in  business  fixed  investment  in  2016-17  than  in  our  forecast;  this  diff erence  may  partly reflect  the  Tealbook  assessment  that  the  capital  stock  is  fairly  close  to  levels  consistent  with  its  rather low  estimate  of  potential  growth. This  factor  is  off set by  faster  consumption  growth  in  the  Tealbook forecast, another long-standing diff erence with our forecast, which in part reflects stronger wealth eff ects in the  Tealbook  forecast.

For inflation, the two forecasts diff er on how quickly inflation reaches the 2% objective: our projection  has  inflation  near  2%  at  the  end  of  2017  whereas  the  Tealbook  projects  that  inflation  will not  reach  that  level  until  2019. Note  that  the  Tealbook  has  this  slower  rise  to  2%  even  though  there  is a positive  output  gap  and  an  undershoot  of  unemployment  in  its  projection. This  diff erence  between the Tealbook  and  our  projections  reflects  diff ering  views  about  inflation  dynamics. In the Tealbook, with  the  underlying  inflation  rate  below  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  and  considerable  persistence in the inflation process, a prolonged  period of above-potential growth  (and a positive output gap) appears  to  be  necessary  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal-this  Tealbook forecast suggests that such a period is indeed  quite prolonged. The  faster return of inflation to its goal  in  our  forecast  reflects  our  assumptions  of  less  inflation  persistence  and  of  the  stronger  attraction provided  by  anchored  inflation  expectations.

In terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  a  few  diff erences  between  the  two  projections. On  the  real  side,  we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual  nature  of  the current  expansion,  the  atypical  policy  environment  in  the  U.S.  and  many  foreign  economies,  and  the possible implications of recent financial market  and  international economic  developments  leave  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard  associated  with  the  20-year  window  of  forecast errors. However,  we  agree  with  the  Tealbook  that  the  risks  to  real  growth  are  tilted  to  the  downside  for many  of  the  same  reasons  cited  in  the  Tealbook. As  for  inflation,  our  uncertainty  and  risk  assessments are  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  with  uncertainty  near  the  SEP  standard  and  risks  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 17: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  in  mid-2016,  three quarters  later than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of increase  after liftoff is a bit faster than  the  Tealbook and  consequently  we  converge  to  the  same  funds  rate  by  the  end  of  the  2018.

Our projection for GDP  growth runs about 1 2 / percentage point stronger than the Tealbook throughout  the  projection  period. However,  given  our  higher  assumption  for  potential  output  growth, our  forecast  represents  a  bit  weaker  cyclical  outlook  than  the  Tealbook. We  also  assume  the  long-run normal  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  averages  4.9  percent  over  the  projection  period,  0.2  percentage point  below  the  Tealbook's. Our  projection  for  inflation  essentially  matches  the  Tealbook.
