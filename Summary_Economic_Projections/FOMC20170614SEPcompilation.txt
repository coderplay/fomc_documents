Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level for the federal funds  rate  at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  March  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  14-15,  2017. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  March  14-15,  2017,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such projections  in  conjunction  with  the  June  13-14,  2017,  meeting.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Median projection and confidence interval based on historical forecast errors

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: We  believe  convergence  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  its  long-run  level  is  likely  to  take  about  2 1 / 2 years.

Respondent 3: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  four  years.

Respondent 4: Our  assumption  for  potential  GDP  growth  is  1.8  percent,  unchanged  from  March.  As  in  recent submissions,  we  judge  that  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  is  within  the  range  of  4  to  6  percent,  with the  mode  of  that  distribution  between  4.5  and  5  percent. Given  the  recent  trends  in  labor  market  conditions,  we have  nudged  down  our  point  estimate  from  the  middle  of  that  range  to  4.6  percent.

We  project  that  the  current  unemployment  rate  will  remain  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  through  the projection  horizon. Our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in long  expansions  indicate  that  there  is  significant  probability  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  somewhat  further below  its  longer-run  normal  level.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC longer-runobjective.  Undertheseconditionsandwithsomeundershootingofthelonger-runnormalunemployment rate  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  mildly  above  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective  in  2018-19,  before  returning  to  that  level  afterwards.

Respondent 5: Full  convergence  of  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  inflation  and  interest  rates  to  their longer-run  values  will  likely  take  six  years  or  so, for two  reasons. First, I expect  a  gradual  rise  in  the  neutral federal  funds  rate  through  2019  and  beyond  as  productivity  growth  slowly  picks  up  and  international  conditions (including  the  dollar)  improve.  Second,  my  projection  has  the  unemployment  rate  running  almost  1/2  percentage point  below  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  through  2019,  and  I  anticipate  that  a  modest  and  gradual  tightening in  policy  over  the  following  two  or  three  years  will  succeed  in  holding  inflation  around  2  percent  while  gradually getting  the  unemployment  rate  back  to  the  natural  rate  by  2022.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  five  years.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Labor-force  participation  is  near  its  demographic  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  now below  its  longer-run  sustainable  level,  but  inflation  remains  marginally  below  our  2-percent  longer-run  objective. With  the  labor  market  tight  and  monetary  policy  still  accommodative,  I  expect  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  by  the end  of  next  year. The  labor  market  will  be  stretched  at  that  point,  and  a  soft  landing  will  be  difficult  to  engineer. If we  are  successful,  full  convergence  to  maximum  sustainable  employment  with  price  stability  will  likely  take  5 years.

Respondent 10: I expect  real  GDP  growth  and  PCE  inflation  to  converge  to  their  longer-run  rates  next  year, while  the  unemployment  rate  will  likely  reach  its  longer-run  rate  only  later.  I  view  the  recent  weakness  in  consumer pricedataastransitoryandexpectinflationtosettleattwopercentfromnextyearonward.  Theunemploymentrate has  declined  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  and  I  expect  the  convergence  process  for  the  unemployment rate  to  last  five  or  six  years.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Reflecting  recent  data,  we  project  a  temporary  undershooting  of  inflation  for  2017. GDP growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  have  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of  2.0%,  an  unemployment rate  of  4.5%,  and  inflation  of  2.0%.  Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  for  these  variables  based  on  multiple outcomes  is  potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0%  longer-run  inflation  projection  that  is  independent  of the  regime.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  or  exceeded  by  the  end  of  2018. However,  it  will  take at least  a couple  more  years  to  achieve  complete  convergence  to  our  longer-run  projections. The  effects  from accommodative monetary policy  will  generate  some  overshooting  of  inflation  and  undershooting  of  unemployment before  dissipating  over  the  longer  run.

Respondent 16: Given  our  current  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate,  the  economy  is  now operating  above  potential  and  the  underlying  pace  of  activity  suggests  a  significant  risk  of  further  undesirable overshooting  of  full  employment  in  the  near  term.  In  order  to  converge  back  to  full  employment,  a  prolonged  period of growth  below  potential  will  be  needed. The  historical  record,  however,  places  a  significant  probability  on  a 'growth  recession'eventually  morphing into  a full-blown  recession.  In  sum,  while  a purely  model-driven  forecast would  suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below  around  2021-22,  there  is  a  nontrivial risk  that  the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: WethinkuncertaintyaboutthegrowthforecasthasdiminishedsinceMarch,whileuncertainty over  the  inflation  outlook  has  increased. Still,  on  balance,  we  continue  to  judge  that  the  levels  of  uncertainty  for both  forecasts  fall  into  the  'broadly  similar'  bucket. The  size  and  timing  of  new  fiscal,  trade,  immigration,  and regulatorypolicies,  andtheircorrespondingimpactonhouseholdandbusinessspending, continuetobeunresolved. However,  at  least  in  the  near  term,  the  odds  of  large  changes  in  policy  appear  to  have  diminished. Volatility  in financial  markets  continues  to  be  very  low. Concerns  over  foreign  economic  growth  appear  to  have  fallen  further since  March.  The  labor  market  has  tightened  while  the  inflation  data  have  been  disappointing;  the  lack  of  clarity about  how  these  opposing  factors  will  net  out  boosts  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: Ours  is  a quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are somewhat  narrower  than  in  our  March  SEP  submission,  as  economic  data  have  been  roughly  consistent  with  our central  projection  and  geopolitical  uncertainty  has  diminished  (notwithstanding  the  results  of  the  June  8  election in the  U.K.). As  some  of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our  forecasts  has  dissipated,  the  probability  intervals  for real  activity  and  core  PCE  inflation  forecasts  are  now  broadly  in  line  with  the  SEP  standard  (for  inflation,  this assessment  takes  into  rough  account  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core PCE  inflation).

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened uncertainty  about  the  course  of  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  trade  policy. The  impact  on  inflation  uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: While  I  see  possible  upside  from  potential  fiscal  policy  and  structural  reforms,  I  am  not  unduly optimistic  about  the  sustainable  positive  impact  of  these  actions.  Regulatory  review,  if  thoughtfully  done,  as  well as  appropriate  infrastructure  spending  decisions  could  be  helpful  to  GDP  growth.  However,  I  am  concerned  about the  potential  negative  impacts  of  healthcare  reform  and  immigration  policies,  and  about  tax  policies  which  create a  short  term  bump  in  GDP  growth  but  ultimately  do  not  create  sustained  improvement  in  GDP,  and  leave  us  with a higher  level  of  debt  to  GDP  at  a  time  when  the  US  government  is  already  highly  leveraged. I am  hopeful  that trade  policy,  despite  recent  rhetoric,  will  be  done  in  a  way  that  doesn't  dismantle  logistics  and  other  integrated supply  chain  arrangements  which  I  believe  help  US  competiveness  and  help  job  growth  in  the  US.

Uncertainty  about  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years  is  unusually  high.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 15: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 16: N/A

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Our  forecast  assumes  a  very  modest  impetus  to  growth  arising  from  fiscal  policy.  These  and otherpotentiallegislativeoradministrativepolicychangesremainquitespeculative.  Nonetheless,giventhecurrent legislative  environment,  we  feel  the  likelihood  of  an  outsized  boost  to  growth  from  large  fiscal  actions  appears  to have  diminished.  The  same  can  be  said  for  the  downside  risks  posed  by  other  potential  policies.  Changes  in  other risk  factors  have  been  small,  and  we  continue  see  the  overall  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  as  roughly  in  balance.

The  recent  low  inflation  data  are  disconcerting,  as  are  the  continued  low  levels  of  financial  market  inflation compensation  and  household  measures  of  inflation  expectations. We  believe  changes  in  these  factors  are  only partially  o ffset  by  the  lower  unemployment  rate,  and  accordingly  we  marked  down  both  our  core  and  total  inflation forecasts  by  0.2  percentage  point  in  2017  and  0.1  percentage  point  in  2018  and  2019. These  revisions  allow  us  to continue  to  characterize  the  risks  to  our  inflation  forecast  as  balanced,  although  this  was  a  close  call.  In  the  end  we 'rounded  up'to  a  balanced  risk  assessment  for  the  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 3: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced. However,  this  view continues  to  be  based  on  a  monetary  policy  path  that  is  a  bit  steeper  than  the  median  path  in  the  March  SEPs.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  continue  to  expect  some  changes  to  fiscal  and  other  economic  policies,  pertaining to some  combination  of  infrastructure  spending,  the  tax  code,  immigration,  trade,  healthcare,  and  regulation. However,  there  continues  to  be  uncertainty  about  what,  if  anything,  will  be  passed  and  the  timing. My  baseline forecast  incorporates  fiscal  stimulus  in  line  with  the  size  and  timing  of  the  package  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  but thereisconsiderableuncertainty.  Thefiscalpolicyassumptionsleadtoonlyamodestincreaseinoutputgrowthand inflation  in  2018  and  2019  in  my  projections.  While  a  larger  package  could  pose  upside  risks  to  growth  and  inflation, depending  on  how  it  is  financed,  a  larger  fiscal  policy  package  could  also  pose  some  downside  risks  over  the  longer run  because  of  the  implications  for  the  budget  deficit  and,  therefore,  for  long-term  interest  rates.  A  fiscal  package that  doesn't  meet  investors'  expectations  could  generate  financial  market  volatility  and  poses  a  downside  risk. Failure  to  pass  legislation  in  line  with  expectations  also  has  the  potential  to  increase  uncertainty  more  generally. If  political  uncertainty  continues  to  rise  more  generally,  this  could  lead  consumers  and  businesses  to  delay  activity, and  thus,  poses  a  downside  risk.  Policies  that  constrain  immigration  and  trade  would  have  negative  effects  for  the U.S.  economy  over  the  longer  run,  but  I  have  not  incorporated  these  into  my  projections.

The  global  outlook  has  improved  over  the  last  year.  Some  risks  remain,  including  the  weak  banking  system  in Italy,  uncertainty  around  the  outcomes  of  the  elections  in  European  countries,  the  continued  rebalancing  of  the Chineseeconomy,vulnerabilitiesinemergingmarketeconomies,andgeopoliticalrisks.  Accommodativemonetary policy  in  many  countries  will  continue  to  help  support  their  economies.

At  this  point,  I  continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced  and  I  continue  to  expect  that  inflation  will gradually  return  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  time. The  recent  weaker  readings  on  inflation  suggest  it  may  take slightly  longer  to  achieve  a  sustained  return  to  2  percent  inflation  than  in  my  March  forecast,  however  I  still  expect this  goal  to  be  met  by  the  end  of  2018.

Because  price  and  wage  inflation  have  remained  moderate  even  as  labor  markets  continue  to  tighten,  in  this projection  I've  reduced  my  estimate  of  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  to  4.75  percent  from  5  percent.  Even  so, I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  remain  below  this  longer-run  level  over  the  forecast  horizon. If labor  markets tighten  more  than  I've  assumed  and  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  kick  in,  then  this  could  translate  into  higher inflation,  especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  slower  than  I've  assumed. Even  absent  a change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  than  I've  assumed  poses an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

The  risks  to  inflation  from  oil  prices  appear  balanced,  as  geopolitical  risks  have  increased  while  domestic  oil supply  has  responded  strongly  to  higher  prices  over  the  past  year.

A  larger  appreciation  of  the  dollar  than  I'm  expecting  poses  a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far,  but  given  the  outlook  and the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an  appropriate  pace, these  risks  would  rise.  Indeed,  the  low  level  of  market  volatility  coupled  with  the  low  equity  premium  suggests  that these  risks  may  be  building.

Respondent 4: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution.  With  little  resolution  concerning  U.S.  fiscal,  regulatory, and  trade  policy  changes,  risks  remain  significant  on  both  sides  of  the  real  activity  outlook.  Overall,  as  in  March, they  are  roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  also  remain  roughly  balanced  throughout  the  forecast  horizon.  Longer-term  inflation  compensation  has  declined  moderately  and  the  Michigan  long-run  survey  inflation  expectations  have  been  stable-both are  at  low  levels,  consistent  with  continued  downside  risks.  In  addition,  our  SCE  3-year  inflation  expectations  and some  measures  of  underlying  inflation  have  moved  down  since  March. By  contrast,  global  disinflationary  forces appear  to  have  somewhat  abated  and  financial  conditions  have  eased,  indicating  still-significant  upside  risks.

Respondent 5: Continued  high  readings  on  consumer  and  business  sentiment  since  the  election  and  rising equityvaluationsmaysignalstrongerconsumptionandinvestmentthanIexpect; realactivitycouldalsobeboosted by  expansionary  fiscal  policy.  These  upside  risks  to  real  activity  are  roughly  balanced  by  the  potential  for  a  stock market  correction  as  well  as  the  asymmetries  created  by  the  effective  lower  bound  on  interest  rates.  Inflation  risks remain  broadly  balanced:  Although  recent  soft  monthly  readings  on  various  price  measures  suggest  a  slight  shift to  the  downside,  this  shift  is  balanced  by  an  upward  revision  to  the  projected  level  of  labor  utilization.

Respondent 6: Monetary  policy  is  currently  highly  accommodative,  as  evidenced  by  a  negative  real  federal funds  rate.  The  unemployment  rate  is  below  most  estimates  of  the  natural  rate.  While  my  modal  forecast  is  for  a soft  landing  with  inflation  on  target,  there  is  an  elevated  risk  that  shocks  could  lead  to  overheating.

Respondent 7: Fiscal  uncertainty  remains  high. Some  stimulus  may  be  forthcoming  that  would  boost  demand,  raise  output  growth,  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further. The  magnitude  and  timing  of  any  such stimulus  remains  uncertain.

Respondent 12: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity  growth  regime  is possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  as  this  time.  We  do  not  see  the  fiscal  and  deregulation proposals  of  the  administration  as  sufficiently  concrete  or  close  enough  to  enactment  to  forecast  a  high  productivity regime.  Such  a  possible  switch,  however,  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion.  If  a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially.  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon;  however,  such  a  possibility  leads  us  to  allow  for  a  higher  unemployment rate.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate.  We  see  the  risks as  broadly  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  that  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate falls. It is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  could  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. Thus,  we  see  the risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  this  variable  also  depends  on the  behavior  of  energy  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  effective  lower bound  limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a countervailing  risk  that  it  will  fall  more  rapidly  if  the  labor  force  participation  rate  resumes  its  downward  trend. Therefore  I  see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 15: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced.  We  have  reached  our  objective  of  maximum sustainable  employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  be  beyond  full  employment for  the  next  couple  of  years. The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long. Despite  some  Q1  softness, consumer  spending  is  on  track  for  solid  growth  this  year,  bolstered  by  a  stronger  labor  market  and  equity  wealth gains.

I continue  to  expect  some  fiscal  policy  impetus  in  2018  and  2019. However,  there  is  significant  uncertainty about  the  size,  composition,  timing,  and  effect  of  future  fiscal  and  other  government  policy  initiatives.

Uncertainty  about  growth  in  foreign  economies  appears  to  have  subsided  somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  some risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  remain.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced. A  tightening  of  resource  utilization  supports  the  continued  movement  of inflation  towards  2  percent  and  a  slight  overshooting  some  time  afterwards. In recent  months,  the  dollar  has declined,  which  should  put  upward  pressure  on  import  prices  in  the  near  term.  On  the  other  hand,  oil  prices  have declined  somewhat  and,  if  sustained,  could  lead  to  lower  inflation  for  some  time. The  size,  scope,  and  impact  of expected  fiscal  and  other  government  policy  measures  are  a  contributing  factor  to  inflation  risk.

Respondent 16: Our  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  is  fairly  upbeat,  and  we  view  the  near-term risks  around  the  real  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. The  recent  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  continues  to be  consistent  with  a  low  estimate  of  the  potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy. In  this  context,  if  our  real  growth forecast  materializes,  that  would  entail  a  notable  risk  that  the  unemployment  rate  would  fall  by  more  than  what we  are  envisioning  absent  an  improvement  in  potential  GDP  growth.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Progress  toward  the  Committee's  inflation  objective  appears  to  have  stalled,  with  trailing twelve-month  core  PCE  inflation  at  1.5  percent,  little  different  from  a  year  earlier.  In  addition,  it  now  appears  that fiscal  stimulus  is  likely  to  be  of  smaller  magnitude  and  delayed  relative  to  my  earlier  assessment.  For  these  reasons, and  taking  into  account  the  expected  change  in  reinvestment  policy,  after  the  June  meeting,  my  federal  funds  rate path  holds  steady  for  the  remainder  of  2017.  With  inflation  projected  to  rise  gradually  toward  target  in  2018  and 2019,  interest  rates  rise  again. However,  the  increase  in  rates  is  only  gradually. In  particular,  with  inflation  still below  target  by  2019,  the  federal  funds  rate  is  below  my  estimate  of  its  long-run  level,  despite  an  unemployment rate  that  is  below  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 2: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  twice  in  2017,  4  times  in 2018,  and  then  reaching  its  long-run  neutral  rate  of  3  percent  in  the  second  half  of  2019.  We  anticipate  raising  the funds  rate  25  bps  in  June  and  then  putting  rate  hikes  on  a  hiatus  for  the  rest  of  2017. We  assume  balance  sheet normalization  begins  in  September  of  this  year. We  believe  this  policy  package  represents  a  balanced  approach to  achieving  both  of  our  dual  mandate  objectives. In  particular,  we  think  the  fourth-quarter  rate  pause  will  be appropriate  to  avoid  the  credibility  risks  that  would  be  presented  by  further  tightening  in  the  presence  of  the continued  low  inflation  we  are  projecting. Risk  management  considerations  also  continue  to  argue  in  favor  of tempering  policy  moves. If growth  proceeds  along  our  forecast  path  and  inflation  solidifies  as  expected,  then  by next  year  we  believe  rate  increases  will  be  able  to  proceed  at  a  somewhat  faster  pace.

Respondent 3: I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  in  the  funds  rate  as  appropriate.  Given  the  changes in  my  outlook  for  inflation,  my  path  is  slightly  flatter  in  2017  and  2018  than  in  my  March  projection. I anticipate that  we  will  change  our  reinvestment  policy  later  this  year  to  begin  normalizing  the  balance  sheet  and  I  view  this as  appropriate.

In  2017  and  2018,  I  project  that  growth  will  be  somewhat  above  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  below  my estimates  of  their  longer-run  levels. I anticipate  that  labor  compensation  measures  will  firm  moderately,  in  line with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  a  variety  of  data  showing that  wage  and  compensation  gains  have  been  picking  up  over  time.  However,  these  gains  will  likely  be  slower  than in  past  expansions  reflecting  slower  growth  in  productivity.

The  recent  weaker  readings  in  inflation  partly  reflect  transitory  factors.  Reasonably  stable  inflation  expectations  coupled  with  continued  strength  in  labor  markets  and  ongoing  economic  growth  suggest  that  inflation  will gradually  increase  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals.  Based  on  the  outlook,  I  believe  it  will  be

appropriate for the FOMC to move rates up over the course of the forecast horizon. I assume that the funds rate will end 2019 at a level slightly higher than my longer-run estimate of 3 percent.

Respondent 4: The principal factors behind our assessment of the appropriate path for monetary policy are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the outlook. The steepness of the policy path also depends on how overall financial conditions respond to our policy actions.

Because our projections are largely unchanged, our current projections of the appropriate policy path are the sameasintheMarchsubmission. ThetargetFFRrangesattheendof2017,2018,and2019are1 / -1 / percent, 1 4 1 2 2 - 2 1 / 4 percent, and 2 3 / 4 - 3 percent respectively. Our policy path remains fairly shallow and is consistent with the gradual rising path of the natural interest rate as projected by the staff DSGE model.

Our estimate of the longer-run equilibrium real short-term interest rate remains in the range of 0 - 2 percent, consistent with the estimates and forecasts from a variety of models. Adding the objective for inflation (2 percent) gives our estimated range for the nominal equilibrium rate as 2 - 4 percent. Our modal projection is in the lower half of this range due to the combination of continued subdued productivity growth, still-low longer-term sovereign yields, continued indications of a global'saving glut,'and demographic factors. Relative to the March submission, however, as reported in the response to question 3(a) we raised our point estimate of the nominal equilibrium rate to 2 3 / 4 percent, reflecting primarily the easing of financial conditions since the beginning of the year. Despite this increase, our appropriate policy path temporarily slightly overshoots the longer-run FFR.

As for the balance sheet policy, we assume that under our central projection the conditions for starting the phase-out of reinvestment will be met by end-2017Q3.

Respondent 5: My assessment of appropriate policy rests on three assumptions. First, keeping the unemployment rate near 4 percent for the next two or three years will facilitate the return of inflation to our 2 percent objective by 2019. Second, the federal funds rate is currently somewhat below its neutral rate, implying that a few additional hikes will be needed in the next few quarters to prevent the unemployment rate from falling below 4 percent. And third, the neutral rate is likely to slowly rise over time as productivity growth and global demand for USproducts pick up. As a result, additional gradual increases in the federal funds rate will likely be required over the next six years or so, first to keep the unemployment rate near 4 percent through 2019, and then to gradually move it back up to its longer-run sustainable level of 4-1/2 percent . Under this strategy, the federal funds rate would still be somewhat below its longer-run level at the end of 2019 even though inflation would be back to 2 percent and the unemployment rate would be below the natural rate.

Respondent 6: Inflation has been below 2 percent for a lengthy period. Leading indicators for inflation are not signaling any material increase. We have examined several forecasting models that predict that inflation will remain under 2 percent for a considerable period. Under these circumstances, I believe that we can remove monetary accommodation at a modest pace without undue risk of significantly overshooting our inflation target of 2 percent. I also believe that under appropriate policy we will begin reducing our security holdings this year.

Respondent 7: Myprojection for the appropriate path for the federal funds rate is unchanged from last time. Myviewisthatpolicyshouldadjust at a gradual pace given low productivity growth, uncertainty about the future path of the labor force participation rate, and inflation that has been running below target for some time.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Prospects for meaningful policies that might grow the workforce or improve productivity have dimmed somewhat, reducing upward pressure on the neutral real funds rate, r*. In response I've lowered my estimate of the longer-run value of the funds rate by 25 basis points and assumed a shallower path for the funds rate over the projections horizon. Risks to my funds-rate projections are balanced, in my view. However, my confidence that the funds-rate path I have specified will, in fact, prove to be appropriate is lower than usual. I am cognizant that the 10 year treasury yield now stands at approximately 2.15 percent. I believe that if this rate stays as is, our operating flexibility in raising the fed funds rate will be more limited.

I expect it will be appropriate to begin scaling back reinvestment of funds from maturing Treasury and MBS securities in our portfolio sometime later this year-probably in September. I do not expect the exact timing of the change in reinvestment policy to influence on my thinking on the appropriate path for the funds rate.

Respondent 10: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  to  be  near  two  percent  in  2017.  Yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2017.  In  my  view  such  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate promotes  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 11: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate.

Respondent 12: Toreflectadditionalupwardmovementinthelowrealinterestrateonshort-termgovernment debt,  we  have  one  more  25  basis  point  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  in  2017,  with  no  additional  changes  in  2018 and  2019. By  2018  all  variables  will  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity growth  and  a  still  low  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.

Respondent 13: Thelowlevelofthefederalfundsratehasbeennecessarytomoveinflationandunemployment back  toward  our  targets.  This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low  rate  of  productivity  growth and  other  factors. Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring  a  low  federal  funds  rate  for  some time  in  order  to  deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 14: Inflation  continues  to  come  in  below  our  2  percent  target;  in  fact  it  has  come  down  a  bit over  the  past  three  months. Even  though  the  labor  market  continues  to  strengthen,  it  is  not  clear  that  we  have reached  maximum  employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime age  persons  remain  well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. In addition,  the neutral  funds  rate  is  expected  to  rise  from  its  currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several  years. As  a  result,  the  federal  funds  rate  should  increase  very  gradually.

Respondent 15: The  labor  market  is  beyond  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  of  slack.  Labor markets  will  continue  to  tighten  this  year-with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  further  below  its  natural  rate-before gradually  returning  to  its  long-run  steady-state  value.  On  inflation,  despite  some  recent  weakness  due  to  transitory factors,  I  expect  a  continued  gradual  increase,  reaching  our  2  percent  objective  by  the  end  of  2018  and  overshooting it in  2019. Underpinning  this  path  is  my  view  that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run  above potential,  and  that  this  will  contribute  to  upward  pressure  on  inflation.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  this  year  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest. This reflects  the  fact  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only  gradually  to  our  objective  from  below.  Beyond  the  near  term,  I envision  a  faster  pace  of  fed  funds  rate  normalization  than  predicted  by  fed  funds  futures.  The  fed  funds  rate  will overshoot  its  long-run  level  a  bit  by  the  end  of  2018  and  in  2019  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in  inflation  and  labor market  conditions. In  addition,  I  have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  long-term  equilibrium  real  interest  rate, incorporating  mounting  evidence  on  this  topic.  Similarly  to  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  the  SOMA  portfolio  to  start  to gradually  decline  before  the  end  of  this  year  with  the  reduction  in  reinvestments.

Respondent 16: The  tightening  of  monetary  policy  is  accompanied  in  this  projection  by  a  contraction  in  the SOMA  portfolio  starting  early  this  summer.  The  projected  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  balances  the  need  to avoid  overshooting  full  employment  by  a  larger  amount  with  the  risk  of  destabilizing  financial  markets  by  raising rates  at  an  even  faster  pace.  The  stance  of  monetary  policy  in  this  forecast  pushes  probing  for  a  lower  equilibrium unemployment  rate  to  what  is  likely  the  limit  before  the  probability  that  a  soft  landing  will  turn  into  a  recession becomes  too  high. The  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  conditioned  on  an  equilibrium  federal  funds rate  that  stays  below  our  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent  for  most  of  the  forecast  horizon. Specifically,  over  the forecast  horizon  the  average  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  is  around  2.7  percent.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: If fiscal  stimulus  is  enacted,  it  now  appears  likely  to  be  smaller  and  later  than  before. On the  other  hand,  global  growth  projections  have  been  revised  up,  downside  risks  from  abroad  have  diminished,  and financial  conditions  have  eased  on  balance.

Respondent 2: We  expect  growth  to  run  moderately  above  potential  through  2019.  The  first  quarter  lull  in consumer  spending  appears  to  have  been  transitory. Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market, and  improved  household  balance  sheets  should  support  solid  gains  in  consumer  spending.  Business  outlays  appear at  last  to  be  growing  at  a  healthier  pace. We  assume  fiscal  policy  provides  a  small  boost  to  growth,  with  higher defense  spending  in  2017:H2  adding  0.1  percentage  point  to  GDP  growth  for  the  year  as  a  whole  and  tax  cuts  raising GDP 0.1  percentage  point  in  2018.  At  4.3  percent,  the  unemployment  rate  is  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate, and  we  expect  it  to  continue  to  be  modestly  below  the  neutral  rate  as  we  move  through  the  forecast  period. We project  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  4.0  percent  in  2019,  0.6  percentage  point  below  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to prevail  at  that  time.  (We  think  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  averages  4.6  percent  over  the  projection  period, but  will  fall  to  4.5  percent  in  the  long  run.)

Our  forecast  does  not  have  core  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  until  after  the  projection  period.  The  incoming dataoninflationwereasetback.  Eventually,overshootinginresourceslackshouldprovidesomelifttoinflationgoing forward. Furthermore,  our  assumption  of  a  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  play  critical  roles  in  solidifying  inflation  expectations  and help  to  bring  actual  inflation  toward  target. The  inflation  forecast  has  been  marked  down  two  tenths  in  2017  and a  tenth  in  2018  and  2019  compared  to  our  March  forecast.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 3: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  accommodative monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement in  labor  markets,  and  relatively  low  oil  prices. Business  investment  has  strengthened. Consistent  with  the  data, business  contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified workers,  and  some  increased  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations.  The  global  outlook  has improved  over  the  last  year. Inflation  rates  here  and  abroad  are  fluctuating  around  a  general  upward  trajectory, supported  by  accommodative  monetary  policy.

In  the  U.S.,  there  will  likely  be  some  form  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  although  the  details  are  still  unknown. I've  incorporated  fiscal  policy  assumptions  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook.  My  modal  forecast  is  not  dependent on  a  sizable  fiscal  policy  package;  I  expect  that  fiscal  stimulus  will  provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth  and  inflation over  the  forecast  horizon.  There  is  considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  my  fiscal  policy  assumptions.  In  addition, there  is  uncertainty  about  whether  policies  that  constrain  immigration  and  trade  will  be  enacted. While  I  have not  incorporated  such  effects  into  my  baseline  forecast,  these  would  have  negative  effects  for  the  U.S.  economy  over the  longer  run.

The  U.S.  economy  has  been  growing  at  a  moderate  rate  and  labor  market  conditions  have  strengthened  over the  last  year.  From  the  perspective  of  what  monetary  policy  can  do,  I  believe  we  are  at  or  slightly  beyond  maximum employment.

While  recent  readings  on  inflation  have  softened,  transitory  factors  have  played  a  role. Measured  year-overyear,  inflation  is  notably  higher  than  it  was  in  2015  and  most  of  2016  and  is  not  far  from  our  2  percent  goal.  I  view inflation  expectations  as  reasonably  well-anchored. This,  coupled  with  continued  strengthening  in  labor  market conditions  and  ongoing  economic  growth,  suggests  that  inflation  will  gradually  move  to  2  percent  on  a  sustained basis  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Although  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  fiscal  and  other  government  policies,  I  view  overall  uncertainty  as roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years.  As  described  above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 4: Theweaknessofreal GDPgrowthin2017Q1appearstohavebeenatemporaryphenomenon, andweexpectgrowthtoreboundtoaround3percent(annualrate)inthesecondquarter, andthuscomeinaround 2 percent for 2017H1, the same as for 2016 (Q4/Q4). Growth is then projected to firm to around 2 1 / 4 percent over 2017H2, reflecting modestly stronger growth of final sales to domestic purchasers and somewhat less drag from both inventories and net exports. In 2018 we project growth to slow to around 1 3 / 4 percent, due largely to an anticipated tightening of financial conditions associated with the continued gradual normalization of monetary policy. Growth in 2019 is expected to be similar.

Weprojectreal PCEgrowthover2017H2topick-upfrom1.8percent(annualrate) over 2017H1to 2.4 percent, supported by steady income growth, further improvement in household net worth and high consumer confidence. PCE growth is then expected to slow to just above 2 percent by the end of 2018. We anticipate business fixed investment to grow moderately, and housing starts to remain on a gradual uptrend as the housing inventory is still quite low. Overall, we project growth of final sales to domestic purchasers to be slightly stronger in 2017 than in 2016, and then to slow somewhat in 2018.

As has been the case for the past few cycles, we continue to hold off on incorporating any fiscal stimulus into our forecast, so that we expect no growth contribution from the government sector.

These projections imply that for roughly the next six to twelve months we expect the economy to grow at a somewhat above its potential rate, further reducing slack. Any associated decline of the unemployment rate should be contained by firming of productivity growth and a gradual rise of the labor force participation rate. We expect the unemployment rate to average 4.3 percent in 2017Q4 and then rise slightly to 4.4 percent in 2018Q4 and 2019Q4.

Regarding inflation, we believe that many of the factors responsible for the recent slowdown of core inflation are temporary, and our models continue to project a gradual firming of underlying inflation. With the economy operating near or modestly beyond full employment and inflation expectations anchored at the FOMC's objective, core PCE inflation is projected to rise from 1.7 percent in 2017 to 2.1 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2019. Overall PCE inflation is similar in those latter two years.

Respondent 5: Myforecast is conditioned on several key assumptions. First, the forces currently restraining growth (slow productivity growth, an elevated exchange rate, and restrictive mortgage credit) will abate only gradually. Second, no enactment of a major fiscal stimulus package. Third, the federal funds rate rises gradually over time, stabilizing the unemployment rate near 4 percent, roughly 1/2 percentage point below its longer-run level. And fourth, a moderately tight labor market and anchored inflation expectations allow actual inflation to move up to 2 percent over the next couple of years.

Key risks to the outlook include the possibility of major changes in federal economic policy (including ones with potentially adverse effects); the chance of a significant market correction given current valuations that are somewhatrich; the risk that high levels of consumer and business confidence will actually show through to stronger spending; and the chance that recent low monthly CPI readings signal a more persistent weakness in inflation.

Respondent 6: I expect real GDP to grow slightly more rapidly than its trend value of 1.8 percent in 2017 and 2018. In 2019, my best estimate is for trend growth. This forecast does not assume any significant change in fiscal policy, since the timing, size, and composition of any change is highly uncertain. For example, many analysts believe that fiscal policy changes will include a reduction in the corporate tax rate. However, we have been told that corporate executives who had earlier incorporated such a change in their internal plans are now concluding that no change will occur in this Congressional session.

Respondent 7: Myforecast calls for output growth of about 2 percent over the forecast horizon. I continue to expectthatsomefiscalstimulusmaybeforthcomingoverthenextfewyears,butbecausethetimingandmagnitude is so uncertain it is not yet meaningfully affecting my point forecast. However, I see some upside risk to output growth over the medium term. I have revised down my projection for the unemployment rate in response to the incoming data. I expect the unemployment rate to fall below my estimate of the natural rate as the economy grows at about its trend pace and the labor force participation rate edges down. Headline inflation has been held down recently by transitory factors. As these factors wane headline inflation moves up the 2 percent target by the beginning of 2018. With inflation and output growth running near my longer-term trends and the unemployment rate below my estimate of the natural rate, monetary policy becomes less accommodative over the forecast horizon. However, accommodation is removed at a gradual pace in light of the economic uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy, regulatory and trade reform, productivity growth, and inflation dynamics.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Cutbacks in OPEC and Russian oil production are being offset by increases in U.S. output, which are a clear plus for the U.S. economy. Substantial oil inventories and the high price-elasticity of shale oil production reduce the danger that continued expansion of the world economy will be choked off by sharply higher energy prices anytime soon.

I expect U.S. GDP growth to be more balanced than has been the case in recent years, with a larger growth contribution from fixed investment and a reduced drag from net exports helping to complement the growth contribution from consumer spending.

Monetary policy remains accommodative, and with labor-market strains increasingly in evidence it is appropriate to continue withdrawing monetary stimulus. In light of aging demographics leading to slowing workforce growth, I believe that r* may stay lower for longer than is commonly recognized. While asset valuations are high by historical standards, corporate profits have firmed and the market may be taking into account lower interest rates for an extended period of time.

Transitions to sustainable, non-inflationary growth are always difficult, but this is especially so once the unemployment rate has fallen below the natural rate. The exact mechanisms are unclear, but probably revolve around levels of debt, physical capital, and staffing that suddenly become problematic-inducing sharp cutbacks in spending and hiring-when it becomes apparent that the growth outlook must be revised downward. (It sometimes seems that the economy has only two distinct modes-(1) growth above potential and (2) recession-with very different dynamics.) Substantial unemployment undershoot now seems all but inevitable, and it will take unusual skill and a good measure of luck to engineer a soft landing.

Respondent 10: Modal forecast: My forecast for real GDP growth is characterized by growth near trend in the period from 2017 to 2019. As the stimulus from accommodative financing conditions and gains in household wealth gradually diminishes, I expect growth to become more self-sustaining, based on modest increases in the labor force and a moderate pace of productivity gains. I view the economy as at or beyond full capacity, and expect the unemployment rate to remain below its longer-run level in the next few years, before gradually moving back toward its longer-run rate. I see PCE inflation average 1.7 percent in 2017, and rise further to 2 percent next year, as labor market conditions tighten and the effects of past dollar appreciation and lower energy prices dissipate.

Uncertaintyandrisks: Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over the past 20 years, considering the magnitude of historical projection errors, the current debt-related economic problems in China and some European countries, and economic and policy uncertainty at home. The risks to economic growth, inflation, and unemployment appear broadly balanced. On the downside, China is the primary source of risk to the foreign outlook. A downside risk emanating from the U.S. is the possibility that an overly expansive monetary policy could lead the unemployment rate to significantly undershoot its natural level, as periods of overheating have historically often ended with a recession. Upside risks to my forecast are related to the resilience of the U.S. economy and the possibility of a more expansionary fiscal policy stance.

Government policies: My assumption for fiscal policy has not changed since March. My forecast does not assume major changes in fiscal policy because any possible changes in taxes, government spending, or regulations remain highly uncertain. The likelihood of a more accommodative fiscal policy stance, while diminished since earlier this year, still poses upside risk for growth and inflation and downside risk for the unemployment rate. I did not assume any major changes in trade policy or immigration policy either, but view them as posing downside risk to my forecast. Considering the risks related to government policies in the context of the array of global and domestic risks to the outlook, I view uncertainty as broadly similar to the past 20 years and the risks around my outlook as broadly balanced. Given that my assumptions about government policies do not imply changes in the modal outlook or in my assessment of uncertainty and risks, they did not alter my projection for the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.

Respondent 11: Myoutlook consists of modestly above-trend growth over the next two years, supported by a moderate pace of consumption and investment spending.

Despite the recent soft readings, I see inflation converging to target next year.

I view the risks to my growth outlook as balanced. I have not incorporated any changes in either fiscal policy or other government policies into my baseline outlook. If there are eventual changes in fiscal policy, they are likely to be, on net, expansionary in the near-to-medium term. On the other hand, I am concerned about a scenario

similar  to  the  Tealbook's'broad  policy  disappointment,'that  would  have  a  sizeable  negative  impact  on  aggregate demand.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  balanced. The  unemployment  rate  is  below  my  assessment  of  its longer-run'normal'value.  Whilerecenthistorysuggeststhattheresponseofinflationtoresourceslackissomewhat muted,  it  may  be  more  pronounced  at  high  rates  of  resource  utilization.

On  the  other  hand,  after  a  number  of  years  with  below-target  inflation,  it  is  possible  that  inflation  expectations are  becoming  entrenched  at  a  level  lower  than  is  consistent  with  our  mandate.

Respondent 12: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy. In  our  conception,  there  a  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them. The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent,  and,  with  a  25  basis  point  increase,  can  be  viewed  as  optimal given  the  current  regime.  Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession.  If  the  economy  transitions to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may  be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  rate may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting  when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast that  we  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 13: My  central  economic  outlook  is  based  on  the  performance  of  the  economy  in  the  past  few years  and  my  attempt  to  foresee  future  policies  and  disturbances.

Respondent 14: The  continued  low  level  of  inflation,  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of  allowing  further  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  and  potential  risks  to  the  US  economy  from  international  policy  divergence  all  suggest a  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy.

I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 15: The  recovery  from  the  housing  collapse  and  the  financial  crisis  is  essentially  complete,  and incoming  data  indicate  that  the  economy  is  expanding  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  the  slow  pace  of  growth  in  potential output,  which  has  pushed  the  unemployment  rate  lower.  Going  forward,  the  strength  in  labor  market  hiring,  faster wage  growth,  and  gains  in  household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  climate  for  future fixed  business  investment  appears  to  have  improved  given  the  continued  expectation  of  higher  after-tax  corporate cash  flow,  lighter  regulatory  burdens,  and  improving  prospects  abroad.

Despite  substantial  uncertainty  about  the  anticipated  fiscal  stimulus,  its  expected  net  impact  on  economic growth  over  the  next  few  years  is  likely  to  be  a  small  positive. Similar  to  the  Tealbook,  I  continue  to  expect  some newmeasurestobeapprovedbytheendofthisyear, contributingtogrowthin2018and2019ofuptoa / percentage 1 4 point,  which  is  partly  o ffset  by  less  accommodative  monetary  policy.  Due  to  the  substantial  uncertainty  about  the composition  of  the  stimulus  it  is  premature  to  adjust  the  longer-run  outlook.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  a  bit  above  potential.  Output and  unemployment  gaps  were  closed  in  2016.  With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  place  and  renewed  fiscal stimulus,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for  the  next  few  years.  This  overshooting  should  lead  to  faster  inflation over  the  next  few  years.  I  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  the  last  quarter  of  2018,  and  to  overshoot slightly  in  2019. Tighter  monetary  policy  will  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  above  its  long-run  level  by  the  end  of 2018  and  in  2019  bringing  inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the following  year  or  two.

Respondent 16: Incoming  spending  and  labor  market  data  are  consistent  with  a  rebound  in  activity  after  a disappointingfirstquarter.  Theestimatedpaceofgrowthinthefirsthalfofthisyearnowstandsclosetothe2percent average  growth  rate  that  we  have  experienced  over  this  recovery.  Such  a  pace  of  growth,  while  not  particularly  fast by  historical  standards,  should  be  enough  to  continue  to  put  downward  pressure  on  the  unemployment  rate.  In  this regard,  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  we,  as  the  Tealbook,  project  a  pickup  in  the  pace  of  growth  in  the  second half  of  this  year,  to  about  3  percent. The  acceleration  is  at  least  in  part  predicated  on  conditioning  assumptions that  are  even  more  favorable  than  what  was  envisioned  at  the  time  of  the  March  SEP.  Households'  net  worth  is higher  than  anticipated,  and  despite  the  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate,  long-term  yields  are  now  lower  than  in

March.  These  developments,  coupled  with  ongoing  gains  in  employment  and  high  sentiment  readings,  should  be consistent  with  solid  gains  in  consumer  spending  in  the  near-term.

In  2018,  fiscal  policy  is  expected  to  provide  further  support  to  disposable  income  at  a  time  when  the  effect  on consumption  from  net  worth  appreciation  is  starting  to  wane. Uncertainty  surrounding  the  timing,  nature,  and size  of  the  Trump  Administration's  fiscal  policy  measures  remains.  For  comparison  purposes,  we  continue  to  work with  the  same  assumptions  as  in  the  Tealbook.  Overall,  the  upbeat  outlook  for  consumption  supports  a  forecast  for GDP  growth  above  potential  this  year  and  next.  The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  reach  a  low  of  4.0  percent by  the  end  of  2018. This  is  only  modestly  below  the  current  level  of  the  unemployment  rate,  and  there  is  the  risk that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  by  a  larger  amount  if  our  assessment  that  the  current  reading  overstates  the degree  of  labor  market  tightness  turns  out  to  be  wrong.

In 2019,  the  tightening  of  monetary  policy  brings  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  below  potential,  and  thus  the unemployment  rate  starts  to  rise.  The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  four  25  bp  increases  in  the  federal  funds rate  this  year,  six  in  2018,  and  four  in  2019.  Our  federal  funds  rate  assumption  is  coupled  with  a  contraction  in  the SOMA portfolio starting  early  in  the  second  half  of  this  year.  In  all,  the  projected  removal  of  policy  accommodation is now  less  gradual  than  in  previous  forecasts. We  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  remain  close  to  target  over  the forecast  period.

The  odds  of  a  fiscal  package  larger  than  what  we  are  envisioning  have  declined  somewhat. While  there  are risks  that  the  federal  government  fails  to  enact  a  fiscal  stimulus,  upbeat  household  and  business  sentiment  could signal  stronger  demand  than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning. Downside  risks  emanating  from  abroad  are  still present  but  recent  data  has  surprised  on  the  upside.  In  all,  we  assess  the  risks  around  our  GDP  growth  outlook  as roughly  balanced.  As  concerns  prices,  there  is  a  risk  of  a  nonlinear  response  of  inflation  associated  with  low  levels of  the  unemployment  rate. A  countervailing  risk  is  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  what we  are  currently  estimating.  From  a  policy  standpoint,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  despite  the  recent  increases  in the  federal  funds  rate,  long-term  yields  remain  very  low  by  historical  standards,  even  when  taking  into  account  a reduction  in  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest.  If  this  pattern  persists,  the  federal  funds  rate  may  need  to  increase by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  assuming.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: A  key  change  to  my  projection  this  round  is  a  reduction  in  my  assumption  about  the  longerrun  unemployment  rate,  to  4-1/2  percent. This  change  reflects  downward  surprises  to  both  inflation  and  the unemployment  rate. The  recent  disappointing  news  on  inflation  has  also  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for inflation  over  the  next  two  years.

I view  the  prospect  of  large  deficit-financed  tax  cuts  less  likely  than  in  March. My  outlook  for  GDP  growth is little  changed,  however,  as  my  interest-rate  forecast  is  slightly  lower  than  in  March,  and  the  global  economy  is somewhat  stronger.

Respondent 2: The  spending  and  production  indicators  since  our  March  submission  have  come  in  pretty much  in  line  with  expectations  and  therefore  we  made  only  small  changes  to  our  GDP  forecast  in  response  to  these data.  Given  the  lack  of  legislative  progress,  this  outlook  incorporates  slightly  less  fiscal  stimulus  in  2018  compared with  our  March  forecast.  The  unemployment  rate  came  down  more  than  we  had  anticipated  and  we  have  lowered our  unemployment  rate  forecast  in  response.  The  incoming  inflation  data  have  raised  concerns  that  core  inflation is not  on  the  gradual  path  to  target  as  we  projected  in  March. As  a  result,  we  lowered  our  inflation  projection  as noted  earlier.

Respondent 3: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  has  changed  little  since  March.  Because  price  and  wage  inflation have  remained  moderate  even  as  labor  markets  continue  to  tighten,  I  reduced  my  longer-run  estimate  of  the unemployment rate  and  the  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon.  Reflecting  the  recent  weaker readings  on  inflation,  my  inflation  forecast  in  2017-2018  is  slightly  lower  compared  to  March.  (I  note  that  in  March it  was  the  opposite:  the  inflation  data  had  been  a  bit  stronger  than  anticipated  and  my  inflation  forecast  for  2017 was  slightly  higher  compared  to  my  December  SEP.)

I have  not  made  changes  to  my  expectations  for  fiscal  policy  since  the  last  SEP  and  continue  to  await  further details  on  the  composition,  timing,  and  magnitude  of  any  package.  My  modal  forecast  is  not  dependent  on  a  sizable fiscal  policy  package. At  this  point,  my  fiscal  policy  assumptions  remain  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  and  I expect  that  expansionary  fiscal  policy  will  provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth  and  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon. I have  not  incorporated  changes  to  other  economic  policies  such  as  immigration  policy  and  trade  policy,  but  view these  as  risks  to  the  outlook  over  the  longer  run.

I view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as  appropriate  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to remain  below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  is  projected  to  gradually  move  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  next year  or  so. My  funds  rate  path  is  slightly  flatter  over  the  next  two  years  compared  to  my  March  projection.

Respondent 4: Even  though  our  real  GDP  growth  projections  are  largely  unchanged,  we  now  see  a  lower path  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  the  near  and  medium  term. This  change  reflects  our  current  assessment  of  the implications  of  recent  labor  market  dynamics  for  the  near- and  medium-term  outlook. As  we  have  marked  down our  assessment  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate,  we  project  a  touch  narrower  unemployment  gap  than  in  our  March submission.

The  overall  and  core  inflation  forecasts  for  2017  are  a  bit  lower  than  they  were  in  our  March  projections, reflecting  the  weak  Q1  data.  As  we  judge  this  weakness  temporary,  we  maintain  the  small  overshoot  of  the  inflation objective  in  the  medium  term  forecast  we  had  in  March.  This  overshoot  helps  to  ensure  that  inflation  expectations do  not  begin  to  fall  below  the  FOMC's  longer-run  inflation  objective  and  thus  helps  to  achieve  the  Federal  Reserve's mandated  objectives  over  the  longer  run.

Our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  unchanged,  with  a  mild  overshoot  of  the  longer-term  policy rate  meant  to  ensure  that  the  overshoot  of  inflation  and  undershoot  of  unemployment  are  temporary,  and  the longer-run  objectives  are  met  in  the  early  2020s. The  recent  easing  of  financial  conditions  leads  us  to  assume that  the  announcement  of  the  change  in  the  reinvestment  policy  will  occur  in  2017Q3,  somewhat  earlier  than  we assumed  in  March.

Respondent 5: I have  made  no  change  to  my  assumptions  for  government  policies.  I  have,  however,  lowered my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  two  tenths,  to  4-1/2  percent.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Incoming  data  on  the  labor  market  has  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for  the  unemployment rate.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: My baseline  projections  assume  a  somewhat  shallower  path  for  r*  than  in  March,  based  partly on  scaled  back  expectations  for  policy  actions  which  would  either  increase  labor  force  growth  and/or  increase  the rate  of  productivity  growth.

I have  modestly  lowered  my  2017  inflation  and  unemployment  forecasts  to  reflect  recent  lower-than-expected realizations,  without  significant  change  to  my  economic  forecasts  for  2018  and  beyond.

Respondent 10: I have  made  small  revisions  to  my  forecasts  of  real  GDP  growth,  headline  inflation,  and  core inflation  for  2017,  based  on  the  incoming  data.  I  also  revised  down  my  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate through  2019  to  reflect  recent  improvements  in  labor  market  data. Consistent  with  the  higher  rate  of  resource utilization  embedded  in  this  revised  unemployment  rate  path,  I  have  raised  slightly  my  view  of  the  appropriate level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  in  2019.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Recentdatahascausedustochangeourinflationprojectionsfor2017andourunemployment projections  for  2017,  2018,  and  2019.

Respondent 13: Recent  data  have  caused  me  to  change  my  forecasts,  particularly  of  unemployment  and  GDP growth.

Respondent 14: Near-term  core  inflation  has  come  in  lower  than  I  expected,  so  I  decreased  my  2017  forecast. The  labor  force  participation  rate  has  been  moving  sideways  over  the  past  year,  but  I  continue  to  expect  the  labor market  to  be  able  to  accommodate  healthy  employment  gains,  but  at  a  slightly  lower  rate. I have  lowered  my forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  as  well  as  my  estimate  of  its  long-run  level  given  the  declines  we  have  seen  in the  unemployment  rate  without  any  step-up  in  wage  growth.

I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 15: Since  March  I  have  become  less  confident  that  there  will  be  meaningful  fiscal  stimulus  or other  government  policy  initiatives  that  will  a ffect  the  economy.  However,  my  modal  projection  still  assumes  that fiscal  policy  will  not impact growth  in  this year  but  will  push  up  growth  by  up  to a  tenth  or  two in  each  of the next two years  after  factoring  in  some  o ffset  from  higher  interest  rates  and  a  stronger  dollar.  Even  without  additional  fiscal stimulus,  stronger  than  expected  equity  and  labor  markets  should  boost  consumption  and  investment  through  the remainder  of  the  year. Additionally,  the  dollar  has  declined,  reducing  the  drag  from  net  exports. Therefore,  my projection  for  growth  in  this  year  is  higher  compared  to  March.

My  inflation  projection  is  revised  down  a  bit  for  this  year  due  to  weaker  than  expected  data  in  the  second quarter.  I  expect  this  to  be  mostly  due  to  transitory  factors  with  only  a  small  impact  on  my  projections  for  inflation in  2018  and  none  in  2019.

Respondent 16: The  real  outlook  in  the  near  term  is  stronger  than  what  we  were  forecasting  in  March. Moreover,  the  unemployment  rate  has  declined  by  more  than  expected.  As  a  result,  our  outlook  now  entails  more policy  tightening  than  in  the  previous  forecast.  The  additional  policy  tightening,  both  in  the  form  of  a  higher  path for  the  federal  funds  rate  and  an  earlier  start  for  the  contraction  of  the  SOMA  portfolio,  is  necessary  to  keep  the unemployment  rate  from  falling  even  further.  By  the  end  of  2019,  the  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  similar  to

the  level  projected  in  March.  The  forecast  for  inflation  this  year  has  been  revised  down,  but  we  interpret  the  recent soft  readings  as  temporary.  As  a  result,  the  inflation  outlook  is  unchanged  in  2018  and  2019.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Our  Federal  Funds  rate  path  is  about  60  -  70  bps  below  the  Tealbook  in  2018  and  2019,  ending 2019  at  3  percent,  which  is  our  view  of  its  long-run  equilibrium  level. Our  boost  to  GDP  from  discretionary  fiscal policy  action  is  smaller  than  the  Tealbook.  Our  projection  for  GDP  growth  over  2017-2019  averages  the  same  as  the Tealbook.  However,  given  our  slightly  higher  assumption  for  potential  output  growth,  we  do  not  expect  output  to overshoot  potential  as  much  as  the  Tealbook.  In  terms  of  labor  market  slack,  our  projection  for  the  unemployment rate  averages  about  0.2  percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook;  in  addition,  we  assume  the  natural  rate  of unemployment  is  about  0.3  percentage  point  lower.  Accordingly,  our  4  percent  unemployment  rate  projection  for 2019:Q4  undershoots  the  natural  rate  by  less. Our  outlook  for  inflation  is  somewhat  more  pessimistic  than  the Tealbook's,  as  we  feel  that  even  with  our  more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy,  actual  inflation  will  not return  to  target  until  after  the  projection  period  in  2020.

Respondent 3: As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  labor  market conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  gradually  rise  to  our  2  percent  goal. The  labor  market dynamics  in  my  outlook  differ  from  those  in  Tealbook,  and  I  do  not  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  as  much  as in  the  Tealbook.  At  the  same  time,  I  see  slightly  greater  inflationary  pressures  than  in  the  Tealbook,  with  inflation expected  to  reach  2  percent  in  2018  compared  to  2019  in  the  Tealbook. On  balance,  my  funds  rate  path  over  the next  two  years  is  similar  to  that  in  the  Tealbook.  My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook, but  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around  these  assumptions.

Respondent 4: As  in  the  March  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and our  projections  for  the  key  SEP  variables. In  part,  these  differences  reflect  divergences  in  some  of  the  underlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts. In  particular,  the  Tealbook  forecast  incorporates  a  substantial  fiscal  stimulus in the  form  of  a  personal  income  tax  cut  that  commences  in  2018Q1. As  we  said  in  our  answer  to  4(a),  we  do not  attempt  to  incorporate  changes  in  fiscal  policy  in  our  modal  forecast  as  there  still  is  not  enough  information regarding  their  nature,  magnitude  and  timing.

The  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2017-8  than  in  our  outlook,  as  it  did  in  March.  Furthermore,  based  on its  assessment  of  potential  GDP  growth,  which  is  below  our  assumption  in  2017-19,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP leads  to  a  notably  positive  output  gap  in  2017-19.  Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output gap,  our  assessment  is  that  it  is  at  most  modestly  positive  at  that  time.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  two  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption.  The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2017  -  19  than  in  our  projection;  this  is  a  long-standing  difference between  the  two  forecasts,  which  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  Tealbook  fiscal  policy  assumption  that  helps  to  boost the  Tealbook  projection  of  consumption  growth  in  2018.  Another  effect  of  the  Tealbook  fiscal  policy  assumption is  a  higher  projected  saving  rate  that  is  appreciably  above  our  projection  in  2018.

Another  notable  difference  between  the  projections  is  the  underlying  assumptions  on  the  longer-run  natural rate  of  unemployment,  which  the  Tealbook  has  at  4.9  percent,  while  we  notched  it  down  to  4.6  percent.  Combined with  our  growth  projections,  we  anticipate  that  unemployment  will  modestly  undershoot  its  natural  rate  over  the projection  period;  in  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects  the  unemployment  to  significantly  undershoot  the  longer-run natural  rate.  This  pattern  is  a  counterpart  of  the  sizable  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: in  our projection  the  participation  rate  picks  up  gradually  from  its  current  level  to  reach  63.1  percent  by  2018, while  in  the Tealbook  it  declines  to  62.5  percent  at  end-2018.  This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical effects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  differ  notably  on  the  dynamics  over  the  projection  period.  We  see  inflation  rising modestly  above  2  percent  in  2018  -  19  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade,  whereas  the  Tealbook projects  core  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  only  in  2019,  despite  a  sizable  undershooting  of  unemployment. The

considerable persistence of inflation and the flat Phillips curve within the Tealbook framework appear to require a prolonged period of above-potential growth in order to induce inflation to rise toward the longer-run inflation goal. Asmentioned previously, the overshoot of inflation in our projection occurs to prevent inflation expectations from falling below levels consistent with the FOMC's longer-run objective.

In terms of the uncertainty and risk assessment, both projections see uncertainty at near normal levels and risks broadly balanced.

Finally, our monetary policy path is below the Tealbook path for 2017-19. In addition, our assumption for the longer-run normal policy rate is 25bps below that of the Tealbook, as we take a somewhat stronger signal from the still-low sovereign yields and potential growth rate estimates across the advanced economies. Both policy paths have a mild overshooting of the longer-run FFR in 2019.

Respondent 5: Relative to my outlook, the Tealbook implicitly incorporates a much higher level of the neutral funds rate over the medium term (some of which reflects greater fiscal stimulus), a higher estimate of the natural rate, and a lower estimate of long-run inflation expectations. The latter two assumptions imply that the unemployment rate needs to more markedly undershoot its longer-run level in order for inflation to move back up to the 2 percent objective.

Respondent 6: MyforecasthasslightlylessrealgrowthandslightlyhigherunemploymentthantheTealbook. As a result, my path for the federal funds rate is slightly lower.

Respondent 7: I have not included a fiscal stimulus package in my forecast due to uncertainties about timing and magnitude. My path for appropriate monetary policy remains more accommodative than the Tealbook over the forecast horizon.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I am projecting somewhat weaker GDP growth this year and next than does the Tealbook, andsignificantly less overshoot of the longer-run rate of unemployment. The weaker growth and smaller overshoot occurdespiteamore-gradualriseinthefederalfundsratetoalowerlong-runlevel. Implicitly, Iseeashallowerpath for r* than does the Tealbook. Despite a higher unemployment path, I anticipate a slightly more rapid return to our 2-percent inflation objective than is forecasted by Board staff. In my view, the longer-term inflation expectations relevant to wage and price setting remain anchored at 2 percent, and inflation remains fairly responsive, albeit with a lag, to labor-market slack.

My views on prospective fiscal and other non-monetary government policies are outlined in my responses to 2(a) and 3(b), above.

Respondent 10: Unlike Tealbook, my forecast does not incorporate a change in the stance of fiscal policy. Consistently, my projection for real GDP growth in 2018 is lower and my projected path for the unemployment rate is flatter than in Tealbook.

Respondent 11: Despite some differences in assumptions, my growth forecast is similar to the Tealbook through 2019. I have not taken onboard any changes to government policies. My projection has a higher long-run growth trend owing to a somewhat stronger productivity assumption. The trajectory of my unemployment rate forecast is above the Tealbook's due to a somewhat lower projection for employment growth.

Respondent 12: For GDP growth and inflation, our projections are quite similar to those in the Tealbook. Differences arise because the Tealbook projections incorporate the idea of a longer-run steady state to which the economy is converging. Monetary policy has to be set appropriately as the economy transitions to the longer-run steady state. This tends to imply an upward-sloping policy rate path. The regime conception we use, in contrast, views monetary policy as regime-dependent and the current regime is viewed as persistent. It is acknowledged that the economy may visit other regimes in the future, but switches to those regimes are quite difficult to forecast. This suggests a flat path for the policy rate over the forecast horizon relative to that contained in the Tealbook. The Tealbook forecast also has a substantial undershooting of the unemployment rate before returning to its long-run value.

Respondent 13: I believe,  though  lack  total  conviction,  that  there  will  be  a  reasonable  (1  percent  of  GDP) fiscal  impetus  in  2018.

Respondent 14: My forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  except  that I believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  keep  the  labor force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job  growth  on  the  unemployment rate. This  would  lead  to  less  upward  movement  for  wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the  path assumedintheTealbook.  Removingmonetaryaccommodationmoregradually,asinmyprojection,wouldproduce a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the  Tealbook.

I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 15: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the unemployment rate declining  to  3.8  percent at the  end  of  2019,  and with inflation  returning  to  the  2  percent target  only  very  gradually. In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output through  2019,  and  those  gaps  close  in  the  following  year  or  two.  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  4.1 percent  by  the  second  quarter  of  next  year.

The  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  effects  of  expected  fiscal  stimulus  are  fairly  front-loaded  in  2018  with  some smaller  impact  to  growth  in  2019.  Additionally,  the  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  permanent  changes  to  fiscal  policy lead  to  an  increase  of  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate. In  my  projections  I  assume  that  the  expected  fiscal policy  stimulus  is  also  somewhat  concentrated  in  2018  with  a  smaller  contribution  to  growth  in  2019,  but  I  do  not expect  fiscal  policy  to  lead  to  a  change  to  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate.

The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows growth  to  below  potential  in  2019. This  pushes  up  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.4  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. Finally,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  the  end  of  2018  and results  in  a  slight  overshooting  of  inflation  for  some  time  afterwards.  Tighter  monetary  policy  brings  inflation  back to  target  and  unemployment  back  to  its  long-run  sustainable  level  in  2020.

Respondent 16: The  main  difference  with  the  Tealbook  forecast  stems  from  different  monetary  policy  assumptions.  Our  unemployment  rate  outlook  would  be  closer  to  the  Tealbook  if  we  had  adopted  the  same  monetary policy  assumptions  as  in  the  Tealbook.  However,  the  Tealbook  outlook  for  the  unemployment  rate  implies  a  sizable overshooting  of  full  employment. Such  an  overshooting  substantially  raises  the  odds  of  a  recession  as  monetary policy  tries  to  bring  the  unemployment  back  up  to  a  level  consistent  with  full  employment. We  thus  have  opted for  a  tighter  path  of  monetary  policy,  which  we  deem  is  more  appropriate  to  achieve  stabilization  of  activity  and inflation  over  time.
