Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates of change  in, respectively, the price index for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the rate  to which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  March  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  17-18,  2015.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In March 2015, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015 and 2016 were, respectively, 15 and 2. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  its  longer  run  growth  and  inflation targets  by  the  end  of  2017.

Respondent 2: All measures  converge  in  less  than  5-6  years. GDP  growth  will  converge  in  2017, while  the  unemployment  and  inflation  measures  will  converge  in  2018. Prior  to  convergence,  I  expect the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  further  below  its  long-run  value  of  5.8%  and  the  inflation  measures to overshoot  2%.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  takes  less than  5  years. Specifically,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  reach  its  longer-run  rate  by  2017  and  inflation to rise to close to 2 percent  in  2016. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  will  hit  its  longer-run  level  by the  end  of  2015,  and  fall  below  it  in  2016  and  in  2017  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: It will be shorter  under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  in  part  because  the  FOMC will take appropriate  steps  to help return  the underlying  rate  of inflation to 2%. My  assessment  of appropriate  monetary  policy  puts  little  weight  on  interest  rate  smoothing.

Respondent 7: Convergence  to  the  mandated  goals  is  expected  to  occur  over  the  2017-18  period.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: I expect  the unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  sustainable  rate  by the end  of 2015,  and  then  to  fall past  that  level. Convergence  to  the  natural  rate  from  below  is  unlikely to be  achieved  until  the  end  of  2018. To  avoid  setting  the  stage  for  a  new  recession,  it  is  essential  that any  substantial  overshoot  of  the  natural  rate  be  avoided. I expect  trimmed-mean  inflation  to  reach  2 percent  in  2016,  and  to  rise  past  2  percent  in  2017. Inflation  is  unlikely  to  return  to  target  until  2019.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: No  comment.

Respondent 17: We  continue  to  assume  that  the  economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  within  a  range around  2%  and  maintain  a  point  estimate  of  2%. We  currently  assess  that  a  reasonable  range  for  the longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%,  and  we  have  maintained  our  point  estimate  of  5%. We plan  to conduct  our  usual  reassessment  of  these  assumptions  after  the  annual  revisions  of  GDP  and productivity  are  released  in  late  July  and  August.

We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  level  in  2016Q3,  and  for  it  to  fall  slightly below  that  level  at the end  of 2016,  which  would  be  consistent  with  the  implications  of  some  of  our scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  (2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI,  based  on the  longer-term  average  of  the  diff erence  between  CPI  and  PCE  inflation). Under  these  conditions  and with  the  resource  gap  anticipated  to  dissipate  over  the  forecast  horizon  (the  unemployment  gap  may not  provide  an  accurate  measure  of  the  resource  gap  at  this  time),  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2017  and  thereafter.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  in  2017.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: It remains  the  case  that  the  extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place  and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3:

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Inflation expectations  have  probably  become  more  firmly  anchored  as  a  result  of the  FOMC's  consensus  statements,  and  uncertaintly  is  accordingly  lower  than  before  January  2012.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is  similar  to  its  average  level over  the  past  20  years,  which,  of  course,  is  a  period  that  was  characterized  by  considerable  variability. Inflation remains  anchored  by quite stable longer-run inflation expectations at the FOMC's  stated goal  of  2 percent. Inflation  expectations  have  now  been  well  anchored  for  about  20  years,  so  I  see  the magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation outlook  as consistent with that over the past 20 years.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Because  of  the  difficulty  disentangling  persistent  headwinds  from  structural  changes in the  economy,  GDP  growth  over  the  medium  term  is  somewhat  more  uncertain  than  is  typically  the case.

Also,  the  recent  swings  in  oil  prices  and  the  still  uncertain  response  of  oil  demand  and  oil  supply to last year's sharp drop in prices imply  a higher-than-usual  amount  of  uncertainty  around  energy prices  and  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Oil price futures have remained particularly volatile, raising the uncertainty around my headline PCE  projection above its 20 year average. I also judge the uncertainty surrounding  my  core  PCE  inflation  projection  as  'higher.' This  is due  to recent disparate  readings  on underlying  PCE  inflation  coming  from  various  measures,  and  uncertainty  regarding  how  inflation  expectations  are  reacting  to  a  prolonged  period  of  below-target  core  inflation  readings,  especially  in  light of inflation  compensation  measures  that  remain 1 2 / percentage  point  below  year  ago  levels.

Respondent 17: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. The  width  of  these  intervals  have  narrowed  modestly  since  the  March SEP,  as  we  interpret  the  recent  developments  as  indicating  less  probability  of  either  a  sharp  increase in real  growth  or  a  significant  and  protracted  slowdown. Nevertheless,  the  probability  intervals  for  the real  activity  forecasts  are  still  somewhat  wider  than  the  SEP  standard,  particularly  in  2016  and  2017, in part because  of the still-extraordinary economic  and  financial environment,  including  the policy rate  in  most  advanced  economies  remaining  constrained  by  its  eff ective  lower  bound. The  further  net impact  on  real  activity  of  the  dollar  appreciation  during  the  second  half  of  2014  and  early  2015  is  not yet clear, contributing  to the uncertainty. In contrast, the forecast intervals for core PCE  inflation appear  broadly  consistent  with the SEP  standard,  taking  rough  account  of  the diff erences between forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: I view  the  risks to inflation as weighted  to  the  upside  over  the  medium  term  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 6: Because of the zero lower bound, and the perceived costs associated with asset purchases,  it  is hard  for  the  FOMC  to  respond  eff ectively  to  low  inflation  and  low  growth  outcomes. This  means  that  these  outcomes  are  more  likely  to  occur.

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9: The risks to my  projections are broadly balanced. Weakness  abroad  remains  a downside  risk,  but  less  so  than  in  April. Further  weakening  in  the  economies  of  key  trading  partners may have a larger eff ect on U.S. export growth than I am forecasting. Central banks in foreign economies  have  been  adding  accommodation,  which  is  helping  to  stimulate  global  demand.

Oil prices have stabilized at a low level, which  should  be  a net positive for spending. The  U.S. labor market is showing solid gains and measures  of labor compensation  are strengthening, which will support  household  spending. The  combination  of  these  factors  alongside  highly  accommodative monetary  policy  raises  the  possibility  that  the  U.S.  economy  may  be  poised  for  faster  growth  than  I am  currently  projecting.

Inflation risks are balanced. Second-quarter  inflation  rates  have  moved  up  from  their  very  weak first-quarter readings, as oil prices have stabilized and transitory factors weighing  on core inflation have waned. Survey-based  measures  of inflation expectations have been relatively stable; inflation compensation  measures  based  on  asset  prices  have  stabilized  but  I've been  taking  less signal about inflation  expectations  from  changes  in  these  measures  because  the  changes  might  be  reflecting  liquidity eff ects. A broad-based  downward  drift  in  inflation expectations  would  pose  a downside  risk to my inflation projection. On  the other hand,  too slow a withdrawal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation has  the  potential  to  create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium  run.

ffer Respondent 10: I see the risks to GDP  growth  as  somewhat  weighted  to  the  downside  for two reasons. First,  the  lower  bound  on  the  nominal  funds  rate  constrains  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to bu negative,  but  not  positive,  shocks  to  the  economy,  thereby  skewing  the  distribution  of  possible outcomes  for  real  activity. Second,  I  see  a  greater-than-even  chance  that  productivity  growth  will  be

slower to pick up than  I anticipate. For the unemployment  rate,  however,  these  two  factors  largely off set one  another,  leaving  my  assessment  of  the  risks  to  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

As  for inflation, I continue  to  see  the  risks to my  forecast  as  weighted  to  the  downside,  although perhaps a bit less so than in March. I am now more confident than before that the influence of past energy  price  declines  and  dollar  appreciation  will  prove  to  be transitory  and  that  inflation  will return  to  an  underlying  trend  of  about  1-1/2  percent  by  early  2016. But  I  still  see  a  greater-than-even chance  that  inflation  may  not  move  back  to  2  percent  as  quickly  as  I project. In particular, even  if my  projection  for  the  labor  market  comes  to  pass,  I  worry  that  the  response  of  inflation  will  be  less than  I  anticipate  because  my  baseline  forecast  anticipates  that  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve  will  not be  quite  as  low  as  it  has  been  in  recent  years. Moreover,  I  see  a  greater  risk  that  the  true  natural  rate of unemployment  may  be  below  5  percent  than  above,  although  the  recent  tentative  signs  of  a  pickup in wage  inflation  have  diminished  my  concerns  on  this  score  somewhat.

Respondent 11: Risks to economic  activity  appear  balanced. Recent  data  point  to slower GDP growth  in the first half of this year, but much  of that reported  softness likely is due to temporary factors such as adverse weather and residual seasonality. Overall, most indicators suggest steady improvements  in  economic  conditions  going  forward. Most  of the remaining  headwinds  continue  to abate.

The  zero  lower  bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no  longer  appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light  of the apparent  eff ectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs. Moreover,  normalization  of  monetary  policy  means  that  the zero  lower  bound  will  be  less  relevant  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced. The  recent  low  readings  on  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  raise the  possibility  that  inflation  could  remain  below  target  for  some  time. On  the  other  side,  the  steady diminution  of labor market  slack increases the odds of building wage pressures feeding through  to more  inflation  in  the  near-term.

Respondent 12: We  think  the  risks  to  our  GDP  and  unemployment  rate  forecasts  are  roughly  in balance. On  the  downside,  we've  been  surprised  by  the  lackluster  gains  in  consumption  and  investment, and  we  cannot  dismiss  the  possibility  that risk-aversion  may  be  a more  powerful  and  longer-lasting headwind  on  household  and  business  spending  than  we have assumed. On  the upside, we still see some  chance  that  positive  household  sector  fundamentals  (gains  in  wealth,  the  better  job  market,  and low  energy  prices)  and  ample  business  access  to  credit  could  lead  to  stronger-than-expected  growth. In addition, we see some  possibility that demographic  trends  will  lead  to greater trend labor input and  a  lower  natural  rate  of  unemployment  than  we  have  assumed.

The  flattening  in  the  dollar,  slight  increase  in  oil  prices,  and  the  signs  of  a  pickup  in  wage  growth have  reduced  the  downside  risks  to the inflation outlook, but not by enough  to  move  the  risks into balance. Importantly, our forecast of inflation rising to 1-3/4 percent by the end of the projection period depends heavily on an upward pull from inflation expectations supported by the FOMC's credible  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target. We  have  yet  to  see  evidence  of  these factors  taking  hold  in  the  pricing  plans  of  our  business  contacts,  let  alone  in  the  actual  inflation  data. Accordingly,  we  still  see  the  balance  of  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast  as  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Over  the  medium  term,  I  expect  the  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation  on  inflation  to wane,  and  wage  pressures  to  increase  as  resource  utilization  rise. But  there  are  risks  that  these  factors continue  to  weigh  on  prices  longer  than  I  expect,  and  the  that  dollar  strengthens  further. In this low inflation  environment,  inflation  expectations  may  start  to  decline.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: No  comments.

Respondent 17: Quantitative judgment based on the diff erence between the central projection and  the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance, the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced, as has been the case in recent SEPs: even though  market-based  inflation  compensation  has  risen  some  since  the  March  SEP,  its  level  is  still  low, indicating  little change  in the balance  of inflation risks over the past few months. The  risks to the real  activity  outlook  also  are  roughly  balanced  over  our  forecast  horizon. The  broad  balance  continues to reflect  two  opposing  hypotheses  that  could  explain  the  contrasting  tone  of  data  of  the  past  several months-relatively  strong  labor  market  data  and  relatively  weak  expenditure  data. One  hypothesis  is that the sluggish growth  through  much  of  this  expansion  has  come  from  more  persistent  structural factors  rather  than  from  various  headwinds  that  are  expected  to  abate  in  our  central  forecast,  which is consistent  with  the  weaker  expenditure  data. The  other  hypothesis  is  that  the  economy  has  greater underlying  strength  than  anticipated  in our projection, which  is consistent with the stronger labor market  data. Beyond  those  hypotheses,  other  risks  include  the  impacts  of  the  recent  oil  price  decline and  dollar  appreciation  on  U.S.  activity  and  inflation;  the  continued  weakness  in  a  number  of  emerging market  economies,  most  prominently  China,  which  could  leave  the  U.S.  and  world  economies  more susceptible  to  negative  shocks;  and  the  constraints  that  monetary  policy  faces  under  the  eff ective  lower bound  in  a  number  of  major  economies.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: My  appropriate  path  for  policy  has  the  Commitee  starting  to  raise  the  funds  rate in 2015Q3  as  the  economy  continues  to  strengthen  and  inflation  moves  toward  target. My  path  for the funds  rate  is within  the  range  of  prescriptions  given  by  the  monetary  policy  rules  enumerated  in the Tealbook  and  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  reach  its  long-run level of 3.75  percent  in  early  2018.

Respondent 2: According  to  the  empirical  model  supporting  my  forecast,  lift-off  should  have  already  occurred. Such  an  action  would  have  reduced  the  extent  of  the  undershooting  of  unemployment and  the  overshooting  of  inflation.

Respondent 3: I have  lowered  my  growth  forecast  for  this  year  so  I  lowered  my  appropriate  policy path  as  well.

Respondent 4: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on promoting sustainable long-run economic growth and price stability. My  forecast calls for the unemployment  rate  to  be  near  its longer-run  level and inflation close to two percent  in early 2016. Given uncertainty about how the economy  will respond to the removal of accommodation  after a prolonged  period  of  near-zero  interest  rates,  I  believe  increases  in  the  funds  rate  should  be  gradual  to see how  the  economy  responds. Adjustments  should  be  data-dependent,  but  the  gradual  approach  to normalizing  policy  results  in  a  funds  rate  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2016  and  2017.

Respondent 5: After  the  roller  coaster  of  data  generated  during  the  spring,  we  are  left  with  expected economic performace for the next ten quarters that is little changed from March  projections, but without the grwoth that had been anticipated for 2015 Q1. Thus, while it does not at this time appear  that  Q1  reflected a significant slowdown  in  underlying  growth  momentum,  the  performance of the economy  will  very  likely  be  worse  than  expected  in  the  March  projections. Thus  there  seems little reason to move  up  my  projected  date for the first federal funds rate increase. Moreover,  tha apparent  absence  of  a  substantial  bounceback  from  the  poor  Q1  makes  it  reasonable  to  await  more confirmation that there hasn't been a slowing even more significant. I anticipate a fairly gradual increase in the federal funds rate, as growth continues to run only modestly to moderately  above potential and  inflation only gradually  returns  to the Committee's  stated  target. Also, I have  again

marked  down  my  projection  of  the  longer  run  target  federal  funds  rate,  which  has  also  prompted  me to make  the  path  from  zero  to  fully  normalized  still  less  steep.

Respondent 6: The  data  suggest  that  there  has  been  a  sharp  fall  in  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest since 2007. We  remain below maximum  employment  and  below  target  inflation, even though the market real rate of interest (over any horizon) is much  lower than in 2007. This means  that the neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  consistent  with  target  inflation  and  maximum  employment  -  has  fallen by  even  more.

There  are  many  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  but  the  main  point  is that  the  change  is  likely  to unwind  over  time  -  but  only  slowly  and  only  partially. This  judgment  is borne  out  by  the  real  yield  curve,  which  is  upward  sloping  (roughly  10  basis  points  over  the  next  five years,  and  rising  to  over1.5%  from  2025  to  2035). Note  that  this  real  yield  curve  is  roughly  consistent with  inflation  break-evens  of  around  2%,  which  suggests  tha  these  market  interest  rates  are  reflective too  of what's  happening  with  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest.

Put  another  way: I see the intercept  term  in  the  Taylor  rule  as  being  a  stochastic  process  with  a lot of persistence. That  intercept  is  very  low  and  is  likely  to  return  to  its  long-run  value  only  slowly. I have  also  taken  on  board  the  staff 's  downward  revision  of  the  underlying  rate  of  inflation,  as  well as the  staff '  view  that  overshooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  natural  rate  will  be  helpful  to bring  inflation  back  to 2 percent. Given  the  low  inflation  outlook,  I  believe  it would  be  appropriate to reinstate  some  kind  of  asset  purchase  pogram.

I have increased my  estimate  of the longer-run  normal  value of the federal funds rate since the previous  SEP  because  longer-term  nominal  market  interest  rates  have  come  back  up  in  the  last  quarter.

Respondent 7: The  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  features  a  gradual  removal  of  policy accommodation,  so  that  policy  can  probe  for  the  possibility  of  lower  equilibrium  levels  of  the  unemployment  rate  and/or  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest. If our  current  estimates  for  the  longer  run levels of the  unemployment  rate  and  the  real  interest  rate  turn  out  to  be  correct,  the  projected  path for  the  federal  funds  rate  will  generate  a  level  of  activity  modestly  above  full  employment  and  inflation slightly above  target  over the period  2018-19. In other words,  we  judge  the costs of probing  in the current  environment  to  be  small.

Respondent 8: The  decline in core and headline inflation that we saw late last year has clearly come  to an end, and recent readings have boosted  confidence  that inflation is headed  back  toward our  2 percent  objective. Moreover,  labor  market  underutilization  is  statistically  insignificant,  and  so the conditions  the  Committee  spelled  out  at  the  beginning  of  the  year  have  been  met. In addition, consumer  spending  has  shown  sustained  strength  since  the middle  of last year, despite a couple of soft months  this  past  winter. The  tightening  of  labor  market  conditions  is  likely  to  bolster  household spending  growth  going  forward. Such  conditions  warrant  raising  real  interest  rates.

Respondent 9: I continue to see underlying strength in the economy  and labor markets. The weakness  in  the  first  quarter  data  appears  to  have  been  primarily  caused  by  a  number  of  temporary factors, and  the  incoming  monthly  data  give  me  confidence  that  some  rebound  is  already  underway. The  labor  market  has  already  made  considerable,  sustained  progress  toward  our  goal  of  full  employment,  and  I  expect  further  gains  to  be  made. The  unemployment  rate  has  reached  my  point  estimate of its longer-run  level. Measures  of  underemployment  have  been  steadily  declining  as  well,  and  recent signs  of  firming  in  labor  compensation  lend  further  support  to  the  view  that  labor  underutilization  is shrinking. Inflation expectations  are  stable,  oil prices have  stabilized, and  appreciation  in  the  value of the  dollar  has  slowed. Based  on  these  factors  and  my  forecast  for  above-trend  growth,  I  anticipate that inflation will move  higher  over time. I continue  to project a gradual  rise in inflation over the forecast  horizon  to  the  Committee's  2  percent  longer-run  goal  by  late  2016  or  early  2017.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should  reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. With  the  economy at or close  to  full  employment  and  projected  inflation  between  one  and  two  years  ahead  already  equal to  the  Committee's  goal  of  2  percent,  an  economic  case  can  be  made  for  raising  the  funds  rate  in  June. But  given  our  past  communications,  I  believe  the  public  is  unprepared  for  such  a  rate  hike. Thus,  my policy  path  has  the  FOMC  beginning  to  raise  the  fed  funds  rate  in  2015Q3,  with  the  funds  rate  rising gradually  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 10: Several factors influence my judgement regarding the appropriate path of the federal  funds  rate,  which  I  anticipate  will  need  to  rise  only  gradually  over  the  next  few  years  given  my modal  outlook. First, I judge  that  an  appreciable  amount  of  slack  remains  in  the  labor  market,  and more  than  the  unemployment  gap  by  itself  would  suggest. Second,  the  underlying  trend  in  inflation currently  appears  to  be  no  higher  than  1-1/2  percent,  and  I  believe  that  bringing  inflation  back  to  2 percent  over  the  next  few  years  will  require  policy  to  remain  sufficiently  accommodative  to  generate  a noticeable  further  tightening  in  labor  market  conditions,  to  the  point  of  allowing  the  unemployment rate  to  fall  below  its  natural  rate  for  a  time. Third,  the  headwinds  which  have  restrained  the  expansion to date  have  not  yet  completely  faded  and  will  likely  take  several  more  years  to  completely  disappear; alternatively put, the equilbrium  real funds rate currently appears  to be near zero and I expect it to converge  only  gradually  to  its  (low)  longer-run  value  of  1-1/4  percent. Fourth,  uncertainty  about the true value of the equilibrium  real rate argues for taking a cautious approach  to  policy firming, particularly  initially,  until  we  are  more  certain  about  the  economy's  ability  to  continue  to  expand  at a moderate  pace  in  the  face  of  rising  interest  rates. Similarly,  I believe  that  it will be appropriate  to proceed  cautiously  in  firming  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  until  the  risks  associated  with  a  return  to the  zero  lower  bound  fade.

Respondent 11: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  continue  to  decline. I expect  these  gaps  to  close by  the  end  of  this  year. In  addition,  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  below  our  2  percent  objective  until  the end  of 2016. This  situation  continues  to  call  for very  accommodative  monetary  policy. Appropriate policy in this case is to delay liftoff from the zero lower bound  until the second half of 2015. My judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following  liftoff ,  my  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules would  suggest. In my  projection,  the  reasons  include  the  following:

- · Although  the  unemployment  rate  reaches  its  long-run  natural  rate  in  the  second  half  of  2015, broader  measures  of  slack  (including  the  share  of  long-term  unemployment)  take  a  bit  longer  to return  to  normal,  reflecting  the  dynamics  of  the  labor  market.
- · Some  headwinds  remain  in  2016,  such  as  constraints  on  credit  availability  for some  borrowers and  foreign  economic  activity. These  continue  to  reduce  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  relative to its long-run  value.
- · In an environment  in  which  short-term  rates  have  been  near  zero  for  almost  seven  years,  there are potential benefits to having an earlier liftoff followed by a more gradual rate path than might  normally  be  called  for. These  benefits  include  managing  expectations  and  minimizing  the potential  for  disruptions  to  global  financial  markets.

Respondent 12: We  continue  to believe that under appropriate  policy, liftoff should be delayed until growth is clearly on a more sustained footing, an array of labor market measures are closer to their long-run norms, and core inflation has clearly begun to move sustainably higher. In our projection,  it  will  take  until  mid-2016  for  all  three  of  these  conditions  to  be  met. In  particular,  at  that time  our  two-year-ahead  inflation  forecast  will  just  be  reaching  2  percent. After  liftoff , we  believe  it

will be appropriate  for the path  of rate increases to be quite shallow, at least initially. This would give the Committee  time  to assess the economy's  performance  under  less accommodative  financial conditions  and  to  observe  whether  inflation  is  indeed  moving  up  to  target. Furthermore,  we  believe that a mid-2016  lift off date and  a shallow  path  for rate increases is appropriate  policy  from  a  risk management  perspective, as we view the costs of a retreat back to the zero lower bound  as much greater than  those  of inflation running  modestly  above  2  percent  for  a  couple  of years if demand  is unexpectedly  strong. Indeed,  given  the  normal  inertia  in  the  inflation  process,  our  rate  assumptions could  result  in  inflation  modestly  overshooting  2  percent  beyond  the  projection  horizon. We  see  this as a feature  of an optimal  policy  aimed  at  achieving  a  symmetric  inflation  target. Finally, our path for  appropriate  policy  also  is  influenced  by  our  view  that  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  currently  is quite  low  and,  though  moving  up  over  time,  it  will  still  be  well  below  our  assumption  for  the  long-run neutral  rate  at  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 13: The  amount  of accommodation  provided  by  a  given  short-term  interest rate is heavily  influenced  by  broader  financial  conditions,  which  can  be  approximated  using  a  long-term  forward  rate  and  growth  in  household  net  worth. Accommodation  measured  in  this  way  is  a  powerful predictor  of  changes  in  the  unemployment  rate,  and  a  policy  rule  that  has  the  FOMC  adjust  accommodation  in  response  to  current  slack  and  inflation  does  a  good  job  of  explaining  historical  funds-rate movements  without  resort  to  ad hoc inertia. Policy was exceptionally  accommodative  in  late  2013 and into 2014, but a deterioration in the economic  outlook abroad and increased geo-political uncertainty  have  subsequently  reduced  accommodation,  without  overt  FOMC  action. Nevertheless,  the Committee's  current  policy stance is more  accommodative  than  is  warranted. At least, it is more accommodative  than  is  consistent  with  the  FOMC's  past  behavior.

Is a tilt toward accommodation  appropriate  given the proximity of the zero bound? I do not see the risks associated  with  too-much  and  too-little  accommodation  as  asymmetric  at  this  stage  of the business  cycle: Too  much  accommodation  or  accommodation  maintained  for  too  long  is  just  as risky  as  too  little  accommodation  once  you  reach  the  point  where  full-employment  overshoot  is  a  real possibility. You'll  note  the  focus  on  full-employment  overshoot,  not  inflation  overshoot. The  concern  is that  business  investment  decisions,  consumer  durables  purchases,  and  borrowing  commitments  made in an artificially favorable  financial  environment  can't  be  easily  reversed  or  unwound  when  financial conditions  eventually  begin  to  normalize. It is difficult  to  achieve  smooth  convergence  in  an  economy with  capital  and  debt  overhangs,  and  the  longer  artificially  favorable  financial  conditions  persist,  the greater these overhangs are likely to become. The damage  to the economy  from  overshooting  full employment  is  cumulative,  and  as  it  accumulates  the  threat  to  macroeconomic  stability  mounts.

Dallas Fed research has confirmed  that the wage  Phillips curve is nonlinear. That  nonlinearity suggests  that  as  the  unemployment  rate  is  pushed  downward,  eventually  wage  growth  will  rise  relative to  price  inflation  by  an  amount  that  exceeds  trend  productivity  growth,  eroding  profit  margins. Falling profit margins  must  have  consequences  for  business  investment  and  for equity prices. The  point is that  if Federal  Reserve  policymakers  focus  solely  on  the  inflation  consequences  of  their  actions,  they may  miss  other  important  parts  of  the  picture.

There  is  a price  to be paid  for running  the  economy  hot,  and  it  is  not  just  the  risk  of  a  period  of above-target  inflation. Even  (especially?) if inflation does  not pick up, imbalances  are  created  that are  (1) unsustainable  and  (2)  dangerous,  if  allowed  to  build.

In projecting  a  path  for  the  funds  rate, I assume  that  headwinds  from  weak  growth  prospects  in the  foreign  advanced  economies  and  from  geo-political  uncertainty  lift  only  gradually,  and  it  is  for  that reason  that the funds  rate I project for 2016  falls short of its longer-run  normal  level, even though by  then  I expect  we  will  have  achieved  full  employment  and  price  stability. It may  very  well  be  that headwinds  ease  more  quickly  than  I  expect,  in  which  case  a  steeper  policy  path  will  be  appropriate.

Respondent 14: Although  we  have  seen  continued  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  the  aftereff ects of the crisis continue to restrain housing, and perhaps  consumer  spending. At the same  time, the significant  appreciation  of  the  currency  has  held  down  net  exports  and  core  inflation  through  import prices. These  eff ects  are  likely to fade  only  slowly. As  a result, monetary  policy  may  need  to  remain accommodative  for  longer  to  move  employment  and  inflation,  in  particular,  back  to  target  levels.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: My  outlook  has  liftoff for the federal funds  rate in September  2015  (to  a  range of 25-50 basis points), followed by 25 basis point increases at every other meeting through 2016. The  trajectory  steepens  to  25  basis  point  increases  at  every  meeting  in  2017,  nearing  its  appropriate long-run  value  by  the  end  of  the  year.

Respondent 17: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communicate clearly to the public  that  these  factors  will dictate  the  path  of the policy  stance. The  developments along  these  dimensions  since  the  March  SEP  were  such  that  there  is  no  change  to  our  assessment  of the  appropriate  path  for  the  FFR  in  this  submission.

Based  on  our  modal  outlook  and  assuming  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored, we  anticipate  that  the  target  range  for  the  FFR  will  remain  at  its  current  level  until  September  2015. Nevertheless, it is important to communicate  to the public that the decision about the timing of liftoff is dependent  upon  the  data  and  the  FOMC's  assessment  of  the  outlook  and  risks  rather  than  a particular  calendar  date.

However,  a  more  important  factor  in  determining  the  stance  of  policy  as  we  approach  normalization will  be  the  pace  of  rate  increases  following  liftoff . In  general,  this  pace  will  depend  upon  our  assessment of economic  conditions  and  the  outlook,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  the  response  of  overall financial conditions to policy tightening. Currently, the still-low levels of inflation and longer-term inflation  compensation,  the  still-significant  uncertainty  surrounding  both  the  real  activity  and  inflation outlooks, and  the uncertainty  about  the  level  of the equilibrium  real  FFR  [discussed  further  below] all point  to  a  gradual  pace  during  the  early  stages  of  normalization. Therefore,  our  assessment  of  the appropriate  path  continues  to  have  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2015  and  the  end  of  2016  at 1 2 / -3 4 / %  and  1 3 4 / - 2%  respectively. We  thus  do  not  expect  that  the  FFR  will  reach  our  estimate  of  its longer-run  normal  rate  until  2018. We  believe  that  this  gradual  path  is  necessary  to  provide  insurance against  the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced  by  the  U.S.  economy  (including  those  stemming  from global economic  and  financial developments)  and  to  address  the uncertainty  about  the equilibrium real FFR,  which  in  turn  will  help  ensure  the  achievement  of  the  FOMC's  objectives  over  the  longer run. Moreover, in current circumstances-low  inflation and unemployment  near  our  estimate  of its longer-run  normal  level-unemployment  could  fall  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  under  appropriate policy, thus providing  more  insurance  against  the  risk of being caught  in a low inflation trap. Our modal  forecast  has  the  unemployment  rate  falling  just  below  our  5%  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal rate,  although  there  is  a  sizable  probability  that  it  could  fall  further  below  the  longer-run  rate.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real short-term  interest rate. We  maintain  the  range  of 1 2 / -3%  that we had  in March: this range is modestly  below  our assessment  of 1%  3%  for  'normal times,'  reflecting the impact  of  the  protracted  period  of  low  global  interest  rates  and  resulting  continued  uncertainty  about the equilibrium  real  rate. Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for the nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2.5  - 5.0%. We  continue  to  assess  that  the  equilibrium  rate  is  more likely  to  be  in  the  lower  half  of  that  range  because  of  the  behavior  of  nominal  and  real  Treasury  yields and  productivity  growth  since  the end of the recession, leading to our point estimate  of 3 1 2 / %, as

seen  in the  response  to  question  3(a). Estimates  of  the  equilibrium  rate  using  DSGE  models  and  the Laubach-Williams  model  also  suggest  that  the  equilibrium  rate  remains  low.

We would also note that we assume that reinvestment continues until economic and financial conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the  zero  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of a reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to occur  sometime  in  the  first  half  of  2016.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: I expect  the  pace  of  output  growth  over  the  medium  term  to  be  somewhat  above  my longer  term  trend  of  2.4  percent  as  the  headwinds  that  have  been  holding  down  growth  recede  further. While  I lowered  my  output  growth  forecast  for  2015  to  reflect  the  weak  2015Q1  data, I continue  to expect  that  the  economy  will  rebound  to  about  3  percent  growth  in  the  second  half  of  the  year. With fairly  modest  headline  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  anticipate  that  the  unemployment  rate  will fall to about 5 percent in 2017, slightly below my  longer term trend. With  appropriate  monetary policy firming, I do not anticipate that the unemployment  rate  will move  much  below  the  natural rate in 2017. Headline  inflation has been held down  in the first half of 2015 by the fall in energy prices. In 2017, I anticipate that headline and core inflation will have rebounded  to  my  2 percent target. Inflation stays anchored  around  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter monetary  policy  than  that anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 2: My  view  is  that  lift-off  will  be  tardy. This  tardiness  is  shaping  my  forecasts  of  the overshooting  of  inflation  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment.

Respondent 3: i) Fundamentally,  the  belief  that  the  underlying  trend  of  growth  is  strong  now  that we  are  recovering  well  from  the  Q1  slowdown. ii) The  need  to  look  through  the  influence  of  the  decline in oil prices  and  -to  a  considerable  extent-the  appreciation  of  the  dollar  in  forecasting  inflation. iii) The  fact  that  employment  has  continued  to  increase  at  an  impressive  rate.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  for  real GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  below-trend  growth  in  2015 followed  by  above-trend  growth  in  2016. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising employment  and  wages,  rising  household  wealth,  and  accommodative  financing  conditions. Real  GDP growth  is  likely  to  slow  in  2017  as  the  economy  operates  at  full  capacity. As  the  remaining  economic slack  declines,  I  expect  the  unemployment  gap  to  be  closed  by  the  end  of  2015. My  inflation  outlook projects a gradual rise in inflation coinciding with the removal  of slack from the economy  and  the dissipating  of  transitory  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  energy  prices.

I view  the  risks surrounding  my  outlook  as  broadly  balanced. Important  downside  risks  to  GDP growth  are  global  growth,  which  may  deteriorate  due  to  a  possible  slowing  in  emerging  markets  or  to spillovers  from  a  possible  Greek  exit,  and  continued  weakness  in  productivity. On  the  upside,  possible surprises  to  consumer  spending,  residential  construction  or  wages  are  risks  to  the  growth  outlook. For the unemployment  rate  path,  the  difficulty  with  predicting  labor  force  participation  introduces  risks to the  upside  and  to  the  downside. For  the  inflation  outlook,  the  downside  risk  of  a  persistent  impact of the  dollar's  appreciation  is  broadly  balanced  by  the  upside  risk  that  slack  may  diminish  faster  than expected.

Respondent 5: My  expectation  continues  to  be  for  a  path  of  moderate  recovery  as  labor  markets continue to improve, consumer  spending  firms, and fiscal headwinds  disappear. The absence of a strong  rebound  from  Q1,  a  la  Q2  in  2014,  is  of  some  concern. Industrial  production  and  business  fixed investment  (even ex the energy sector) are still disappointing, and may  remain  so until household income  is  supported  by  rising  wage  increases  as  well  as  by  employment  increases,  thereby  providing greater certainty that the demand  warranting  more  investment  and  production  will  be  there. The strength  of the dollar will be a notable  drag on growth  for at least the next several quarters. The degree  of  risk  posed  by  international  developments  -  notably  Greece  -  seems  to  fluctuate  on  an  almost

daily  basis,  but  it  seems  fair  to  anticipate  that  the  average  level  of  risk  in  at  least  the  first  part  of  the projection  period  will  be  elevated.

Respondent 6: There  is a risk of a premature  tightening  of  monetary  policy  that  would  degrade our  performance  on  inflation  and  employment.

Respondent 7: Incoming  data  on  real economic  activity  has been  below  expectations, but labor market  improvements  have  continued  at a relatively solid pace. We  judge that, at this stage, the labor market provides a more reliable signal of the underlying strength of the economy, and as a result  we  continue  to  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  modestly  above  potential  over  the  projection period. The  factors shaping  our  real outlook  have  not  changed  materially. Over  the second  half of this year and in 2016 and 2017, consumption  is expected  to grow  somewhat  faster  than  GDP  and disposable income, as the pent-up demand  that has accumulated  so far is being released. Steady growth in consumption  should stimulate business investment, and continued improvements  in the labor market  should  translate into a faster pace of household  formation  and  residential  investment growth. There  are  several  uncertainties  surrounding  our  baseline  outlook. In particular,  it  is  possible that  the  rebound  in  consumption  may  prove  weaker  than  expected  if  consumer  behavior  is  still  being impacted by the experience of the financial crisis and the Great Recession. The forecast for the investment  components  of  demand  remains  especially  uncertain,  given  the  subdued  recovery  so  far  in residential  and  investment  and  the  uneven  improvement  in  business  capital  spending.

Given  our  outlook  for  real economic  activity,  we  project  a gradual  decline  in the unemployment rate, with the unemployment  rate  reaching  the  5  percent  equilibrium  level  by  2017. The  decline  in the unemployment  rate  is  slower  than  what  would  be  implied  by  just  considering  the  projected  pace of GDP  growth. The reason has to do with our expectation of a cyclical rebound in labor force participation  over  the  forecast  period,  which  should  bring  the  relationship  between  employment  and labor  force  participation  more  in  line  with  historical  norms. By  the  end  of 2017,  core  PCE  inflation is expected  to  run  slightly  below  target. In a context  of growth  modestly  above  potential  and  little inflationary  pressures,  monetary  policy  can  aff ord  to  be  patient  when  removing  accommodation. The gradual removal of accommodation  in  our baseline outlook gives monetary  policy the opportunity to probe  for lower equilibrium  levels of the unemployment  rate  and/or  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of interest than we are currently assuming. It also provides room  for a faster but disciplined pace of tightening  should  inflationary  pressures  materialize  more  rapidly  than  expected.

The  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  are  becoming  more  balanced,  even  if  the  risks  of  a  negative  shock from  abroad  remain  somewhat  elevated. Moreover,  it  is still the case that  monetary  policy  may  not provide an adequate off set in the case of an adverse scenario. So far the unemployment  rate  has declined  more  than  what  we  would  have  thought  given  the  pace  of  GDP  growth,  and  there  is  a  risk that  this  pattern  will  persist  over  the  forecast  horizon. We  continue  to  view  the  risks  to  the  inflation outlook  as  skewed  to  the  downside,  as  we  factor  in  the  possibility  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment rate  is  lower  than  5  percent,  and  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  a  level below  target.

Respondent 8: Population growth in prime working ages will be below 0.5 percent each year. Real GDP  per  employee  has  risen  by less than 1 percent annually  over the last 3 years and is not likely to change  dramatically  over  the  forecasting  horizon. My  estimate  of  the  medium-trend  in  real GDP  is  accordingly  1.75  percent, well below  what  we  have  experienced  in  the  past. My  forecast  is that consumer  spending  will  be robust, leading to GDP  growth  that  is modestly  above  trend, and unemployment  will  fall  below  its  long-run  value.

Respondent 9: Fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  improving  household  balance  sheets,  strengthening  labor  markets  and  lower

oil prices that support  consumer  spending, easing fiscal headwinds, and further relaxation of tight credit  conditions. The  softness  in  the  data  early  this  year  will  prove  to  be  transitory;  recent  incoming data  suggest  strengthening  is  underway. Foreign  central  banks  are  adding  accommodation,  which  is promoting  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates abroad. My  business  contacts  are optimistic, and  a majority  of my  contacts  anticipate  increasing  employment  over  the  next  12  months. Overall, I see these  forces  contributing  to  above-trend  growth  and  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. By the  end  of  2017,  I  project  that  the  economy  will  essentially  be  at  its  steady  state.

The  year-over-year  headline  PCE  inflation  rate  is  likely  to  remain  low  in  the  near  term  due  to  the impact  of  the  oil price shock,  and  core  inflation  has  been  aff ected  by  some  pass-through  of  lower  oil prices  and  import  prices. But  with  oil  prices  already  moving  up  from  their  lows  reached  earlier  in  the year  and  with  the  dollar  moving  sideways  since  this  spring,  these  forces  will  exert  less  drag  on  inflation going  forward. In my  judgment,  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored,  especially  the  survey-based measures  to which  I attach more  signal. Anchored  inflation expectations  along with an improving economy  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to  the  2  percent  longer-run  objective  by  late  2016 or  early  2017. As  inflation  increases  and  the  expansion  continues,  I  expect  wage  growth  to  rise  further as well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 10: I anticipate that real GDP,  after  increasing at an anemic  1-1/4  percent  annual rate during  the first half of 2015, will expand  at an average  pace from  the second  half of this year through  2017  that  is  slightly  faster  than  potential,  reflecting  a  gradual  improvement  in  the  underlying strength  of  aggregate  demand  that  is  not  quite  off set  by  a  gradual  rise  in  interest  rates. Among  the factors  increasing  underlying  aggregate  demand  are  diminishing  drag  from  net  exports,  assuming  that the  real  exchange  rate  remains  flat  for  a  time  and  then  begins  to  depreciate  gradually  in  the  context  of a modest  pickup  in  foreign  activity. In  addition,  continued  progress  in  the  repair  of  household  balance sheets, further modest  increases  in credit availability, and  rising employment  (albeit  at  a moderate rate)  should  permit  solid  growth  in  consumer  spending  and  further  increases  in  residential  construction even  as  borrowing  costs  rise. Business  fixed  investment  should  also  pick  up  more  noticeably  once  the contraction  in  drilling  is  behind  us,  although  I  do  not  expect  this  sector  to  contribute  much  to  overall growth  in  an  environment  in  which  aggregate  demand  is  expanding  only  modestly  and  interest  rates  are rising. Finally,  I  anticipate  little  if  any  contribution  to  growth  from  federal,  state  or  local  governments given  their  fiscal  situations.

My  forecast  for  the  labor  market  assumes  that  the  Committee  adjusts  the  pace  of  tightening  over time so as to cause the unemployment  rate  in 2017 to fall a bit below my  estimate of its natural rate. Allowing  the  unemployment  rate  to  temporarily  undershoot  its  longer  level  would  accelerate  the takeup  of underutilized  labor resources, specifically by helping both  to attract discouraged  workers back  into  the  labor  force  and  to  reduce  the  number  of  employees  working  part-time  involuntarily. In my  estimation,  such  a  tightening  in  labor  market  conditions  will  be  necessary  to  return  inflation  to  2 percent  over  the  medium  term. Nevertheless,  my  forecast  assumes  that  we  do  not  achieve  our  inflation objective  until  2018.

Regarding  key  risks  to  my  forecast,  I  am  concerned  that  the  various  headwinds  noted  above  may fail to lift as quickly  or  as much  as  I  anticipate,  creating  the  possibility  that  we  might  inadvertently pursue  too  rapid  a  pace  of  tightening  for  a  time. In  addition,  I  am  concerned  that  the  anemic  gains  in productivity  recorded  over  the  past  year  could  be  a  harbinger  of  continued  weakness;  if  so,  the  risk  of having  to  return  to  the  zero  lower  bound  in  the  face  of  any  adverse  shocks  to  the  economy  would  be greatly  increased  in  the  resulting  slow-growth  world. Finally,  I  am  concerned  that  returning  inflation to 2 percent  within  a reasonable  time  period  may  require  stronger  real  activity and  a tighter labor market  than  envisioned  in  my  projection.

Respondent 11: The economy  is still recovering from the severe housing collapse and financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand  through  a  variety  of  channels,  which  policy  has  only  partially  off set. Many  of  the  associated remaining  headwinds  are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  has  been  and  continues  to  be  a  headwind. However,  with  household  balance  sheets  as well  as consumer  credit  conditions  improving,  I  expect  this  to  abate;
- · The  relatively  strong  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year  compared  with  that of the rest of the world, and subsequent monetary  easing in Europe  and elsewhere, resulted in a sharp appreciation  of the dollar. This appreciation has been a drag on net exports and GDP  growth. Yet, as the value of the dollar appears  to  have  stabilized, I expect  this drag  to gradually  abate  over  the  next  year. The  potential  deterioration  of  foreign  economic  and  financial conditions  represents  a  downside  risk.

In this environment, I expect the economic recovery will proceed at a solid pace. And with substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  play  I  expect  output  and  unemployment  gaps  to  close  by  the  end of this  year. In  terms  of  inflation,  the  lagged  eff ects  of  the  remaining  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets, combined  with  subdued  commodity  and  import  prices, should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2 percent inflation target over the next year and a half. Well-anchored inflation expectations and diminishing  slack  eventually  pull  inflation  back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 12: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthier  labor  market,  improved  household and  business  balance  sheets,  increased  access  to  credit,  and  continued  low  energy  prices  should  allow domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period. We  also  assume  that the high-degree  of  risk  aversion  that  still  seems  to  be  holding  back  household  and  business  spending will diminish  over  the  forecast  period,  which  in  turn  should  unencumber  some  pent-up  demands  for consumer  durables,  housing,  and  capital  goods. We  assume  little  change  in  the  dollar  going  forward, so that  the  constraint  on  net  exports  from  its  earlier  appreciation  will  wane  as  we  move  through  the projection  period.

These  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over the  next  2-1/2  years. As  monetary  policy  normalizes  and  cyclical  dynamics  run  their  course,  growth moderates  back  towards  potential  as  we  move  into  2018. Our  path  for  GDP  results  in  resource  gaps nearly being closed by the end of 2017. Accordingly, the downward  influence  of resource slack on inflation is expected  to  diminish  as we move  through  the  projection  period. Furthermore,  as  noted above,  we  assume  policy  normalization  does  not  begin  until  mid-2016  and  that,  at  least  initially,  the path  for  rate  increases  will  be  shallow. This  highly  accommodative  path  should  reinforce  the  public's perception  that the Committee  is  firmly committed  to  a symmetric  2  percent  inflation target, and thus  solidify  the  upward  pull  on  actual  inflation  from  inflationary  expectations.

See  the  description  of  uncertainties  and  risks  in  section  2(b)  above.

Respondent 13: Financial  conditions  remained  accommodative,  on  net,  in  the  second  half  of  2014 despite  the  rising  dollar  and  uncertainties  about  the  foreign  economic  outlook. Now,  with  the  dollar holding  relatively  steady  and  with  increased  confidence  about  the  growth  outlook  in  the  foreign  advanced  economies,  financial  conditions  are  becoming  even  more  accommodative. The  result  should  be solid  growth  during  the  remainder  of  2015,  with  continued  improvement  in  the  labor  market. Expected reductions  in  labor-market  slack  give  me  confidence  that  inflation  will  reach  our  2-percent  objective in 2016  or  shortly  thereafter.

Potential  adverse  international  political  and  financial  developments  are  the  main  source  of  nearterm  downside  risks. The  main  near-term  upside  risk  is  that  Federal  Reserve  policy  will  remain  too easy  for  too  long. This  is also  the  main  downside  risk  for  2017.

Respondent 14: The  gradual fading of the aftereff ects of the global financial crisis in the U.S., developments abroad, levels of resource utilization, and inflation expectations are the key factors shaping  my  central  economic  outlook. In  addition  to  the  aftereff ects  of  the  financial  crisis  on  domestic activity,  the  depressing  eff ect  of  the  elevated  dollar  on  net  exports  and  core  inflation  will  exert  restraint on  the  progression  of  employment  and  inflation  to  target  levels. In this environment,  accommodative monetary  policy  remains  necessary  to  move  to  maximum  employment  consistent  with  price  stability and 2 percent inflation, assuming  inflation expectations remain well anchored. The main risks to this outlook  stem  from  developments  abroad,  in  particular  the  tightening  of  financial  conditions  and restraint on aggregate demand  associated with a considerable and persistent strengthening of the dollar.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: My  outlook  consists  of  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  several  quarters,  a  further reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  gradually  converges  to  target.

Growth  over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  stronger  consumption  growth,  supported  by ongoing  improvements  in  the  labor  market  and  a  robust  pace  of disposable  income  growth,  further improvement  in  consumer  sentiment,  and  a  modest  stimulus  from  lower  energy  prices. While  lower  oil prices  negatively  impact  energy-related  investment  in  the  near-term,  conditions  remain  supportive  for capital  investment  in  other  sectors. Strength  in  the  dollar  remains  a  modest  headwind  in  my  outlook, slowing  export  growth  and  providing  some  restraint  to  domestic  industrial  activity.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  downside. Further  dollar  appreciation  and  weaker foreign  GDP  growth  could  restrain  export  growth  and  domestic  industrial  activity  more  than  I  assume in  my  baseline  outlook. I am  also  growing  increasingly  concerned  that  the  recent  weak  growth  readings are not as transitory  as  I've assumed  in  my  baseline,  and  my  assumption  for  potential  GDP  growth is too  optimistic.

The risks to my inflation outlook are balanced. On the upside, some measures of underlying inflation  point  to  a  nascent  acceleration  that,  if  sustained,  would  suggest  convergence  to  target  much more  quickly  than  I've  built  into  my  baseline  outlook. However,  measures  of  inflation  compensation are  still  about  50  basis  points  below  year  ago  levels,  and  some  respondents  in  the  Survey  of  Professional Forecasters  panel  have  lowered  their  longer-run  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 17: Real  GDP  expanded  2.7%  (annual  rate)  over  2013  and  2014,  firmer  than  growth earlier in the expansion. Qualitatively, this firming was consistent with our outlook at the time: much  of  the household  deleveraging  process  was  completed,  imbalances  in  the  housing  market  were worked  off ,  and  fiscal  consolidation  at  both  the  federal  and  state  and  local  levels  was  largely  finished. The stronger 2013-14 growth rate appeared to have been above the potential growth rate, as the unemployment  rate  declined  by  over two percentage  points and other labor market  indicators also improved. Core  PCE  inflation  was  relatively  stable  over  this  period, running  between  1 1 4 / %  and  1 1 2 / %,  consistent  with  a  flat  price  Phillips  curve.

ffeted Then  in 2015Q1  the US economy  was bu by several adverse shocks; some of which were transitory, such as severe winter weather  and the West  Coast port labor dispute, while others are more  long  lasting,  such  as  the  appreciation  of  dollar  and  steep  contraction  in  oil  and  gas  exploration in the  wake  of  the  steep  decline  of  oil  prices. But  now,  there  is  greater  evidence  that  the  economy  has begun  to  shake  off these shocks. Nevertheless,  the  growth  rate  of  real GDP  for  2015H1  is  expected to be a little below 1 1 4 / % (annual rate). [Note: this projection takes on board the Board  staff 's estimates of the revisions to the second estimate of Q1 real GDP  growth  that were shown  in the Tealbook  forecast  update  memo  to  the  FOMC.]

Assessing  that  much  of  this slowdown  is  temporary,  we  expect  real  GDP  to  expand  2 1 4 / %  to 2 1 2 / % (annual rate) over 2015H2, similar to that in our March  SEP  submission,  which  would  bring

the Q4/Q4  growth  rate  to  about  1 3 4 / %. We  anticipate  real  PCE  growth  moving  up  to  around  3% (annual  rate)  in  2015H2  from  about  2%  In  2015H1. In addition  to  improved  labor  market  conditions and consumer  confidence, we expect the savings from lower energy prices to provide an important boost  to consumer  spending  as  households  become  more  confident  that  lower  prices  are  lasting. We also expect housing construction to continue to move  higher, aided by an improved  labor market, gradual  easing  of mortgage  underwriting  standards,  and  emerging  tightness  in  housing  supply. The steep  contraction  in  investment  in  the  oil  and  gas  sector  should  be  largely  over  by  the  second  half  of the  year. In  addition,  we  anticipate  that  the  the  drag  from  international  trade,  while  still  substantial, will be  less in 2015H2  than  our  projections  for  2015H1.

For  2016  we  expect  growth  of  around  2 1 2 / %  (Q4/Q4);  again,  similar  to  our  March  SEP  submission. Growth  of  real  PCE  will  likely  slow  somewhat  from  the  2015H2  pace  as  the  boost  from  lower  energy prices fades. Nonetheless, we anticipate the personal saving rate to continue to decline gradually as credit becomes  more readily available and the scars from the financial crisis fade. We  project stronger growth of residential investment in 2016 than in 2015 but we also anticipate it will slow in 2016H2 as higher mortgage interest rates begin to have an eff ect. Given our assumption of a relatively stable dollar exchange  rate  and  somewhat  stronger  foreign  growth,  the  drag  from  trade  is expected  to  diminish  in  2016  and  US  manufacturing  output  is  projected  to  rise  at  a  healthy  rate. In this environment,  business  fixed  investment  is also expected  to strengthen  though  the  growth  rate-6%  (Q4/Q4)-is  still  not  particularly  robust. In 2017, most  of the resource  slack is expected  to  be dissipated,  and  thus  we  expect  growth  to  be  near  its  potential  rate.

Above-potential  growth  between  mid-2015  and  end-2016  is  expected  to  lead  to  further  reductions of labor  market  slack,  with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  slightly  below  5%  by  late  2016. This  is a pretty  flat  trajectory  relative  to  the  experience  of  the  past  few  years: a  projected  return  of  productivity growth  to  its  longer-term  trend,  a  flat  participation  rate,  and  a  modest  increase  of  the  average  work week  all contribute  to a slower decline in the unemployment  rate  over  this  period. With  real GDP and  productivity  growth  near  trend  in  2017,  we  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  little  changed that  year.

Based on oil futures markets, we believe that oil prices have bottomed  out and will gradually move  higher  over  the  forecast  horizon. Thus,  while  the  total  PCE  deflator  is  likely  to be essentially unchanged  over  the  2015H1,  we  expect  it  to  rise  at 1 3 4 / %  annual  rate  over  2015H2. Over  2016  we expect  headline  inflation  to  move  gradually  toward  the  FOMC's  target  of  2%,  due  to  declining  slack and  the  gravitational  pull  of  well-anchored  longer-term  inflation  expectations. The  core  PCE  deflator is expected  to rise 1 1 4 / %  (annual  rate) over 2015H1,  the  same  as over 2014H2,  as declining prices for nonpetroleum  imports  depress  goods  prices. However,  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon the eff ect of the dollar appreciation  begins  to  wane  and  the  slowing  of health  care price inflation is expected  to  end. Under  those  assumptions,  core  PCE  inflation  will  rise  gradually  to  2%  in  2017.

The  near-term  risks  to the forecast for real activity appear  to be reasonably  well balanced. On the upside, the transitory  adverse  shocks  may  have  obscured  a  significantly  stronger  economy; consequently,  with  an  improving  labor  market  and  solid  sentiment,  we  could  see  a  stronger  growth  than we  now  expect. If so, that  would  likely  provide  an  additional  boost  to  business  investment  spending. On  the  downside,  the  U.S.  economy  may  have  been  more  negatively  aff ected  by  dollar  appreciation than  assumed  in  our  central  forecast,  or  further  dollar  appreciation  could  lead  to  a  larger  drag  from international trade. Also, because we do not fully understand  the sources of the recent decline of productivity, it is possible that productivity growth could remain below our forecast with adverse eff ects on real GDP  growth. The  risks to the inflation forecast also appear  to  be roughly  balanced. The  disinflationary  eff ect  of  dollar  appreciation  may  be  stronger  than  we  have  anticipated. However, it is possible  the  slack  may  be  reduced  more  quickly  and  begins  to  have  a  stronger  impact  on  inflation than  we  have  anticipated.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: I have  lowered  my  near-term  forecast  somewhat  in  response  to  weaker-than-expected data  received  since  the  March  FOMC  meeting.

Respondent 2: The  GDP  data  for  Q1/2015  has  caused  a  markdown  of  growth  in  the  first  half  of 2015  and  for  2015  as a whole. The  unemployment  rate  for  2015  has  also  been  adjusted  accordingly. Some  of  the  growth  has  been  shifted  to  2016  and  2017.

Respondent 3: Other  than  the  near  term,  my  forecast  has  not  changed  greatly.

Respondent 4: The  information  received  since  March  has  led  me  to  revise  down  my  forecasts  for real GDP  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2015,  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  in  2015,  and  revise up  my  forecasts  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  in  2015.

Respondent 5: Obviously,  the  severity  of the reported  Q1  stumble  has  caused  me  to  mark  down my  expectation  for  2015  GDP  growth. Otherwise,  I  haven't  changed  much  from  my  March  forecast.

Respondent 6: My  forecast  is  little  changed  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 7: The  projected  pace  of  GDP  growth  this  year  is  slower  than  in  the  previous  projections,  mainly  as  a  result  of  weaker  than  expected  growth  in  the  first  half  of  the  year. Given  that  the current  pace  of  growth  is  slower  than  previously  thought,  the  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  somewhat more  accommodative  policy  stance. This  more  accommodative  stance  is  expected  to  generate,  by  the end  of the forecast horizon, the same  unemployment  rate  outcome  as  in  the  previous  forecast. The outlook  for  inflation  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 8: The temporary weakness in the first quarter was greater than expected. But consumer  spending  seems  more  resilient than I feared, which suggests somewhat  more  momentum next  year  and  beyond.

Respondent 9: The  contours  of  my  forecast  are  little  changed  from  the  previous  SEP.  GDP  growth in the first half of this year was weaker than I anticipated, but I attribute much of the softness to transitory factors that are dissipating; I continue to expect growth to pick up to above-trend levels. The  recent  incoming  data  related  to  consumer  spending  and  labor  markets  support  this  view. The  labor  market  data  and  inflation  developments  have  played  out  largely  in  line  with  my  previous forecast: with an improving  economy  and  stable  inflation  expectations, I expect  further declines in the  unemployment  rate  and  an  inflation  rate  that  gradually  returns  to  our  target.

Respondent 10: My  projections  for  real  GDP  growth  have  shifted  down  noticeably  since  the  March FOMC,  reflecting  both  the  weaker-than-expected  tone  of  incoming  spending  and  production  indicators and a downward  revision  to my  estimate of the longer-run growth  rates of labor productivity and potential output. In turn, the revision to potential output  growth  has  led me  to lower the longerrun  projection  of  the  nominal  federal  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points,  to  3-1/4  percent. Relatedly,  the somewhat  disappointing  incoming  data  also  led  me  to  reassess  the  underlying  strength  of  aggregate demand. I now  judge  that  achieving  the  tightening  in  resource  utilization  needed  to  return  inflation

to 2 percent  within  the  next  few  years  will  require  a  noticeably  flatter  trajectory  for  the  federal  funds rate. Because  I  have  incorporated  such  a  trajectory  into  my  outlook,  my  projections  for  the  paths  of unemployment  and  inflation  are  little  changed.

Respondent 11: Since  March,  I  have  made  few  changes  to  my  forecast. My  forecast  for  GDP  growth in 2015  (Q4/Q4)  is  somewhat  lower,  primarily  due  to  the  unexpected  weakness  of  GDP  growth  in  the first half of the year. My  medium  and  longer  run  forecasts  for  GDP  growth  are  unchanged. Also, I have  revised  up  slightly  my  forecast  of  the  unemployment  rate  for  2015,  reflecting  the  recent  slowing in the  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate.

My  inflation  forecast  is  little  changed. I continue  to  expect  both  headline  and  core  inflation  to  run below  our  2  percent  target  until  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 12: On  balance, the incoming  data have been weaker than we expected in March. Although  the  labor  market  improved  about  as  we  expected,  consumption  and  investment  rose  lessthan-anticipated,  possibly, as we noted  earlier, due to a greater degree of risk aversion on the part of households and consumers  than we had been assuming. Indeed, the reports from our business contacts-particularly  with regard to capital spending-  have  been more  subdued  than  they  were in March. The incoming news on inflation has been mixed. On  the positive side, there are nascent indications  of a pickup  in wage  growth  and  relative  stabilization  of  the  dollar  and  energy  prices; on the downside,  the  incoming  data  on  core  PCE  inflation  have  been  a touch  softer than  we expected and  we  still  are  not  hearing  of  any  price  pressures  from  our  business  contacts.

In response  to  these  developments,  we  lowered  our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2015  by  about 3 4 / percentage  point;  about  half  of  this  revision  reflects  a  weaker  first  quarter. We  made  only  marginal changes  to  our  growth  outlook  for  2016  and  2017. Corresponding  to  the  lower  level  of GDP  in  this forecast, we bumped  up  our  unemployment  rate  forecast  a  touch  throughout  the  projection  period. We  slightly  reduced  our  near-term  forecast  for  core  inflation  in  light  of  recent  data,  but  left  our  2016 and  2017  forecasts  the same  as in March. Given  the  changes  in  resource  slack and  lower  near-term inflation  outlook,  we  pushed  our  assumed  date  of  policy  liftoff  from  early  2016  to  the  middle  of  that year  and  lowered  our  funds  rate  path  marginally  thereafter.

Respondent 13: First-quarter GDP  growth  was  weaker  than  anticipated. I expect some  of the shortfall to be made  up in the second half of 2015, and more to be made  up in 2016. Still, full employment  is  likely to take slightly longer to achieve than I previously thought  (the end of 2015, rather  than  the  middle  of  the  year). I've  left  my  inflation  forecasts  largely  unchanged: As  discussed  in my  response  to  question  4c,  below,  Dallas  Fed  research  continues  to  suggest  that  we  will  see  inflation rise to our 2-percent objective in 2016. My  assessment of the likely appropriate policy path has changed  significantly  for  reasons  given  in  my  response  to  question  3c, above. I would  note  that  the broader  financial conditions  which  play an important  role in my  thinking  about  appropriate  policy can  change  quickly.

Respondent 14: The  incoming  indicators  on  the  labor  market  and  aggregate  spending  suggest  a more pronounced  slowing  in the pace of economic  activity in the first half of the year than I had expected  in March. As a result, I reduced  my  projection of GDP  growth  this  year and raised my projection of the level of the unemployment  rate a bit in 2016 and 2017. Because of the weaker trajectory  of  the  incoming  data,  I  believe  monetary  policy  will  need  to  be  slightly  more  accommodative than  I expected  in  March,  and,  thus,  I  have  lowered  my  projected  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by 1/4  percentage  point  at  the  end  of  2015,  2016,  and  2017.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: I have  marked  down  my  growth  forecast  in  2015  appreciably,  largely  in  response  to a decline  in  first  quarter  output  growth. I view  much  of  that  weakness  as  reflecting  transitory  factors, such  as  unusually  severe  winter  weather  and  other  seasonal  anomalies,  West  coast  port  disruptions,  a sharp  drop  in  energy-related  investment,  and  headwinds  due  to  a  stronger  dollar. I expect  weakness connected  to  declining  energy-related  structures  investment  and  softer  net  exports  to  persist,  at  least through  the  current  quarter.

Respondent 17: For real GDP  growth,  the  first  quarter  was  much  weaker  than  we  expected. As noted above, a number  of transitory adverse shocks contributed to the weakness; in addition, the residual  seasonality  issue  could  have  contributed  a  little  to  that  weakness. We  diff er  from  the  Tealbook assessment  about  the  relative  contributions  of  those  factors-we  attribute  more  to  the  weather  and  less to residual seasonality-but our assessment of the total eff ect on Q1 real GDP  growth is similar. Although  we expect much  of these eff ects to be reversed in 2015Q2, the expenditure data for the quarter  so  far  on  net  indicate  that  the  rebound  could  be  relatively  subdued,  and  thus  our  projection for  2015H1  is  significantly  below  that  of  the  March  SEP  submission. Nevertheless,  we  see  the  economic fundamentals  as  progressing  fairly  close  to  our  March  projection;  consequently,  the  forecast  for  2015H2 and  beyond  is  little  changed.

The  unemployment  rate  is  a bit higher than we had projected  in March. With  little change  in our economic  growth  forecast,  we  have  carried  that  higher  rate  forward, leaving our projected  path for the unemployment  rate slightly higher than that of our March  SEP  submission, although the unemployment  rate  still  falls  slightly  below  our  point  estimate  of  the  longer-run  natural  rate.

Both overall and core inflation have been modestly above our previous projections, leading us to raise our projected  paths  for both  variables. The  behavior  of  alternative  measures  of  underlying inflation also is consistent with a bit higher inflation path over the next two years. Beyond the aggregate number, the higher path for inflation reflects our assessment that the decline in import prices  has  had  a  somewhat  smaller  eff ect  on  core  goods  inflation  than  we  had  anticipated  in  March. We continue  to  assume  that  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored  at  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective, so we  still project  inflation  be  at  2%  in  2017.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: My  forecast  calls  for  stronger  growth,  somewhat  higher  inflation,  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast  horizon  than  the  Tealbook

Respondent 2: My  forecast  is  for  more  rapid  GDP  growth  in  2015  and  2016  than  is  in  the  Tealbook forecast. While  the  Tealbook  indicates  a  convergence  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  5.2%  in  2016,  my forecast includes an undershooting to 4.6% and then a convergence to 5.8%. Also, the Tealbook anticipates  a  steady  convergence  of  inflation  to  2%,  while  I  foresee  an  overshooting  to  2.4%  and  then a convergence  to  2.0%.

Respondent 3: I am  more  optimistic  than  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  forecast.

Respondent 4: My  forecast for GDP  growth in 2015, 2016 and 2017 is slightly above that of Tealbook,  largely  due  to  my  more  upbeat  outlook  for  investment  and  expectations  of  less  drag  from net exports, reflecting less persistent eff ects of the rise in the foreign exchange  value of the dollar. My  projected path for the unemployment  rate  does not diff er substantially from Tealbook's path. My  outlook  for PCE  inflation  and  core PCE  inflation  is several tenths of a percentage  point  above Tealbook's  projection,  largely  reflecting  a  quicker  reduction  in  slack  than  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 5: No  major  diff erences  -  a  few  tenths  of  a  percentage  one  way  or  the  other  for  some items.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Our  forecast is conditioned  on liftoff occurring  in Q4  rather than Q3. However, the  Tealbook  forecast  and  our  forecast  have  similar  outcomes  both  in  terms  of  economic  activity  and inflation.

Respondent 8: I believe  that  inflation  will  reach  2  percent  in  2017.

Respondent 9: My  forecast is somewhat  stronger than the June Tealbook forecast. As in the Tealbook,  I  expect  that  after  a weak  first quarter  GDP  growth  will  proceed  at  an  above-trend  pace in 2015  and  2016  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  continue  to  decline. (I note  that  my  trend  growth rate is higher  than  the  Tealbook's.) My  forecast  calls  for somewhat  more  inflationary  pressure  than in the  Tealbook  forecast: I expect  that  inflation  will  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term  objective  by late 2016 or early 2017. Compared  with  Tealbook,  this  firmer  path  for inflation calls for a steeper path  for  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 10: My  longer-run  projections  for output  growth, the unemployment  rate,  and  the nominal  federal funds rate are modestly  lower  than  the staff 's, but otherwise  the two forecasts are reasonably  close.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection. One  notable  diff erence is that  the  Tealbook  has  a  much  more  protracted  return  of  inflation  to  the  FOMC's  stated  2  percent objective. Also,  the  Tealbook  has  somewhat  slower  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2015  than  I  do, though  I  broadly  share  the  Tealbook's  view  on  GDP  growth  after  2015.

Respondent 12: We  assume  that the first increase in the funds rate will occur mid-2016, three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of increase  after  liftoff is a bit faster than  the  Tealbook, and  at  the  end  of  the  projection  period  our  funds  rate  reaches  2.38  percent.

Our projection for GDP  growth runs about 1 4 / percentage point stronger than the Tealbook throughout the projection period. However, given our somewhat  higher assumption for potential output  growth,  our  forecast  represents  a  slightly  weaker  cyclical  outlook  than  the  Tealbook,  and  we end the forecast period with actual output  still bit below  potential. Our  projection  for inflation is a touch below the Tealbook in 2016 and 2017. We  also assume the long-run normal level of the unemployment  rate  is  5  percent,  0.2  percentage  point  below  the  Tealbook's.

Respondent 13: Dallas researchers forecast significantly faster GDP  growth  in the second half of 2015 than does the Tealbook, and slightly more strength in 2016 as well. Consequently, the unemployment  rate  falls  a  bit  faster  and  a  bit  farther  than  is  shown  in  the  Board-staff  forecast. Partly because  of  our  lower  unemployment  path,  partly  because  we  believe  that  inflation  responds  to  changes in the unemployment  rate  as  well  as  its  level,  and  partly  because  we  accept  that  long-term  inflation expectations  are  anchored  at  2 percent, our forecast calls for inflation to rise past 2-percent  within the  projections  horizon. With  the  unemployment  rate  falling  faster  and  farther  than  in  the  Tealbook, inflation rising faster and farther, and no ad hoc policy inertia, the appropriate  funds-rate path is steeper  than  that  assumed  in  the  Tealbook  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: After making similar adjustments to the near-term path, my growth forecast continues  to run roughly 1 2 / percentage  point  above  the Tealbook  throughout  the  forecast  horizon, mostly  due  to  our  diff ering  perspectives  on  potential  GDP  growth. My  unemployment  rate  projection converges  in  2017  to  a  long-run  unemployment  rate  that  is  0.2  percentage  point  below  the  Tealbook. My  headline  and  core  inflation  forecasts  run  about 1 4 / percentage  point  above  the  Tealbook  over  the forecast  horizon,  as it is still my  view  that  inflation  expectations  remain  at  a  target-consistent  level of 2 percent.

Respondent 17: Since March,  the  revisions to the Tealbook  forecast  and  our  projection  for real GDP  growth  have  resulted  in  the  two  forecasts  being  fairly  similar  for  2015-16. The  Tealbook  forecast is modestly  above  ours for 2017, reflecting the Tealbook's assessment  that there is some  economic slack  remaining  at  the  end  of  2016.

Therefore, on the real side, the diff erences are principally in the details. Among  such  details, one  longstanding  diff erence  regards  business  fixed  investment. The  Tealbook  projects  slower  growth in business fixed investment  in 2015-16 than in our forecast; this diff erence may  partly reflect the Tealbook assessment that the capital stock is fairly close to levels consistent with its rather low estimate of potential growth. This factor is off set by faster consumption  growth in the Tealbook forecast, another long-standing diff erence with our forecast, which in part reflects stronger wealth eff ects in the  Tealbook  forecast.

We  project  a  slight  undershoot  of  the  unemployment  rate  while  the  Tealbook  has  unemployment  at or above  its  estimate  of  the  longer-run  natural  rate. However,  the  diff erence  between  the  paths  of  the unemployment  rate  reflects  more  the  Tealbook's  higher  estimate  of  the  longer-run  rate  (5 1 4 / %)  than in our  forecast  (5%). In addition,  there  is  a  small  diff erence  in  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: our projection has a flat participation rate path through  2016 while the Tealbook  has it declining gradually  to  62.6%  at  end-2016.

fferences  arise For  inflation, the two  forecasts  are  similar  in 2015. Larger  di in 2016-17,  where  we expect  inflation to rise relatively quickly  toward  the  FOMC's  objective  while  the  Tealbook  projects that  inflation  will  not  reach  that  level  until  2019. This  diff erence  reflects  diff ering  views  about  inflation dynamics. In the  Tealbook,  with  the  underlying  inflation  rate  below  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective and considerable persistence in the inflation process, a prolonged  period of above-potential  growth (and  a  positive  output  gap)  appears  to  be  necessary  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run inflation  goal. The  faster  return  of  inflation  to  its  goal  in  our  forecast  reflects  our  assumptions  of  less inflation  persistence  and  of  the  stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation  expections.

As in March, our assessment  of the longer-run potential GDP  growth  rate  is a bit higher than that  in the Tealbook  forecast. We  will  reevaluate  our  assessment  following  the  release  of  the  annual revisions  for  GDP  and  productivity  during  the  summer.

In terms of the uncertainty and risk assessment, we see some  diff erences between  the two projections. On  the  real side, we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty at near normal  levels. This assessment reflects our view that the unusual nature of the current expansion,  the  atypical policy environment  in  the  U.S. and  many  foreign  economies, and  the  decline  in  real  GDP  in  2015Q1  leave  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard associated  with  the  20-year  window  of  forecast  errors. In  another  contrast,  we  see  the  risks  around  the real activity projections  as roughly  balanced  rather  than  tilted  to  the  downside  as  in  the  Tealbook. The  continued  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  and  the  indications  that  private  final  domestic demand  has  been  well  maintained  so  far  (despite  some  of  the  weaker  expenditure  data)  signal  a significant  risk  that  stronger  expansion  dynamics  have  been  established. Furthermore,  the  possibility of delayed  response  to  lower  energy  prices  is  another  off set  to  the  negative  risks  cited  by  the  Tealbook. As  for  inflation,  although  our  uncertainty  assessment  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  we  still  see  the  risks as roughly  balanced: although  still-low  longer-term  inflation  compensation  and  low  inflation  in  other areas of the world  pose  downside  risks  to  the  forecast, the possibility that slack could  be dissipated more  quickly  than  anticipated  off sets  those  risks.
