Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds rate at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  September  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee on September  25-26,  2018. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with the  September  25-26,  2018,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  December  18-19,  2018,  meeting.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines are based  on  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the  Committee's  target for the federal funds  rate at the end  of the year indicated. The  actual  values  are the midpoint  of  the target range; the median  projected values are based on either the midpoint  of the target range or the target level. The  confidence  interval around  the median  projected  values  is based  on root mean  squared  errors  of various private and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years. The  confidence  interval  is  not  strictly  consistent  with  the projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  primarily  because  these  projections  are  not  forecasts  of  the  likeliest  outcomes  for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments  of appropriate  monetary  policy. Still, historical  forecast  errors  provide  a  broad  sense  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate generated  by  the  uncertainty  about  the  macroeconomic  variables  as  well  as  additional  adjustments  to  monetary  policy that  may  be  appropriate  to  off set  the  eff ects  of  shocks  to  the  economy.

The  confidence  interval  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  except  when  it  is  truncated  at  zero-the  bottom  of  the  lowest target range  for the federal funds  rate that has been  adopted  in  the past by the Committee. This truncation  would not be intended  to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative  interest rates to provide  additional  monetary  policy accommodation  if  doing  so  was  judged  appropriate. In such  situations,  the  Committee  could  also  employ  other  tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  their  projections.

* The  confidence  interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term  interest rates in the fourth quarter  of  the  year  indicated;  more  information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. The  shaded  area  encompasses less than  a  70  percent  confidence  interval  if  the  confidence  interval  has  been  truncated  at  zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: Developments  since  the  September  SEP,  including  the  productivity  data,  indicate  that  the U.S.  economy  still  appears  to  be  experiencing  low  trend  productivity  growth. Therefore,  I  have  not  changed  my estimate  of  1 3 / 4 percent  for  longer-run  real  GDP  growth.  The  evidence  also  points  to  no  change  in  my  estimate  for the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  of  around  4 1 / 2 percent.

I assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective. Under  those  conditions,  the  monetary  policy  stance  will  be  consistent  with  a  small  overshooting  of  inflation  and  an  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  normal  unemployment  rate  for  the  next  several  years. I expect  these  variables  to  return  to  their  longer-run  levels  by  the  mid-2020s.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: We  expect  values  of  headline  and  core  inflation  to  be  on  or  very  close  to  target  in  2018  and beyond,  but  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  are  expected  to  deviate  from  their  long-run  values  conditional  on the  current  regime. This  regime,  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  on  short-term government  debt,  features  GDP  growth  of  2.0  percent,  and  unemployment  rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0 percent.  The  projected  deviations,  due  in  part  to  federal  stimulus,  are  expected  to  be  temporary.  We  project  that the  overshooting  of  GDP  will  end  in  2020  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment  will  end  in  2022.  Because  there are  multiple  potential  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  of  these  variables  based  on  the  outcomes  in  multiple  regimes  is  potentially misleading.  We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run  inflation  projection  that  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Our  policy  goals  have  effectively  been  reached. However,  it  will  take  some  time  to  achieve sustained  convergence  to  longer-run  levels.  The  fiscal  stimulus  and  past  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  keep the  unemployment  rate  well  below  the  natural  rate  for  several  years  before  it  returns  back  a  longer-run  sustainable level. This  overshooting  of  full  employment  is  accompanied  by  a  very  modest  overshooting  of  the  inflation  target.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: We  are  at  our  inflation  target  but  past  full  employment. We  believe  that  growth  will  slow  in 2019  and  2020  and  this  should  at  least  stabilize  the  employment  gap. If growth  slows  as  we  expect,  it  is  possible that  we  will  be  more  vulnerable  to  adverse  shocks  and  policy  missteps.

Respondent 10: I expect  the  convergence  process  will  take  shorter  than  five  years. Real  GDP  growth  will likely  decelerate  to  its  longer-run  level  in  the  next  few  years. PCE  inflation  will  likely  decline  in  the  near  term reflecting  lower  energy  prices,  but  I  expect  inflation  to  return  to  two  percent  over  the  next  year. Whether  the unemployment  rate  will  eventually  converge  toward  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  is  uncertain. Although  I see  the  unemployment  rate  remaining  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  over  the  forecast  horizon,  there  is substantial  uncertainty  around  estimates  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate. Should  the  unemployment  rate stabilize  at  a  low  level  without  signs  of  building  inflationary  pressures,  that  would  suggest  that  such  a  level  may

be  consistent  with  sustainable  growth  over  the  medium  term. Taking  into  account  the  uncertainty  about  the longer-run  unemployment  rate,  and  looking  through  an  energy-related  decline  in  inflation,  we  have  in  my  view essentially  achieved  our  objectives  for  inflation  and  unemployment.

I reduced  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate,  in  light  of  the  downward  surprise  to  core  PCE inflation  since  June  2018,  when  I  last  revised  this  estimate.  A  declining  longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  consistent with  ongoing  demographic  changes,  such  as  the  aging  of  the  workforce.

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12:

N/A

Respondent 13: The  forecast  has  the  unemployment  rate  declining  through  next  year,  remaining  steady  in 2020  as  growth  slows,  and  then  rising  starting  in  2021  as  growth  edges  down  further  below  potential.  Thereafter,  a prolonged'growth recession'is  needed  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  return  to  its  equilibrium  level.  Assuming  that the  federal  funds  rate  does  not  rise  much  above  its  2021  level,  a  model  driven  forecast  would  say  that  it  will  likely take  5  or  6  additional  years  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  converge  to  its  long-run  rate  from  below. In  practice, the  likelihood  of  achieving  this  type  of  soft  landing,  over  such  a  long  period,  is  small.  Indeed,  the  historical  record places  a  high  probability  on  a  recession  occurring  once  growth  starts  to  slow  below  potential.

Respondent 15: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath. Changes  in  trade  policy  and  other  financial  and  international  developments  have  increased  the  uncertainty  around my  forecasts,  but  not  significantly.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Uncertainty  around  my  projections  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  may  be  a  little  higher than  in  September,  but  it  is  still  roughly  similar  to  their  respective  average  levels  over  the  past  20  years  (the  SEP standard). Continued  trade  tensions,  the  turbulence  in  financial  markets,  the  impact  of  slower  global  growth  on the  U.S.  economy,  escalated  political  tensions  in  Europe,  and  the  future  path  of  fiscal  policy  are  sources  of  greater uncertainty. However,  economic  developments  since  the  September  SEP  have  been  largely  consistent  with  my outlook,  which  o ffsets  some  of  that  uncertainty.

Respondent 4: Elevateduncertaintyaboutu*.  Anotherstrongyearforemployment,hours(andproductivity at  least  in  business  sector),  and  Core  PCE  is  running  at  1.8  and  nominal  wages  up  3.1  in  line  with  productivity  and inflation.  This  is  the  lowest  unemployment  rate  in  50  years  but  I'm  looking  at  the  data  to  learn  about  where  u*  is today  .

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Mycontactsin thebusiness community appear tobe moreuncertainaboutthe growthoutlook than  they  were  in  September.  That  said,  uncertainty  does  not  appear  to  be  materially  greater  than  it  has  averaged for  the  last  20  years.

Respondent 7: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: An  awareness  that  real  growth  is  slowing  and  is  likely  to  slow  further  has  begun  to  sink  in. With  that  new  awareness  has  come  an  increased  recognition  of  the  economy's  vulnerability  to  adverse  shocks  and policy  missteps,  and  an  increased  sense  of  unease.  Political-economy  risks  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  have  multiplied. These  political  economy  risks  are  likely  to  spill  over  into  company  results,  and  then  spill  over  into  economic  results. We  believe  this  is  already  beginning  to  happen. The  list  of  risks  includes-but  is  by  no  means  limited  to-trade and  tariff  disputes,  concerns  about  debt  sustainability  in  Italy,  the  possibility  of  a  hard  Brexit,  new  leadership  in Mexico,  domestic  and  trade  decisions  by  China,  OPEC  decisions  regarding  production  levels,  and  the  threat  of  a U.S.  government  shutdown.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: While  the  forecasting  exercise  under  current  conditions  may  not  be  as  uncertain  as  during the  Great  Recession,  we  have  little  experience  forecasting  inflation  dynamics  at  very  low  unemployment  rates,  as well  as  guiding  the  economy  through  a  protracted  growth  recession.  More  directly  related  to  our  current  outlook, we  assume  very  limited  effects  from  the  change  in  tariffs,  but  it  is  possible  that  the  disruption  in  global  trade  will  be broad-based  enough  to  a ffect  the  economy  in  ways  not  captured  by  our  models.  The  tariffs  could  also  feed  through to domestic  prices  more  than  anticipated. There  could  also  be  spillovers  from  the  recent  increase  in  financial market  volatility  that  are  not  well  captured  by  our  models,  and  there  are  potential  financial  stability  concerns associated  with  keeping  interest  rates  relatively  low  given  an  economy  that  is  forecasted  to  be  significantly  above full  employment  for  an  extended  period  of  time.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  future  course  of  both  trade  and  fiscal  policy.  The  impact  on inflation  uncertainty  is  less  pronounced  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 16: Fiscal  and  trade  policy  continue  to  be  a  key  source  of  uncertainty  to  the  outlook.  In  addition, the  extent  to  which  recent  changes  in  financial  conditions  might  impact  consumer  and  business  sentiment  and spending  is  unclear. We  also  see  the  range  of  outcomes  for  world  growth,  especially  those  of  our  major  trading partners,  as  somewhat  wider  than  in  the  recent  past.  Finally,  the  recent  data  on  inflation  and  inflation  expectations have  modestly  increased  the  uncertainty  around  our  inflation  forecast. Nevertheless,  we  do  not  think  that  these changes  have  risen  to  a  degree  that  would  alter  our  characterization  of  uncertainty  as  broadly  similar  to  historical levels.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: Although  downside  risks  have  increased  some,  risks  are  roughly  balanced.

Respondent 2: The  risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  are  mounting.

Respondent 3: The  risks  to  real  economic  activity  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon. The  primary  downside  risks  come  from  the  possibility  that  trade  tensions,  political  events  in  Europe,  and  slower globalgrowthcouldfurtherimpactfinancialmarkets, eventuallyleadingtosignificantlytighterfinancialconditions and  slower  growth  for  the  U.S.  economy.  Another  downside  risk  is  that  fiscal  policy  could  become  more  restrictive than  anticipated,  which  is  somewhat  more  likely  following  the  mid-term  elections.  One  notable  upside  risk  is  that fiscal  stimulus  could  have  more  positive  demand- and/or  supply-side  effects  than  I  anticipate. Possible  stronger momentum  associated  with  robust  household  and  business  confidence  is  another  upside  risk.

The  risks  to  inflation  also  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced. A  major  upside  risk  is  that  aggregate  demand pressures  as  well  as  the  effects  of  higher  tariffs  and  trade  tensions  could  begin  to  put  more  upward  pressure  on inflation  than  has  been  apparent  so  far. A  significant  downside  risk  is  that  slower  global  growth,  declines  in  oil prices,  a stronger-than-anticipated foreign exchange  value  of the  US dollar  and  subdued inflation  in many  advanced economies  may  weaken  domestic  inflationary  pressures  more  than  I  have  judged.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  one  of  low  growth.  A  higher productivity  growth  regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Recent increases  in  productivity  still  leave  productivity  in  its  low  regime. However,  as  changes  in  fiscal  and  regulatory policy  continue  to  a ffect  the  economy,  we  see  the  possibility  of  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  we  see US  trade  policy  as  generating  some  downward  risk  for  growth.  An  additional  factor  is  the  possibility  of  yield-curve inversion. Further  upward  movements  in  the  federal  funds  rate  have  typically  been  associated  with  recessions; however,  we  anticipate  a  lag  of  more  than  a  year  between  yield-curve  inversion  and  the  onset  of  recession. Thus we,  we  view  the  risks  on  this  variable  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion. If a  recession  were to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially  and  quickly.  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon.  The  interaction  between  US  and  foreign  trade  policies  raises  the  possibility of  trade  disruptions  that  might  increase  unemployment.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  if  GDP  growth  surprises  on  the  upside. Federal  stimulus  associated  with  tax and  spending  changes  might  produce  such  a  surprise.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects. However,  there is  a  risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. In  addition,  federal  stimulus associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  could  push  prices  higher. Trade  policy  changes  might  also  put some  upward  pressure  on  import  prices. Anecdotal  reports  are  consistent  with  increasing  price  pressures. Thus we,  we  view  the  risks  on  this  variable  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  the  variable  depends  on  the behavior  of  energy  prices,  whose  recent  declines  are  incorporated  in  our  projections.  While  an  upward  energy-price shock  is  a  possibility,  a  case  can  be  made  for  some  further  downward  drift  in  energy  prices. Overall,  we  view  the risks  for  PCE  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 6: Of  the  three  choices,  I  feel  that'broadly  balanced'best  captures  my  view.  However,  I  do  lean in  the  direction  of  putting  the  risk  of  overheating  higher  than  the  risk  of  excessive  monetary  restraint.

Respondent 7: Risks  to  projected  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced.  On  the  upside,  the  economy continues  to  show  higher  than  expected  momentum. On  the  downside,  the  effects  of  a  higher  federal  funds  rate may  be  more  powerful  than  expected,  as  suggested  by  the  tightening  of  financial  market  conditions  and  cooling of  the  housing  market  this  year. Further  downside  risk  arises  from  a  greater  escalation  of  the  tariff  war  and  much weaker  growth  abroad.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Our  internal  models  have  shown  a  sequence  of  downgrades  to  the  2019:H1  GDP  growth outlook,  and  any  of  a  variety  of  global  political-economy  risks,  if  realized,  would  adversely  a ffect  U.S.  GDP  growth in  2019. Symptoms  of  this  slowing  are  already  manifesting  themselves  in  corporate  results  and  forward  guidance regarding  earnings.

Respondent 13: With  the  economy  growing  above  potential,  labor  markets  are  expected  to  tighten  further. In  recent  quarters,  the  additional  demand  for  labor  has  been  accompanied  by  improvements  in  the  cyclical  position of  labor  force  participation.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  additional  demand  will  not  be  met  by  increased  participation and  the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  decline  consistent  with  its  demographically-driven  downward  trend. This  scenario  would  lead  to  a  more  pronounced  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  than  we  anticipate  and  place more  upward  pressure  on  wages  and  prices.

Respondent 14: DownsideriskstooutputgrowthhaveincreasedsincemylastSEPsubmission.  Butincoming data,  including  weak  investment  spending,  have  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for  GDP  growth,  and  I  see  risks around  this  now  somewhat  lower  path  as  broadly  balanced. Similarly,  I  see  risks  as  broadly  balanced  around  my slightly  higher  unemployment  rate  path. I have  made  little  change  to  my  inflation  path  and  continue  to  see  risks to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

The  U.S.  economy  remains  in  a  healthy  position,  with  output  and  employment  growing  above  trend,  the unemployment  rate  below  estimates  of  its  longer-run  natural  rate,  and  inflation  near  2  percent. Nevertheless, sentiment  about  the  global  economic  outlook  has  deteriorated,  uncertainties  over  trade  policy  remain  unresolved, financial  market  volatility  has  increased,  stock  prices  have  fallen,  and  corporate  credit  spreads  have  increased. Downside  risks  include  slower  than  anticipated  growth  in  China  and  in  Europe,  the  possibility  of  a  hard  Brexit, increasing  uncertainty  around  trade  policy  and  higher  tariffs,  losses  on  high  levels  of  leveraged  lending  to  weaker borrowers,  the  possibility  that  the  moves  in  financial  markets  are  signaling  weaker  underlying  fundamentals, further  deterioration  in  sentiment,  and  further  pull-back  in  risk-taking.  On  the  other  hand,  there  are  some  upside risks,  too,  since  these  situations  could  turn  out  to  be  better  than  what  is  built  into  forecasts. For  example,  the resolution  of  uncertainty  over  the  trade  situation  is  an  upside  risk  to  the  forecast.  In  addition,  fiscal  stimulus  (tax cuts  and  increased  government  spending)  added  to  growth  in  2018;  I  expect  the  stimulative  effects  to  wane  over  the forecast  but  there  are  two-sided  risks  around  that  expectation.  Tax  refunds  next  year  could  turn  out  to  be  higher than  anticipated  as  households  may  not  have  completely  adjusted  withholding  rates.  Thus,  higher  refunds  could boost  household  spending  in  the  first  half  of  next  year,  with  this  effect  fading  in  the  second  half.

ff changes,  they  should  not  raise  the ff changes  in  inflation; I continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced. Inflation  rates  are  currently  near  2  percent. Looking through  the  temporary  downturn  in  headline  inflation  that  will  result  from  recent  declines  in  energy  prices,  I expect  that  inflation  rates  will  be  near  2  percent  over  the  medium  run. However,  with  labor  markets  tight  or  if nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  begin  to  kick  in,  inflation  could  move  higher  than  I  anticipate. Tariffs  present firms  with  an  opportunity  to  raise  prices. To  the  extent  that  these  are  one-o inflation  rate.  However,  a  continued  roll-out  of  tariffs  over  time  could  lead  to  continued  one-o this  could  push  up  inflation  expectations  and  lead  to  higher  inflation  rates  over  time.

The  value  of  the  dollar  has  been  rising  since  the  spring. I expect  somewhat  further  appreciation  given  the relative  strength  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  prospects  for  tighter  monetary  policy  compared  to  abroad.  But  the  risks

around  the  path  of  the  dollar  are  two-sided. A  considerably  stronger-than-expected  appreciation  in  the  dollar poses  a  downside  risk  to  the  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  appear  elevated  -  leverage  lending  is  at  high  levels  and  underwriting  standards  on this  debt  have  deteriorated;  commercial  real  estate  valuations  continue  to  be  lofty.  Financial  vulnerabilities  could amplify  an  economic  slowdown.

Respondent 15: Recent  volatility  in  asset  markets,  declines  in  inflation  compensation  measures,  falling  oil prices,  and  indications  of  slowing  growth  abroad  have  shifted  my  perception  of  the  risk  surrounding  my  forecast. As  well, I remain  uncertain  about  the  extent  to  which  fiscal  stimulus  may  be  masking  underlying  growth  and inflation.  I  remain  concerned  about  the  potential  magnitude  of  adverse  effects  on  the  economy  from  international trade  conflicts.

Respondent 16: We  see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  both  growth  and  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

We  still  see  the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  fiscal  policy  will  result  in  a  bit  more,  or  a  bit  less,  stimulus  than  we built  into  our  projection.  International  developments  pose  a  downside  risk;  growth  abroad  is  somewhat  softer  than expected  and  trade  war  scenarios  have  yet  to  abate.  In  addition,  changes  in  financial  conditions  could  weigh  more heavily  on  business  and  household  sentiment  and  spending  than  in  our  forecast.  We  do  not  want  to  overstate  these risks,  however.  To  date,  measures  of  aggregate  financial  market  conditions  and  foreign  growth  prospects  have  not deteriorated  that  much  (for  example,  by  much  less  than  in  2015  and  2016). And  it  is  unclear  how  much  of  recent financial  market  movements  are  largely  noise  (as  the  Tealbook  assumes)  or  simply  reflect  more  market  participants taking  on  board  a  slowing  in  activity  along  the  lines  in  our  baseline  projection. In  sum,  while  downside  risks  may have  increased  some,  we  do  not  think  it  is  by  enough  to  move  the  overall  balance  of  risks  into  the  downside  bucket.

The  recent  softening  in  core  inflation  and  lack  of  a  firming  in  inflation  expectations  suggest  that  underlying inflation  trends  may  not  be  rising  to  the  degree  we  assume  in  our  baseline  forecast. In addition,  some  of  the international  risks  noted  above  could  lead  to  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  lower  U.S.  inflation. In contrast, the  anecdotes  from  our  business  contacts  about  intensifying  costs  with  pass-through  to  customer  prices  point  to building  inflationary  pressures. Furthermore,  our  concern  about  the  recent  low  readings  on  inflation  may  be  an overreaction  to  noisy  data.  There  also  is  a  risk  that  tariffs  could  show  through  more  visibly  to  consumer  prices.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Afterrunningbelowour2percenttargetforquitesometime, inflationhadessentiallyreturned to  target  earlier  in  the  year.  However,  recent  inflation  readings  have  been  on  the  soft  side.  While  job  gains  remain strong  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  below  4  percent,  it  is  not  clear  that  we  have  reached  maximum  employment as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime  age  persons  remain  well  below their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued.  Given  the  persistent  undershooting  of  our  inflation target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy  implies  a  very  gradual  path  of  increases  for  the  federal  funds rate.

Respondent 2: My  funds  rate  path  continues  on  a  gradual  tightening  path  next  year. Despite  the  recent tightening  in  financial  conditions,  indicators  of  the  real  economy  suggest  that  above-trend  growth  is  continuing. I have  therefore  adjusted  my  rate  path  only  slightly. With  inflation  close  to  our  objective,  it  will  be  desirable to  stabilize  growth  around  its  longer-run  sustainable  pace  sometime  soon,  a  key  reason  that  gradual  tightening remains  appropriate.  One  factor  that  works  to  o ffset  in  part  the  impact  of  tighter  financial  conditions  on  my  funds rate  path  is  my  assumption  of  a  larger  terminal  value  of  reserves;  see  question  4b  for  further  details.

Respondent 3: The  principal  factors  behind  my  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are my  estimate  of  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest,  my  economic  outlook,  and  the  balance  of  risks  around  that  outlook. Most  estimates  for  the  natural  rate  have  changed  little  since  the  September  SEP,  and  so  I  have  maintained  my estimate  of 1 / 2 percent.  I  will  continue  to  monitor  future  data  and  estimates  to  determine  if  an  adjustment  to  my assumption  is  necessary.

Withaslightdowngradeofmy2019growthprojection, asmallerprojectedovershootofinflation,andsomewhat tighter  financial  conditions  than  I  previously  anticipated,  my  assessment  of  the  appropriate  federal  funds  rate  path is shallower  than  in  September. In  particular,  I  see  the  target  federal  funds  rate  range  at  the  end  of  2018  at  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / 2 percent,  the  same  as  in  my  September  SEP  submission.  However,  I  anticipate  that  the  target  range  at  the end  of  2019,  2020  and  2021  will  be  3  -  3 1 / 4 percent  in  each  year: The  end-2020  and  end-2021  assessments  are  50 basis  points  below  those  in  my  September  submission.  I  still  envision  that  the  policy  rate  modestly  overshoots  its longer-run  level  in  2019  -  2021,  as  policy  acts  to  unwind  the  small  overshooting  of  inflation  and  tight  labor  market conditions.  This  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  policy  rules  suggest,  reflecting  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only gradually  toward  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

Respondent 4: If as  I expect  we  decide  to  hike  at  this  meeting,  the  upper  bound  of  the  range  for  the  policy rate  will  coincide  with  the  estimate  of  long  run  r*  submitted  by  several  members  of  the  committee  including  me We  have  the  luxury  with  core  PCE  running  at  1.8  ,  with  no  cost  push  wage  pressure  evident,  with  headline  inflation set  to  fall  below  target,  and  with  several  measures  of  expected  PCE  inflation  remaining  below  2  percent  to  be  truly

data  dependent  as  we  assess  both  the  pace  and  ultimate  destination  for  the  Federal  funds  rate.  The  forecasts  from FRB/US  and  EDO  reported  on  page  92  of  the  Teal  book  indicate  that  with  a  Fed  Funds  path  similar  to  what  I write  down  above,  we  can  expect  as  of  today  for  price  stability  to  be  maintained  and  for  unemployment  to  return to  r*  in  two  years.

Respondent 5: A  target  of  2.38  percent  for  the  forecast  horizon  is  consistent  with  our  assessment  of  current economic  conditions  and  for  the  convergence  of  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  to  their  values  in  a  regime characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. A  target of  2.38  is  also  consistent  with  the  Fed's  inflation  target. We  view  additional  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  as too  aggressive  given  our  projections.  In  the  event  of  a  regime  change,  such  as  a  shift  from  low  to  high  productivity growth,  our  target  federal  funds  rate  will  change.

Respondent 6: The  real  federal  funds  rate  will  be  about  a  half  percent  after  our  meeting,  and  it  difficult  for me  to  believe  that  this  low  rate  will  remain  appropriate  over  time. Real  growth  in  this  submission  is  above  trend next  year,  and  labor  markets  are  tight.  Inflation  is  running  near  2  percent  and  expectations  appear  well  anchored. Under  these  conditions  I  believe  that  the  funds  rate  needs  to  increase.  I  would  note  that  although  my  submission projects  3  rate  increases  next  year,  I  am  open  to  the  possibility  of  having  fewer  increases  in  2019.  I  also  believe  that our  balance  sheet  normalization  should  remain  on  autopilot.

Respondent 7: The  labor  market  has  exceeded  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  and  I  expect it to  continue  to  tighten  with  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  3.4  percent  by  the  end  of  next  year. The recent  inflation  numbers  were  a  bit  soft,  but  with  the  economy  above  potential,  I  anticipate  inflation  will  be  on target  next  year  and  then  modestly  overshoot  beginning  in  2020.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  assume  a  low  natural rate  of  interest  of 3 / 4 percent.  My  fed  funds  rate  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  reflects an  inflation  rate  that  has  been  rising  only  gradually  toward  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term,  I envision  a  path  for  the  fed  funds  rate  that  modestly  overshoots  its  longer-run  level  beginning  in  late  2019  through 2021  to  keep  the  economy  on  a  sustainable  growth  path  and  limit  the  modest  overshooting  of  the  inflation  target.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I  believe  recent weakening  in the  outlook,  coupled  with  our  vulnerability  to  further weakening, makeitunlikelythatwewillneedtoraisethefundsrateaboveitslonger-runneutrallevel.  Iwouldnotethatinflation is  sufficiently  tame  and  other  imbalances  sufficiently  limited  that  the  Federal  Reserve  has  the  ability  to  be  patient in  removing  accommodation.  I  believe  that  the  level  of  long-term  interest  rates-especially  long-forward  interest rates-conveys  useful  information  about  the  longer-run  neutral  short-term  interest  rate,  and  I  believe  that  a  yieldcurve  inversion  of  any  size  or  duration  would  signal  that  we've  likely  moved  too  far  in  our  monetary  policy  decisions. My  own  view  is  that  it  is  just  as  likely  that  long-term  interest  rates  will  move  lower,  rather  than  higher,  over  the next  few  years.  As  a  result,  my  funds-rate  path  is  fairly  shallow.

Respondent 10: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability.  I  anticipate  it  will  be  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds rate  to  rise  in  2019  to  near  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level,  and  to  stay  near  that  level  over  the  remainder  of  the forecast  horizon,  for  three  main  reasons. First,  the  economy  is  operating  at  or  above  full  capacity,  yet  inflation remains  moderate. While  strong  labor  market  conditions  may  eventually  put  more  upward  pressure  on  prices, structural  and  global  factors  appear  to  be  disinflationary. With  these  o ffsetting  pressures  on  inflation,  I  view  a gradualpathofthefederalfundsrateasimportanttocollectmoreevidencethatinflationwillremainstable.  Second, estimates  of  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  and  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  are  uncertain. The  closer unemployment  and  inflation  are  to  our  objectives,  the  more  this  uncertainty  favors  a  data  dependent  approach  to monetary  policy.  Third,  in  this  environment,  a  patient  approach  to  monetary  policy  normalization  will  allow  for the  assessment  of  economic  effects  of  past  interest  rate  rises.

Respondent 13: With  the  economy  running  already  beyond  full  employment  and  a  policy  stance  that  is  still accommodative,  it  is  difficult  to  determine  an  appropriate  path  for  policy.  A  number  of  models  and  optimal  control exercises  call  for  a  rapid  tightening  of  policy  in  the  near-term  to  get  the  unemployment  rate  back  to  equilibrium. However,  such  a  swift  tightening  of  policy  would  likely  increase  the  probability  of  a  recession  in  ways  that  our  linear models  are  unable  to  capture.  Our  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  tries  to  balance  this  concern  against  the concern  that  running  an  economy  above  full  employment  for  an  extended  period  of  time  may  also  create  distortions that,  too,  could  increase  the  probability  of  a  future  downturn.  Given  the  underlying  momentum  in  real  activity,  we believe  it  is  appropriate  to  somewhat  front  load  the  policy  increases  next  year  and  then  tighten  policy  twice  more in  2020  before  stopping  any  rate  hikes  at  least  through  2021.  Such  a  strategy  would  reduce  the  likelihood  of  further declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  after  next  year,  while  providing  policymakers  time  to  assess  how  the  economy responds  to  a  contractionary  policy  stance.  This  path  for  policy  also  achieves  the  goal  of  turning  the  unemployment rate  around  before  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon,  rather  than  moving  further  from  full  employment,  which  would occur  with  a  slightly  more  gradual  policy  path.

Respondent 14: Over  2017  and  2018,  the  policy  rate  has  been  moving  toward  the  range  of  estimates  of the  neutral  rate. There  has  been  a  compelling  case  to  move  the  policy  rate  up  given  the  economy's  strength -characterized  by  above-trend  growth  and  tight  labor  markets  -  and  the  fact  that  inflation  has  moved  up  to  2 percent.  We  are  now  getting  closer  to  a  new  phase  in  which  to  determine  appropriate  policy  settings  the  Committee needs  to  be  even  more  attentive  to  the  evolution  of  economic  conditions  and  their  implications  for  the  medium  run outlook  and  the  risks  around  the  outlook.

My  modal  outlook  is  for  the  economy  and  labor  markets  to  remain  strong  over  the  forecast  horizon.  I  project that  growth  will  be  slowing  to  trend  over  the  forecast  horizon  and  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  remain  well below  my  4.5  percent  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level.  I  anticipate  that  tight  labor  market  conditions  will  translate into  some  continued  firming  in  the  labor  compensation  measures,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups.  However,  given  slow  productivity  growth,  I  expect  wages  to  rise  at  a  slower pace  than  in  past  expansions.

Inflation  rates  are  near  our  2  percent  target. The  recent  decline  in  energy  prices  will  temporarily  weigh  on headline  inflation  into  2019.  Inflation  expectations  are  fairly  well-anchored,  firms  have  reported  some  increase  in their  ability  to  raise  prices  for  their  customers,  and  the  economy  is  expected  to  remain  in  a  sound  position.  Thus, I expect  inflation  to  remain  near  2  percent  through  the  forecast  horizon.

With a  somewhat  slower  growth  trajectory  and  somewhat  higher  unemployment  path  compared  to  by  previous SEP  submission,  I  have  revised  down  the  fed  funds  rate  path  associated  with  my  projections. This  reduction  in my  path  also  takes  on  board  the  fact  that  the  labor  market  tightness  we  have  seen  to-date  has  not  translated  into significantly  higher  inflation.  My  modal  projection  sees  some  further  increases  in  the  funds  rate  next  year  and  only slightly  tighter  policy  in  2020,  with  the  rate  moving  down  to  slightly  above  my  longer-run  3  percent  estimate  by  the endof2021.  Iviewthispathasprudentlybalancingtheriskstotheoutlookforbothpartsofourmandate.  However, as  we  near  estimates  of  the  neutral  rate,  with  the  uncertainties  around  that  rate,  and  with  the  uncertainties  around the  forecast,  I  am  well  aware  there  is  uncertainty  around  my  policy  path  and  I'll  be  attentive  to  the  incoming  data and  what  they  imply  about  the  medium  run  outlook  and  the  risks.  I  note  that  the  position  of  the  economy  at  this point,  with  strong  labor  markets  and  inflation  near  2  percent,  gives  us  the  opportunity  to  make  this  assessment and  calibrate  policy  to  achieve  and  maintain  our  dual  mandate  goals.

Respondent 15: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  three  years  is slightly  lower  compared  to  my  September  forecast.  In  response  to  the  continued  lack  of  significant  acceleration  in inflation,  even  with  tight  labor  markets,  I  have  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points and  have  revised  down  my  assessment  of  the  degree  to  which  monetary  policy  is  accommodative.  I  now  anticipate two  rate  hikes  through  the  end  of  2019  and  one  more  in  2020.

Respondent 16: We  assume  that  a  funds  rate  in  the  3  to  3-1/4  percent  range  would  be  restrictive  enough  to bring  about  a  soft  landing.  And  we  continue  to  think  it's  appropriate  to  move  policy  into  this  position  by  the  end  of 2019.  Accordingly, after a federal funds rate increase this round, we have three rate hikes in 2019 and thereafter hold the  funds  rate  steady  through  2021.  We  assume  balance  sheet  normalization  proceeds  according  to  the  announced plan  and,  like  the  Tealbook,  we  now  assume  a  $1  trillion  long-run  level  of  reserves.

Our  policy  rationale  is  the  same  as  it  has  been  for  some  time. A  very  gradual  pace  of  funds  rate  increases is necessary  to  firm  inflation  expectations  symmetrically  about  2  percent  and  ensure  that  inflation  achieves  our objective  on  a  sustainable  basis. But,  eventually,  policy  will  have  to  take  a  modestly  restrictive  stance  to  return output  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  their  long-run  normal  rates  in  a  measured  fashion.  We  believe  a  funds  rate at  3  to  3 1 / 4 percent  -  when  compared  with  our  2 3 / 4 percent  assumption  for  the  long-run  neutral  rate  -  will  achieve this  goal.  The  recent  changes  in  financial  conditions  have  not  altered  our  view  that  r*  is  currently  slightly  above  its longer-run  level  but  will  move  down  as  fiscal  stimulus  wanes.  Our  policy  trajectory  is  consistent  with  some  modest overshooting  of  our  2  percent  inflation  objective  in  2020  and  2021,  which  we  see  as  a  virtue  that  will  help  to  firm inflation  expectations  symmetrically  around  the  2  percent  target.

Respondent 17: In  my  view,  appropriate  monetary  policy  calls  for  an  attenuated  removal  of  accommodation until  we've  achieved  a  neutral  stance.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Core  inflation  is  close  to  target  and  the  economy  continues  to  add  jobs  with  only  modest increases  in  wage  growth.  This  reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  may  be  some  slack  left  in  the  economy.

Respondent 2: Fiscal  policy  is  a  key  factor  shaping  my  outlook,  continuing  to  provide  a  boost  to  growth  next year  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  in  2020  as  well.

Respondent 3: The  recent  data  generally  indicate  that  the  economy  remains  strong,  and  I  project  that  real GDP  growth  for  this  year  will  be  about  3  percent,  similar  to  my  September  projection. However,  I  assess  that the  economy  has  a  little  less  momentum  at  this  time  and  financial  conditions  are  tighter  than  I  had  anticipated  in September,  so  I  project  that  growth  in  2019  will  be  about  2 1 / 4 percent,  compared  to  2 1 / 2 percent  in  my  September submission.

ff has A  number  of  factors  contribute  to  this  moderation  of  growth. First,  the  housing  market  has  weakened  more than  I  anticipated,  and  I  have  marked  down  my  forecast  for  residential  construction. Analysis  by  my  sta found  that  the  combination  of  higher  mortgage  rates  and  smaller  tax  subsidies  to  housing  from  the  TCJA  have had  a  more  significant  effect  on  the  housing  market  than  anticipated  and  probably  will  continue  to  do  so  in  2019. These  factors  should  also  reduce  home  price  appreciation,  leading  to  somewhat  lower  household  wealth.  Second, I have  dampened  my  projection  for  business  investment  because  of  the  tightening  of  financial  conditions  and  the decline  in  my  projected  path  for  oil  prices. Third,  the  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  slightly  slower  global  growth combine  to  lower  U.S.  aggregate  demand  modestly.

Even  with  this  moderation,  real  GDP  growth  in  2019  will  be  at  a  pace  above  its  potential  rate.  I  thus  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  fall  to  about  3 1 / 2 percent  by  the  end  of  next  year  and  core  PCE  inflation  to  reach  2  percent. The  basic  contours  of  my  projection  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon  are  similar  to  those  in  my  September projection.  The  combination  of  a  gradually  tighter  monetary  policy  stance  and  the  fading  of  fiscal  stimulus  leads to  a  slowdown  of  growth  to  just  above  potential  in  2020  and  modestly  below  potential  in  2021.  With  slower  growth, the  unemployment  rate  begins  to  rise  gradually,  but  it  remains  well  below  its  longer-run  normal  rate  at  the  end of 2021. With  resource  utilization  remaining  tight,  inflation  rises  and  is  slightly  above  the  FOMC  objective  in 2020  and  2021. A  still-moderately  tight  monetary  policy  and  little  impetus  from  fiscal  policy  contribute  to  bring inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  longer-run  normal  levels  by  the  middle  of  the  next  decade.

Respondent 4: The  cost  of  credit  - through  higher  Treasury  yields,  wider  spreads,  and  9  increases  in  the  Fed funds  rate  - and'financial  conditions  = risk  appetite'have  tightened  materially.  Global growth  outlook has  been marked  down. Treasury  supply  is  exploding  and  we  are  shrinking  our  balance  sheet  . Term  premia  likely  to  rise and  if  they  do't  - it  will  be  because  global  growth  and  risk  appetite  falls  further. Dollar  is  stronger. Fed  is  not  the only  game  in  town.

Respondent 5: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  US  economy.  In our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them. The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  a  switch  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. However,  we  are  paying  close  attention  to  many  factors,  such  as  the  effects  of  regulatory  and  tax  policy changes,  which  might  move  the  economy  to  a  high  productivity  state. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent  and can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes,  such  as ones  associated  with  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variable  may  be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regimedependent  policy  may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting  when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  challenging, so  we  forecast  that  the  economy  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 6: I believe  that  fiscal  stimulus  temporarily  boosted  real  GDP  growth,  but  that  boost  is  now wearing  o  . Strong  consumer  and  business  sentiment  suggest  that  GDP  growth  will  stay  above  trend  for  some time.  However,  the  signals  on  sentiment  are  becoming  more  mixed.

Respondent 7: The  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  strong  pace  relative  to  trend,  which  has  pushed  the unemployment  rate  lower. My  forecast  factors  in  a  sizable  effect  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  to  the  economic  outlook. Ongoing  strength  in  household  disposable  income  coupled  with  past  gains  in  household  wealth  and  high  consumer confidence  should  support  continued  consumption  growth. The  outlook  for  fixed  business  investment  appears healthy  given  the  corporate  tax  changes.  However,  uncertainty  regarding  possible  further  retaliatory  tariffs  from U.S.  trading  partners,  the  declining  prospects  for  global  growth,  and  the  recent  rise  in  financial  market  volatility may  induce  more  cautious  spending  behavior.  Furthermore,  my  contacts  in  the  business  community  have  recently shown  a  noticeable  decline  in  optimism.  These  factors  have  caused  me  to  slightly  lower  my  estimate  for  real  GDP growth  in  2019.

Despitetheserecentdevelopments, Iexpecttheeconomicexpansiontoproceedatapacethatisabovepotential. Withfiscalstimulusandlikelysomemonetaryaccommodationstillinplace, Iexpecttheoutputandunemployment gaps  to  overshoot  for  the  next  few  years,  leading  to  some  pickup  in  inflation.  I  continue  to  expect  core  inflation  to reach  our  2  percent  target  on  a  sustained  basis  by  2019,  followed  by  a  slight  overshooting  that  continues  through 2021. Normalization  of  monetary  policy  and  a  tightening  of  fiscal  policy  will  help  bring  inflation,  growth,  and unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  in  the  following  years.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: In  the  background,  the  economic  outlook  continues  to  be  shaped  by  adverse  demographic trends, technology  enabled  disruption  (which  is  increasing  the  need  for  improved  education  and  skill  levels), educationandskilllevelsthatarenotkeepingpacewithbusinessneedsandarecontributingtosluggishproductivity growth,  and  the  likely  unsustainable  path  of  U.S.  government  debt. Weak  trend  U.S.  growth,  weakening  growth prospects  abroad,  and  strong  global  demand  for  safe  assets  continue  to  hold  down  the  equilibrium  level  of  interest rates  and  the  appropriate  path  for  policy.  Cyclical  pressures  on  wage  inflation  are  building,  but  appear  more  likely to  squeeze  margins  than  put  upward  pressure  on  price  inflation. Brinksmanship  in  trade  and  other  government policies,  here  and  abroad,  contributes  to  business  uncertainty  as  well  as  uncertainty  about  the  economic  outlook, greatly  complicates  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  and  limits  the  practical  usefulness  of  forward  guidance  on  the path  of  short-term  interest  rates.

Respondent 10: Central  economic  outlook:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend growth  from  2018  to  2020,  where  supportive  financial  conditions  and  expansionary  fiscal policy are  the  main  factors boosting  growth  temporarily  above  trend.  Real  GDP  growth  will  likely  decelerate  as  financial  conditions  become less  accommodative  and  the  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  wane. I expect  PCE  inflation  to  be  modestly  below  2 percent  early  in  2019,  reflecting  the  recent  drop  in  energy  prices,  but  to  return  to  2  percent  during  the  year.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  forecast  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad. The  risks  to  economic  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  appear  broadly balanced,  although  downside  risks  appear  to  have  increased. Threats  of  more  restrictive  trade  and  immigration policies,signalsofslowingglobaldemand,andrisinggeopoliticaluncertaintyposedownsiderisktoeconomicgrowth and  inflation. Upside  risks  to  my  forecast  stem  from  greater-than-expected  momentum  in  the  economy  and  the possibility  that  deregulation  and  elevated  business  confidence  translate  into  sustained  increases  in  investment  and productivity.

Respondent 11: I believe  that  the  economy  still  has  considerable  underlying  momentum,  notwithstanding recent  volatility  in  financial  markets.  Strong  growth  will  push  down  the  unemployment  rate,  but  by  a  fairly  modest amount as  workers  are  drawn  into  the  workforce,  increasing  labor  force  participation.  The  bu ffering  effect  of  higher potential  growth,  both  in  response  to  policy  changes  as  well  as  increased  investment  and  labor  force  participation, will  limit  the  spillover  of  growth  into  inflation.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Incoming  data  since  the  September  projections  have  been  a  touch  weaker  than  expected on  net,  although  data  on  consumer  spending  has  remained  strong. Economic  growth  remains  far  enough  above potential  to  have  resulted  in  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  if  not  for  a  continued  cyclical  rebound  in labor  force  participation. Turbulence  in  the  financial  markets  has  yet  to  have  a  noticeable  impact  on  consumer sentiment,  but  equity  valuations  are  less  supportive  of  growth  going  forward  than  they  were  in  September.  At  the same  time,  the  outlook  for  real  household  income  has  improved  due  to  tight  labor  markets  and  falling  oil  prices. In  addition,  the  outlook  for  residential  investment  has  become  more  negative  and  net  exports,  which  provided  a boost  to  the  economy  earlier  in  the  year,  are  now  a  drag  on  growth. Taken  together,  we  believe  the  underlying momentum  of  the  economy  remains  reasonably  strong-helped  in  part  by  ongoing  fiscal  stimulus-and  that  growth will  continue  to  outstrip  potential  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  but  by  a  little  less  than  we  expected  in  September. Economic  momentum  carries  forward  into  next  year,  but  growth  moderates  as  interest  rates  continue  to  increase. By  2020,  growth  falls  a  bit  below  potential  and  moves  lower  in  2021.  As  a  result,  the  unemployment  rate  begins  to rise,  but  remains  nearly  a  percentage  point  below  full  employment  by  the  end  of  2021.

Our  forecast  is  conditioned  on  further  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  that  result  in  a  moderately  restrictive stance  of  monetary  policy  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon. The  pace  of  tightening  is  very  cautious  relative  to historical  standards  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  already  well  below  its  assumed  equilibrium  level. Our path  for  policy  strikes  a  balance  between  the  need  to  raise  rates  enough  to  prevent  the  unemployment  rate  from falling  further  below  its  equilibrium  level,  and  the  risk  that  raising  rates  too  quickly  may  increase  the  likelihood that  the  economy  falls  into  a  recession.  In  striking  this  balance,  we  have  revised  down  the  level  of  the  federal  funds rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  our  projection  in  September.  Given  a  slightly  weaker  outlook  for  growth in  those  years,  this  lower  policy  path  has  the  unemployment  rate  moving  up  slightly  over  the  medium  term  while somewhat  reducing  the  probability  of  higher  rates  pushing  the  economy  toward  a  recession.

We  view  the  risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced  in  the  near  term.  It  is  possible  that  the recent  financial  market  volatility  and  equity  price  declines  will  start  weighing  on  consumer  spending  more  than  we currently  anticipate. In  addition,  while  our  outlook  accounts  for  the  recently  enacted  tariffs,  it  assumes  that  any effects  are  relatively  minor  whereas  in  reality  they  could  prove  more  disruptive  to  economic  growth. At  the  same time,  we  maintain  a  fairly  conservative  view  of  the  effects  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  on  GDP  growth,  and  it  is possible  that  the  tax  cuts  will  stimulate  activity  by  an  amount  that  is  cumulatively  larger  than  we  have  assumed. In  the  medium  term,  with  the  unemployment  rate  well  below  equilibrium,  the  ability  to  achieve  a  soft  landing remains  questionable. A  scenario  in  which  the  economy  eventually  falls  into  a  recession  as  monetary  policy  tries to  move  the  unemployment  rate  back  to  equilibrium  has  historical  precedents.  The  likelihood  of  such  a  situation increases  if  inflation  suddenly  reacts  more  forcefully  than  anticipated  to  the  tight  labor  market  conditions  and policymakers  respond  by  raising  interest  rates  faster. In  addition,  the  unemployment  rate  would  decline  more quickly  if  the  ongoing  and  anticipated  increase  in  payrolls  does  not  continue  to  be  met  by  cyclical  increases  in  labor force  participation.  Finally,  an  unemployment  rate  below  4  percent  for  an  extended  period  runs  the  risk  of  eliciting a nonlinear  response  in  inflation,  even  if  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  turns  out  to  be  below  our  current estimate.

Respondent 14: The  U.S.  economy  remains  in  a  healthy  position,  with  output  and  employment  growing above  trend,  the  unemployment  rate  below  estimates  of  its  longer-run  natural  rate,  and  inflation  near  2  percent. Nevertheless,  sentimentabouttheglobaleconomicoutlookhasdeteriorated, uncertaintiesovertradepolicyremain unresolved,  financial  market  volatility  has  increased,  stock  prices  have  fallen,  and  corporate  credit  spreads  have increased.  One  question  is  whether  the  moves  in  financial  markets  are  signaling  weaker  underlying  fundamentals. At  this  point,  I  have  not  changed  my  view  that  the  fundamentals  are  healthy.  Firms  in  the  district  reported  a  strong 2018  and  are  optimistic  that  2019  will  be  healthy  as  well,  although  likely  somewhat  weaker  than  in  2018.

Theconsumersectorremainshealthy.  Wagesaremovinghigherand,despitethedropinstockprices,household balance  sheets  remain  healthy.  With  much  of  consumer  debt  at  low  fixed  rates,  the  sector  should  be  able  to  handle the  anticipated  interest  rate  increases,  although  mortgage  originations  are  likely  to  decline.

Thebusinesssectorremains sound, but the paceof investmenthasslowed,  perhapsdue toincreaseduncertainty around  trade  policy  and  the  health  of  the  global  economy.

Labor  market  conditions  are  strong. Firms  continue  to  report  tightness  in  labor  markets  and  difficulties  in findingqualifiedworkers.  Inresponsetheyhavebeenincreasingwagesacrossarangeofskillgroupsandoccupations. The  outlook  for  the  global  economy  has  weakened,  but  accommodative  monetary  policies  are  expected  to  be supportive  of  continued  growth.

After  running  well  above  trend  in  2018,  I  project  growth  will  be  slowing  to  trend  over  the  forecast  horizon  and

that  the  labor  market  will  remain  strong,  with  the  unemployment  rate  moving  down  somewhat  further  next  year and  remaining  below  its  longer-run  rate  through  2021.

Inflation  rates  are  near  our  2  percent  target. The  recent  decline  in  energy  prices  will  temporarily  weigh  on headline  inflation  into  2019.  But  with  inflation  expectations  fairly  well-anchored,  the  economy  remaining  healthy, and  a  leveling  out  of  energy  prices,  I  expect  underlying  inflation  to  remain  near  2  percent  through  the  forecast horizon.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  the  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  the  risks  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real economy  and  for  inflation,  contingent  on  my  policy  rate  path.

Respondent 15: My  forecast  calls  for  output  growth  to  slow  from  3  percent  in  2018  to  2  percent  in  2021  as fiscal  stimulus  wanes  and  the  economy  returns  to  trend. The  unemployment  rate  stays  below  my  estimate  of  the natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  but  I  do  not  anticipate  this  will  result  in  a  significant  building  of  inflation pressures  due  to  a  relatively  flat  Phillips  curve.  As  well,  the  continuing  lack  of  significant  acceleration  in  inflation even  with  tight  labor  markets  has  led  me  to  revise  my  view  on  how  accommodative  monetary  policy  is.  My  forecast calls  for  inflation  to  remain  near  the  Committee's  target  with  only  modest  increases  in  the  funds  rate  going  forward. I see  more  downside  risk  to  the  forecast  compared  to  September  in  response  to  heightened  asset  market  volatility, a  flattening  yield  curve,  and  weaker  growth  prospects  abroad.  I  remain  concerned  about  uncertainty  surrounding fiscal  and  trade  policy  going  forward.

Respondent 16: We  continue  to  see  the  fundamentals  underlying  private  domestic  demand  as  solid. Less accommodative monetary policy  and  a  waning  impulse  from  fiscal  policy  are  expected  to  result  in  somewhat  slower growth  in  2019. Still, we  see  growth  then  running  somewhat  above  potential. By  2020  and  2021,  higher  policy rates  and  a  further  decline  in  fiscal  stimulus  lowers  growth  below  potential,  and  the  output  gap  falls  by  almost  a percentage  point  to  1.4  percent  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.  Slowing  foreign  growth  and  a  stronger  dollar  also are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  slowdown.

We  project  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  3 1 / 2 percent  in  2019  and  then  rise  to  3.8  percent  by  the end  of  2021,  a 1 / 2 percentage  point  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment.

We  expect  that  tight  labor  markets  will  provide  a  lift  to  inflation  going  forward,  even  with  a  flat  Phillips  curve. We also  rely  on  a  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2 percent  inflation  target  to  firm  inflation  expectations  around  2  percent.  A  non-accelerationist  Phillips  curve  limits the  upside  risk  to  inflation,  even  with  the  unemployment  rate  at  3 1 / 2 percent.  All  told,  we  expect  core  inflation  to be  2.0  percent  next  year,  then  to  rise  gradually  to  2.2  percent  by  2021.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 17: Real  GDP,  in  my  outlook,  steps  down  from  the  strong  growth  we've  seen  this  year,  but  still grows  at  an  above  trend  pace  next  year  before  settling  down  to  trend  by  the  end  of  2020. A  stronger  profile  to consumer  spending,  owing  largely  to  the  recent  tax  reform,  is  the  primary  driver  of  the  moderate  overshoot  of potential  growth.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  balanced. Household  spending  could,  again,  surprise  to  the  upside  given solid  balance  sheets  and  favorable  sentiment  levels. However,  the  recent  bout  of  financial  volatility  may  induce more  pessimistic  attitudes  among  households  and  lead  to  a  growing  sense  of  caution  from  firms,  forestalling  further capital  expansion  and  slowing  hiring.

Measuredinflationappearstoberunningatorslightlybelowtarget.  Giventheabsenceofslackinmyprojection, I see  inflation  continuing  at  or  very  near  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective  through  2021.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  balanced. Given  high  rates  of  resource  utilization,  we  could  see  a  more pronounced  inflation  response  than  a  linear  Phillips  curve  would  suggest. Also,  additional  tariffs  could  increase the  pressure  on  firms'  costs  and  consumer  prices,  leading  to  higher  inflation  expectations.

However,  to  date,  inflation  has  remained  quiescent  despite  the  strong  profile  of  growth  this  year  and  amid  what appear  to  be  tightening  labor  market  conditions. This  may  be  a  signal  that  inflation  expectations  are  very  well anchored  at  mandate-consistent  levels.  Another  possibility  is  that  alternative  sources  of  slack  that  are  not  a  part of my  baseline  view,  such  as  global  resource  utilization,  are  having  and  will  have  a  greater  impact  on  domestic inflation  than  I  currently  anticipate.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Incoming  data,  especially  the  recent  slide  in  oil  prices  caused  me  to  mark  down  my  inflation forecast.  Otherwise,  my  forecasts  are  little  changed.

Respondent 2: GDP growth  this  year  and  next  is  slightly  weaker  than  in  my  September  projection,  reflecting incoming  data  and  the  effects  of  somewhat  tighter  financial  conditions.

ff baseline ff projection. One  key  government  policy  change  is  an  upward  revision  to  the  terminal  level  of  the  balance  sheet: At  the time  of  September  SEP,  I  had  assumed  that  reserves  would  stabilize  around  $500  billion,  as  in  the  sta assumption.  This  round,  I  have  raised  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  level  of  reserves,  along  the  lines  of  the  upward revision  in  the  sta Other  things  equal,  this  larger  balance  sheet  tends  to  push  up  my  federal  funds rate  path,  helping  to  o ffset  some  of  the  downward  revision  to  the  funds-rate  path  that  the  tightening  in  financial conditions  would  otherwise  suggest.

Respondent 3: While  most  data  since  September  have  been  in  accord  with  my  economic  outlook  at  that time,  there  were  a  few  developments  that  have  led  to  some  changes  in  my  projections.  As  noted  in  my  response  to question  4(a),  weak  housing  data,  tightening  financial  conditions,  dollar  appreciation  and  a  softer  global  growth outlook  have  led  me  to  reduce  modestly  the  real  GDP  growth  projection  for  2019. The  lower  growth  projection also  is  associated  with  a  slightly  higher  unemployment  projection  for  that  year.

ff has  analyzed  these  developments  through  the  lens  of  several In  addition,  the  inflation  data  since  September  were  on  the  softer  side,  which  has  been  a  feature  of  the  U.S. economy  through  most  of  this  expansion. My  sta statistical  models  and  found  that  the  preponderance  of  evidence  points  to  underlying  inflation  running  modestly below  2  percent  through  this  period. Taking  this  on  board,  I  have  lowered  the  profile  of  my  inflation  projections, resulting  in  a  smaller  overshoot  of  inflation  in  2020  -  21  than  I  had  projected  in  September.

Another  consequence  of  my  assessment  of  lower  underlying  inflation  and  weaker  growth  in  2019  is  that  my  path for  the  policy  rate  is  shallower  than  it  was  in  my  September  submission. This  shallower  path  is  necessary  in  my opinion  to  achieve  the  dual  mandate  on  a  sustainable  basis  in  the  current  environment.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Recent  data  for  the  US  and  world  economies  have  led  us  to  decrease  our  projections  for  GDP growth  for  2019  and  2020.

Respondent 6: We  have  slightly  lowered  our  inflation  forecasts  in  response  to  recent  monthly  inflation  readings.

Respondent 7: My forecast  has  changed  little  from  the  previous  projection  with  only  a  slightly  lower  estimate for  growth  and  inflation  in  2019.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I'veloweredmyprojectionsforGDPgrowthinresponsetomyconcernsregardingdeterioration infinancialconditions,deteriorationinglobalgrowthprospects,deterioratingcorporateearningsguidance,andthe rise  in  overall  business  uncertainty.  Political-economy  risks  continue  and  are  contributing  to  elevated  uncertainty which  is  likely  to  spill  over  to  the  real  economy. I've  also  revised  my  near-term  inflation  projections  downward  in response  to  potential  hints  of  weakness  in  our  core  measures  as  well  as  lower  prospective  energy  prices. With  a more  uncertain  and  somewhat  weaker  growth  outlook,  my  funds-rate  path  is  shallower  than  before-25  b.p.  lower in  both  2019  and  2020.  Given  tame  inflation  and  hints  of  an  earlier-than-previously-expected  deceleration  in  real activity,  we  need  to  be  more  patient  in  assessing  the  impact  of  past  rate  increases  and  waning  fiscal  stimulus,  and should  be  disciplined  enough  to  allow  time  for  these  uncertainties  to  resolve  themselves--for  better  or  for  worse.

Respondent 10: I have  revised  down  my  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. The expansionary  fiscal  policy  enacted  late  last  year  in  an  economy  operating  at  or  above  full  capacity  increased upside  risk  to  growth  and  inflation. However,  inflation  has  remained  stable  this  year,  suggesting  this  upside  risk is unlikely  to  materialize. At  the  same  time,  downward  revisions  to  the  global  growth  outlook  this  year  have intensified  disinflationary  pressures. With  these  developments,  I  view  a  more  patient  approach  to  monetary policy  normalization  as  appropriate,  as  it  will  allow  collecting  more  evidence  that  inflation  remains  stable  and unemployment  remains  near  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 11: My  outlook  is  little  changed.  I  have  revised  down  my  outlook  for  the  unemployment  rate  a touch  in  response  to  the  recent  data. I have  also  nudged  down  my  inflation  outlook  in  2018  and  2019,  mostly  on account  of  lower  oil  prices.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: We  believe  that  appropriate  policy  should  aim  for  at  least  a  modest  uptick  in  the  unemployment  rate  by  the  end  of  the  SEP  forecast  horizon,  and  we  set  the  interest  rate  path  accordingly. Because  we  see underlying  economic  growth  as  somewhat  weaker  than  in  our  previous  SEP  submission,  the  path  for  interest  rates that  accomplishes  these  outcomes  is  a  bit  lower  than  it  was  in  our  previous  submission.  Still,  by  late  2021,  the  lower rate  path  does  not  fully  o ffset  weaker  underlying  growth,  and  as  a  result  the  unemployment  rate  ends  the  forecast horizon  a  bit  higher  than  in  our  September  outlook.

Respondent 14: The  U.S.  economy  remains  in  a  healthy  position,  with  output  and  employment  growing above  trend,  the  unemployment  rate  below  estimates  of  its  longer-run  natural  rate,  and  inflation  near  2  percent. Nevertheless,  sentimentabouttheglobaleconomicoutlookhasdeteriorated, uncertaintiesovertradepolicyremain unresolved,  financial  market  volatility  has  increased,  stock  prices  have  fallen,  and  corporate  credit  spreads  have increased. Incoming  data,  including  weak  investment  spending,  have  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for  GDP growth  somewhat  and  to  edge  up  my  path  of  the  unemployment  rate;  there  has  been  little  change  in  my  inflation projection.

With a  somewhat  slower  growth  trajectory  and  somewhat  higher  unemployment  path  compared  to  by  previous SEP  submission,  I  have  revised  down  the  fed  funds  rate  path  associated  with  my  projections. This  reduction  in my  path  also  takes  on  board  the  fact  that  the  labor  market  tightness  we  have  seen  to-date  has  not  translated  into significantly  higher  inflation.

Respondent 15: My forecast is  largely unchanged  since  September thoughIhave loweredslightlymyestimate of  the  longer  run  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 16: A  touch  weaker-than-expected  incoming  data  led  us  to  reduce  our  GDP  growth  forecast  by a  tenth  in  2018  and  2019,  but  the  remainder  of  the  GDP  forecast  is  unchanged.  With  no  change  to  our  estimates  of potentialoutput,ouroutputgapis0.2percentagepointsmallerattheendof2021relativetoSeptember.  Consistent with  this  small  downward adjustment  to  GDP,  we  raised  our  unemployment  rate  projection  by 0.1  percentage  point in  2019-2021.

As  a  consequence  of  the  softer  core  PCE  data,  we  lowered  our  forecast  for  core  inflation  by  0.1  percentage  point in  2018-2020.

Respondent 17: Thereal-sideeconomicdatahavelargelyevolvedinlinewithmypriorexpectations.  However, energy  prices  have  declined  precipitously  and  inflation  has  been,  on  balance,  a  touch  softer  than  I  had  projected for  the  second  half  of  the  year.  In  response,  I  have  lowered  my  inflation  projections  modestly  through  2020.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  my  forecasts for  economic  activity  and inflation  are  a  touch  stronger. I believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  keep  the  labor force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job  growth  on  the  unemployment rate. I believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually  than  in  the  Tealbook. Even with  lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  be  just  barely  above  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: My  set  of projections  is broadly  in  alignment  with  the  Tealbook  forecast. One  notable exception  is  the  anticipated  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

In  both  forecasts,  the  fading  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  slow  real growth  to  near  its  potential  rate  in  2020  and  below  potential  in  2021. The  prolonged  period  of  tight  resource constraints  eventually  results  in  inflation  slightly  overshooting  the  2  percent  objective: This  overshoot  occurs somewhat  earlier  in  my  projection  (2020)  than  it  does  in  the  Tealbook  projection  (2022,  based  on  the  longer-term projection).  The  Tealbook  projects  a  somewhat  larger  and  more  prolonged  undershooting  of  the  unemployment rate  from  its  longer-run  normal  rate,  with  a  trough  of  the  unemployment  rate  at  3.4  percent  in  2019  -  20,  compared to  the  trough  of  3.5  percent  for  those  years  in  my  projection. Although  the  policy  rate  paths  in  both  projections have  shifted  downward  since  September,  my  path  has  shifted  more  than  the  Tealbook  path,  leading  to  a  somewhat wider  discrepancy  between  the  two  paths.

Respondent 4: frb/us  and  EDO  forecast  (sans  judgement)  on  page  92  of  Teal  book  are  in  the  zone  of  reasonableness  to  me.

Respondent 5: For  GDP  growth,  especially  through  2020,  and  inflation,  our  projections  are  similar  to  those in  the  Tealbook.  Differences  arise  with  respect  to  monetary  policy  implications  because  the  Tealbook  projections incorporate  the  idea  of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set appropriately  as  the  economy  transitions  to  the  longer-run  steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping policy  rate  path.  Our  regime  conception,  in  contrast,  views  monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current regimeisviewedaspersistent.  Weacknowledgethattheeconomymayvisitotherregimesinthefuture,butswitches to  these  regimes  are  difficult  to  forecast.  This  suggest  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook. Before  returning  to  its  longer-run  value  of  4.6  percent,  the  Tealbook  also  has a substantial  undershooting  of  the  unemployment,  far  more  than  our  undershooting. The  Tealbook  also  has  an undershooting  of  GDP  growth  in  2021  that  we  do  not  project.

Respondent 6: As  usual,  the  Tealbook  path  for  the  funds  rate  seems  implausible,  given  the  paths  for  output, employment,  and  inflation.  Otherwise,  our  forecasts  are  similar.

Respondent 7: The  two  projections  are  largely  in  alignment,  with  the  exception  of  the  anticipated  path  for the  federal  funds  rate.

In  both,  the  waning  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation slow  growth  closer  to  potential  by  2020. Still, in my  projection,  the  unemployment  rate  bottoms  out  at  3.4 percent  by  the  end  of  2019  and  then  begins  to  increase  in  late  2020. By  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects  that  the unemployment  rate  remains  at  3.4  percent  until  the  third  quarter  of  2021. The  persistent  overshooting  of  full employment  results-in  my  forecast-in  inflation  slightly  above  2-percent  for  several  years.  My  projection  for  the funds  rate  path  shows  a  more  gradual  rise  that  tops  out  to  a  much  lower  level  relative  to  the  funds  rate  path  in  the Tealbook.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Relative  to  the  Tealbook  baseline,  my  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment rate  are  slightly  tilted  toward  the  FRB/US  model  forecasts.  Contributing  factors  are  my  belief  that  the  stimulus  to growth  from  fiscal  policy  will  fade  faster  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook  baseline,  and  the  relatively  greater  weight that  I  attach  to  the  impact  of  global  growth  decelerating,  corporate  profit  growth  decelerating,  trade  tensions  impacting  companies  fairly  extensively,  widespread  commodity  price  weakness  potentially  foreshadowing  economic slowing, yield curve flattening, corporate credit spreads widening, andanoverallriseinbusinessuncertainty.  Many of  these  uncertainties  haven't  yet  shown  up  in  the  hard  economic  data: Waiting  for  these  issues  to  translate  into concrete  evidence  of  slowing  may  put  the  Fed  well  behind  the  curve  and  reduce  our  operating  flexibility. We  are now  in  a  late-cycle  economy,  and  that  fact  should  be  reflected  in  our  risk-management  calculus.

Respondent 10: My  assumptions  and  projections  for  real  GDP  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  are similar  to  those  in  Tealbook.  My  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  lower  than  in  Tealbook.

ff outlook. Respondent 11: I have  a  stronger  outlook  for  potential  growth  than  the  Tealbook. Consequently,  I  believe that  the  economy  can  grow  faster  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook  without  much  additional  upward  impetus  to  price inflation. My  more  optimistic  outlook  for  potential  growth  is  consistent  with  a  slightly  higher  long-run  neutral interest  rate  compared  to  that  in  the  Sta

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Real  outcomes  are  qualitatively  similar  in  the  two  forecasts.  We  expect  inflation  to  increase somewhat  more  meaningfully  above  2  percent  than  the  Tealbook  in  large  part  because  long-run  inflation  expectations  in  our  model  are  anchored  at  2.0  percent  rather  than  1.8  percent.  In  both  forecasts  monetary  policy  needs  to tighten  noticeably  more  than  what  financial  markets  are  currently  expecting  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  start moving  up  toward  its  equilibrium  level.  However,  the  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  the  Tealbook  is  noticeably higher  than  in  our  forecast-a  difference  that  is  due,  at  least  in  part,  to  the  Tealbook's  more  favorable  assessment of  the  underlying  strength  in  the  economy. Our  outlook  also  takes  some  signal  from  the  empirical  evidence  suggesting  that  monetary  policy  tightening  has  a  larger  effect  on  economic  activity  than  monetary  easing  of  the  same magnitude.

Respondent 14: As  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  I  expect  that  over  the  forecast  horizon  growth  will  slow  from  an above-trend  pace  to  trend,  labor  market  conditions  will  remain  strong,  and  underlying  inflation  will  remain  near our  2  percent  goal.  Although  the  outcomes  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  are  similar  to  those  in  my  forecast,  to  achieve these  outcomes,  the  Tealbook's  policy  path  is  steeper  throughout  the  forecast  horizon  than  my  path. By  the  end of  the  forecast  horizon,  the  Tealbook's  fed  funds  rate  projection  is  about  125  basis  points  steeper  than  mine.  Thus, the  Tealbook  sees  a  stronger  underlying  economy  that  needs  to  be  tempered  by  more  restrictive  monetary  policy and/or  different  inflation  dynamics  compared  with  my  projection.

Respondent 15: My  anticipated  path  for  the  funds  rate  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  is  significantly lower  than  the  Tealbook  baseline.

Respondent 16: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  forecast  period, ending  2021  in  the  3  to  3 1 / 4 percent  range. We  assess  the  long-run  neutral  funds  rate  to  be  2.75  percent,  a  bit higher  than  the  Tealbook,  and  therefore  do  not  overshoot  the  long-run  neutral  fed  funds  rate  by  nearly  as  much.  In contrast  to  the  Tealbook,  we  assume  the  recent  financial  market  developments  are  a  slight  negative  for  the  forecast. Over  the  2018-2020  period,  we  assume  roughly  the  same  average  impulses  from  tax  cuts  and  government  spending as  the  Tealbook;  however,  we  assume  fiscal  policy  will  be  a  slight  negative  for  growth  in  2021.  Our  view  of  potential output  growth  through  2021  is  somewhat  stronger  than  the  Tealbook's,  largely  reflecting  more  BFI  and  capital deepening.

Our  projection  for  actual  GDP  growth  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  projection  period.  Given our  stronger  potential,  in  2020  and  2021  our  output  gap  is  about  1  percentage  point  smaller.  Our  projection  for  the unemployment  rate  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook's  in  2018  and  2019,  but  we  expect  the  rate  to  begin  to  rise  in  2020, a  bit  sooner  than  the  Tealbook. Combined  with  a  lower  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  (4.3  percent),  this  leaves  our unemployment  rate  gap  at  the  end  of  2021  at  about  0.5  percentage  point,  half  the  estimate  in  the  Tealbook.

Our  forecast  for  core  inflation  is  0.1  and  0.2  percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook  in  2020  and  2021, respectively.  Our  boost  from  resource  pressure  is  a  not  quite  as  large,  but  we  condition  on  a  more  accommodative monetary  policy  path,  which  should  lift  underlying  inflation  trends  and  expectations  more  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 17: My  projection  and  that  of  the  Tealbook  share  a  qualitatively  (if  not  quantitatively)  similar arc. That  said,  my  projection  has  slightly  slower  growth  over  the  next  two  years  relative  to  the  Tealbook  baseline owinglargelytothemodestlysmallerimpactfromtaxreformonoverallgrowththatIamexpecting.  Thedivergence between  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  and  the  projection  marked  into  the  Tealbook  is  due  to  differences  in our  employment  growth  projections  over  the  next  several  years.
