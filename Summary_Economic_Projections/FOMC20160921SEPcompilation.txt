Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for the federal funds  rate are the value of the midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or the projected  appropriate  target  level  for the federal funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  June  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on June  14-15,  2016. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  June  14-15,  2016,  meeting. For  the  September  20-21,  2016,  meeting,  one  participant did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: We  now  view  the  current  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  as  providing  a  good  indication  of the  amount  of  slack  in  the  economy,  and  we  expect  the  activity  gap  to  fully  close  in  the  first  half  of  next  year. Convergence  to  the  inflation  target  is  expected  to  occur  in  2018.

Respondent 2: I  anticipate  that  it  will  take  at  least  six  years,  and  maybe  longer,  for  the  economy  to  achieve  full convergence  because  the  real  neutral  federal  funds  rate  -  which  I  estimate  is  currently  around  zero  -  will  probably still  be  considerably  below  its  longer-run  value  in  2019.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: There  is  an  increasingly  strong  case  for  the  proposition  that  monetary  policy  alone  will  have difficulty  getting  PCE  inflation  to  the  2  percent  target  on  a  sustainable  basis. Something  external-  such  as  a significant  fiscal  boost  -  may  well  be  needed. However,  since  I  think  there  is  a  reasonable  chance  that  something of  this  sort  will  happen,  over  the  next  five  or  six  years,  I  do  not  take  the  position  here  that  a  longer  convergence process  will  be  required.

Respondent 5: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  five  years.

Respondent 6: As  is  typical  following  the  annual  revisions  to  the  GDP  and  productivity  data,  we  reviewed our  assumptions  for  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment.  Our  assessment  was that  there  was  no  compelling  reason  to  change  those  assumptions  this  year.

Theunemploymentratecurrentlyisjustaboveitslonger-runnormallevel, andweprojectthatitwillfallslightly below  that  level  in  2017  -  18  before  returning  to  it  in  2019. However,  our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate  that  there  is  appreciable  probability  of the  unemployment  rate  falling  more  substantially  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  during  the  projection  period.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the FOMC  longer-run  objective.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  resource  gap  anticipated  to  dissipate  over  the forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  (on  a  quarterly  basis)  to  be  2%  by  2018.

As  indicated  in  our  projections,  we  anticipate  that  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  no  further  shocks, the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  2018.  Accordingly,  the  projections  of  the  major  economic variables  for  2019  are  at  their  longer-run  values.

Respondent 9: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11: We  believe  convergence  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  its  long-run  level  is  likely  to  take  3  to  4 years.

Respondent 12: Labor-force  participation  is  now  near  its  demographic  trend,  and  the  unemployment  rate is roughly  at  its  longer-run  sustainable  level. The  economy  appears  to  be  on  a  track  that  will  push  it  past  full employment. With  the  labor  market  tight  and  the  restraining  effects  of  oil-price  declines  and  a  stronger  dollar waning,  I  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  longer-run  objective  over  the  next  1-to-1 1 / 2 years.  In  the  absence of  new  shocks,  the  unemployment  rate  eventually  converges  to  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  from  below. Full convergence  might  take  5  years.

Respondent 13: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  or  exceeded  by  2018.  However,  it  will  take  an  additional year  to  work  through  the  secondary  dynamics  and  achieve  complete  convergence  to  our  longer-run  projections.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of 2.0%,  unemployment  of  4.7%,  and  inflation  of  2.0%.  Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot provide  a  single  set  of  longer-run  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  for  these variables  based  on  multiple  possible  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading.  We  do  provide  a  2.0%  longer-run  inflation projection,  which  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 16: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  takes  less  than  5 years. Specifically,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  be  at  its  longer-run  rate  and  inflation  to  be  at  2  percent  in  the period  from  2017  to  2019.  The  unemployment  rate  has  reached  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level,  and  I  expect  it will  fall  below  its  longer-run  level  in  the  period  from  2016  to  2019,  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 17: With  real  GDP  growth  expected  to  be  around  2  percent  this  year  and  employment  growth likely  to  slow  as  labor  markets  tighten,  we  are  only  about  a  year  away  from  steady  state  growth  of  around  1  3/4 percent.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during  the Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

The  widths  of  these  intervals  are  somewhat  narrower  than  in  our  June  SEP  submission. The  probability intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  remain  modestly  wider  than  the  SEP  standard.  Although  global  risks  have dissipated  to  some  extent,  we  still  see  them  as  quite  significant,  which  are  reflected  in  financial  market  volatility of the past  week. The  forecast  intervals  for  core  PCE  inflation  still  appear  broadly  consistent  with  the  SEP standard,  taking  rough  account  of  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core PCE  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: DevelopmentssincetheJunemeetinghaveeasedmyconcernsaboutboththeMaylabormarket report  and  (despite  the  Brexit  vote)  the  potential  for  global  economic  and  financial  conditions  to  deteriorate.  For this  reason,  I  view  the  risks  to  my  near-term  projection  as  broadly  balanced. In  contrast,  I  view  the  risks  to  real activity  and  inflation  beyond  the  near  term  as  weighted  to  the  downside,  primarily  because  I  anticipate  that  the federal  funds  rate  will  remain  exceptionally  low  for  the  next  few  years,  which  will  markedly  lessen  our  ability  to deal  with  recession  should  one  occur.

Respondent 3: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  effective  lower  bound limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. The  downward  drift  of  inflation  expectations presents  an  additional  downside  risk  for  inflation. For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a  countervailing  risk  that it  will  continue  to  fall  more  rapidly  than  expected  for  a  given  path  for  output,  as  it  has  over  the  past  several  years; therefore  I  see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: I am  anticipating  a  continued  decline  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate,  though  there  is uncertainty  surrounding  the  path  and  the  implied  growth  of  the  labor  force.  I  see  a  risk  that  the  unemployment  rate falls  further  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  average. Inflation  has  continued  to  run  below  the  Committee's target  for  some  time,  despite  significant  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 6: Quantitativejudgmentbasedonthedifferencebetweenthecentralprojectionandtheexpected value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. There  has  been  some  reduction  since  June  in  our  assessment  of downside  risks  as  much  of  the  incoming  data  were  consistent  with  the  central  forecast,  at  least  until  recently. Nevertheless,  the  future  output  implications  of  the  softness  in  business  fixed  investment,  the  low  levels  of  advanced foreign  economy  sovereign  yields,  and  a  soft  foreign  economic  outlook  pose  some  downside  risks. Overall,  we  see the  risks  as  roughly  balanced  over  the  near  term,  and  modestly  to  the  downside  at  longer  horizons,  in  part  reflecting the  constraints  on  policy  to  react  to  negative  shocks.

Inflation  risks  are  nearly  balanced  for  2016  -  17  and  slightly  skewed  to  the  downside  for  2018  -  19;  we  assess that  they  are  overall  roughly  balanced  as  we  did  in  June. Core  measures  of  inflation  have  been  stable  as  we  had anticipated  and  we  project  convergence  to  objective  similar  to  the  June  projections,  which  is  consistent  with  little change  in  inflation  risks. However,  low  levels  of  market-based  longer-term  inflation  compensation  and  survey measures  of  longer-term  household  inflation  expectations  suggest  significant  downside  risks  persist.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

Financial  market  volatility  related  to  the  June  23  'Brexit'  vote  subsided  rapidly. The  Chinese  economy continues  to  rebalance,  which  will  be  a  lengthy  process. Monetary  policy  in  many  countries  is  likely  to  remain highly  accommodative  in  the  near  to  medium  run,  which  will  continue  to  support  the  outlook  for  growth  and inflation.

The  slowdown  in  payroll  growth  in  May  was  reversed  in  subsequent  months  and  a  variety  of  recent  indicators paint  a  very  solid  picture  of  the  labor  market.  With  the  economy  at  or  near  full  employment,  we  should  expect  to see  payroll  growth  slow  from  the  pace  seen  earlier  in  the  year.

Inflation  risks  are  balanced.  The  downward  pressure  on  inflation  coming  from  energy  prices  is  subsiding,  as  oil prices  have  settled  in  the  $40-$50  range  for  much  of  this  year.  The  dollar  has  also  shown  signs  of  stabilizing,  which will  reduce  the  downward  pressure  on  inflation  from  imported  goods  prices;  indeed,  deflation  in  nonpetroleum import  prices  has  subsided  since  late  last  year. There  have  been  small  downward  movements  in  some  of  the survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations,  which  I  continue  to  watch,  but  my  overall  assessment  is  that  inflation expectations  have  been  relatively  stable. Should  inflation  expectations  show  a  more  significant  downward  move, this  would  pose  a  downside  risk  to  my  inflation  projection.  On  the  other  hand,  too  slow  a  withdrawal  of  monetary policyaccommodationandcontinueddeclinesinunemploymenthavethepotentialtocreateupsideriskstoinflation over  the  medium  run.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far.  I  expect  them  to  remain so  if  we  gradually  normalize  interest  rates.  However,  a  failure  to  do  so  increases  these  risks.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Our  growth  forecast  is  driven  by  solid  household  sector  spending, which,  in  turn,  is  propelled importantlybyfurtherlabormarketgains.  However,ourbusinesscontactsappearverycautiousandquiteattentive to  any  bad  news  they  hear.  Accordingly,  it  is  much  easier  to  envision  shocks  that  would  result  in  businesses  delaying hiring  or  capital  expenditures  than  it  is  to  identify  developments  that  would  cause  them  to  spend  more  robustly than  in  our  projection.  In  sum,  we  see  the  balance  of  risks  to  the  GDP  forecast  as  tilted  to  the  downside  and  those to  the  unemployment  rate  projection  as  tilted  to  the  upside.

The  incoming  wage  and  price  data  have  been  roughly  in  line  with  our  expectations,  and  are  consistent  with  a slowreturntotargetinflation.  However, thedownsiderisktoourprojectionforrealactivityimpartssomedownside risk  to  the  inflation  outlook. More  importantly,  financial  market  inflation  compensation  and  household  inflation expectations  remain  persistently  low. This  highlights  the  risk  that  longer-run  inflation  expectations  may  have slipped  below  2  percent;  at  a  minimum,  it  points  to  fragility  in  inflation  expectations. Furthermore,  our  forecast assumes  a  flat  dollar  over  the  projection  period,  and  we  see  a  risk  that  it  will  instead  appreciate  due  to  differential monetary  policies.  We  do  not  see  major  o ffsetting  upside  risks  to  prices.  As  a  result,  we  feel  the  risks  to  our  inflation forecast  remain  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 12: I show  a  balanced  risk  weighting  on  real  growth  and  inflation. I'm  comfortable  with  a balanced  risk  weighting  given  that  my  projections  have  been  on  the  conservative  side  of  the  professional  consensus.

Respondent 13: Risks  to economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. We  have  essentially  reached  our objective  of  maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  likely overshoot  full  employment  over  the  next  few  years. The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long. Consumer  spending  is  on  track  for  solid  growth  this  year,  bolstered  by  a  stronger  labor  market.  Fiscal  policy  is  set to  be  accommodative  in  the  near  term.

Uncertainty  about  growth  in  foreign  economies  appears  to  have  subsided  somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  some risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  remain.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced  around  an  inflation  path  that  is  slightly  lower  than  in  June. A  tightening  of resource  utilization  supports  the  continued  movement  of  inflation  towards  2  percent. Disinflationary  pressures from  abroad-namely  previous  strengthening  of  the  dollar  and  declines  in  oil  prices-are  still  present  but  dissipating.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  growth  regime  is  low. A  higher  productivity  growth regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Such  a  possible  switch,  however,  leads  us to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  near  the  low  for  an  economic  expansion. If a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially.  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon. However,  such  a  possibility  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  a  higher unemployment  rate.

ForcorePCEinflation,weplacenegligibleweightontheprospectsofPhillipsCurveeffects.  Thereis,however,a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  that  inflation  moves  higher.  It  is  also  possible  that  inflation expectations,  which  are  currently  low,  could  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation.  In  addition,  much  depends  on  the  behavior and  energy  and  other  commodity  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Appropriatepolicyrequiresa resumption oftheprocessofgradualnormalizationofthefederal funds  rate.  With  the  economy  already  near  full  employment,  increasing  the  federal  funds  rate  sooner  rather  than later  reduces  the  risk  of  overshooting  full  employment  by  a  larger  amount  than  what  is  already  embedded  in  the forecast. While  the  inflation  costs  of  overshooting  full  employment  are  likely  small,  it  has  proven  difficult  in  the past  to  slow  the  economy  to  a  sustainable  rate  without  going  too  far  and  causing  a  recession. As  a  result,  failure to  continue  on  the  path  of  gradual  removal  of  accommodation  could  shorten,  rather  than  lengthen,  the  duration  of this  recovery.

Respondent 2: Three  considerations  influence  my  forecast  for  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary  policy.  First, the  neutral  real  funds  rate  appears  to  be  close  to  zero  currently  and  I  anticipate  that  it  will  change  little  over  the next  two  or  three  years.  Second,  monetary  policy  needs  to  remain  somewhat  accommodative  for  a  while  longer  in order  to  produce  a  moderately  tight  labor  market,  thereby  speeding  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation  and  possibly pulling  more  people  back  into  the  labor  force. Lastly,  in  an  uncertain  environment  it  is  appropriate  to  proceed cautiously  and  gradually  in  removing  accommodation  because  the  ZLB  limits  our  ability  to  ease  in  the  event  we are  hit  with  adverse  shocks.

Respondent 3: The  labor  market,  as  measured  by  the  unemployment  rate,  is  essentially  back  to  normal.  But secondary  measures  of  slack,  such  as  the  fraction  of  the  labor  force  working  part  time  for  economic  reasons,  remain elevated,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued.  As  long  as  the  unemployment  rate  stays  at  or  above  its  long  run  level, it will  not  be  appropriate  to  raise  interest  rates  without  a  sustained  increase  in  core  inflation. In  other  words,  job increases  that  do  not  lead  to  a  drop  in  the  unemployment  rate  or  an  increase  in  price  inflation  are  not  sufficient  to raise  interest  rates.

Respondent 4: One  of  the  many  infirmities  of  the  SEP  is  particularly  apparent  in  the  current  circumstances. Given  that  we  have  only  a  couple  of  meetings  left  this  year,  a  target  federal  funds  rate  in  the  above  box  that  is higher  than  0.38  is  too  readily  translated  into  an  indication  that  the  participant  is  projecting  an  increase  at  the very  next  meeting  or  two.  But  leaving  the  projection  at  0.38  strongly  suggests  the  opposite,  While,  in  theory,  this projection  is  tied  to  the  participant's  expectations  with  respect  to  GDP  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation,  in fact  the  publicly  reported  version  of  the  SEP  does  not  allow  anyone  outside  the  Fed  to  see  that,  for  example,  an expectation  of  no  increase  is  tied  to  a  slippage  in  one's  expectations  for  the  economy. While  my  projection  in  the box  above  remains  unchanged  from  current  levels,  I  want  to  be  clear  -  internally,  at  least  -  that  it  is  premised  on my  expectation  of  just  a  modest  slippage  in  economic  performance.  Should  that  not  prove  to  be  the  case,  I  would of  course  reassess  the  appropriate  monetary  policy  action.

At  least  so  long  as  growth  remains  no  better  than  slightly  above  trend  and  inflation  is  not  fairly  convincingly moving  toward  2%,  a  key  consideration  in  determining  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary  policy  remains  the  asymmetric  nature  of  the  Committee's  range  of  policy  instruments.  The  nearly  certain  need  for  resort  to  unconventional policy  instruments  in  the  event  that  an  adverse  shock  were  to  threaten  the  continued  moderate  expansion  -  or in  the  even  growth  significantly  decelerates  even  in  the  absence  of  such  a  shock  -  argues  strongly  for  maintaining current  levels  of  accommodation  so  as  to  increase,  even  if  only  marginally,  the  economy's  resilience  to  such  a  shock. With  an  external  environment  that  is  still  somewhat  disinflationary,  with  continued  sluggish  growth  abroad,  with even  more  accommodative  monetary  policies  like  in  most  other  mature  economies,  and  with  the  resulting  risk  of another  period  of  dollar  strengthening  as  rates  in  the  U.S.  rise,  considerable  caution  is  warranted.

Another  key  factor  informing  my  judgment  is  the  increasing  strength  of  the  hypothesis  that  secular  stagnation, or  a  phenomenon  sharing  some  of  the  same  characteristics  as  classic  secular  stagnation,  is  a ffecting  U.S.  economic performance.

ff scenarios  given  low  productivity  growth,  declining  labor  force  participation,  and  inflation  that  has Respondent 5: In  response  to  elevated  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal,  regulatory,  and  trade  policy  I  have pushed  the  next  tightening  of  policy  from  this  meeting  to  the  end  of  2016.  My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path for  the  federal  funds  rate  reflects  my  view  that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than  has  been  typical in  past  lifto been  running  below  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 6: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The pace  of  normalization  also  will  depend  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

Our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2016,  2017,  2018,  and 2019  at 1 / 2 -3 / %,  1  - 1 4 1 / %,  1 4 3 / 4 - 2%,  and  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / %  respectively;  the  projected  ranges  for  2016  -  2018  are 2 each  25bps  below  the  corresponding  ranges  in  our  June  submission. In  light  of  the  still  significant  uncertainty surrounding  the  outlook,  in  part  reflecting  the  negative  forecast  errors  for  GDP  growth  in  recent  quarters,  and  a low  projected  path  of  the  short-term  neutral  rate  (r*),we  believe  this  downward  adjustment  of  the  policy  path  is necessary  to  support  our  modal  economic  projections  as  well  as  to  provide  some  additional  insurance  against  the restraining  forces  on  the  U.S.  economy.  Furthermore,  risk-management  considerations  point  to  smaller  costs  from a  too-gradual  path  of  removing  accommodation  than  the  costs  from  a  too-rapid  removal.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  real short-term  interest  rate  over  the  longer  run,  which  we  now  judge  to  be  in  the  range  of  0  -  2%. This  range  is  50 bps  below  our  estimated  range  in  June  and  is  consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety  of  models. Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2  -  4%. Our  modal  projection  is  in  the  lower  half  of  this  range  due  to  the  combination  of  subdued  productivity  growth, low  longer-term  sovereign  yields,  continued indications  of  a global'saving glut,'and demographic factors.  These considerations  lead  to  our  point  estimate  of  2 1 / %  in  the  response  to  question  3(a). 2

We  assume  that  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the effective  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible.  Based  on  our modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  sometime  in  2018.

Respondent 7: The  low  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  been  necessary  to  move  inflation  and  unemployment back  toward  our  targets.  This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low  rate  of  productivity  growth and  other  factors.  Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring  a  low  federal  funds  rate  in  order  to deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 8: The  neutral  rate  is  currently  very  low,  and  I  expect  it  to  rise  only  gradually  to  a  longer-run level  that  is  also  quite  low  by  historical  standards. In  addition,  downside  risks  to  activity  and  inflation  make  the appropriate  policy  path  lower  over  the  medium  term  than  it  would  be  if  risks  were  balanced.

Inresponsetocontinued extremely weakreadings onproductivitygrowthinrecentyears, Iloweredmyestimate of  the  longer-run  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points.

Respondent 9: The  trajectory  of  my  forecast  is  similar  to  my  June  forecast  but  I  have  revised  down  my estimate  of  the  longer  run  fed  funds  rate  from  3.25  to  3  percent  so  my  monetary  policy  path  is  somewhat  flatter than  in  June.

I project  that  growth  will  be  slightly  above  my  estimate  of  the  longer  run  trend.  From  the  standpoint  of  what monetary  policy  can  do,  I  believe  that  the  economy  is  basically  at  our  goal  of  full  employment. I expect  the  pace of further  gains  in  employment  and  unemployment  to  slow. In  this  scenario,  labor  compensation  measures  will firm,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  a  variety  of data  showing  that  wage  and  compensation  gains  have  picked  up. However,  these  gains  will  likely  be  slower  than in past  expansions  reflecting  slower  growth  in  productivity. Reasonably  stable  inflation  expectations  coupled with  continued  improvement  in  labor  markets  and  ongoing  economic  growth  make  me  reasonably  confident  that inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  next  couple  of  years.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Given  the  outlook,  I  believe  it  will  be appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  move  rates  up  gradually  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  with  the  federal  funds  rate at  the  end  of  2019  at  its  longer-run  level,  which  I  now  estimate  to  be  3.00  percent.  Forestalling  rate  increases  for  too long  increases  the  risks  to  financial  stability  and  has  the  potential  to  require  sharper  rate  increases  in  the  future, which  poses  it  own  risks  to  the  outlook.

Respondent 10: In  my  forecast  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  below  its  long  run  level  through  2019,  and inflation  will  reach  2.0%  in  2018.  The  fed  funds  rate  will  reach  its  longer  run  level  of  2.5%  in  2019.

Respondent 11: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  25  bps  once  in  2016,  twice in  2017  and  4  times  in  2018  before  getting  to  its  long-run  neutral  rate  of  3%  in  2019.  We  also  assume  the  Committee strongly  communicates  that  future  rate  hikes  will  depend  on  increasing  confidence  in  achieving  its  employment and  inflation  objectives.

The  weak  first-half  GDP  data  and  some  weak  August  indicators  are  reminders  that  the  economy  still  faces substantial  headwinds  and  that  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  is  still  quite  low. The  current  level  of  the  funds rate  likely  is providing  only  a  modest  amount  of  accommodation. We  assume,  however,  that  communication of a state-dependent  path  for  future  rates,  and  the  likely  shallow  nature  of  this  path,  can  deliver  the  degree  of accommodation  necessary  to  achieve  our  baseline  projections  for  output  and  inflation. In  addition,  we  assume policy  communication  will  indicate  that  we  are  aiming  to  achieve  our  inflation  target  symmetrically,  a  strategy which,bydefinition,callsforapolicypaththatallowsforasignificantprobabilityofmodestlyovershooting2percent inflation.  Furthermore,  risk  management  considerations  continue  to  argue  in  favor  of  low  rates  in  order  to  provide an  extra  boost  to  aggregate  demand  as  a  bu ffer  against  future  downside  shocks  to  activity  and  the  asymmetric  risks we  see  to  the  inflation  forecast.  Indeed,  the  continued  low  readings  on  financial  market  inflation  compensation  and survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations,  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  further  dollar  strengthening,  suggest  that we  should  be  putting  meaningful  weight  on  inflation  risks.

Respondent 12: Weak  longer-term  growth  prospects  have  combined  with  an  expanded  world-wide  demand for  safe  assets  and  a  weak  and  uncertain  economic  and  political  outlook  abroad  to  put  downward  pressure  on  the neutral  real  federal  funds  rate. The  implication  is  that  monetary  policy  is  substantially  less  accommodative  at current  settings  than  might  have  been  expected.  The  global  demand  for  safe  assets  is  likely  to  remain  elevated  for quite  a  while.

Moreover,  global  financial  integration  means  that  financial-market  conditions  are  likely  to  be  quite  sensitive  to increases  in  the  level  of  U.S.  real  short-term  rates  relative  to  foreign  rates.  As  long  as  the  foreign  economic  outlook remains  subdued,  a  shallow  path  for  U.S.  rates  is  likely  to  be  appropriate.

A  lower  and  flatter  policy  path  keeps  us  closer  to  the  zero  bound  for  longer.  Downside  risks  to  the  outlook  may, therefore,  be  somewhat  larger  than  usual.

ff andbyresearcherselsewherearoundtheFederalReserveSystemhaveconvinced Analysesconductedbymysta me  that  sluggish  productivity  growth  and  aging  demographics  have  had  a  larger  effect  on  U.S.  growth  prospects and  the  longer-run  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  than  I  previously  believed.  Accordingly,  I've  marked  my  estimate of  the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  downward  by  25  basis  points,  from  3.0  to  2.75  percent.

Respondent 13: The  labor  market  is  essentially  at  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  of  slack. Labor  markets  will  continue  to  tighten  over  the  next  year-with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  its  natural rate-before  gradually  returning  to  full  employment.  On  inflation,  despite  some  transitory  factors  a ffecting  recent data,  I  expect  inflation  to  rise  gradually  and  reach  our  2  percent  objective  in  2018. Underpinning  this  path  is  my

view  that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run  slightly  above  its  potential. Overshooting  in employment  and  output,  paired  with  fading  effects  from  the  dollar  appreciation  and  a  drop  in  oil  prices  will  push inflation  up  over  the  next  year.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  is  based on  the  following:  The  economy  continues  to  face  headwinds  in  2016,  including  weak  growth  abroad,  and  lingering effects  of  the  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar. In addition,  I  have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  long-term equilibrium  real  interest  rate,  incorporating  the  lessons  from  recent  research  on  this  topic.

Respondent 14: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate,  similar  to  that  used  in  the  current  Tealbook. I lowered  my  federal funds  rate  path  taking  into  account  a  25  basis  point  reduction  in  the  long-run  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  and a  judgment  that  short-term  r*  will  more  gradually  rise  toward  its  longer-run  value. My  judgment  is  informed  by recent  movements  in  long-term  real  yields  and  projections  that  suggest  a  more  muted  path  for  equilibrium  rates than  I'd  assumed  in  June.

Respondent 15: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.

Respondent 16: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  to  be  at  two  percent  in  2017.  Yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2017. In  my  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate promotes  economic  and  financial  stability.

I revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate,  to  3.00  percent  from  3.75  percent. I now view  the  factors  weighing  on  the  equilibrium  real  federal  funds  rate  as  longer  term  in  nature,  rather  than  being temporary  headwinds.  In  particular,  the  reluctance  of  firms  to  invest.

Respondent 17: It  would  be  unacceptably  risky  to  leave  the  real  funds  rate  below  zero  with  real  activity  likely to  grow  faster  than  trend,  the  labor  market  at  full  employment,  and  core  inflation  reasonably  close  to  our  2  percent objective.  I  also  believe  that  we  should  begin  reducing  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  in  the  near  future.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Recent  data  appear  consistent  with  a  solid  rebound  in  economic  activity  in  the  second  half  of this  year. The  rebound  is  driven  by  private  consumption  expenditures,  which  are  supported  by  noticeable  gains in  household  income  and  a  high  level  of  household  net  worth. A  buildup  in  inventories  after  the  sharp  drawdown in the  first half  of the  year  is  also  expected  to  contribute  to  the  pickup  in  economic  activity  in  the  near  term. Business  investment  has  been  disappointing,  but  the  recent  decline  in  corporate  bond  spreads  should  support modest  additions  to  capital  going  forward. Investment  should  also  benefit  from  the  retrenchment  in  drilling  and mining  activity  having  run  most  of  its  course. In all, while  not  all  of  the  components  of  demand  are  showing strength,  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  is  likely  to  be  at  least  one  percent  above  current estimates  of  potential  GDP  growth.  Such  a  pace  of  growth  is  consistent  with  continued  improvements  in  the  labor market.

Beyond  the  near  term,  with  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  remaining  accommodative,  we  continue  to  project growthslightlyabovepotentialovertheforecasthorizon.  Thispaceofgrowthshouldgeneratefurtherdeclinesinthe unemployment  rate.  In  our  baseline  forecast,  the  cyclical  improvement  in  labor  force  participation,  coupled  with  a gradualremovalofpolicyaccommodation, generatesomeovershootingoffullemployment, withtheunemployment ratereaching4.2percentbytheendof2019.  Still,thepossibilitythattheunemploymentratewillultimatelydecline by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning  is  of  particular  concern. Past  experience  suggests  that  the  more the  economy  overshoots  full  employment,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  the  economy  will  fall  into  a  recession  as monetary  policy  tightens. While  monetary  policy  should  probe  for  better  labor  market  outcomes,  the  potential costs  of  this  strategy  should  not  be  ignored. These  costs  include  the  risk  of  growing  imbalances  in  some  asset classes,  which  would  then  lead  to  conditions  that  require  an  even  more  rapid  increase  in  interest  rates  and  a  more pronounced  rise  in  unemployment. For  these  reasons,  our  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  balances  the need  for  probing  cautiously  with  the  risk  of  overheating  the  economy.  This  projected  path  requires  rates  to  increase sooner  rather  later,  given  the  lags  with  which  monetary  policy  operates  and  the  fact  that  the  economy  is  already near  our  estimate  of  full  capacity. With  the  unemployment  rate  projected  to  fall  below  its  natural  level,  inflation is  expected  to  reach  and  then  rise  marginally  above  target  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon.

We  view  the  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. Downside  risks  emanating  from  abroad  are still present. The  expected  tightening  of  U.S.  monetary  policy  could  also  entail  a  stronger  dollar  than  what  we are  currently  envisioning. On  the  upside,  the  increase  in  the  pace  of  growth  of  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers could  signal  a  stronger-than-expected  acceleration  in  activity.  On  the  inflation  side,  while  we  continue  to  see  risks associated  with  the  possibility  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below  the  2  percent target,  we  take  the  recent  progress  towards  the  inflation  target  as  signaling  that  the  risks  around  the  inflation outlook  are  becoming  more  balanced.

Respondent 2: My  forecast  is  conditioned  on  two  key  assumptions. First,  the  forces  currently  restraining economic  growth  -  including  slow  productivity  growth,  an  elevated  exchange  rate,  weak  foreign  growth,  and restrictive  mortgage  credit  -  will  abate  very  slowly  over  time,  thereby  causing  the  real  neutral  funds  rate  to  remain persistently  low. Second,  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years  will  rise  at  a  pace  sufficiently  gradual to  narrow  but  not  completely  close  the  gap  between  the  real  funds  rate  and  the  real  neutral  rate. Under  these conditions,  real  GDP  growth  outpaces  potential  (particularly  in  2017)  by  enough  to  bring  the  unemployment rate  down  to  4.5  percent  in  2018  and  2019  -  two  tenths  of  a  percentage  point  below  its  longer-run  level. In  this moderately  tight  labor  market  environment,  inflation  moves  up  to  2  percent  by  2019  under  the  assumption  that inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  about  2  percent,  and  that  oil  prices  and  the  exchange  rate  remain  roughly unchanged  at  their  current  levels.

A  key  risk  to  this  forecast  is  that  inflation  expectations  are  not  anchored  at  2  percent;  alternatively  put,  low readings  on  inflation  compensation  and  the  Michigan  survey  could  indicate  that  the  underlying  trend  in  inflation is  lower  than  2  percent.  If  so,  then  bringing  inflation  back  to  2  percent  would  require  an  even  flatter  trajectory  for the  federal  funds  rate,  both  to  generate  tighter  labor  markets  conditions  and  to  bolster  inflation  expectations  by demonstrating  the  FOMC's  commitment  to  its  inflation  goal.

Respondent 3: Secondary  measures  of  labor  market  slack  continue  to  suggest  that  further  reductions  in  slack are  possible. In addition,  inflation  continues  to  run  low  and  it  is  likely  to  be  several  years  before  it  returns  to target. The  continued  low  level  of  inflation,  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of  allowing  further  improvement  in  the labor  market,  weakness  in  foreign  economies,  and  potential  risks  to  the  US  economy  from  international  policy divergence  all  suggest  a  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy.

Respondent 4: My  baseline  expectations  have  slipped  just  a  bit  from  June,  which  in  turn  had  slipped  a  bit from  March. While  economic  performance  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  has  surely  -  as  expected  -improved  on the  first  half,  it  may  not  be  improving  by  as  much  as  was  expected  three  months  ago.  Indeed  there  are  at  least  some signs  that  momentum  may  be  slowing  a  bit  more. So  there  is  some  increase  in  domestic  downside  risks,  though not  a  particularly  large  one.  Externally,  the  risk  of  sharp  downside  market  movements  has  abated  since  June  but  against  the  backdrop  of  expectations  for  improved  overall  foreign  economic  performance  in  the  coming  year,  I  find the  risks  to  that  projection  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside.  China,  in  particular,  poses  such  risks.

Respondent 5: I expect  that  output  growth  will  accelerate  from  the  below-trend  pace  over  the  last  few quarters  as  the  headwinds  that  have  been  depressing  growth  recede.  Over  the  medium  term,  output  grows  at  close to  my  longer-run  trend  pace  of  2  percent. I expect  that  labor  markets  will  continue  to  strengthen  and  that  the unemployment  rate  will  continue  to  edge  down  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  declines  further. Headline inflation  has  been  held  down  by  falling  energy  prices,  but  as  oil  prices  stabilize  and  dollar  appreciation  wanes, inflation  will  rise  and  run  at  a  pace  close  to  the  Committee's  2  percent  target  by  the  end  of  2017. With  inflation and  output  growth  running  near  my  longer-term  trends,  and  the  unemployment  rate  moving  below  my  estimate of  the  natural  rate,  monetary  policy  becomes  less  accommodative  over  the  forecast  horizon,  and  the  federal  funds rate  reaches  2.9  percent  by  the  end  of  2018  and  slightly  overshoots  my  longer-run  funds  rate  of  3  percent  in  2019.

Respondent 6: We  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  rebound  to  around  2 3 4 / %  (annual  rate)  over  2016H2,  resulting in a Q4/Q4  growth  rate  of  around  2%,  slightly  below  the  projections  in  the  June  SEP  submission. Consumer spending  is  expected  to  continue  to  be  the  main  engine  of  growth,  increasing  2 3 / %  (annual  rate)  over  2016H2,  a 4 slightly  slower  pace  than  over  2016H1. The  personal  saving  rate  is  expected  to  remain  around  its  recent  level  of 5 3 / %. 4 Business  fixed  investment  is  expected  to  provide  a  positive  growth  contribution,  largely  due  to  the  end of  the  decline  in  oil  and  gas  drilling  activity,  although  we  have  lowered  the  growth  contribution  from  this  sector due  to  the  continued  weakness  in  equipment  investment.  Similarly,  we  have  reduced  our  projection  for  residential investment  growth  due  to  the  downturn  in  value  added  per  completed  unit. The  net  export  growth  contribution over  2016H2  is  expected  to  be  less  negative  than  expected  at  the  time  of  the  June  SEP  submission. In  addition, due  to  the  steep  decline  of  inventory  investment  in  Q2,  we  now  expect  inventory  investment  to  provide  a  positive growth  contribution  over  2016H2.

After  declining  in  the  past  three  quarters,  we  expect  productivity  growth  to  rebound  over  the  2016H2,  which should  keep  monthly  payroll  gains  below  200,000  (on  average)  over  the  remaining  months  of  the  year.

CorePCEdeflatorinflationisexpectedtoaverage around  1 1 / %  (annual  rate)  over  2016H2,  similar  to  that  projected  in  the  June  SEP  submission. 2

Our  real  GDP  growth  forecast  for  2017  has  been  raised  to  1.9%,  somewhat  above  our  estimate  of  the  economy's potential  growth  rate.  Growth  of  consumer  spending  is  projected  to  decrease  from  3%  in  2016  to  around  2 1 / %,  led 4 by  a  continuation  of  the  slowing  of  growth  of  durable  goods  spending  and  a  reduction  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  real disposable  income.  Growth  of  real  residential  investment  also  slows  in  response  to  higher  interest  rates.  However, business  investment  spending  is  expected  to  be  somewhat  firmer,  but  still  would  not  be  regarded  as  robust. The trade  drag  is  larger  than  in  2016  reflecting  stronger  growth  of  imports  due  to  the  dollar  appreciation  of  the  past  few years  and  the  normalization  of  domestic  inventory-sales  ratios.

With  growth  remaining  above  potential  in  2017,  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  decline  to  4.7%  by  the end  of  the  year. Productivity  growth  is  assumed  to  pick  up  from  the  2016  pace  but  still  be  below  its  long-term trend  of  1 1 / %.  The  compensation  share  of  national  income  continues  to  rise  gradually  while  the  corporate  profit 4 share  declines.  Total  PCE  deflator  inflation  is  expected  to  move  higher,  reaching  1.9%  for  2017  (Q4/Q4),  reflecting reduced  slack,  a  declining  impulse  from  past  dollar  appreciation,  anchored  expectations,  and  accommodative policy.

For2018, weexpectrealGDPgrowthtoslowslightlytoitspotentialratewiththeunemploymentrateremaining at  4.7%. This  slowing  of  growth  is  due  to  a  combination  of  the  aging  of  the  business  cycle  and  some  tightening

of financial  conditions  associated  with  further  removal  of  monetary  accommodation. Reflecting  the  fact  that the  unemployment  rate  is  at  our  estimate  of  NAIRU  in  2017,  and  nonpetroleum  import  prices  are  projected  to increase,  total  PCE  inflation  moves  upward  to  2%  (Q4/Q4). For  2019-with  economic  slack  largely  dissipated, inflation  at  objective  by  the  end  of  2018,  and  the  policy  rate  rising  to  near  its  longer-run  normal  level-real  growth, unemployment,  and  inflation  are  anticipated  to  be  at  their  longer-run  levels.

Respondent 7: Continued  uncertainty  about  the  rate  of  productivity  growth.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  low  oil  prices.  Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  further  tightening  in labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified  workers,  and  some  increased  wage  pressures  across a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations.  While  global  growth  prospects  remain  subdued,  monetary  policy  globally is  highly  accommodative,  which  should  promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad.  After  a  weak start  to  the  year,  I  expect  U.S.  growth  to  strengthen  over  the  second  half  of  the  year,  to  a  pace  that  is  at  or  slightly above  trend  next  year,  which  will  support  further  improvement  in  labor  markets.  With  the  labor  market  already at  full  employment,  I  expect  a  slowing  in  the  pace  of  labor  market  gains  compared  to  last  year. I project  that  the economy  will  be  near  its  steady  state  by  2019.

Inflationrateshavemovedupfromtheiryear-agolevelsastheeffectsofpastdeclinesinoilpricesandappreciation of  the  dollar  have  faded. This  path  is  consistent  with  what  the  FOMC  has  been  expecting.  I  continue  to  monitor inflation  expectations,  but  I  judge  inflation  expectations  as  reasonably  well-anchored. If this continues,  then continued  output  growth  and  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  stabilizing  oil  prices  and  the  dollar,  are  consistent withinflationmovingbacktothe2percentlonger-runobjectiveoverthenextcoupleofyears.  Anecdotalinformation andtheofficialstatisticsindicatetherehasbeensomeaccelerationinwagesandcompensation; Iexpectsomefurther acceleration  as  the  expansion  continues  and  labor  markets  continue  to  improve.  However,  wage  increases  are  likely to  be  lower  than  in  earlier  expansions  due  to  lower  productivity  growth.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years.  As  described  above, while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and inflation.

Respondent 10: Globalgrowthgraduallymovesupfromitscurrentanemicpace.  U.S.GDPgrowthcontinues at  close  to  2%.  Business  investment  gradually  increases  but  the  legacy  of  weak  investment  means  that  productivity moves  up  more  slowly  than  in  the  Teal  Book  forecast. Job  growth  continues  at  a  decent  pace,  unemployment declines,  LFPR  performs  better  than  the  baseline,  wages  increase,  and  inflation  returns  to  2.0%  by  2018.

Respondent 11: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  stable  financial  conditions,  a  healthy  labor  market,  and improved  household  and  business  balance  sheets  should  allow  for  solid  consumer-led  growth  in  domestic  private demand.  In  addition,  we  assume  little  change  in  the  dollar  going  forward,  and  so  project  that  the  drag  from  net exports  will  wane  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period.

The  factors  supporting  activity  are  sufficient  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over  the  next three  years. We  assume  that  resource  gaps  will  be  closed  by  early  2018;  although  the  unemployment  rate  today is only  slightly  above  our  estimate  of  the  current  natural  rate,  we  think  it  will  take  a  bit  longer  to  close  the  gaps we  still  see  remaining  in  some  other  labor  market  indicators. We  assume  growth  will  be  strong  enough  to  push the  unemployment  rate  down  to  4.3  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period,  about  a  quarter  percentage  point below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  that  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

As  it  has  for  some  time,  our  forecast  for  rising  inflation  relies  on  reductions  in  resource  slack  (and  eventually overshooting),  stabilization  of  the  dollar,  some  upward  movement  in  energy  prices,  and  a  lift  from  the  inflation attractor  as  it  rises  back  to  2  percent. All  but  the  latter  seem  to  be  in  train  now. We  assume  that  a  quite  shallow path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target will  solidify  inflation  expectations  and  allow  them  to  assert  an  upward  pull  on  actual  inflation. If this  does  not occur,  then  we  do  not  see  the  upward  force  from  other  factors  as  being  adequate  to  bring  inflation  close  to  target over  the  forecast  period.

As  to sources of uncertainty,  international developments,  their influence on financial markets,  and the spillovers to  household  and  business  confidence  are  likely  to  cloud  the  forecast  for  growth  for  some  time  to  come. So,  too, is the  degree  to  which  business  caution  may  hold  back  investment  spending  and  hiring. With  regard  to  inflation, the  linkages  among  Fed  policy  (including  communications),  inflation  expectations,  and  actual  inflation  are  key uncertainties.  Risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  in  the  risks  and  uncertainty  section.

Respondent 12: My  projections  envision  the  U.S.  economy  making  a  successful  transition  to  sustainable growth.  Such  transitions  have  always  been  difficult,  and  given  greater  international  connectedness,  divergent  and uncertain  global  economic  trends  promise  to  make  the  current  transition  more  than  usually  challenging  for  Federal Reserve  policymakers.

Because  of  the  lags  in  inflation's  response  to  the  real  economy,  and  in  the  response  of  the  real  economy  to monetary  policy,  it  is  essential  that  the  process  of  removing  policy  accommodation  begin  before  full  employment and  price  stability  are  fully  achieved.  The  main  difficulty  will  be  accurately  assessing  the  degree  of  accommodation implied  by  a  given  funds-rate  path.

Respondent 13: Recovery  from  the  housing  collapse  and  financial  crisis  has  been  a  slow  process.  Nonetheless, most  of  the  healing  process  has  already  taken  place  with  improved  financial  conditions  supportive  of  a  healthy pace  of  consumer  spending  growth.  Strength  in  the  labor  market  hiring,  a  pick  up  in  wage  and  disposable  income growth,  and  household  wealth  gains  should  also  support  solid  consumption  growth  going  forward.

The  strong  relative  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year,  the  subsequent  monetary  easing  in Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  the  depreciation  of  the  renminbi  resulted  in  a  sharp  appreciation  of  the  dollar  last  year. This  appreciation  has  been  a  drag  on  net  exports  and  GDP  growth. In  recent  months,  the  dollar  has  stabilized, eliminating  that  source  of  drag  to  GDP  growth  going  forward.  In  addition,  financial  market  volatility  over  the  past year  has  calmed  with  equity  prices  rising  on  balance  in  recent  months  and  interest  rate  spreads  falling.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace.  Output  and  unemployment gaps  were  essentially  closed  by  the  end  of  2015. With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  at  play,  I  expect  these aggregate  indicators  to  overshoot  in  the  coming  year,  before  reverting  back  to  potential  in  2019.  This  overshooting, along  with  the  dissipating  effects  from  falling  energy  prices  and  a  rising  dollar  should  lead  to  faster  inflation  over the  next  year.  Inflation  reaches  our  2  percent  target  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018.

Respondent 14: My  outlook  consists  of  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  few  years, a further, modest reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  converges  to  target  by  the  end  of  next  year.

Growth over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  a  sustained  pace  of  consumption  growth  and  a  strengthening  in  investment  growth.  This  growth  of  domestic  demand  is  supported  by  continued  firming  in  the  labor  market and  growth  of  household  incomes.

ff I view  the  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. My  sta presented  survey  evidence  suggesting uncertainty  over  the  upcoming  election  has  been  weighing  on  business  investment  and  hiring  decisions. Once lifted,  investment  spending  could  grow  at  a  faster  rate  than  I  currently  expect. On  the  other  hand,  the  modest acceleration  in  productivity  growth  that  I  am  projecting  could  fail  to  materialize.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  mostly  balanced.  While  I  view  inflation  expectations  as  anchored  at policy-consistent  levels,  persistent,  below-target  inflation  readings  risk  anchoring  expectations  to  the  downside. On  the  other  hand,  some  measures  of  wage  growth  are  accelerating  in  spite  of  weak  productivity  growth,  a  signal that  we  could  be  approaching  full  employment  more  quickly  than  I  expect.

Respondent 15: Our  forecast  continues  to  be  based  on  a  regime-based  conception  of  medium  and  long-term outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy.  In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  converged  to one  of  them.  The  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  so  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current regime  over  the  forecast  horizon. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent,  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the current  regime.  Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  some  of  the  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession.  If  the  economy  transitions to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may  be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal,  regime-dependent  policy  rate would  require  adjustment. However,  we  have  no  way  of  predicting  when  these  transitions  may  occur,  and  so  we forecast  that  we  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 16: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  trend  growth  in  the  period  from  2017  to 2019.  Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising  employment  and  wages,  past  gains  in  household wealth,  and  accommodative  financing  conditions. After  the  rapid  reductions  in  economic  slack  in  the  past  few years,  I  view  the  economy  as  currently  operating  near  full  capacity.  Hence,  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move only  somewhat  lower  next  year,  before  gradually  moving  back  toward  its  longer-run  rate  in  2019. My  inflation outlook  projects  an  inflation  rate  near  2  percent  from  2017  onwards,  an  increase  from  the  inflation  rate  in  2016  that reflects  tightening  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  effects  of  past  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  energy prices.

I view  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projection  of  the  PCE  inflation  rate  as  higher  than  levels  of  uncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  reflecting  the  volatility  in  oil  prices  in  recent  years.  The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation, and  unemployment  appear  broadly  balanced.  In  particular,  the  foreign  outlook  appears  to  have  stabilized  relative to  earlier  in  the  year,  as  the  volatility  stemming  from  Brexit  has  dissipated  and  growth  in  China  has  stabilized.

My  projection  for  GDP  growth  this  year  is  slightly  higher,  reflecting  mainly  solid  consumer  spending growth.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: There  have  been  only  minor  changes  to  the  real  outlook. The  unemployment  rate  is  now expected  to  fall  by  less  this  year  than  in  the  June  forecast,  but  in  the  out  years  the  projected  path  is  unchanged. The  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  materially.  The  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  slightly  lower  path  for  the  federal funds  rate  in  the  near  and  medium  term,  to  reflect  the  fact  that  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate over  the  forecast  horizon  lies  somewhat  below  our  longer-run  estimate.

Respondent 2: Relative  to  the  June  SEP,  I  have  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  value  of  R*  to  0.75 percent,  in  part  reflecting  a  slight  downward  revision  to  my  assumptions  for  longer-run  productivity  growth. In addition,  I  have  assumed  a  flatter  trajectory  for  the  path  of  the  neutral  funds  rate  over  the  next  several  years, reflecting  more  pessimistic  assumptions  about  the  speed  at  which  various  headwinds  still  restraining  the  economy will  fade  over  time.

Respondent 3: Incoming  data  caused  me  to  mark  down  GDP  growth  in  2016  and  overall  PCE  inflation  has run  a  bit  lower  than  I  expected. The  recent  upticks  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  are  an  encouraging  sign that  workers  will  continue  to  be  drawn  back  into  the  workforce,  but  at  a  slightly  lower  rate.

Respondent 4: See  answer  to  4(1)

Respondent 5: Based  on  a  reassessment  of  the  data,  I  have  lowered  my  longer-run  projection  for  real  GDP growth  to  2  percent  and  my  longer-run  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  3  percent.

Respondent 6: Our  macroeconomic  projections  have  changed  only  modestly  from  those  in  June.  Real  GDP growth  is  anticipated  to  be  slightly  lower  in  2016  and  modestly  higher  in  2017  than  the  June  SEP  projections.  The lower  projection  for  2016  is  largely  the  result  of  the  weaker-than-expected  growth  in  2016H1,  while  the  reasons  for the  upgrade  to  2017  are  discussed  in  our  forecast  narrative  (Question  4(a)).  The  stronger  projected  growth  in  2017 also  led  us  to  lower  our  unemployment  projections  for  2017  and  2018.  Overall  and  core  inflation  forecasts  have  not changed  substantially  from  those  in  June:  the  convergence  of  inflation  to  the  longer-term  objective  is  expected  by 2018.  As  noted  and  explained  in  the  response  to  3(b),  we  judge  that  a  lower  path  of  the  policy  rate  is  necessary  to support  these  projections.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: My  modal  forecast  is  little  changed  since  June,  but  the  funds  rate  path  consistent  with  this outlook  is  shallower  because  I  have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  long-run  interest  rate.  I  continue to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

I modestly  reduced  my  forecast  for  growth  and  PCE  inflation  in  2016  to  account  for  the  weak  first  half  of  the year,  but  the  trajectory  remains  the  same:  I  expect  growth  will  pick  up  over  the  second  half  of  the  year  and  be  at or  slightly  above  trend  next  year,  which  will  support  continued  growth  in  payrolls,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  last year.  I  view  inflation  as  being  on  a  gradual  upward  trajectory  toward  our  2  percent  objective.

I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  as  appropriate  monetary  policy,  which balances  the  risks  to  the  forecast  and  takes  into  account  uncertainty  around  the  forecast. My  slightly  shallower path  compared  with  my  June  projection  reflects  the  slightly  weaker  growth  forecast  for  2016-2017  and  the  estimate of  a  lower  long-run  equilibrium  interest  rate  compared  to  June.

Respondent 10: Labor  market  improvement  is  showing  up  more  in  LFPR  than  in  unemployment. I now expect  that  will  continue,  with  unemployment  declining  slower  than  my  prior  forecast  (but  at  least  as  fast  as  the baseline),  but  LFPR  outperforming  baseline.  I  now  see  one  rate  increase  in  2016  and  two  increases  in  2017.

Respondent 11: Second-quarter  growth  was  a  percentage  point  weaker  than  we  were  expecting  in  June.  We were  particularly  surprised  by  the  further  decline  in  business  capital  spending. We  assume  that  the  first-half weakness  will  largely  be  transitory; indeed,  we  see  the  third-quarter  data  as  consistent  with  strong  consumer spending  and  a  moderate  gain  in  BFI.

TheincomingdataoncorePCEinflationwerebroadlyinlinewithourexpectations.  However,financialmarket inflation  compensation  and  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations  remain  very  low,  highlighting  the  downside risks  to  the  inflation  outlook.

We  reduced  our  assumptions  for  long-run  growth  and  the  equilibrium  funds  rates  by  a  quarter  percent  and have  one  fewer  rate  increase  in  2017  than  we  did  in  June.  With  this  policy  path,  we  expect  core  and  total  inflation to  reach  1.9  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period,  slightly  later  than  we  did  in  June.

Respondent 12: I've  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  economy's  longer-run  growth  potential  by  a  few  of  tenths of  a  percentage  point  and  adjusted  my  GDP  growth  projections  for  coming  years  downward  accordingly.  The  net effect  is  to  leave  my  unemployment  projections  unchanged  from  June. Reflecting  downward  revisions  to  official data  and  weakness  in  recent  reports,  I've  lowered  my  inflation  projections  over  the  near  term.  As  discussed  above, in my  response  to  3(b),  I've  become  convinced  that  demographic  changes  and  weaker  prospective  productivity growth  have  had  a  significant  impact  on  the  longer-run  equilibrium  fed  funds  rate.  As  a  result,  the  funds-rate  path that  I  regard  as  most  likely  to  be  appropriate  is  lower  than  before.

Respondent 13: Since  June,  I  have  increased  my  unemployment  path,  largely  reflecting  incoming  data. I now  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  bottom  out  at  4.6  percent  by  the  first  quarter  of  next  year  before  gradually rising  back  to  its  5  percent  natural  rate  over  subsequent  years. Despite  strong  consumer  spending  and  a  positive contribution  from  net  exports,  continuing  weakness  in  business  investment  spending  and  construction  activity  led me  to  lower  my  projection  of  GDP  growth  for  2016.

My  inflation  projection  is  slightly  lower  owing  mainly  to  lower  than  expected  energy  prices  for  the  current  year. With  less  overshooting  in  output  and  employment,  I  now  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  2018  and to  remain  there  afterwards.  As  a  result,  my  projection  of  core  inflation  is  one-tenth  lower  for  both  2016  and  2018.

Respondent 14: In  response  to  weaker  first  half  growth  than  I  had  expected  in  June,  I  lowered  my  current year  projection  by  0.2  percentage  points. However,  given  that  the  shortfall  was  largely  due  to  a  downswing  in inventories  and  final  demand  measures  of  economic  growth  remained  reasonably  solid,  I  am  taking  little  signal from  first  half  growth.

Progress  on  the  unemployment  rate  has  slowed  over  the  course  of  this  year,  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate (LFPR)  has  moved  modestly  higher.  I've  taken  on  board  a  slightly  higher  path  for  the  LFPR  and  have  marked  up my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  accordingly.

Respondent 15: We  have  made  minor  changes  to  our  2016  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  PCE  inflation based  on  data  for  the  first  half  of  2016.

Respondent 16: I  have  revised  down  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth,  PCE  inflation,  and  core  PCE  inflation in  the  first  half  of  2016  based  on  the  incoming  data.  In  addition,  I  have  lowered  my  medium-term  projection  of  real GDP  growth,  from  slightly  above-trend  growth  to  growth  at  its  longer-run  trend  rate.

Respondent 17: I have  lowered  my  near-term  inflation  forecast  in  response  to  somewhat  soft  data  this  summer.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: The  Tealbook's  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  at  5.0  percent,  is  higher  than our  estimate,  which  stands  at  4.7  percent.  The  Tealbook  forecast  implies  a  more  pronounced  overshooting  of  full employment  than  our  forecast.

Respondent 2: Implicitly,  the  Tealbook  assumes  a  faster  recovery  in  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  over  the next  few  years.  In  addition,  the  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  underlying  trend  in  inflation  is  below  2  percent,  which implies  that  they  need  a  more  pronounced  undershoot  of  the  unemployment  rate  relative  to  its  longer-run  level  to bring  inflation  back  to  2  percent.  Lastly,  I  assume  that  the  longer-run  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  somewhat lower  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 3: My forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  except  that  I believe  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  draw  workers  back  into  the  labor  force,  leading  to  more  progress on  the  labor  force  participation  rate  than  the  unemployment  rate. This  would  lead  to  less  upward  movement  for wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the  path  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.  Removing  monetary  policy more  gradually,  as  in  my  projection,  would  produce  a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 4: I continue  to  differ  with  the  Tealbook  on  2017  GDP  projections,  since  I  do  not  anticipate  a significant  pickup  in  growth. I should  add  that,  although  it  does  not  reflect  a  difference  on  the  forecast  as  such,  I do  differ  in  a  non-trivial  way  with  the  Tealbook  assumption  that  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  5  percent.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: As  in  the  June  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and our  projections  for  the  key  SEP  variables. In  part,  these  differences  reflect  divergences  in  some  of  the  underlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts.

The  two  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  are  similar,  but  the  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2017 and  2018  than  in  our  outlook.  Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential  GDP  growth,  which  is  below  our assumption  in  2016-18,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to  a  notably  positive  output  gap  in  2017-19. Even though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  there  is  not  a  significantly positive  output  gap  at  that  time.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption. The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2017  -  19  than  in  our  projection,  a  long-standing  difference between  the  two  forecasts,  which  likely  reflects  a  stronger  wealth  effects  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Another  notable  difference  is  the  underlying  assumptions  on  the  longer-run  natural  rate  of  unemployment: the  Tealbook  assumption  of  5.0%  is  above  our  assumption  of  4.8%. Combined  with  our  growth  projections,  we anticipate  that  unemployment  will  be  fairly  close  to  its  natural  rate  over  the  projection  period;  in  contrast,  the Tealbook  projects  that  unemployment  significantly  undershoots  the  longer-run  natural  rate. This  pattern  is  a counterpart  of  the  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  that  does  not  arise  in  our  projections.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: in  our projection  the  participation  rate  is  roughly  flat  through  2018  at  62.8%  while  in  the  Tealbook  it  declines  gradually to  62.2%  at  end-2018.  This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  continue  to  differ  on  how  quickly  inflation  reaches  the  2%  objective. In  our projection  inflation  is  at  2%  in  2018  whereas  the  Tealbook  projects  inflation  below  2%  until  2020,  despite  a  sizable undershooting  of  unemployment  in  its  projection. The  considerable  persistence  of  inflation  within  the  Tealbook frameworkappearstorequireaprolongedperiodofabove-potentialgrowthinordertoinduceinflationtorisetoward the  longer-run  inflation  goal. In  our  forecast,  the  faster  return  of  inflation  to  its  goal  reflects  our  assumptions  of less  inflation  persistence  and  a  stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation  expectations.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  a  few  differences  between  the  two  projections.  On  the real  side,  we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  in  the  projections  of  real  activity  and  unemployment,

whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual natureofthecurrentexpansion,theconflictingsignalsinrecenteconomicdata, andtheatypicalpolicyenvironment in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  keep  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard. However,  we  now  see  the risks  to  real  growth  as  roughly  balanced,  especially  over  the  near  term,  which  is  in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's assessment  of  a  downside  skew  to  the  risks.  As  for  inflation,  our  uncertainty  assessment  is  broadly  similar  to  that in  the  Tealbook,  but  we  see  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

Finally, our  monetary  policy  path  is  aligned  with  the  Tealbook  projection  for  the  rest  of  this  year, but  is significantly  shallower  than  the  Tealbook  path  for  2017-19.  As  discussed  earlier  in  our  submission,  we  believe  that a  very  gradual  removal  of  accommodation  is  necessary  to  support  our  projections  and  to  address  risk-management considerations. In addition,  our  assumption  for  the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  25bps  below  that  of  the Tealbook,  as  we  take  a  somewhat  stronger  signal  from  the  persistently  low  sovereign  yields  across  the  advanced economies.

Respondent 7: I am  more  optimistic  about  the  current  state  and  the  growth  potential  of  the  U.S.  economy than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  the  labor  market will  continue  to  improve,  and  inflation  will  gradually  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term  objective. My  outlook for  the  real  economy  is  generally  similar  to  Tealbook's  forecast,  but  I  see  somewhat  greater  inflationary  pressures than  in  the  Tealbook,  with  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  over  the  next  couple  of  years  compared  with  2020  in  the Tealbook.  As  a  result,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  to  have  a  somewhat  steeper  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate compared  with  the  Tealbook,  which  limits  the  extent  to  which  the  unemployment  rate  undershoots  its  longer-run value.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Our  Federal  Funds  rate  path  is  25-50  bps  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  period,  ending 2019  at  3%,  which  we  view  as  its  equilibrium  level.  We  assume  that  these  more  moderate  increases  in  policy  rates will  keep  the  dollar  from  increasing,  as  it  does  in  the  Tealbook. Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  we  also  see  more  slack in  the  economy;  we  assume  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  trends  down  from  4.7  percent  today  to  4.5  percent at  the  end  of  2019,  in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's  constant  5  percent  assumption. We  also  think  that  the  current gap  between  actual  and  trend  labor  force  participation  is  somewhat  larger  and  that  it  will  not  close  until  the unemployment  rate  is  modestly  below  its  natural  rate.

Thus  even  though  we  have  slightly  faster  growth,  on  net,  over  the  forecast  period,  we  do  not  expect  output to  overshoot  potential  output  to  as  great  of  a  degree  as  in  the  Tealbook. Nonetheless,  our  outlook  for  inflation is very  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  as  we  feel  our  more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  be  successful at  buoying  inflationary  expectations,  firming  the  inflationary  attractor  and  therefore  providing  a  larger  boost  to actual  inflation.

Respondent 12: There  are  several  notable  differences. First, I see the  unemployment  rate  overshooting the  longer-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate  by  less  than  is  projected  in  the  Tealbook. Allowing  the  larger overshoot  predicted  by  the  Tealbook  would  risk  the  buildup  of  dangerous  real  and  financial  imbalances  and  an early  or  severe  recession. Second,  because  I  am  relatively  conservative  in  my  views  on  the  appropriate  path  for the  unemployment  rate,  I  project  somewhat  slower  2017  and  2018  GDP  growth  than  does  the  Tealbook.  Finally, I see  a  more  rapid  return  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  than  does  the  Tealbook.  In  my  view,  the  longer-term inflation  expectations  relevant  to  wage  and  price  setting  remain  anchored  at  2  percent.

Respondent 13: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the unemployment rate declining  to  4.2  percent at the  end  of  2019,  and with inflation  returning  to  the  2  percent target  only  very  gradually.  In  my  projection,  there  is  a  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output  through 2018,  and  those  gaps  close  in  2019. I see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  4.6  percent  in  the  first  half  of 2016. The  gradual  removal  of  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows  growth  to

below  potential  in  2017  and  2018,  respectively.  This  pushes  up  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.9  percent  by  the  end  of 2018.  Finally,  the  persistent  overshoot  of  full  employment,  combined  with  firmer  price  pressures,  pushes  inflation back  to  2  percent  by  the  first  quarter  of  2018.

Respondent 14: I have  marked  in  a  slightly  higher  long-run  growth  trend  owing  to  a  somewhat  stronger productivity  assumption. My  projection  of  a  level  unemployment  rate  results  from  a  more  modest  employment growth  trend. I have  a  faster  acceleration  in  inflation  to  its  longer-term  target  and  I  am  assuming  that  inflation expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  policy-consistent  levels.

Respondent 15: The  Tealbook  forecast  is  in  many  ways  similar  to  our  forecast,  but  incorporates  the  idea  of a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the economy  transitions  toward  the  longer-run  steady  state.  This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. The  regime  conception  we  use,  in  contrast,  views  monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is viewed  as  persistent. It  is acknowledged  that  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to those  regimes  cannot  be  forecasted.  This  suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 16: My  projected  path  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017  and  2018  is  lower  and  my  projected  path for the unemployment  rate  is  flatter  than  in  Tealbook, as I expect  to  see less momentum  once  the  economy operates  at  full  capacity.  My  forecasts  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  in  the  period  2017-2019  are  a  few tenths  of  a  percentage  point  above  Tealbook's  forecasts,  with  the  difference  narrowing  over  time. With  inflation expectations  well  anchored,  I  view  inflation  as  less  inertial  than  Tealbook,  and  therefore  expect  the  effects  of  past dollar  appreciation  and  oil  price  declines  to  wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projections.

Respondent 17: I  expect  inflation  to  converge  to  2  percent  more  rapidly  than  the  Tealbook.  I  also  expect  real growth  in  2017  and  2018  to  be  at  trend.
