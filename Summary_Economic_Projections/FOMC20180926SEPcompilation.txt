Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for the federal funds  rate are the value of the midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or the projected  appropriate  target  level  for the federal funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  June  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on June  12-13,  2018. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  June 12-13,  2018,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  September  25-26,  2018,  meeting.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines  in  the  top  panel  show  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the percent  change  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter of the year  indicated. The  confidence  interval  around  the  median  projected  values  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  and  is based  on  root  mean  squared  errors  of  various  private  and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years;  more information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. Because  current  conditions  may  diff er  from  those  that  prevailed, on average, over the previous  20 years, the width  and  shape  of the confidence  interval estimated  on  the basis of the historical forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current  assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around their  projections;  these  current  assessments  are  summarized  in  the  lower  panels. Generally  speaking,  participants  who judge  the  uncertainty  about  their  projections  as  'broadly  similar'  to  the  average  levels  of  the  past  20  years  would  view the width  of the confidence interval shown  in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments  of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who  judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced'  would  view  the  confidence  interval  around  their  projections  as  approximately  symmetric.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines are based  on  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the  Committee's  target for the federal funds  rate at the end  of the year indicated. The  actual  values  are the midpoint  of  the target range; the median  projected values are based on either the midpoint  of the target range or the target level. The  confidence  interval around  the median  projected  values  is based  on root mean  squared  errors  of various private and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years. The  confidence  interval  is  not  strictly  consistent  with  the projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  primarily  because  these  projections  are  not  forecasts  of  the  likeliest  outcomes  for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments  of appropriate  monetary  policy. Still, historical  forecast  errors  provide  a  broad  sense  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate generated  by  the  uncertainty  about  the  macroeconomic  variables  as  well  as  additional  adjustments  to  monetary  policy that  may  be  appropriate  to  off set  the  eff ects  of  shocks  to  the  economy.

The  confidence  interval  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  except  when  it  is  truncated  at  zero-the  bottom  of  the  lowest target range  for the federal funds  rate that has been  adopted  in  the past by the Committee. This truncation  would not be intended  to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative  interest rates to provide  additional  monetary  policy accommodation  if  doing  so  was  judged  appropriate. In such  situations,  the  Committee  could  also  employ  other  tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  their  projections.

* The  confidence  interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term  interest rates in the fourth quarter  of  the  year  indicated;  more  information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. The  shaded  area  encompasses less than  a  70  percent  confidence  interval  if  the  confidence  interval  has  been  truncated  at  zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Weareatorverynearourinflationtarget,butlikelywellpastfullemployment.  Thechallengeis tograduallyreiningrowth-leavingtheeconomyvulnerabletopolicymisstepsandadverseshocks.  Fullconvergence is  likely  to  take  at  least  5  years.

Respondent 3: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years.

Respondent 4: We  expect  values  of  headline  and  core  inflation  to  be  on  or  very  close  to  target  in  2018  and beyond,  but  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  are  expected  to  deviate  from  their  long-run  values  conditional  on  the current  regime.  This  regime,  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term government  debt,  features  GDP  growth  of  2.0  percent,  an  unemployment  rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0 percent.  The  projected  deviations,  due  in  part  to  federal  stimulus,  are  expected  to  be  temporary.  We  project  that overshooting  of  GDP  growth  will  end  in  2021  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment  will  end  in  2022. Because there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  of  these  variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run  inflation  projection  that  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 5: No  comment.

Respondent 6: Having  essentially  achieved  our  objectives  for  inflation  and  unemployment,  the  current  stance of  monetary  policy  will  likely  promote  a  further  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  longer-run  level.  Policy rates  will  need  to  adjust  over  several  years  to  bring  unemployment  back  in  line  with  the  longer-run  objective  and ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  with  price  stability.

Respondent 7: The  forecast  entails  a  declining  unemployment  rate  until  2020. Thereafter,  a  prolonged 'growth  recession'  is  needed  to  achieve  a  soft  landing. The  historical  record,  however,  places  a  high  probability on  a  recession  occurring  once  growth  starts  to  slow  below  potential.  In  sum,  while  a  purely  model-driven  forecast would  suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below  around  2024,  the  probability  that the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice  is  sizable.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: The  recent  data,  including  the  comprehensive  revision  to  GDP  and  the  associated  historical revisions  to productivity  growth,  provide  no  compelling  reason to  change  my  estimate  of  1 3 4 / percentfor longer-run real  GDP  growth.  In  addition,  there  is  no  strong  evidence  to  suggest  a  substantial  change  in  my  estimate  for  the longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  of  around  4 1 / 2 percent.

I assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective. Under  those  conditions,  the  monetary  policy  stance  will  be  consistent  with  a  modest  overshooting  of  inflation  and  an  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  normal  unemployment  rate  for  the  next  several  years. I expect  these  variables  to  return  to  their  longer-run  levels  by  the  mid-2020s.

Respondent 16: Our  policy  goals  have  effectively  been  reached. However,  it  will  take  some  time  to  achieve sustained  convergence  to  longer-run  levels. The  effects  from  continued  fiscal  stimulus  and  effects  from  past  accommodative  monetary  policy  will  generate  a  modest  degree  of  overshooting  of  the  inflation  target  and  an  unemployment  rate  that  will  remain  well  below  the  natural  rate  for  several  years  before  returning  back  to  its  longer-run level. Recent  data  show  no  indication  of  a  shift  in  longer-run  levels  of  GDP  growth  or  the  unemployment  rate.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath. Changes  in  trade  policy  increase  the  uncertainty  around  my  forecasts,  but  not  significantly.

Respondent 2: Near-term  uncertainty  is  likely  somewhat  below  average.  Uncertainty  two  or  three  years  out may  be  above  average: We  have  seldom  succeeded  in  stabilizing  the  unemployment  rate-much  less  engineering a non-trivial  increase  in  unemployment-without  triggering  a  recession. Strong,  unpredictable  fiscal- and  tradepolicy  crosswinds  have  the  potential  to  make  the  convergence  process  more-than-usually  challenging.

Respondent 3: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  future  course  of  both  fiscal  and  trade  policy.  The  impact  on inflation  uncertainty  is  less  pronounced  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: No  comment.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: While  the  forecasting  exercise  under  current  conditions  may  not  be  as  uncertain  as  during the  Great  Recession,  we  have  limited  experience  with  some  of  the  factors  a ffecting  the  forecast. We  assume  a small  effect  from  the  change  in  tariffs,  but  these  changes  may  become  broad-based  enough  and  disrupt  global supply  chains  in  ways  that  models  have  difficulty  in  capturing.  We  have  also  limited  experience  with  an  economy significantly  above  full  employment  for  a  considerable  period  of  time  -  the  kind  of  scenario  implied  by  our  forecast.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10: Uncertainty  around  my  projections  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  their respective  average  levels  over  the  past  20  years  (the  SEP  standard). Continued  trade  tensions,  the  impact  of stresses  in  emerging  market  economies  (EMEs)  on  the  U.S.  economy,  and  the  future  path  of  fiscal  policy  are  sources of greater  uncertainty. However,  economic  and  financial  developments  since  the  June  SEP  have  been  largely consistent  with  my  outlook,  which  indicates  some  o ffsetting  reduction  of  uncertainty.

Respondent 11: I believeuncertaintyaboutu*andthusmyprojectionsfortheunemploymentratearesubject to  greater  uncertainty  than  on  average  for  the  past  20  years. A  late  cycle  rise  in  real  wages  is  typical  in  a  fully employed  economy,  and  we  may  be  starting  to  see  this  in  the  data. Importantly,  in  past  two  cycles,  the  late  cycle rise  in  real  wages  was  not  accompanied  by  a  material  increase  in  core  inflation,  but  instead  was  absorbed  through a  late  cycle  decline  in  profit  margins.  How  the  unemployment,  wage,  and  profit  margin  relationships  play  out  over the  next  several  years  will  be  an  important  factor  in  determining  the  appropriate  path  of  policy  normalization.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Fiscal  policy  and  the  trade  situation  continue  to  add  uncertainty  to  the  outlook,  both  in terms  of  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  their  potential  direct  effects  and  -  particularly  for  trade  -  through  their current  and  prospective  influences  on  sentiment  and  spending.  These  considerations  raise  the  uncertainty  of  our projections  for  real  activity,  but  not  by  enough  to  move  us  out  of  the  'broadly  similar'  uncertainty  box. With inflation  running  near  our  2  percent  target  since  March,  we  are  somewhat  more  confident  about  our  inflation outlook,  but  not  enough  to  alter  our  characterization  of  the  uncertainty  as'broadly  similar'to  historical  levels.

Respondent 16: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

September 25-26, 2018

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: Risks  are  roughly  balanced. On  the  one  hand,  the  effective  lower  bound  limits  monetary policy's  ability  to  respond  to  negative  shocks. On  the  other,  the  recent  changes  in  fiscal  policy  present  increased upside  risks  to  activity.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: I anticipate  that  the  recent  fiscal  stimulus  will  boost  demand,  raise  output  growth,  and  lower unemployment  but  I  remain  uncertain  about  the  magnitude  of  the  effect.  I  am  concerned  that  fiscal  stimulus  may be  giving  a  temporary  boost  to  inflation.  As  well,  I  am  concerned  about  possible  adverse  effects  from  international trade  conflicts  but  have  not  yet  factored  that  into  my  forecast.

Respondent 4: With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity growth  regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Recent  changes  in productivity  growth  still  leave  productivity  in  its  low  regime.  However,  as  changes  in  fiscal  and  regulatory  policy continue  to  impact  the  economy,  we  see  the  possibility  of  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  we  see  US trade  policy  as  generating  some  downward  risk  for  growth. An  additional  factor  is  the  possibility  of  yield-curve inversion. Further  upward  movements  in  the  federal  funds  rate  may  increase  the  risk  of  recession;  however,  we anticipate  a  lag  of  more  than  a  year  between  yield-curve  inversion  and  recession.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion. If a  recession  were to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially. We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  recession during  the  forecast  horizon. The  interaction  between  US  and  foreign  trade  policies  raises  the  possibility  of  trade disruptions  that  might  increase  unemployment.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines in  the  unemployment  rate  if  GDP  growth  surprises  on  the  upside.  Federal  stimulus  associated  with  recent  tax  and spending  changes  might  produce  such  a  surprise.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. In  addition,  federal  stimulus associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  could  push  prices  higher. Trade  policy  changes  might  also  put some  upward  pressure  on  import  prices.  Anecdotal  reports  are  consistent  with  building  price  pressures.  Thus,  we see  the  risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  the  variable  depends  on  the behavior  of  energy  prices. While  an  upward  energy-price  shock  is  a  possibility,  a  case  can  also  be  made  for  some downward  drift  in  energy  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  for  PCE  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 5: No  comment.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: With  the  economy  growing  above  potential,  labor  markets  are  expected  to  tighten  further. There  is  the  risk  that  the  additional  demand  for  labor  may  not  be  accommodated  by  improvements  in  the  cyclical position  of  labor  force  participation  of  the  size  implicit  in  our  baseline  forecast,  but  rather  by  a  more  pronounced decline  in  the  unemployment  rate.  If  this  is  indeed  the  case,  we  would  also  expect  more  upward  pressure  on  wages and  prices.

Respondent 8:

Respondent 10: The  risks  to  real  economic  activity  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced  over  most  of  the  forecast horizon.  The  primary  downside  risks  come  from  the  possibility  that  trade  tensions  or  EME  stresses  could  impact financial  markets  and  eventually  have  more  adverse  effects  on  the  U.S.  economy  than  has  been  apparent  so  far. Another  downside  risk  is  that  fiscal  policy  could  become  more  restrictive  than  anticipated  following  the  expiration of  the  budget  agreement.  An  upside  risk,  particularly  at  shorter-term  horizons,  is  that  fiscal  stimulus  could  have more  positive  demand- and/or  supply-side  effects  than  I  anticipate.  Possible  stronger  momentum  associated  with robust  household  and  business  confidence  also  is  an  upside  risk. Because  the  upside  risks  are  shorter  term,  the balance  of  risks  shifts  modestly  to  the  downside  at  longer  horizons  of  the  projection.

The  risks  to  inflation  also  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced. A  major  upside  risk  is  that  aggregate  demand pressures  as  well  as  the  effects  of  higher  tariffs  and  trade  tensions  could  begin  to  put  more  upward  pressure  on inflation  than  has  been  apparent  so  far.  On  the  downside,  EME  stresses,  declines  in  industrial  commodities  prices, a stronger-than-anticipated  foreign  exchange  value  of  the  US  dollar  and  subdued  inflation  in  many  advanced economies  indicate  that  domestic  inflation  pressures  may  be  weaker  than  I  have  judged.  Even  though  the  risks  are balanced,  in  an  environment  where  inflation  is  likely  to  run  around  or  slightly  above  our  longer-run  goal,  the  costs of  upside  risks  probably  are  now  greater  than  those  of  downside  risks.

Respondent 11: I believe  the  risk  to  my  projections  are  weighted  to  the  upside  on  unemployment  for  the reasons  outlined  in  my  answer  to  2a.

Respondent 12: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced,  conditional  on  my monetary  policy  path  that  is  somewhat  steeper  over  2019-2020  than  the  median  path  in  the  June  SEP.

The  underlying  fundamentals  of  the  U.S.  economy  are  healthy. Financial  conditions  are  accommodative. Household  and  business  sentiment  readings  are  high,  suggesting  there  could  be  more  underlying  momentum  in  the economy  than  I've  been  assuming.

Expansionary  fiscal  policy  has  added  to  growth,  and  that  should  continue  over  the  next  two  years. I am estimating  that  it  will  provide  an  additional  0.5  percentage  point  to  Q4/Q4  GDP  growth  in  2018-2020,  but  there is  an  upside  risk  that  the  effect  could  be  larger. Beyond  the  forecast  horizon,  these  fiscal  policy  actions  pose  some downside  risk  to  the  outlook  because  higher  fiscal  deficits  will  likely  necessitate  reduced  fiscal  spending,  an  increase in  taxes,  and  higher  term-premia  in  longer-term  interest  rates.

Continued  uncertainty  over  trade  policy  poses  a  downside  risk  to  the  forecast,  potentially  lowering  business investment  spending,  aside  from  the  direct  effect  of  the  actual  tariffs. However,  so  far,  the  economy  has  proved to  be  quite  resilient  through  this. To  the  extent  that  uncertainty  over  the  trade  situation  has  been  a  headwind, resolution  of  the  uncertainty  could  be  considered  an  upside  risk  to  the  forecast.

The  outlook  for  most  foreign  economies  remains  positive,  supported  in  part  by  accommodative  monetary policies. However,  activity  abroad  appears  to  be  decelerating  somewhat. Continued  divergence  between  growth and  policy  paths  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  could  put  further  upward  pressure  on  the  dollar  and  poses  a  downside  risk to  U.S.  exports. In  addition,  financial  stresses  are  increasing  in  some  emerging  market  economies  that  have  low levels  of  reserves,  large  current  account  deficits,  and  high  external  debt  burdens.  There  is  some  risk  of  contagion  to other  emerging  market  economies,  which  could  eventually  feed  back  to  the  U.S.  economy  through  financial  market channels  and  trade  linkages.

I  continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced,  contingent  on  my  policy  rate  projection.  If  policy  were  not expected  to  tighten  over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  would  view  inflation  risks  as  tilted  to  the  upside. Incoming  data suggest  that  inflation  has  moved  back  up  to  target.  My  modal  forecast  is  that  I  will  be  able  to  say  by  year-end  that inflation  is  at  2  percent  on  a  sustainable  basis  and  I  expect  it  to  remain  near  2  percent  over  the  medium  run.

ff changes,  they  should ff changes If  the  dynamics  of  inflation  have  fundamentally  changed,  then  I  may  be  overestimating  inflation.  But  if  labor markets  tighten  more  than  I  expect,  or  if  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  begin  to  kick  in,  inflation  could  move higher  than  I  anticipate,  especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  slower  than  I've  assumed. Tariffs  present  firms  with  an  opportunity  to  raise  prices.  To  the  extent  that  these  are  one-o not  raise  the  inflation  rate.  However,  a  continued  roll-out  of  tariffs  over  time  could  lead  to  continued  one-o in  inflation;  this  could  push  up  inflation  expectations  and  lead  to  higher  inflation  rates  over  time.

The  value  of  the  dollar  has  been  rising  since  the  spring. I expect  further  appreciation  given  the  strength  of the  U.S.  economy  and  prospects  for  tighter  monetary  policy  relative  to  growth  and  monetary  policy  abroad.  But the  risks  around  the  path  of  the  dollar  are  two-sided. A  considerably  stronger-than-expected  appreciation  in  the dollar  poses  a  downside  risk  to  the  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  are  increasing  as  the  economy  continues  to  grow  above  trend  and  financial  conditions remain  quite  accommodative.  Domestic  equity  prices  continue  to  be  high  relative  to  earnings  even  accounting  for the  low  level  of  interest  rates  and  lower  tax  rates.  Commercial  real  estate  valuations  also  continue  to  be  lofty,  and leveraged  lending  is  growing.

Respondent 13: China's  debt  problems  continue  to  pose  a  downside  risk  to  the  world  economy.  That  risk  is further  exacerbated  by  the  trade  situation.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: With  regard  to  growth,  the  large  NIPA  revision  to  the  personal  saving  rate  presents  both upside  and  downside  risks  to  consumer  spending:  an  upside  risk  if  the  higher  saving  rate  represents  yet-to-be  spent wealth;  a  downside  risk  if  it  represents  more  persistent  post-crisis  precautionary  behavior  than  we  assume  in  our forecast.  Overall,  we  see  the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  fiscal  policy  will  result  in  a  bit  more,  or  a  bit  less,  stimulus than  we  built  into  our  projection.  Trade  and  international  developments  pose  a  downside  risk:  Trade  war  scenarios appear  to  have  become  more  likely,  and  there  is  a  small  risk  that  turmoil  in  selected  emerging  market  economies could  weigh  on  global  investor  sentiment. However,  we  do  not  think  that  these  risks  have  risen  enough  to  tilt  the overall  balance  to  the  downside.

With  regard  to  inflation,  there  is  a  risk  that  we've  underestimated  the  underlying  inflationary  pressures  in  our forecast,  particularly  given  our  projection  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  run  a  good  deal  below  our  estimate of  its  natural  rate  over  the  projection  period. There  also  is  a  risk  that  tariffs  could  show  through  more  visibly  to consumer  prices. However,  on  the  downside,  continued  low  levels  of  inflation  compensation  in  financial  markets and  some  surveys  suggest  long  run  inflation  expectations  could  hold  down  inflation  more  than  we  assume  in  our forecast.  In  addition,  some  of  the  international  risks  noted  above  could  lead  to  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  lower U.S.  inflation.

Respondent 16: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced.  There  still  remains  uncertainty  about the  effects  of  tax  and  budget  changes  on  the  economic  outlook.  The  possibility  of  further  retaliatory  responses  to U.S.  trade  policies  adds  additional  risk  around  the  outlook.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Although  inflation  is  essentially  back  to  target,  it  had  been  running  below  our  2  percent  target for  quite  some  time. While  job  gains  remain  strong  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  below  4  percent,  it  is  not  clear that  we  have  reached  maximum  employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population ratio  for  prime  age  persons  remain  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued.  Given  the persistent  undershooting  of  our  inflation  target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy  implies  a  very  gradual path  of  increases  for  the  federal  funds  rate  up  to  its  neutral  level.

Respondent 2: Policy  to  date  has  kept  nominal  demand  growth  on  a  fairly  steady,  moderate  path.  This  gives me hopethat arelativelygradual transitionto a modestly restrictive monetary policy stancewillbe sufficient to put the  economy  on  a  path  that  sustains  the  expansion  while  holding  inflation  to  mandate-consistent  levels.  There  are two  important  risks  to  that  scenario,  working  in  opposite  directions.  First,  there  is  a  risk  of  disappointing  growth or  financial  instability  overseas  that  could  blow  back  onto  U.S.  financial  markets,  putting  downward  pressure  on r*. Shifting  U.S.  trade  policy  is  unhelpful  in  this  regard. Second,  there  is  a  risk  that  U.S.  fiscal  policy  will  have larger  or  more  persistent  positive  effects  on  real  activity  and  r*  than  I  currently  anticipate.  My  base  case  is  for  four more  rate  hikes  over  the  remainder  of  2018  and  2019,  but  I  will  be  keeping  a  close  watch  for  signs  of  strain  in  foreign financial  markets,  shifts  in  the  U.S.  economic  outlook,  and  changes  in  the  shape  of  the  U.S.  yield  curve.

Respondent 3: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  three  years  is a  bit  lower  than  in  my  June  projection. I see  one  more  rate  increase  in  2018  as  appropriate,  followed  by  two  rate increases  in  each  of  2019  and  2020.  In  the  face  of  high  uncertainty  about  the  underlying  strength  of  inflation,  and elevated  uncertainty  surrounding  fiscal  and  trade  policies,  I  believe  it  appropriate  that  the  Committee  takes  a cautious  approach  in  raising  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 4: A  target  of  2.13  percent  for  the  forecast  horizon  is  consistent  with  our  assessment  of  current economic  conditions  and  for  the  convergence  of  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  to  their  values  in  a  regime characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. A  target of  2.13  percent  is  also  consistent  with  maintaining  inflation  on  target. We  view  monetary  policy  as  having  been pre-emptive  and  that  additional  increases  in  the  funds  rate  would  be  inappropriate  given  our  projections. In  the event  of  a  regime  change,  such  as  a  shift  from  low  productivity  growth  to  high  productivity  growth,  our  target federal  funds  rate  will  change.

Respondent 5: Inmyview, appropriatemonetarypolicycallsforamovetoaneutralstance,butnotmaterially beyond  this. I have  revised  up  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by  25  basis points,  consistent  with  the  upward  drift  in  statistical  estimates  of  r*.

Respondent 6: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability.  The  economy  has  gone  beyond  full  capacity  and  we  have essentially  achieved  price  stability,  yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2018. That  the  federal  funds  rate  is  still  low  despite  the  economy's  return  to  full employment  and  price  stability  reflects  the  Committee's  past  decisions,  and  I  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  federal funds  rate  as  important  to  promote  economic  and  financial  stability.  I  believe  the  funds  rate  will  need  to  rise  above its  longer-run  level  in  2019  and  beyond.

Respondent 7: With  the  economy  running  already  beyond  full  employment  and  a  policy  stance  that  is  still accommodative,  it  is  difficult  to  chart  an  appropriate  path  for  policy.  A  swift  tightening  of  policy  could  increase  the probability  of  a  recession  in  ways  that  our  linear  models  are  unable  to  capture.  Our  projected  path  for  the  federal funds  rate  tries  to  balance  this  concern  against  the  concern  that  running  an  economy  above  full  employment  for  a prolonged  period  of  time  might  create  distortions  that,  too,  increase  the  probability  of  a  future  downturn.  Given the  underlying  momentum  in  real  activity,  it  may  be  appropriate  to  front-load  some  of  the  increases  in  the  federal funds  rate,  and  then  raise  the  funds  rate  more  gradually  in  2020  and  2021  as  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  turns restrictive.  Such  a  strategy  would  reduce  the  scope  for  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate,  while  providing policymakers  with  more  time  later  to  assess  how  the  economy  responds  to  a  contractionary  stance,  thus  lowering the  risk  of  tipping  the  economy  into  a  recession.

Respondent 8: Before  this  meeting  the  real  funds  rate  was  negative,  indicating  an  accomodative  monetary policy. Real  growth  in  this  submission  is  well  above  trend  for  a  considerable  period,  and  labor  markets  are  tight. Inflation  expectations  appear  well  anchored. Under  these  conditions  I  believe  the  federal  funds  rate  needs  to increase. I am  comfortable  with  continuing  on  a  gradual  path  of  funds  rate  increases  while  we  continually  assess new  information  to  determine  whether  a  different  path  might  be  appropriate.  As  real  growth  slows  while  inflaiton remains  near  target  I  believe  that  it  will  become  appropriate  to  raise  rates  more  slowly. I also  believe  that  our balance  sheet  normalization  should  remain  on  autopilot.

Respondent 9: My  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  not  changed  since  the previous  SEP.

Respondent 10: The  principal  factors  behind  my  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are my  estimate  of  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest,  my  economic  outlook,  and  the  balance  of  risks  around  that  outlook.

Even  though  a  number  of  point  estimates  for  the  natural  rate  have  risen  following  the  comprehensive  revision to  the  NIPA,  given  the  uncertainty  around  those  estimates,  the  magnitudes  of  those  increases  have  not  yet  been sufficient  to  lead  me  to  raise  my  estimate  of 1 / 2 percent. However,  I  will  be  monitoring  closely  future  data  and estimates  to  determine  if  an  adjustment  to  my  assumption  is  necessary.

With  my  economic  outlook  and  risk  assessment  fundamentally  little  different  from  June  and  no  change  in  my natural  rate  assumption,  there  is  little  change  in  my  federal  funds  rate  path  from  June: the  target  federal  funds rate  ranges  at  the  end  of  2018,  2019  and  2020  are  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / 2 percent,  3 1 / 4 - 3 1 / 2 percent  and  3 1 / 2 - 3 3 / 4 percent, respectively. I anticipate  that  the  target  range  for  2021  will  also  be  3 1 / 2 - 3 3 / 4 percent. Consequently,  I  envision that  the  policy  rate  moderately  overshoots  its  longer-run  level  in  2019  -  2021  and  probably  somewhat  beyond,  as policy  acts  to  unwind  the  overshooting  of  inflation  and  tight  labor  market  conditions.  Even  so,  this  path  is  flatter than  some  simple  policy  rules  suggest,  reflecting  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only  gradually  toward  our  longer-run objective.

Respondent 11: I am  ex  ante  somewhat  more  optimistic  about  u*  than  are  some  others  on  the  FOMC,  but also acknowledgethereisgreateruncertaintyaboutthisandotherparametersthaninthepast.  Mybaseline/modal view  is  that,  while  it  will  likely  be  necessary  over  the  next  several  years  for  monetary  policy  to  enter  into  restrictive territory  so  as  to  contain  any  overshoot  of  core  inflation  -  as  has  been  the  case  in  prior  rate  hike  cycles,  I  expect the  required  adjustment  in  the  policy  rate  to  maintain  price  stability  may  be  more  modest  (relative  to  my  point estimate  for  long  run  r*)  than  in  some  past  cycles. In  making  this  assessment,  I  am  factoring  in  that  over  the scenario  horizon,  the  relative  stance  of  US  fiscal  policy  and  Treasury  supply  may  push  up  the  real  term  premium on  government  bonds,  and  that  the  relative  stance  of  US  monetary  policy  will  give  support  to  some  further  dollar appreciation.  Were  this  to  occur,  the  longer  run  policy  rate  consistent  with  our  dual  mandate  would  be  somewhat

lower  than  if  the  real  term  premium  remains  depressed  and  the  dollar  does  not  further  appreciate. Of  course, neither  of  these  is  pre-ordained,  and  there  remains  significant  uncertainty  about  the  point  at  which  policy  inflects from  accommodative  to  restrictive.  But  my  modal  scenario  is  as  described  above  and  reflected  in  my  projections.

Respondent 12: The  policy  rate  has  been  moving  toward  the  range  of  estimates  of  the  neutral  rate. There has  been  a  compelling  case  to  move  the  policy  rate  up  given  the  economy's  strength  -  characterized  by  above-trend growth  and  tight  labor  markets  -  and  the  fact  that  inflation  has  moved  to  2  percent.  We  are  now  getting  closer  to a  new  phase  in  which  to  determine  appropriate  policy  settings  the  Committee  needs  to  be  even  more  attentive  to the  evolution  of  economic  conditions  and  their  implications  for  the  medium  run  outlook  and  the  risks  around  the outlook.

Mymodaloutlookisfortheeconomyandlabormarketstoremainstrongovertheforecasthorizon.  Iprojectthat growth  will  be  above  trend  over  the  period  2018-2020  before  returning  to  trend  in  2021  and  that  the  unemployment rate  will  be  well  below  my  4.5  percent  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level. Labor  markets  are  tight  and  wages  are accelerating.  I  anticipate  that  further  tightening  in  the  labor  market  will  translate  into  some  continued  firming  in the  labor  compensation  measures,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill groups.  However,  given  slow  productivity  growth,  I  expect  wages  to  rise  at  a  slower  pace  than  in  past  expansions.

Inflation  has  essentially  returned  to  our  2  percent  target  and  I  expect  it  to  remain  near  this  level  -  with  the usual  volatility  in  the  monthly  data  -  through  the  forecast  horizon. Firms  are  reporting  increased  ability  to  raise prices  for  their  customers.  Inflation  expectations  are  well  anchored.  My  modal  projection  is  that  I  will  be  able  to say  by  year-end  that  inflation  is  sustainably  at  our  goal.

ff of  increasing  financial  market  imbalances. To  reach  these  outcomes,  my  policy  path  includes  further  fed  funds  rate  increases  in  2019,  with  the  policy  rate holding  at  this  level  until  sometime  in  2021. In  my  view,  this  path  prudently  balances  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for both  parts  of  our  mandate,  as  well  as  helps  to  take  some  pressure  o With  above-trend  growth,  labor  markets  beyond  full  employment,  and  inflation  at  2  percent,  I  believe  it  will  be appropriate  for  the  funds  rate  to  rise  somewhat  above  my  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent  in  order  to  promote  our longer-run  goals  of  maximum  employment  and  price  stability.

ff analysis,  longer-run Respondent 13: My  funds  rate  path  reflects  the  balancing  of  two  key  considerations. First,  owing  in  large part  to  fiscal  policy,  the  short-run  neutral  rate  is  likely  rising,  and  may  exceed  its  long-run  level  before  too  long.  As  a consequence,  the  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  higher  than  it  would  otherwise  be.  Moreover,  with  the  path  for  the neutral  rate  pushing  toward  an  inverted  yield  curve,  it  is  not  surprising  that  some  of  that  pressure  will  be  manifest in the  actual  outcomes  for  interest  rates. At  the  same  time,  it  is  likely  that,  as  in  the  sta underlying  inflation  is  running  somewhat  below  the  Committee's  2  percent  target. One  important  contribution the  Committee  can  make  to  boosting  underlying  inflation  will  be  actively  signaling  that  the  Committee  is  serious about  achieving  its  target  -  which  will  require  patience  in  raising  the  funds  rate. A  gradual  path  of  funds  rate increases,  along  the  lines  I  have  penciled  in  above,  will  most  appropriately  balance  these  opposing  forces.

I  have  revised  up  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  by  1/4  percentage  point.  My  upward  revision reflects  the  accumulated  effects  of  recent  news:  As  can  be  seen  in  the  exhibit  in  the  Tealbook,  model  estimates  of the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  have  been  drifting  up  recently,  and  the  central  tendency  is  now  closer  to  1  percent in real  terms  than  my  previous  assumption  of  3/4  percent. Supporting  the  notion  that  estimates  of  longer-run interest  rates  have  been  moving  up,  ten-year  Treasury  yields  are  higher  now  than  they  were  six  months  ago.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Given  the  solid  path  of  underlying  growth,  we  now  assume  there  will  be  four  funds  rate increases  in  2018,  leaving  the  rate  in  the  range  of  2 1 / 4 to  2 1 / 2 percent  at  the  end  of  the  year.  Thereafter,  we  assume a  gradual  increase  in  the  funds  rate  to  the  3  to  3 1 / 4 percent  range  by  the  second  half  of  2019,  at  which  point  we  hold it  steady  through  2021.  We  assume  balance  sheet  normalization  proceeds  according  to  the  announced  plan.

For  some  time,  our  view  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  has  been  predicated  on  the  funds  rate  increasing  only gradually  in  order  to  firm  inflation  expectations  symmetrically  about  2  percent  and  ensure  that  inflation  achieves our  objective  on  a  sustainable  basis. A  number  of  factors  suggest  this  approach  is  working  and  that  underlying inflation  and  some  measures  of  inflation  expectations  are  headed  in  the  right  direction. In the  absence  of  any surprises,  we  think  it  will  be  appropriate  to  gradually  move  the  funds  rate  into  a  modestly  restrictive  stance  and then  pause  to  see  if  this  setting  is  consistent  with  output  and  the  unemployment  rate  returning  to  their  long-run

normal  rates  in  a  measured  fashion. We  believe  holding  the  funds  rate  in  the  3  to  3 1 / 4 percent  range  -  which  is modestly  above  our  2.75  percent  assumption  for  the  neutral  rate  -  will  achieve  this  goal. Our  policy  trajectory  is consistent  with  some  modest  overshooting  of  our  2  percent  inflation  objective  in  2020  and  2021,  which  we  see  as  a virtue  that  will  help  to  firm  inflation  expectations  symmetrically  around  the  2  percent  target.

Respondent 16: The  labor  market  has  exceeded  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  and  I  expect it to continue  to  strengthen  over  the  next  couple  of  years  with  impetus  from  fiscal  policy. Given  the  strong momentum  in  the  economy,  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  3.4  percent  by  next  year.  With  the  economy above  potential,  I  anticipate  inflation  will  modestly  overshoot  our  2  percent  objective  beginning  in  2019.There  are a number  of  factors  that  suggest  the  natural  rate  of  interest  has  increased. This  includes  the  completion  of  the post-crisis  deleveraging,  a  higher  federal  budget  deficit,  and  persistent  tailwinds  from  deregulation  and  corporate tax  reform.  This  inference  is  corroborated  by  a  broad  range  of  model-based  estimates  which  show  that  the  natural rate  of  interest  has  recently  risen. In  light  of  this  evidence,  I  have  raised  my  assessment  of  the  natural  rate  to 3 / 4 percent.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest. My  fed  funds  rate  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  rules would  suggest.  This  reflects  an  inflation  rate  that  has  been  rising  only  gradually  toward  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term,  I  envision  a  path  for  the  fed  funds  rate  that  moderately  overshoots  its  long-run  level  in  2019 through  2021  as  policy  acts  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in  inflation  and  labor  market  conditions.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Core  inflation  is  now  back  to  target  and  the  economy  continues  to  add  jobs  with  modest increases  in  wage  growth.  This  reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  may  be  some  slack  left  in  the  economy.

Respondent 2: Near  term,  expansionary  fiscal  policy  and  accommodative  monetary  policy  are  pushing  real activity  forward  at  a  rapid  clip,  increasing  pressure  on  an  already  strained  labor  market.  With  longer-run  inflation expectations  well-anchored,  the  tightening  labor  market  is  likely  to  drive  inflation  past  our  2-percent  longerrun  objective. In this  setting  it  is appropriate  that  we  continue  to  move  toward  a  neutral  policy  stance  while remaining  cognizant  of  potential  shifts  in  financial-market  conditions  and  inflation  pressures.  The  longer  that  we maintain  growth  above  potential,  the  more  difficult  it  will  be  to  achieve  a  smooth  transition  to  sustainable  growth with  stable,  on-target  inflation. Over  the  medium  and  longer  runs,  I  continue  to  be  concerned  about  eroding demographic  trends,  education  and  skill  levels  that  are  not  keeping  pace  with  business  needs  and  are  contributing to  sluggish  productivity  growth,  and  the  likely  unsustainable  path  of  U.S.  government  debt  relative  to  GDP.

Respondent 3: My  forecast  calls  for  above  trend  growth  of  3  percent  in  2018,  edging  down  to  2  percent  in 2020  and  2021.  My  near-term  forecast  is  slightly  higher  than  in  June  based  on  the  strength  of  incoming  data.  My uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  on  output  growth  and  inflation  going  forward  remains  elevated, especially  given  the  economy's  high  level  of  resource  utilization. As  well,  uncertainty  about  trade  policy  and  the potential  for  escalating  trade  frictions  with  our  trading  partners  is  of  concern. I expect  the  unemployment  rate to  remain  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  as  output  grows  at  a  healthy  pace  and the  labor  force  participation  rate  edges  down. I anticipate  that  inflation  will  run  slightly  above  the  Committee's target  in  2019  and  2020  before  returning  to  target  in  2021.  With  above-trend  output  growth,  low  unemployment, and  slightly  above-target  inflation  over  the  next  two  years  I  anticipate  a  gradual  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate to  a  level  only  slightly  above  my  longer  run  projection.

Respondent 4: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  US  economy.  In our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them. The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. We  are,  however,  paying  close  attention  to  many  factors,  such  as  the  effects  of  either  regulatory  or  tax policy  changes,  which  might  move  the  economy  to  a  high  productivity  state.  Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes,  such as  ones  associated  with  the  previously  mentioned  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may  be  a ffected and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting  when  these transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast  that  the  economy  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 5: Real  GDP  growth,  in  my  outlook,  grows  at  an  above  trend  pace  this  year  and  next,  before settling  down  to  trend  in  2020. A  stronger  profile  to  consumer  spending  owing  to  the  recent  tax  reform  is  the primary  driver  of  the  moderate  overshoot  of  potential  growth.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  upside.  Recent  tax  cuts  could  have  a  much  more  transformative impact  on  investment  and  growth  than  I  currently  expect. While  not  a  feature  of  my  baseline  outlook,  the  latest data(andtherecentNIPArevisions)havehighlightedthepossibilitythatproductivitygrowthmaybeaccelerating, which  would  boost  overall  growth.

Measured inflation  appears  to  be  running  at  or  very  close  to  target.  Given  the  absence  of  slack  in  my  projection, I see  inflation  continuing  at  or  modestly  above  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective  through  2021.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  upside. Given  high  rates  of  resource  utilization,  we  could see  a  more  pronounced  inflation  response  than  a  linear  Phillips  curve  would  suggest.  Also,  additional  tariffs  could increase  the  pressure  on  firms'  costs  and  consumer  prices,  leading  to  higher  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 6: Central  economic  outlook:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend growth  from  2018  to  2020,  where  supportive  financial  conditions  and  fiscal  policy  stimulus  are  the  main  factors boosting  growth  above  trend.  With  the  economy  already  beyond  full  capacity,  the  growth  forecast  indicates  that the  gap  between  real  GDP  and  its  potential  level  will  widen  further. Consistently,  I  expect  headline  and  core inflation  to  rise  modestly  above  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad. The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly balanced.  Onthedownside,morerestrictivetradeandimmigrationpoliciescoulddampeneconomicgrowth.  Softer data  abroad  and  financial  stress  in  emerging  market  economies  have  put  upward  pressure  on  the  dollar,  posing downside  risk  to  economic  growth  and  inflation. Upside  risks  to  my  forecast  stem  from  greater-than-expected momentum  in  the  economy  and  the  possibility  that  deregulation  and  elevated  business  confidence  translate  into sustained  increases  in  investment  and  productivity.

Respondent 7: Incoming  data  since  the  June  projections  have  been  roughly  in  line  with  expectations. Underlying  momentum  in  real  activity  is  somewhat  stronger  than  previously  thought,  but  a  sizable  cyclical  rebound in labor  force  participation  has  prevented  steeper  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate. Some  of  the  supports  to activity  in  the  first  half  of  the  year,  most  notably  net  exports,  are  unlikely  to  persist  going  forward.  Still,  financial conditions  remain  favorable,  mainly  as  a  result  of  higher  equity  prices  and  higher  personal  income  than  previously thought.  Given  the  underlying  momentum,  financial  conditions,  and  the  ongoing  fiscal  stimulus,  we  expect  growth in  the  second  half  of  the  year  to  continue  to  outstrip  potential.  As  interest  rates  rise  gradually  and  the  effect  of  the fiscal  stimulus  becomes  less  pronounced,  we  expect  real  activity  to  slow  down  to  a  pace  near  potential  near  the  end of  2019  and  2020.  By  2021,  the  rate  of  growth  is  expected  to  fall  below  potential  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  rise marginally,  but  still  remain  one  full  percentage  point  below  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate. With  the  unemployment  rate  projected  to  stay  well  below  its  equilibrium  level  over  the  forecast  horizon,  inflation is  expected  to  increase  above  2  percent,  albeit  by  a  relatively  modest  amount.

Our  forecast  continues  to  be  conditioned  on  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  that  by  the  end  of  the  forecast horizon  steer  policy  to  a  stance  that  is  only  moderately  restrictive.  By  historical  standards,  this  is  a  cautious  pace of  policy  tightening  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  already  below  its  estimated  equilibrium  level. Such  an approach  tries  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  risks  associated  with  an  even  more  gradual  increase  in  rates,  and the  risk  that  faster  policy  tightening  may  increase  the  probability  of  the  economy  falling  into  a  recession. It is nevertheless  important  to  recognize  that  the  past  does  not  provide  much  guidance  in  terms  of  how  to  conduct policy  so  as  to  achieve  a  soft  landing  when  the  economy  is  beyond  full  employment.

We  view  the  risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced  in  the  near  term.  We  maintain  a  fairly conservative  view  of  the  effect  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  on  GDP  growth,  and  it  is  possible  that  the  tax  cuts will  stimulate  activity  by  a  cumulative  amount  that  is  greater  than  what  we  are  currently  expecting. We  take into  account  in  our  forecast  the  impact  of  the  enacted  tariffs  and  the  ones  scheduled  to  go  into  effect  soon. While the  estimated  impact  so  far  is  small,  there  are  more  substantial  risks  to  activity  associated  with  additional  trade policy  actions. In  the  medium  term,  the  ability  to  achieve  a  soft  landing  remains  questionable,  and  a  scenario such  as  the  one  outlined  in  the  Tealbook  ( 'Recession  ' )  in  which  the  economy  eventually  falls  into  a  recession  as monetary  policy  tries  to  move  the  unemployment  rate  back  up  to  its  equilibrium  level  would  find  several  historical precedents. The  probability  of  such  a  scenario  would  be  even  higher  if  in  the  presence  of  persistently  tight  labor market  conditions  inflation  reacts  more  forcefully,  thus  eliciting  a  stronger  monetary  policy  response.  As  concerns the  unemployment  rate,  the  ongoing  and  projected  increase  in  payrolls  runs  the  risk  of  not  being  met  by  the  cyclical increases  in  labor  force  participation  envisioned  in  our  baseline  forecast,  but  rather  by  a  steeper  decline  in  the unemployment  rate.  Finally,  an  unemployment  rate  below  4  percent  for  an  extended  period  of  time  runs  the  risk of  eliciting  a  nonlinear  response  in  inflation,  even  if  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  turns  out  to  be  lower  than what  we  are  currently  estimating.

Respondent 8: I believe  that  fiscal  stimulus  has  temporarily  boosted  real  GDP  growth,  and  will  soon  begin to  wear  o  . Strong  business  and  consumer  sentiment,  however,  are  likely  to  support  above-trend  growth  for  some time.  Beyond  this  year  I  expect  supply  constraints  to  become  more  prominent  and  become  a  headwind  for  growth. I  believe  that  business  practices  will  make  it  difficult  for  inflation  to  rise  rapidly,  even  with  above-trend  real  growth and  tight  labor  markets.

Respondent 9: The  main  factors  shaping  my  economic  outlook  include  an  increasingly  strong  labor  market, still-supportive  domestic  financial  conditions,  accommodative  domestic  fiscal  policy,  and  more  data  suggesting that  inflation  will  stay  around  2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis.

Respondent 10: The  recent  data  indicate  that  the  economy  has  continued  to  expand  at  a  pace  above  its potentialgrowthrate.  Thisgrowthhasledtofurthertighteningofthelabormarket,eventhoughtheunemployment rate  is  little  changed  since  my  June  SEP  submission.  Over  the  rest  of  this  year,  fiscal  stimulus,  ongoing  strength  in personal  disposable  income  and  high  household  wealth  should  support  consumer  spending  growth. Robust  final demand  and  continued  business  optimism  should  help  contribute  to  solid  growth  in  most  categories  of  business fixed  investment.  One  sector  that  recently  has  been  soft  is  residential  investment,  which  has  been  a ffected  by  rising mortgage  rates,  and  I  expect  it  will  remain  soft  through  the  rest  of  this  year.

Given  this  backdrop  as  well  as  continued  fiscal  stimulus  and  some  monetary  accommodation,  I  anticipate  that real  GDP  growth  through  the  rest  of  this  year  and  the  next  will  be  at  a  pace  well  above  potential.  With  continued strong  growth,  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  to  just  under  3 1 / 2 percent  by  the  end  of  next  year  and  core PCE  inflation  to  reach  our  objective  of  2  percent.

The  combination  of  a  gradually  tighter  monetary  policy  stance  and  the  fading  of  fiscal  stimulus  (although, as  in  the  Tealbook  projection,  I  assume  that  discretionary  federal  spending  is  held  constant  in  real  terms  in  2020 and  beyond,  which  would  require  legislative  action  to  raise  the  nominal  discretionary  spending  caps)  leads  to  a slowdown  of  growth  to  around  potential  in  2020  and  modestly  below  potential  in  2021. With  slower  growth,  the unemployment rate  begins  to  rise  gradually,  but  it  remains  well  below  its  longer-run  normal  rate  at  the  end  of  2021. With  resource  utilization  remaining  tight,  inflation  rises  and  is  modestly  above  the  FOMC  objective  in  2020  and 2021.  A  still-moderately  tight  monetary  policy  and  little  impetus  from  fiscal  policy  contribute  to  bring  inflation, growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  longer-run  normal  levels  by  the  middle  of  the  next  decade.

Respondent 11: The  US  economy  and  labor  market  have  been  surprising  on  the  upside  for  nearly  two  years. It  is  impossible  to  know  with  any  precision  how  much  of  this  is  due  to  good  luck,  good  policy,  a  fiscal  sugar  high  ,  or just  noise  that  will  soon  mean  revert.  My  prior  - which  I  will  update  as  new  data  arrives  - is  that  the  economy  may have  hit  bottom  on  trend  growth  and  that  u*  may  be  somewhat  lower  than  I  would  have  though  a  year  or  two  ago. However,  with  inflation  now  essentially  at  our  LR  objective  of  2  percent,  prudent  risk  management  - and  elevated uncertainty  about  u*  - suggests  a  policy  of  continued  gradual  increases  in  the  policy  rate  is  likely  to  be  appropriate for  some  time  to  come.

Respondent 12: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable.  Financial  conditions  remain accommodativedespitethegradualpathofrateincreasestheCommitteehasputinplace.  Householdbalancesheets have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession;  labor  markets  continue  to  strengthen;  monetary  is  accommodative;  and fiscal  policy  -  tax  cuts  and  additional  government  spending  -  is  expansionary. Despite  uncertainty  around  trade and  tariff  policies,  consumers  and  businesses  are  quite  optimistic.  There  has  been  somewhat  stronger  underlying momentum  in  the  economy  than  I'd  been  assuming. Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  ongoing tightnessinlabormarkets,andmorewidespreaddifficultiesinfindingqualifiedworkers.  Inresponsetheyhavebeen increasing  wages  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations. The  global  outlook  remains  generally  positive, although  activity  appears  to  be  decelerating  and  financial  stresses  are  rising,  especially  in  some  emerging  market economies.

I project  growth  will  be  above  trend  over  2018-2020  before  returning  to  trend  in  2021,  and  that  labor  markets will  continue  to  be  strong,  with  the  unemployment  rate  moving  down  further  next  year  and  remaining  below  its longer-run  rate  through  2021.

Inflation  has  essentially  returned  to  our  2  percent  target  and  I  expect  to  be  able  to  say  it  is  sustainably  at  2 percent  by  year-end.  Inflation  expectations  are  well-anchored.  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  near  2  percent  -  with the  usual  volatility  in  the  monthly  data  -  through  the  forecast  horizon.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  the  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy and  inflation,  but  this  is  contingent  on  my  policy  rate  path,  which  includes  further  increases  in  the  fed  funds  rate next  year.

Respondent 13: Fiscal  policy  is  a  key  factor  in  my  outlook,  providing  a  boost  to  aggregate  demand  this  year and  next. With  the  unemployment  rate  already  significantly  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  value,  it  will  be

appropriate  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  several  years,  to  a  level  that  exceeds  that  in  the  longer  run. On  net,  GDP  growth  is  above  trend  this  year  and  next,  and  the  unemployment  rate  drops  to  3.4  percent  by  the  end of  next  year.

Several  factors  contribute  to  the  further  deceleration  in  GDP  growth  after  next  year: (i) Fading  impetus  to GDP  growth  from  fiscal  policy;  (ii)  a  stepping  down  in  the  economy's  underlying  momentum;  and  (iii)  elevated interest  rates.  By  2021,  GDP  growth  is  notably  below  potential  and  the  unemployment  rate  moves  up.  At  the  same time,  core  inflation  is  2-1/4  percent  in  2020  and  2021.  That  increase  in  inflation  is  appropriate  as  it  helps  convince the  public  the  Committee  is  serious  about  achieving  its  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target,  and  provides  some insurance  against  the  next  downturn. Still,  it  will  be  preferable  to  avoid  any  further  increase  in  inflation  beyond that  point; tighter  monetary  policy  and  reduced  resource  utilization  help  keep  those  risks  in  check. Financial vulnerabilities  are  also  greater  when  resource  utilization  is  stretched,  providing  an  additional  reason,  once  the medium-term  inflation  objective  is  met,  to  allow  growth  to  fall  below  potential.

Respondent 14: I  believe  that  the  economy  has  considerable  momentum,  helped  along  by  expansionary  fiscal policy.  Strong  growth  will  push  down  the  unemployment  rate,  but  by  a  fairly  modest  amount  as  workers  are  drawn into  the  workforce,  increasing  labor  force  participation. The  bu ffering  effect  of  higher  potential  growth,  both  in response  to  policy  changes  as  well  as  increased  investment  and  labor  force  participation,  will  limit  the  spillover  of growth  into  inflation.

Respondent 15: The  fundamentals  underlying  private  domestic  final  demand  remain  strong.  Accommodative  monetary  and  fiscal  policies,  a  robust  labor  market,  and  improved  balance  sheets  support  strong  gains  in consumer  spending  and  investment.  The  need  to  restock  inventories  should  add  to  growth  in  the  near  term  as  well. All  told,  we  expect  GDP  to  increase  3.2  percent  in  2018.  The  movement  of  monetary  policy  to  a  modestly  restrictive stance  and  a  diminishing  impulse  from  fiscal  policy  are  projected  to  bring  GDP  growth  down  to  2.4  percent  in  2019, 1.9  percent  in  2020,  and  1.6  percent  in  2021.  Our  assumptions  regarding  fiscal  policy  are  unchanged:  we  expect  the impetus  to  growth  from  fiscal  policy  to  be  close  to  1  percent  in  2018  and  then  to  decline  gradually  to  only  a  tenth or  two  in  2020;  the  impulse  then  turns  slightly  negative  in  2021.  Our  forecast  does  not  incorporate  any  additional changes  in  trade  or  immigration  policy. On  the  supply  side,  we  assume  that  robust  capital  spending,  due  in  part to  the  tax  bill,  will  provide  a  modest  transitory  boost  to  potential  growth  over  the  forecast  period,  raising  it  from a  bit  under  2  percent  now  to  a  bit  over  2  percent  by  2020. Our  assumption  for  long-run  potential  growth  remains at  1.8  percent.

We  think  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  currently  4.4  percent  and  that  it  will  fall  to  its  long-run  level  of 4.3  percent  by  2019. We  expect  the  actual  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  3.4  percent  in  2019  and  then  rise to  3.7  percent  by  the  end  of  2021.

Although  the  trend  in  inflation  appears  to  be  firming,  the  still-relatively-low  readings  on  some  key  measures suggest  that  inflation  expectations  have  not  yet  firmed  symmetrically  about  2  percent. Various  features  of  our forecast  will  help  boost  this  trend  closer  to  target. With  unemployment  forecast  to  undershoot  the  natural  rate substantially,  even  with  a  flat  Phillips  curve  resource  pressures  should  provide  a  lift  to  inflation  going  forward.  We also  rely  on  a  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2 percent  inflation  target  to  firm  inflation  expectations  around  2  percent.  A  non-accelerationist  Phillips  curve  limits the  upside  risk  to  inflation,  even  with  the  unemployment  rate  a  little  below  3  1/2  percent.  All  told,  we  expect  core inflation  to  be  2.0  percent  this  year,  then  to  rise  to  2.2  percent  in  2020  and  2021.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 16: The  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  strong  pace  relative  to  trend,  which  has  pushed  the unemploymentratelower.  Myforecastfactorsinasizableamountoffiscalstimulustotheeconomicoutlook.  Going forward,  ongoing  strength  in  household  disposable  income  coupled  with  past  gains  in  household  wealth  and  high consumer  confidence  should  support  continued  consumption  growth. The  outlook  for  fixed  business  investment also appears  strong  given  the  corporate  tax  changes  and  continued  optimism. However,  there  is  uncertainty regarding  the  impact  of  rising  oil  prices,  an  appreciating  U.S.  dollar,  and  possible  further  retaliatory  tariffs  from U.S.  trading  partners

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  expansion  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  well  above  potential. With considerable  fiscal  stimulus  and  some  monetary  accommodation  still  in  place,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for thenextfewyears,leadingtoafurtherpickupininflation.  Icontinuetoexpectinflationtoreachour2percenttarget

by  2019,  followed  by  a  slight  overshooting  that  continues  through  2021. Normalization  of  monetary  policy  and  a tightening  of  fiscal  policy  will  help  bring  inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable levels  by  the  following  years.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Long-term  interest  rates  and  model-based  estimates  of  the  long-run  funds  rate  have  moved up  a  bit,  causing  me  to  increase  my  estimate  of  the  long-run  federal  funds  rate. The  subdued  response  to  date  of wage  growth  to  low  unemployment  caused  me  to  edge  down  my  estimate  of  the  long-run  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 2: Marginally  stronger-than-expected  incoming  data  have  led  me  to  revise  my  GDP  growth projections  modestly  upward  in  2018  and  2019.  Labor  force  participation  has  been  a  touch  higher  than  expected over  the  first  half  of  the  year,  so  I  have  revised  my  outlook  for  the  unemployment  rate  at  the  end  of  2018  up  a  touch; beyond  2018,  my  outlook  for  labor  utilization-and  hence  for  inflation  and  the  appropriate  path  of  policy-is  little changed  since  the  last  projections  exercise.

Respondent 3: The  potential  for  adverse  effects  from  fiscal  policy  uncertainty  and  trade  policy  uncertainty have  led  me  to  be  more  cautious  about  the  appropriate  pace  of  monetary  policy  normalization.

Respondent 4: Recent  data,  as  well  as  some  upward  adjustments  reflecting  the  growth  impacts  of  fiscal  and regulatory  changes,  have  led  us  to  increase  our  projections  for  GDP  growth  for  2018,  2019,  and  2020.

Respondent 5: The  economic  data  released  since  the  June  meeting  has  come  in  above  my  expectations.  I  view some  of  this  surprise  strength  as  reflecting  transitory  or  idiosyncratic  factors. That  said,  I  have  taken  on  board some  of  the  acceleration  in  consumer  spending,  pulling  some  of  that  momentum  into  2019.

I have  marked  up  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  modestly,  reflecting  its  recent  flattening  out  and  an assumption  that  the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  remain  relatively  flat.

The  latest  data  on  consumer  prices  suggests  inflation  this  year  will  likely  be  a  slightly  below  my  previous projection.

Respondent 6: I have  revised  up  my  assumption  for  the  broad  exchange  value  of  the  dollar,  reflecting  a downgraded  foreign  growth  outlook  from  early  in  the  year  and  increased  financial  stress  in  emerging  market economies.  As  a  result,  I  view  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  as  somewhat  lower  than  in  June.

Respondent 7: Revisions  to  the  outlook  have  been  minor. The  modest  downward  revision  to  the  projected path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  implies  that  the  unemployment  reaches  a  level  in  2020  that  is  marginally  lower  than in  our  previous  forecast.

Respondent 8: ThissubmissionislittlechangedfrommyJunesubmission.  Ihavenotchangedmyassumptions about  fiscal  or  trade  policies.

Respondent 9: My  projection  has  not  changed  all  that  much  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 10: The  developments  since  June  have  been  largely  in  accord  with  my  economic  outlook  at that  time. In  addition,  these  developments  did  not  lead  me  to  make  any  substantive  changes  to  my  longer-run assumptions.  Consequently,  my  projections  have  not  changed  substantially  since  the  June  SEP.

Respondent 11: No  significant  change  to  my  outlook  since  June.

Respondent 12: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  is  similar  to  that  in  June. Economic  fundamentals  remain healthy,  consumer  and  business  sentiment  are  at  high  levels,  and  fiscal  policy  will  add  to  growth  over  the  forecast horizon.  Incoming  data  suggests  stronger  momentum  so  I  have  edged  up  my  growth  forecast  and  edged  down  my unemployment rate  forecast  over  the  projection  horizon.  I  expect  growth  to  be  above  trend  over  the  next  two  years, which  puts  addition  downward  pressure  on  the  unemployment  rate  and  keeps  it,  over  the  forecast  horizon,  below my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate.  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  near  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.

The  policy  rate  has  been  moving  toward  the  range  of  estimates  of  the  neutral  rate.  There  has  been  a  compelling case  to  move  the  policy  rate  up  given  the  economy's  strength  -  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  and  tight  labor markets  -  and  the  fact  that  inflation  has  moved  to  2  percent.  We  are  now  getting  closer  to  a  new  phase  in  which  to determine  appropriate  policy  settings  the  Committee  needs  to  be  even  more  attentive  to  the  evolution  of  economic conditions  and  their  implications  for  the  medium  run  outlook  and  the  risks  around  the  outlook.  My  medium-run forecasted  outcomes  are  contingent  on  a  policy  path  that  includes  further  fed  funds  rate  increases  in  2019,  with the  policy  rate  holding  at  this  level  until  sometime  in  2021. I view  this  fed  funds  path  as  prudently  balancing  the risks  to  our  dual-mandate  goals,  as  well  as  helping  to  contain  developing  financial  imbalances.  My  funds  rate  path is  similar  to  my  June  projection.

Respondent 13: An  important  factor  driving  my  revision  since  the  previous  SEP  has  been  the  incoming  data, notably  on  spending. While  the  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  slightly  higher  than  anticipated  in  June,  the LFPR  has  also  been  firmer. Overall,  I  view  resource  utilization  as  tighter  than  in  June. I expect  some  of  the economy's  recent  momentum  to  carry  forward  into  next  year.  The  stronger  economy  merits  a  slightly  steeper  path for  the  federal  funds  rate,  and  so  my  funds  rate  projection  is  25  basis  points  higher  at  the  end  of  next  year  and  in 2020. The  latest  round  of  tariffs  boosts  my  2019  inflation  outlook  by  0.1  percentage  point  beyond  what  it  would otherwise  be.

Respondent 14: My  outlook  is  little  changed.

Respondent 15: Onnet,ourGDPgrowthforecastislittlechangedcomparedwithJune.  Wetookonboardthe strength  in  the  spending  data  received  since  June  and  raised  our  growth  forecast  in  2018  by  two-tenths,  but  made no  changes  to  the  growth  outlook  for  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  period.  In  light  of  the  NIPA  revisions,  we  made some  small  changes  to  our  estimates  of  potential  growth  that  boosted  our  output  gap  a  bit. The  unemployment rate  has  not  moved  down  as  we  expected  in  June.  In  the  near  term,  our  projected  gap  between  the  unemployment rate  and  the  natural  rate  is  a  bit  smaller  than  in  June,  but  by  2020  it  is  unchanged  from  our  previous  forecast.  This still  leaves  us  with  a  small  Okun's  Law  error  at  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

In light of the  firmer  inflation  trends  apparent  since  June, we  raised  our  forecast  for  core  inflation  by  0.1 percentage  point  in  2019  and  2020. In  response,  we  made  monetary  policy  slightly  less  accommodative,  moving one  rate  increase  forward  from  2019  into  2018. Our  forecast  continues  to  overshoot  the  inflation  target  modestly in  2020  and  2021.

Respondent 16: My  forecast  has  changed  little  from  the  June  SEP.  My  assumptions  about  the  effects  of  fiscal stimulus  on  the  economic  outlook  are  unchanged;  however,  I  have  edged  up  the  near-term  inflation  forecast  based on  recent  trade  policy.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  my  forecasts for  economic  activity  and inflation  are  a  touch  stronger. I believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  keep  the  labor force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job  growth  on  the  unemployment rate. I believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually  than  in  the  Tealbook. Even with  lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  be  just  barely  above  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 2: Despite  a  fed  funds  rate  path  that  is  considerably  less  aggressive  than  that  of  the  Tealbook, I see slightly more  of  a deceleration  in  real  activity  from  2018  to  2020. I expect  that  slowing  will  cause  the unemployment  rate  to  begin  to  turn  up  by  the  end  of  2020,  earlier  than  anticipated  by  the  Tealbook.  Fading  fiscal stimulus  contributes  to  the  anticipated  growth  slowdown.

My  inflation  path  is  slightly  higher  than  the  Tealbook's,  principally  because  I'm  not  convinced  that  the  longerterm  inflation  expectations  relevant  to  price  setting  are  currently  below  our  2-percent  objective.

Respondent 3: While my output and inflation  forecasts  are similar  to  the  Tealbook,  I anticipate a much slower pace  of  federal  funds  rate  increases  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 4: ForGDPgrowthandinflation,ourprojectionsaresimilartothoseintheTealbook.  Differences arisewithrespecttomonetarypolicyimplicationsbecausetheTealbookprojectionsincorporatetheideaofalongerrun  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the  economy transitions  to  the  longer-run  steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. Our  regime conception,  in  contrast,  views  monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent. It  is  acknowledged  that  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  these  regime  are  difficult to  forecast. This  suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  that  contained  in  the Tealbook.  Beforereturningtoitslonger-runvalueof4.7percent,theTealbookalsohasasubstantialundershooting of  the  unemployment  rate,  far  more  than  our  undershooting.

Respondent 5: My  projection  has  modestly  slower  growth  over  the  next  two  years  relative  to  the  Tealbook baseline.  I am continuing to markinasmallerimpactfromtaxreformonoverallgrowththantheTealbook,creating much  of  the  divergence  in  our  growth  trajectories. The  divergence  between  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate and  the  projection  marked  into  the  Tealbook  owes  to  differences  in  our  employment  growth  projections  over  the next  several  years.

Respondent 6: My  assumptions  and  projections  are  similar  to  those  in  Tealbook.

Respondent 7: Real  outcomes  are  similar  in  the  two  forecasts.  We  expect  inflation  to  increase  somewhat  more meaningfully  above  2  percent  than  the  Tealbook. In  both  forecasts  monetary  policy  needs  to  tighten  noticeably more  than  what  financial  markets  are  currently  expecting  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  start  reverting  to  a  level consistent  with  full  employment. Our  outlook,  however,  features  a  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  which  is  less steep  than  the  Tealbook's.  This  difference  could  be  due  to  the  Tealbook  having  a  more  optimistic  assessment  of  the economy's  underlying  momentum,  and  to  the  fact  that  we  take  some  signal  from  the  empirical  evidence  suggesting that  a  monetary  policy  tightening  has  a  greater  impact  on  economic  activity  than  a  monetary  policy  easing  of  the same  magnitude.

Respondent 8: I believe  that  the  Tealbook's  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  unlikely  to  be  consistent  with plausible  paths  for  output  and  inflation.

Respondent 9: My  projections  for  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  inflation  are  broadly  consistent with  the  Tealbook. I have  slightly  stronger  growth. My  path  for  the  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is substantially  lower  than  the  Tealbook  path.

Respondent 10: My  set  of  projections  is  broadly  in  alignment  with  the  Tealbook  forecast. The  one  notable exception  is  the  anticipated  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

In  both  forecasts,  the  fading  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  slow  real growth  to  near  its  potential  rate  in  2020  and  somewhat  below  potential  in  2021. The  prolonged  period  of  tight resource  constraints  results  in  inflation  slightly  overshooting  our  2  percent  objective  in  2020  -  21  and  for  some  time afterwards. The  Tealbook  projects  a  somewhat  larger  and  more  prolonged  undershooting  of  the  unemployment rate  from  its  longer-run  normal  rate,  with  a  trough  of  the  unemployment  rate  at  3.2  percent  in  2020,  compared  to the  trough  of  3.4  percent  in  2019  in  my  projection. My  projection  for  the  policy  rate  displays  a  more  gradual  rise and  less  overshooting  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  than  does  the  projected  path  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 11: My  economic  forecast  differs  primarily  from  the  Teal  book  in  that  I  think  that  trend  growth may  be  somewhat  faster  and  u*  lower  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. On  trend  growth,  we  have  seen  some pick  up  in  productivity  (albeit  from  a  very  low  base)  over  the  last  8  quarters  in  contrast  to  the  prior  cycle  when productivity  growth  slowed  sharply  late  in  the  cycle.  It  is  premature  to  declare  an  inflection  point  in  trend  growth, but  my  baseline  is  more  optimistic  than  the  Tealbook  on  this  front.

Respondent 12: As  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  an  above-trend  pace, labor  market  conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  remain  near  our  2  percent  goal  over  the forecast  horizon. Although  the  outcomes  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  are  similar  to  those  in  my  forecast,  to  achieve these  outcomes,  the  Tealbook  has  a  steeper  funds  rate  path,  especially  in  2020  and  2021,  compared  to  my  policy path. By  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon,  the  Tealbook's  fed  funds  rate  projection  is  more  than  150  basis  points steeper  than  mine. Thus,  the  Tealbook  sees  a  stronger  underlying  economy  that  needs  to  be  tempered  by  more restrictive  monetary  policy  compared  to  my  projection.

Respondent 13: N/A

ff outlook. Respondent 14: I have  a  stronger  outlook  for  potential  growth  than  the  Tealbook. Consequently,  I  believe that  the  economy  can  grow  faster  in  the  near-term  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook  without  much  additional  upward impetus  to  price  inflation. My  more  optimistic  outlook  for  potential  growth  is  consistent  with  a  slightly  higher long-run  neutral  interest  rate  compared  to  that  in  the  Sta

Respondent 15: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  forecast  period, ending  2021  in  the  3  to  3 1 / 4 percent  range. We  assess  the  long-run  neutral  funds  rate  to  be  2.75  percent,  a  bit higher  than  the  Tealbook.  Consequently,  we  do  not  overshoot  the  long-run  fed  funds  rate  by  nearly  as  much  as  the Tealbook  does. Over  the  2018-2020  period,  we  assume  the  same  average  impulse  from  tax  cuts  and  government spending  as  the  Tealbook;  however,  we  assume  fiscal  policy  will  be  a  slight  negative  for  growth  in  2021.  Our  view of  potential  output  growth  through  2021  is  somewhat  stronger  than  the  Tealbook's,  largely  reflecting  more  BFI and  capital  deepening.

Our  projection  for  actual  GDP  growth  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  projection  period.  Given our  stronger  potential,  by  2020  our  output  gap  is  1  percentage  point  smaller.  Our  projection  for  the  unemployment rate  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook's  in  2018  and  2019,  but  we  expect  the  rate  beginning  to  rise  in  2020,  a  bit  sooner  than the  Tealbook. Combined  with  a  lower  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  (4.3  percent),  this  leaves  our  unemployment rate  gap  at  the  end  of  2021  at  about  1/2  percentage  point,  half  the  estimate  in  the  Tealbook.

Our  forecast  for  core  inflation  is  about  a  tenth  higher  than  the  Tealbook.  Our  boost  from  resource  pressure  is  a not  quite  as  large,  but  we  condition  on  a  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  path,  which  should  lift  underlying inflation  trends  and  expectations  more  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 16: The  two  projections  are  largely  in  alignment,  with  the  exception  of  the  anticipated  path  for the  federal  funds  rate.

In  both,  the  waning  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation slow  growth  closer  to  potential  by  2020. Still,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  results  in  inflation slightly  overshooting  the  2-percent  target  for  several  years.  In  my  projection,  the  unemployment  rate  bottoms  out at  3.4  percent  by  the  middle  of  2019. By  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects  a  slightly  more  protracted  overshooting of  full  employment,  with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  to  3.2  percent  in  2020.  My  projection  for  the  funds  rate path  shows  a  more  gradual  rise  that  tops  out  to  a  lower  level  relative  to  the  funds  rate  path  in  the  Tealbook.
