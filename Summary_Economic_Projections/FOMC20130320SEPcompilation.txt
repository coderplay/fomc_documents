Table  1. Economic  projections  of  Federal  Reserve  Board  members  and  Federal  Reserve  Bank  presidents, March  2013

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of  change  in  real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  from  the  fourth  quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE  inflation and core PCE  inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index  for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  and the price index  for PCE excluding food  and energy. Projections  for the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  December projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  11-12,  2012.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In December 2012, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 2, 3, 13, and 1. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 4 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 14: Our  current estimate of the economy's  potential  growth  rate is in the 2%  to 2 1 2 / % range. By 2018 we anticipate a potential growth  rate of around  2 1 4 / %. A reasonable range for an estimate  of the long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%. Assuming  appropriate  policy  and no further significant shocks, we expect  the unemployment  rate  to  be  in  this range  and  the output gap  to  be around  zero  by  2017-18;  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  (1980s  and  1990s)  suggests  the unemployment  rate  could  be  somewhat  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about  2.5%  for the CPI).  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  shrink over the coming  years, we expect inflation as measured  by  the PCE  deflator to be close to 2%  by 2014-15  and  remain  near  that  level  thereafter.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: I anticipate  that  full  convergence  will  be  achieved  within  six  years.

Respondent 17: The  convergence process  may  be somewhat shorter than  5-6 years

Respondent 18: I think  the  unemployment  rate  will  converge  to  its  long-run  value  in  2015,  while real GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  converge  to  their  long-run  values  in  2017.

Respondent 19: It would  be  faster  than  five  years  under  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Since December, we have  gotten past the fiscal  cliff and the risk of a severe European crisis has declined somewhat. Hence, uncertainty  about my projection  for  economic  activity  is similar to its average  level  over  the  past  20 years. Of course,  that  period  was  characterized  by  considerable turmoil, including the Great  Recession, the European  (and  earlier, Asian)  financial crises, the Iraq war,  9/11,  the  dot.com  boom  and  bust,  and  so  on.

Inflation  is  anchored by quite stable  inflation  expectations. The stability  of  these  expectations has been  reinforced by the  explicit 2 percent numerical objective  for inflation. Hence, uncertainty about inflation  is lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Estimates  of  the  long-run  trend  in  real  GDP  are  highly  uncertain  at  this  time,  and I do not believe that the unemployment  rate  gives  an  accurate  signal of the extent of slack in the economy,  so  point  forecasts  for  real activity and  labor  market  conditions  are  unusually  uncertain  at this time. Growth  may  accelerate  to  more  typical  rates, or growth  could  remain  near  2  percent  for some  time  to  come. Inflation  expectations  are probably  more  firmly  anchored  following  the FOMC's consensus  statement,  and  uncertainty  is  correspondingly  lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I have  retained  my  judgment  of  the  level  of uncertainty  attached  to  my  inflation projections at 'higher'. My level of uncertainty  remains high given the significant  amount of increased communication  of  FOMC  members  regarding  individual  views  of  appropriate  policy. For  example,  it is possible that inflation  expectations  could shift notably higher at some  point if  market participants were  to come  to  think  that the level of policy accommodation  or  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  were too  large  to  carry  out  a  successful  exit  or  were  otherwise  inconsistent  with price  stability. I view  such potential perceptions  as being formed  by  comments  that  FOMC  members  may  make  to  the  public which  confuse  markets  from  the  direction  that  the  FOMC  has  committed  to  take.

I have also retained my judgment of the level of uncertainty  attached to my  unemployment projection to 'higher'. Not knowing  for sure whether labor  markets are improving  because of firm decisions to correct  for  too  many  layoffs  previously,  not  knowing  the  full  dynamics  of  how  discouraged  workers will react  once  conditions  improve and  generally  not  understanding  the  contours  of  the  relationship ' between  GDP  growth  and  unemployment,  I  currently  believe  the  level  of  uncertainty  attached  to  my unemployment rate projection to be higher than the  level of uncertainty  over the past 20 years.

Respondent 10: Continued  uncertainties  on  the  real  side  include  US  fiscal  policy  (including  CR, debt  limit), Europe  (Cyprus?),  oil  prices,  growth  in  the  emerging  markets,  possible  structural  damage from  the crisis and  recession, and  our lack of experience  with  recoveries  from  financial  crises  in developed  economies  and  with  unconventional  monetary policies. Core  inflation  is well anchored by stable expectations  and resource slack. Commodity prices have been  generally  flat  to down  (except for isolated  events  like  the  drought),  so  uncertainty  about  inflation  overall  is  in  the  normal  range.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Several  factors  contribute to heightened uncertainty, including the European debt crisis,  U.S. fiscal policy, slowing  world growth, and  ongoing  changes in the regulatory  environment. In addition, the Federal  Reserve's unconventional policies  are a source of uncertainty  because they have no  precedent.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors  over  the  last  20  years. The  widths  of  these  intervals  have  not  changed  significantly  from  those at the time  of the December  SEP.  These  measures  also  reflect  our  view  of  the  appropriate  monetary policy stance providing  insurance  against  realizations of some  of the downside  risks; otherwise, the uncertainty  would  be  even  higher.

Respondent 15: At  this  point,  uncertainty  looks  to  be  broadly  similar  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20 years.

Respondent 16: Several important uncertainties have been  at  least partially resolved.

Respondent 17: Uncertainty  about  domestic  fiscal  policy  continues  to  pose  risks  for  the  forecast. It remains  the case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and uncertainties surrounding  the  future  path  of policy, including  the timing  of the exit from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: Our baseline  assumption regarding budget negotiations over the sequester  are similar to the Tealbook, but  we think the risks are  tilted to more fiscal austerity  over the medium term. We also  think  the  risks  to  U.S.  growth  from  abroad  are  tilted  to  the  downside  (both  from  weaker  foreign GDP  and  a  stronger  dollar). We  see  some  upside  risk  that  virtuous  cyclical  dynamics  will  build  more favorably  than  we  have  anticipated, but the odds  of this occurring  seem  smaller  than  the  downside scenarios. Our  forecast  for  real  activity  implies  that  the  degree  of  resource  slack  in  the  economy  will remain  meaningful  until  late in the projection period. We  assume that well-anchored inflation  expectations  will  assert  a  sufficient  lift  to prices  to  more  than  offset  this  slack  and  return  inflation  to  target by  2015. We may, however, be overestimating  the pull from expectations, or the degree to which they will remain  well  anchored  if  we  face  a  much-longer  streak  of  low  incoming  inflation  numbers  or  if  the FOMC  appears  to  waver  on  its  commitment  to  policy  accommodation.

Respondent 2: Risks  to  GDP  growth  are  still  skewed  to  the  downside,  though  this  is  a  closer  call than  in December. First, fiscal policy  is a smaller  downside  risk  now. Sequestration,  though  a  drag on growth and a downside risk, is less quantitatively important than the fiscal cliff. Second, the European situation remains fragile, though a severe crisis is less likely than at  times last year. Finally, it continues to be the  case that negative shocks  could have particularly severe effects, because of the continuing  vulnerability  of  the  financial system  as  well as the limited ability of fiscal and  monetary policy  to  offset  them.

In contrast to the risk weighting  on growth, risks to unemployment  are  broadly  balanced. The downside  risk  weighting  for  GDP  growth  is  an  upside  risk  for  unemployment. But  other  risks  to  the unemployment  outlook  are  skewed  to  the  downside. For  example,  labor-force  participation  might  be lower  than  my  modal  forecast  assumes.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

Respondent 8: Recent  over-prediction of  the unemployment  rate indicates a deviation in  the Okun relationship  that  may  persist  in  the  near-term.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Real factors cited above  are mostly  downside  risks. The  ZLB  creates  an  asymmetric  policy  response  which  in  turn  imparts  downside  risk. However,  these  risks  have  continued  to moderate  relative  to  last  summer,  and  there  are  some  upside  risks  if  housing,  business  sentiment,  or US  fiscal issues are more  favorable  than  expected. Upside  risks  to  inflation  are primarily  from  commodity prices  and, to a  lesser extent, from an upward drift in inflation  expectations. These upside risks  are balanced by  the possibility  of  tamer-than-expected  commodity prices  or  continuation  of high levels  of slack.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: The risks to inflation are skewed to the upside due to  monetary policy being highly accommodative for a long  time, the possibility  that removing  accommodation  will begin too  late, and long-term  fiscal  imbalances.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between the  central projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation outlook  are roughly  balanced,  as  has  been  the case in the previous  two  SEPs. The  risks  to  the  real  activity  outlook  have  shifted  from  a  downside  weighting  in  December  to  roughly balanced. Two  factors primarily underlie this shift. First, with sequestration now  incorporated  in our  central  forecast,  we  lowered  the  probability  of  fiscal  restraint  beyond  that  in  our  central  forecast. Second,  the  somewhat  more  encouraging  real  economic  data  in  the  face  of  continued  headwinds  from Europe  and fiscal policy raises the probability  that the underlying  strength of the  economy  is greater than  we  have  anticipated  in  our  central  forecast. The  balance  of  risks  for inflation and  real activity also reflects  our view that the appropriate  monetary policy stance in the  current  environment provides insurance  against  tail risks; otherwise, the balance of risks  for both variables probably would be shifted to the  downside.

Respondent 15: I believe the risks are weighted primarily to the downside  for GDP growth and  to the upside for unemployment. In the medium  term, fiscal policy issues in both Europe and the United States  pose  downside  risks  to  growth  and  upside  risks  to  unemployment. I judge  the  overall  risks  to inflation  as  balanced,  with  a  downside  risk  that  slow  growth  could  pull  down  inflation  and  an  upside risk that a large balance sheet  could eventually  cause inflation  expectations and, in turn, inflation to rise.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 18: N/A

Respondent 19: I remain  concerned  about  our  ability  to  respond  effectively  to  downward  shocks to inflation  and  inflation  expectations.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: We  believe the Committee's  current  commitment  to  hold  the federal funds rate near  zero  at  least  as  long  as  the  unemployment  rate  remains  above  6-1/2  percent  and  the  outlook  for inflation remains  below  2-1/2  percent  constitutes  appropriate  policy with regard to the funds rate. Such a rule likely is an adequate  approximation  to the optimal control policy under commitment. However,  in  light of downward  influences  on  our  outlooks  for  growth  and  inflation, we believe that appropriate  policy  requires  a  greater  degree  of accommodation  than  we  assumed  in  December. Accordingly, we assume  a continuation of the open-ended  LSAP  program  into  early 2014; extending the program  would  reinforce  the  FOMC's  commitment  to  the  maintenance  of  substantial  monetary accommodation  and  thus  have  beneficial  influences  on  the  forecasts  of  both  growth  and  inflation.

Under  our  economic  forecast,  we  hit  the  6-1/2  percent  unemployment  threshold  in  late  2015. At that time, our forecast for inflation over the  following  one to two years will be 2-1/4 percent. However, as noted earlier, we see some  downside  risks to this inflation projection. If these risks materialize, then  appropriate  policy  would  delay  lift  off.

Respondent 2: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  are  large and persistent, and inflation remains moderately below  our 2 percent  objective. This situation calls for very accommodative  monetary policy. Even  with  continuing  LSAPs,  appropriate  policy  calls  for  delaying  liftoff  from  the  zero-lowerbound  until the second half of 2015, when  the unemployment  rate  falls below 6-1/2 percent. My judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero-lowerbound  and  for  the  effects of unconventional  policy. In addition, it is informed  by  my  assessment  of the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Respondent 3: Lift-off from  the zero-lower-bound  occurs  around  mid-2015,  when  the  unemployment rate is expected to  fall below 6.5 percent and the  economy  continues to grow above potential.

Respondent 4: Unemployment  reaches  6.5%  in  mid-2015  and  lift-off  begins. I have assumed  increases  in  the  fed  funds  target  of  .25%  at  each  meeting  once  lift-off  begins.

Respondent 5: I am  assuming  we  continue  to follow our threshold policy. Since in my  forecast unemployment  falls  below  6.5%  in  about  the  first  quarter  of  2015,  and  since  I  expect  inflation  to  be in the 2%  range  at  that  time, it seems  appropriate  that  we  would  begin  gradually  raising  the  funds rate in  2015 Q1,  and  resume using  something  that looks roughly  like the inertial Taylor 99 rule.

Respondent 6: My  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  accords  closely  with  Tealbook  although  I  have assumed  a  lower  long-run  equilibrium  value  of  the  funds  rate,  consistent  with  staff  estimates  based  on the three-factor yield curve model of the expected nominal short  rate  ten years ahead, which  currently stand  around  3.25%. The  reduced  value  of  the  equilibrium  funds  rate  reflects,  in  my  view,  persistent drags on aggregate demand,  including  tight  fiscal policy, and somewhat  slower  growth  in potential output. Appropriate  monetary  policy, given the zero lower bound  constraint, involves holding the funds  rate lower for longer than  would  be  prescribed  by  standard  rules, such as Taylor  1999  or the outcome  based  rule. The  Committee's  thresholds-based  guidance, coupled with staff's assumption that  the  funds  rate  follows  inertial  Taylor  1999  post-liftoff  captures  this  basic  principle.

Respondent 7: Once  real GDP  growth  rises  significantly, we will want  to raise the federal funds rate  in order  to  keep  inflation  near  2  percent.

Respondent 8: I expect  the  federal  funds rate  to remain  in  the 0  to  25 basis point range  at  least  as long  as the  unemployment  rate  exceeds  6 1 2 / percent, provided  that  inflation  is projected  to be  close to the Committee's  2 percent  objective  in  the  medium  term  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations continue  to  be  anchored.

Respondent 9: The key  factors informing  my judgment  regarding lift-off in  2015 include review of a set of  economic indicators that  together do not yet suggest that a 'virtuous cycle' is firmly underway that would justify an early monetary  policy contraction. Firms appear now  to be hiring, but the unemployment  rate  remains  elevated. For their part, households  are enjoying more  wealth effects, and  household  confidence  has  improved,  but  real  disposable  incomes  remain  flat. With  the  sequester, fiscal impetus  is  not  substantial  to  provide  necessary  stimulus. Accordingly,  my  view  of  appropriate monetary policy is that it must  remain  accommodative as long  as it  can  continue to deliver  meaningful support, and provided that any  costs in  terms of price stability, financial stability,  market functioning, and  effects  of  lower  remittances  can  be  managed  effectively.

Respondent 10: Projected path is  consistent  with thresholds guidance  and optimal  control simulations.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy are achieving  an inflation objective of 2.0 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that  reduces  unemployment.  To  maintain  the  stability  of  long-run  inflation  expectations  and  financial stability,  I anticipate  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  the  process  of  normalizing  the  federal  funds  rate  in 2014.

Respondent 13: I am  assuming  that  the  committee  begins  to  increase  the  federal  funds  rate  when unemployment declines below  6.5% in mid-2015, as suggested by the thresholds.  I expect that inflation will be  around  2%  at  that  time.

Respondent 14: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR are the current  state of the  economy, our  central  economic outlook, and  our balance of risks around  the  central  outlook. While  a  number  of  the  recent  data  releases  have  been  relatively more encouraging, the indicators since September still point to a substandard  expansion.  In particular, even  with  the  February  labor  market  report,  our  assessment  is  that  the  labor  market  outlook  has  not improved  substantially. Financial conditions have improved, but are not yet fully normal  and are still susceptible  to  sharp  reversals  depending  upon  developments. Furthermore,  we  see  the  'whatever it takes'  policy approaches  of the Federal Reserve and other central banks as an important  factor behind the somewhat better  U.S.  economic data (particularly in the interest rate sensitive sectors of consumer  durables  and  housing)  and  improved  financial  conditions. In these  circumstances,  we  thus see appropriate  monetary  policy  as  'doing  whatever  it  takes'  to  strengthen  the  economic  expansion; under  such  a policy, it will be the economic  outcomes  and  outlook  that  will  dictate  the  path  of  the policy stance. Under  our  modal  outlook, we  anticipate that the  target FFR  will remain near  zero until the second  half  of 2015. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over this period. The  pace  of renormalization  of  the  target  FFR  following  the  period  of  near  zero  policy rates  will then depend  upon our assessment of  economic  conditions, longer-term inflation expectations, and  overall  financial  conditions.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate  is  in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium  rate as 3.0 -5.0%. Given  the recent behavior  of nominal  and  real Treasury  yields and productivity  growth,  we  currently  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to  be  in  the  lower half  of the  indicated  range,  which  results  in  the point  estimate  given  in  the  response  to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  our  assessment  of  economic  and  financial  conditions, our judgement  of  the  current 'neutral' FFR  is below  our  estimate  of  the longer-run FFR  and  is  expected  to  remain  so for some time.

As discussed in our answer to question 3(e), we anticipate that significant improvement  in  the labor  market  outlook  will become  evident near  the  end of  2013,  so we  expect that pace  of purchases under  the  current  program  will  begin  to  slow  in  2013Q4  and  then  end  in  2014Q1.

Respondent 15: I currently  anticipate  that  conditions  will  warrant  raising  the  federal  funds  rate target  at  the  end  of  2015. The  unemployment  rate  will  reach  the  6 1 2 / percent  threshold  in  the  fourth quarter  of that year. In addition, the recovery  will be far enough  along  that  inflationary pressures will be rising,  with a nontrivial probability that expected future inflation  will be approaching the 2 1 2 / percent threshold. Therefore, to preserve the stability  of  long-term inflation  expectations, I believe it will be  appropriate  to  begin  reducing  the  amount  of  monetary  stimulus  at  that  point.

Respondent 16: 'Appropriate policy'  cannot be captured by a time-path for the federal funds rate. An  important  part  of  'appropriate  policy'  is  communicating  a  long-run  strategy  for  monetary policy  that does a better  job  of resisting  imbalances  and  excesses  than did past strategy,  and  which is not so reliant on large downward  movements  in  short-term  interest rates. The formulation and communication  of  such  a  strategy  would  strengthen  the  recovery  more  reliably  than  our  current  form of forward guidance, allowing us to move away from the zero bound relatively quickly. It would enhance  the  effectiveness  of  additional  asset  purchases  while  reducing  the  need  for  them.

For purposes of this exercise, I considered the implications of a variety of simple policy rules, placing  greatest  weight  on  the  prescriptions  of  the  1999  Taylor  rule  and  a  targeting  rule  for  nominal GDP.  In applying these rules I assumed  policy inertia and that the natural real rate of interest is temporarily  depressed.

Respondent 17: Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation. Economic  growth  will  be  slightly  above  trend  in  2013  and  beyond; unemployment will decline slowly. The  Committee  will  find  it necessary  to  adjust policies  to prevent  inflation  from rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 18: Assuming  appropriate policy  and  my  views  on  the  convergence process,  my  judgment  is  that  the  lift-off  of the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in Q2/2014.

Respondent 19: Under  appropriate  monetary  policy, the FOMC  should  keep  the  fed  funds  rate extraordinarily  low  at  least  until  the  unemployment  rate  falls  below  5.5%,  as  long  the  medium-term outlook  for  inflation  remains  below  2.5%.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

We  assume  asset  purchases  continue  through  early  2014  and  total  about  $750  billion  more  than  the Tealbook.

Respondent 2: Yes

Relative  to Tealbook,  I  expect  LSAPs  to  continue  for  about  an  additional  quarter  and  cumulate  to an  additional  $250b  in  purchases.

Respondent 3: Yes

Appropriate  monetary policy entails additional LSAP at a pace of roughly $85 billion per  month until the end of  2013. By then, the pace of growth in real  economic  activity is well established and  sufficient to engender  expectations  of  a  substantial  improvement  in  the  labor  market.

Respondent 4: Yes

I assume  that  purchases  will continue after midyear  but  at a lower level with additional purchases ultimately  reaching  250  billion  more  than  is  assumed  in  the  TealBook.

Respondent 5: No

N/A

Respondent 6: Yes

Given  that  inflation is projected  to undershoot  the  Committee's  2 percent  objective over  the  entire forecast  horizon  while  unemployment  declines  only  slowly  toward  its  longer-run  normal  level,  I  have assumed  around  $500 billion in asset purchases in addition to those incorporated in the Tealbook baseline. My  current  assessment  is  that  the  efficacy  of  these  purchases  accord  with  staff  assumptions and the  marginal  costs do not at this point  exceed the benefits. I assume that these purchases  continue until  there  is  a  substantial  improvement  in  the  outlook  for  the  labor  market. In my projection,  which assumes  such  purchases,  it  would  be  hard  to  rationalize  a  judgment  that  there  had  been  substantial improvement  in  the  outlook  for  the  labor  market  before  the  end  of  2013.

Respondent 7: Yes

I favor immediate  cessation of long-term asset purchases and reinvestment of maturing mortgagebacked  securities.

Respondent 8: No

N/A

Respondent 9: Yes

Given  my  forecast,  I  believe  there  is  the  possibility  that  more  than  $500  billion  may  be  necessary  for a total  amount  of  large  scale  asset  purchases.

Respondent 10: Yes

Given my  projections for output, unemployment,  and  inflation, I would expect asset purchases to continue  at  current  rates  until  approximately  August  or  September,  then  begin  to  slow  through  the end  of  the  year.

Respondent 11: Yes

I assume  approximately  $250  billion  more  in  asset  purchases  than  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: Yes

I believe the benefits of asset purchases are small, while the potential  costs to  market functioning  and financial instability from  'reaching  for  yield'  are larger. In addition, the efficacy of additional  asset purchases  may  have  declined. A larger balance  sheet  also greatly increases  the likelihood  of capital losses and  zero  remittances  to  the  Treasury  for  several  years,  which  could  put  the  Federal  Reserve's independence,  credibility,  and  reputation  at risk. Therefore, I believe we should  tilt purchases  toward Treasury  securities,  begin  tapering  our  purchases,  and  end  the  purchases  by  the  end  of  the  year.

Respondent 13: Yes

I assume  that  we  will  begin  to  taper  purchases  at  mid-year  and  bring  them  to  an  end  by  around  the end  of  2013.

Respondent 14: Yes

As noted above, in part to reinforce the forward  guidance  on the target FFR,  we  assume  that  the FOMC  continues  its  current  outcome-based, open-ended  purchase  program  of  long-term  Treasuries and agency  MBS.  Based  on  our  outlook, we currently expect  that these purchases  will continue  at the current  pace  through  2013Q3,  and  then  proceed  at  a  slower  pace  through  2014Q1  for  a  total  of about $1 trillion in purchases. Our assumed program thus would last 9  months longer and  total  $500 billion  more  than  the  program  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. However,  that  path  and  total  could  change depending  upon  the progress  toward  the FOMC  objectives-it  is  the progress  toward  objectives  that  is important in our assumed policy stance rather than a particular size of the balance sheet.  In our overall strategy  for  appropriate  monetary  policy,  we  believe  that  a  collective  emphasis  of  an  accommodative stance  based  on  a  portfolio  of  tools  would  enhance  the  efficacy  of  policy  in  these  circumstances.

Respondent 15: No

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

Although  I was not in favor of the current program,  having  begun  a  series of asset purchases  I do not  believe  that  we  ought  to  stop  them  cold  turkey. Instead,  purchases  ought  to  be  phased  out,  with tapering  starting  no  later  than  June.

Respondent 17: Yes

I anticipate following the Committee's  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate  path  is steeper than  in the Tealbook,  I anticipate  that we would  reduce  the  size of the balance  sheet  more quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 18: Yes

I assumed  a  continuation  of  asset  purchases  during  the  second  half  of  2013. Based  on  an  improving economy,  I  also  assumed  a  tapering  of  these  purchases.

Respondent 19: No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: The  key  factors  shaping  the  forecast  are  the  same  as  they  have  been  for  some  time. Our  baseline  assumption  is  that fiscal policy in the U.S. will result in net restraint on the order of magnitude  assumed  in  the  Tealbook  and  that  Europe  will  muddle  through  their  problems  without  a meltdown. Accordingly,  over  time, these sources  will exert diminishing  drags  on  spending,  both  directly  and  indirectly  through  their  effects  on  household  and  business  confidence. More  fundamentally, with the support  of accommodative  monetary  policy  and  improved  household  and  business  balance sheets, domestic private demand  should  gain  momentum  as we  move  through  the projection period. Furthermore,  pent-up  demands  for  capital  goods  and  consumer  durables  should  provide  an  impetus for above-trend  growth. Demand  from  abroad  also  is  assumed  to  firm  in  2014  and  2015, as Europe emerges  from  recession  and  growth  in  Asia  recovers  to  a  more  robust  pace.

We expect that resource gaps  will be  meaningful  until  late in the projection period, and thus be a restraining  factor on inflation for some  time. However, under our view of appropriate policy, sufficient monetary  accommodation  will be in place-and will be expected to remain in place-to result in inflation drifting  up  some  over  the  forecast  period. Importantly,  we  assume  that  credible  commitment  to  our accommodative policy stance  will support inflation  expectations and push inflation back  up  to  target by  2015.

Respondent 2: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes  are  associated  with  sustained weakness in  aggregate demand through a variety of channels, which policy has only partially offset. Some headwinds are slowly  easing. For example,  consumer balance sheets are improving; banking  and  credit  conditions are strengthening; and  the  housing  sector  has  turned  the  corner. At  the  same  time,  other  headwinds  remain  intense. For example,  fiscal policy has turned  increasingly  contractionary, with sequestration  an  additional  drag on  activity this year. The  global  economy  remains weak. Uncertainty about  economic prospects has diminished  somewhat  but  continues  to  weigh  on  consumer  and,  especially,  business  spending.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us  to  continue  making  modest progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps over  the next few years. Even  with  substantial  monetary  stimulus,  it  will  take  many  years  of  above-trend  growth to return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity  and import  prices should keep inflation somewhat  below  the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation  target  for the next  few  years.

Respondent 3: Incoming  data have been  more upbeat than  anticipated. Supported by  solid  gains in household net worth,  consumer spending is holding  up  well despite the expiration of the payroll  tax cut at the beginning  of the year. Business spending  in equipment  and  software is recovering  from the pause  experienced  in  the  second  half  of  last  year,  in  the  context  of  an  economic  environment  which  is less uncertain. Since December, some  of  the uncertainty surrounding fiscal policy has dissipated,  while ongoing  economic and political  challenges in Europe are having  a  limited impact on financial  markets, at least for now. With lower uncertainty and pessimism about  current  and  expected  conditions  - which is also  reflected  in  higher  equity  valuations  -  firms  are  stepping  up  the  pace  of  hiring. Recent  payroll gains have been somewhat  larger than expected, and readings for initial claims for unemployment insurance  have  come  down  noticeably. Overall,  while  some  of  the  strength  in  activity  likely  reflects  a bounce  back  from  a  highly  uncertain  environment  and  weather  related  disruptions  in  the  second  half of last year, we  interpret  the  incoming  data  as  indicating  more  underlying  resilience  than  previously

thought. Fiscal policy, however, is now expected  to restrain economic activity this year by more than  what  was  anticipated  in  December. This  additional  restraint  from  fiscal  policy  offsets  the  more positive outlook  for private sector demand. As a result, the forecast for this year and  next  has not changed  significantly.

Since the projected pace of  activity is about unchanged relative to December, the outlook  continues to be  conditioned  on  LSAP  of  $85  billion  per  month  until  the  end  of  2013. This  stimulus  contributes to a  more robust upturn in  activity, so that GDP growth this year is expected to be  close to 3 percent despite the important restraint from fiscal policy. We  continue to view LSAP as effective in stimulating the interest-sensitive sectors of the  economy. Moreover, rather than becoming  less effective, a policy of maintaining  the current low level of rates should increase the availability of credit to a broader range  of  households  and  small  businesses,  whose  propensity  to  spend  could  prove  to  be  greater  than for the population  now  having  access  to  credit. With  the  policy  stimulus,  the  unemployment  rate  is expected to  fall to 7.3 percent by  the end of this year. The unemployment rate is projected to near 6 percent,  with  inflation  running  somewhat  below  target,  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Risks to the real  economic outlook continue to be skewed to the downside.  There is high uncertainty about  the  ultimate  size  of the sequester. It is possible  that  full sequestration,  rather  than  the  more benign  compromise  assumed  in  our  baseline  forecast,  will  remain  in  place  and  restrain  activity  this year more  than we anticipate. Moreover, despite the improvements  in  financial markets  witnessed recently,  the  situation  in  Europe  remains  vulnerable  to  bouts  of  severe  stress.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  is  a  bit  stronger  than  the  TealBook  baseline. I expect  a  strengthening housing recovery to continue to stoke momentum. I believe that the supply of housing units will remain tight and drive prices higher. And  I expect the shortfall in existing homes  for sale to be partially  filled by  additional  new  construction. I assume  the  wealth  effect  of  higher  house  prices  will give  some  boost  to  consumer  spending. However,  I  still  have  not  seen  any  sign  of  the  confidence  spark that leads to the robust  growth  in  the housing-led  recovery  alternative  simulation  in  the  TealBook. Finally, I think household  formation will be a significant factor in housing demand  but  that tight credit  conditions  faced  by  the  new  households  will  result  in  even  more  pressure  on  rental  housing.

Respondent 5: The  basic  narrative  I  have  in  mind  is  one  where  the  economy  is  beginning  to  show clear  signs  of momentum  on  a  number  of  dimensions-housing,  retail  sales,  business  capital  spending, etc. And  uncertainties regarding both fiscal policy and Europe  are fading. These would all point to 2013 being a good bit stronger than 2012. Against this is the drag that will be caused by the sequester in the coming  quarters. The  biggest near-term  risk I see is that this drag will be larger than  expected,  and  will  undermine  some  of  the  increased  confidence  and  forward  momentum  that  are seeing. Nevertheless,  at  this  point  it seems  to  me  that  the  risks  on  the  upside  and  the  downside  are fairly evenly  balanced.

Respondent 6: Recent data pertaining  to the labor  market, housing, and  consumer spending  have contained some upside surprises, strengthening  my  confidence in the underlying  momentum in private demand. All in all, the U.S. economy  appears  to  be  expanding  at  a moderate  pace  and, the labor market  is  showing  some  signs  of  improvement  with payroll  employment  growing  at  an  average pace  of around  205,000  over  the  last  four  months,  up  from  154,000  over  the previous  four  months. That  said, unemployment remains quite  elevated and there has been a small further decline in labor force participation. Recovery  in  the  housing  market  has  gained  traction,  and  we're  seeing  stronger  construction and  sales  and  a  more  rapid  rebound  in  house  prices  than  I  had  anticipated. The  recovery  in  housing appears to be  attributable at  least in part to exceptionally low  mortgage rates. Low interest rates, as well as rising house and equity prices, also appear to be supporting  solid growth in spending  on  motor vehicles  and  other  consumer durables. Incoming  evidence,  albeit preliminary, suggests that  consumer spending  is  holding  up  reasonably  well  in  the  face  of recent  tax  increases. Offsetting  these  positives

is the news  that  Congress  has  allowed  the  sequester  to  go  into  effect  on  March  1  as  scheduled-a  development  which  will  exert  noticeable  and  unanticipated  fiscal  drag  over  the  remainder  of  the  year. In addition, the European  downturn  is proving more sizeable than previously anticipated. All in all, I expect  there  to  be  sufficient  momentum  in  both  consumption  and  investment  spending  for  the economy  to  grow  at  a  trendlike  pace  over  the  coming  year  but  I  anticipate  little  progress  in  bringing down  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  remainder  of  this  year. While  we  have  seen  improvement  in the labor market  since  September,  I  am  concerned  that  it  owes  more  to  disappointing  productivity growth  than  to  above  trend  growth  in  output  and,  as  over  the  last several years, this progress  may not prove  to be persistent. Both  headline  and  core  PCE  prices  have  been  rising  significantly  below the  Committee's 2 percent objective and I  expect that  with substantial slack in the labor  market and very subdued  compensation,  this  situation  will  persist  over  the  forecast  period. Moreover,  inflation expectations appear to be well-anchored and  measures of longer-run inflation  expectations have been stable. With  lingering  and considerable  uncertainty  about  fiscal policy and continued  potential  for renewed turbulence in global financial  markets relating  to European  developments, I  see the risks to growth as skewed to the downside.  These risks,  combined  with  little further scope for  monetary policy to respond,  result  in  risks  to  the  outlook  for  inflation  that  are  skewed  to  the  downside.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Business  uncertainty  and  lingering  after-effects of the financial crisis continue  to weigh on business  activity,  most  notably firms' demand for labor and capital. I expect fiscal tightening to contribute  further  to  sub-par  growth. However,  business  sentiment  is  improving  and  the  appetite for business  expansion appears  to be growing. While rising  sentiment has not yet  caused  me  to revise my  baseline  forecast,  it  has  prompted  me  to  move  my  assessment  of  the  growth  risks  from  weighted to the  downside,  to  broadly  balanced. I continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  being  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 9: My  central  economic  outlook  is  currently  shaped  by  a  sense  of  cautious  optimism. Many  indicators  have  improved;  i.e.,  employment  is  improving,  and  household  wealth  driven  by  improvements  in  shareholder  value  and home  values  are growing. Stresses from Europe  appear  to  be quiet, for the time being. However, other indicators do not yet point to the existence of a strong virtuous cycle that  could provide the  momentum necessary  to remove the risk that the recovery  could flounder. Other  indicators  that  need  to  move  in  tandem,  such  as  improvements  in  business  confidence and  capital  expenditures  and  growth  in  real  disposable  income,  are  not  yet  robust.

Respondent 10: Several  factors raise the possibility of moderately stronger growth: the increasingly well-established  turn  in  housing;  supportive  financial  conditions  arising  from  reduced  global  financial stress, a healthier banking  system, and accommodative  monetary  policy; and less drag from state and local governments. Higher stock and house prices are helpful, but the stronger dollar could slow exports. There is some risk of a rise in longer-term rates that could also slow growth. The employment  data  revision  reinforces  the  sense  that  employment  conditions  are  improving  somewhat, with beneficial effects  for  confidence, income,  and  spending. In the near  term there  will be bounceback from the drought  and superstorm Sandy. However, we have seen  periods of stronger growth before that proved  temporary, so  caution  in upgrading projections  is warranted. Importantly,  federal  fiscal policy  is likely to pose  a significant  drag  on  growth  of  1  to  1.5  percentage  points  (I  am  less  sanguine than  staff  that  a  significant  modification  of  the  sequester  will  be  achieved).

Core inflation remains well anchored by  stable expectations and slack at just below 2 percent. Geopolitical and other influences on global  commodity prices have not been a source of much volatility, The  softness  of  commodity  prices  is  a  little  surprising  given  faster  global  growth.

Respondent 11: There  is  an increasingly  strong  case  that  the  headwinds  created  by  the  financial crisis have substantially diminished. Substantial deleveraging has been  achieved by households, though it is hard  to determine whether there is a new normal  for household debt that may  stretch the process out beyond  what prior  experience would suggest.. Similarly,  the residential housing  market has pretty clearly stabilized. Again, though, this good news is qualified by what is likely an artificially low inventory  that  could  rise significantly as foreclosed, or temporarily  rented  houses  come  back  on  the market.

If diminishing headwinds remains a positive, fiscal developments remain a significant  negative.  The duration of the sequester, and  its impact  for as  long  as it  lasts, remain difficult to project. My  sense is that  a full sequester  would  have  somewhat  greater  negative  effects  on  the  economy  than  is  suggested by  running  the  reduced  federal  spending through  a  macro  model,  Along  with  the  drag  already  created by  the  tax  package  earlier  in  the  year,  the  impact  of  sequester  -  much  less  a  possible  package  making additional short-term cuts  -  makes it highly unlikely that the  economy picks up  too much  momentum for the  next  couple  of  quarters.

Respondent 12: While higher taxes and full sequestration are negative  factors for  economic growth, I continue to expect a moderate  economic recovery  over the next  several years  with a gradual reduction in the unemployment  rate. Sequestration is likely to subtract from growth this year. However, continued gains in labor markets, strength in housing and business investment, and an extremely accommodative  monetary  policy  contribute  to  growth.

Uncertainty  about fiscal policy, a potential slowdown in global growth,  and  expectations of higher taxes and more regulation pose risks to medium  to long-term economic growth. On the upside, recent  indicators  on  labor  markets  and  housing  suggest  that  the  household  sector  may  be  even  more supportive  of  growth  going  forward.

Turning  to  inflation, I  expect  inflation  in  2013  will be  about 1 1 2 / percent and  that  maintaining  our accommodative  monetary  policy  (federal  funds  rate, forward  guidance, and asset purchases)  would lead to an increase  in inflation in 2014  and  2015  above  2  percent. Therefore,  I  think  that  an  earlier end  to asset purchases  and  an  earlier  lift-off in the funds  rate  are needed  to  maintain  inflation  close to our 2 percent  objective.

Respondent 13: I expect  the  economy  to  strengthen  gradually  but  meaningfully  during  the  course of the  year  and  to  continue  to  do  so  in  2014.

Respondent 14: Other Conditioning  assumptions: We  expect the lower degree of inflation persistence evident  since  the early 1990s  to continue. Inflation expectations  remain  well  anchored. We project real foreign GDP growth (GDP  weighted)  at  2.7% in 2013 and  2.9% in  2014,  little different from  December. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  dollar  exchange  rate  are  similar  to  those in the Tealbook. Reflecting  intermeeting  developments,  our  assumed  path  of  WTI  oil  prices,  based on recent  futures  quotes,  has  moved  up  modestly  to  $92.50  for  2013Q4,  and  is  unchanged  at  $90.00 for 2014Q4. This  round,  our  federal  fiscal assumptions  differ  some  from  the  Tealbook: whereas  the Tealbook  has assumed  a  'modified sequester'  in its forecast, we instead have incorporated full sequestration  into  our  forecast. Our  assessment  of  the  additional  fiscal  restraint  from  assuming  the  full sequester  rather  than  a  modified  sequester  is  a  reduction  of  the  2013  real  GDP  growth  rate  of  about 0.4 percentage  points. We  adopt  the  Tealbook  assumptions  regarding  equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: Although  some  details  may  have  changed,  the  conceptual  underpinnings  of  our  forecast for growth and inflation in  2013 and  2014 are  little changed from those in December. Given the impact of previously  anticipated  actions  as  well  as  the  introduction  of  sequestration,  we  expect  that  the  fiscal drag  will be substantially greater in  2013 than in recent years, in  large part because of the  expiration of the payroll tax holiday, higher tax rates for higher-income  taxpayers,  and  the  implementation  of

sequestration. This holds down  the  growth  rate  of real PCE  and  the  personal  saving  rate  over the first half of the  year. Growth  of  real  GDP  over  2013H1  is  likely  to  be  around  2 1 4 / %  (annual  rate).

In 2013H2, we expect growth also to be around 2 1 4 / % (annual rate), reflecting two opposing factors: the greater  drag  from  sequestration  (we  expect  the  impact  to  peak  in  Q2  and  Q3)  and  the subsiding of headwinds such  as those from household deleveraging  and  restricted  access to credit. Also supporting  growth  is  the  turnaround  in  the  housing  market,  leading  to  gains  in  residential  investment as well as to greater  confidence that has a positive impact on  consumer spending. Furthermore, world growth  begins to pick up as the Euro area emerges  from recession and Japan  as well as emerging economies  respond  to  fresh  policy  stimulus. Finally, the monetary  accommodation  in  the  US  begins to have  a  more  substantial  impact  on  the  US  economy. For  all  of  2013,  we  expect  growth  of  real  GDP of around  2 1 4 / %,  with  the  unemployment  rate  ending  the  year  around  7 1 2 / %.

By  2014,  we  expect  the  fiscal  drag  and  the  other  headwinds  to  growth  to  be  diminished,  allowing the full force of monetary  accommodation  and  the  natural healing of the economy  to be realized. Growth  in  that  year  is  likely  to  be  around  3 1 2 / %,  with  business  fixed  investment  providing  a  greater contribution. The unemployment rate is  expected to decline by about  one full percentage point over the year to 6 1 2 / %. These  trends  continue  into 2015, with projected  growth  at  a  similar rate as in 2014  and  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  6%.

The  increase of the total PCE deflator  in  2013  is now  expected  to be  1.8%, reflecting opposing factors of somewhat higher-than-expected energy prices and  somewhat lower than expected  core PCE inflation  (near  1 1 2 / %  rather  than  the  1 3 4 / %  expected  in  December). In 2014,  as  the  economy  begins to establish greater forward  momentum and  to reduce slack, we expect both  total and  core inflation to move gradually higher to  around 2%  for both. With inflation  expectations  anchored, inflation remains near  its objective  in  2015.

Respondent 15: I expect the economy  to recover at a moderate  rate from 2013 through 2015, reflecting  a range  of  forces. On  the positive side, I  expect  that  low  interest rates  and  expanding  credit availability  will  stimulate  interest-sensitive  sectors;  the  housing  recovery  will  continue  to  broaden  and spill over to consumer  spending  and  labor  markets; and the healing labor market  will support  the economy's  usual  self-correcting  forces. However,  fiscal  policy  is likely to restrain  growth  throughout the forecast horizon, and the ongoing  sovereign debt  situation in Europe  will  contribute to uncertainty.

In this environment,  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  near  2  percent  from  2013  through  2015. Recent inflation readings  have  been  soft,  outside  of  the  February  surge  in  gasoline  prices  that  already  looks to be unwinding. But with inflation expectations remaining well-anchored, recovery in the labor market  will gradually push  wage growth back  toward historical norms, helping  to  limit disinflationary pressures.

As to uncertainty  and  risks, uncertainty  is elevated due to the U.S. fiscal outlook  and  Europe's recession and ongoing  fiscal troubles, but it is comparable  to  historical norms  of the last 20 years. While a stronger-than-expected U.S. housing  recovery  could provide a  lift to growth, on net the risks are skewed  to the downside. For inflation, I believe the uncertainty  surrounding  the  forecast  to be consistent with historical norms  and  the risks to be balanced. As I noted above, if downside  risks to the pace of the recovery were to materialize, inflation could slow. Alternatively, the continued expansion of our balance sheet  could eventually  cause inflation expectations and, in turn, inflation to rise.

Respondent 16: Recent data are encouraging. There is a growing feeling that the recovery is entering a phase in which downside risks are no longer quite so prominent. Europe has become less of a preoccupation: uncertainty  about  European  finances  and  the  European  outlook  weighs  less heavily  on U.S. firms' decision  making. Indeed,  there  are indications  that  the Europeans'  problems are increasingly seen, on this side of the pond, as opportunities. Although  still hesitant to expand their operations  through  hiring  and  CAPEX,  U.S.  corporations,  flush  with  cash,  have  begun  seeking

acquisitions here and abroad. This may  be the last gasp of payroll  'rationalization'  in advance  of a more  substantial improvement  in  the labor market  outlook. Disgust with fiscal policy and fiscal policymakers  has,  if anything,  increased, but outside of the defense  and  medical  sectors, businesses are, so far, unfazed  by  the  sequester.

Inflation  remains  under  control,  in  both  directions. Deflation  is  not  a  serious  concern.

Respondent 17: As  uncertainty  over  U.S.  fiscal  policy  fades I expect  that  business  spending  will pick up. Although household deleveraging  continues, I  expect it to become less of a drag going forward as household  balance  sheets  improve.

I expect  3 percent  growth  over  the medium  term,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. With  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6  percent  by  the  end  of  2015,  at  which  time  it reaches my  estimate of the natural rate of unemployment. I  anticipate that headline inflation  will be 2 percent over the  forecast horizon. Inflation stays  anchored  around  my  target of 2 percent in response to tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary  policy  by  ending  purchases  sometime  this  year  and  then  beginning  to  raise  rates  in  the second  half  of  2013.

Respondent 18: I continue to think that the  economy will progress in the near  term. I am assuming a reasonable  resolution  of  fiscal  issues  and  that  the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis  does  not  intensify.

Respondent 19: I think  that  my  central  outlook  is  not  all  that  different  from  the  Tealbook's. The economy has been hit by  a mix of shocks. Some of these push down on employment and inflation  - we can  think  of  these  as  'demand'  shocks. These  shocks  present  no  dual  mandate  tensions: a monetary policy  that  returns  inflation  exactly  to  target  in  the  face  of  these  shocks  will  also  return  the  economy to full employment.

But there have been  other shocks that push  up  on inflation while pushing  down  on  employment  we  can think of these as 'supply' shocks. Typically, when responding  to these shocks using  a balanced approach  to the dual  mandate, appropriate  monetary policy  will give rise to above-target inflation for some  period  of  time.

I see multiple  risks  to  the  outlook.

- 1. There is uncertainty about the US fiscal situation, but I  see the resultant  risks as being balanced around  my  baseline  outlook.
- 2. Inflation expectations  could move  downward. Currently, I feel that we're in a little bit of a 'Wile  E.  Coyote'  situation  - we  really  have  few  policy  tools available to combat  a  significant  fall in inflation  expectations. Fortunately, the public hasn't looked down yet!
- 3. The  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation  may  well  move  upwards  in  the next  year  or  two. We  need  to  stay  alert  to  this  possibility. Unlike  risk  (2),  we  do  have  tools  that  will allow  us  to  respond  to  this  outcome.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: We  have  marked  down  our  historical  estimates  of potential output  growth, with the result of moving our assumption for the current level of the GDP  gap closer to that in the Tealbook. Like the Tealbook,  we  made  this  change  to better  reconcile the GDP  growth data  with developments  in  the  labor  market. The  reduction  in  the  gap  implies  a  smaller  cyclical  bounceback  in growth. However, our projected degree of resource slack  at the end of  2015 is about the same as in our December  submission. The  drag  from  federal  fiscal  policy  in  our  current  forecast  is  close  to  what  we had  assumed  in  December. The  incoming  data  on  inflation  surprised  on  the  downside,  and  we  have marked  down  our  projection  accordingly.

Respondent 2: Since  December,  the  data  on  spending  and  labor  markets  have  been  stronger  than expected  and, with stronger equity markets  and  housing  prices, household  balance  sheets  have improved. In addition, having  skirted the fiscal  cliff, fiscal uncertainty is somewhat lower. In my forecast, this  momentum has been  more than offset by  reality  of greater  near-term fiscal  contraction  as well  as a stronger dollar. Specifically, sequestration is a notable drag  on  economic  activity  over the next  few quarters. With  weaker  growth,  my  unemployment  path  is  a  touch  higher  this  year.

Reflecting  recent  data,  core  PCEPI  inflation  is  a  bit  weaker  in  the  first  half  of  this  year.

In terms  of longer-run  relationships, I am  less concerned  about  permanent  scarring  effects  from the challenging  labor  market environment of the past few years. Hence, I have lowered my  longer-run unemployment  estimate  a  bit. On  its own, this revision would  slightly raise the level of longer-run potential  output. However,  recent  productivity  data  have  continued  to  disappoint,  and  I  now  expect a lower  longer-run  growth  rate  of  potential  output. Consistent  with  this  change,  I  have  also  reduced my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  natural  rate  of  interest.

Respondent 3: Changes  to  the  real  forecast  have  been  minor,  with  stronger  private  sector  growth offsetting  a  larger  drag  from  fiscal  policy. There  have  been  no  changes  to  the  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  is  not  substantially  different  from  my  previous  submission.

Respondent 5: Given  the roughly  offsetting effects of recent better-than-expected data  readings and the worse-than-expected  sequester outcome, my forecasts for output growth are very close to those  in the previous  SEP.  At  the  same  time,  I  have  adjusted  my  forecasts  for  unemployment  down by  a couple  of  tenths,  in  light  of  both  recent  labor  market  data,  as  well  as  the  more  general  tendency seen  in  the  last  couple  of years  for  unemployment  to  outperform  relative  to  output-a  tendency  which I am  now  implicitly  assuming  will  have  a  slightly  greater  degree  of  persistence  going  forward  than  I had previously thought. Or said differently, I  am  marking  down potential output growth just a  touch, which implies that unemployment  will  come  down  a bit faster for a given path of realized output growth.

Respondent 6: My  forecast  has  changed  only  marginally  since  the  December  2012  SEP.  I  adjusted downward my  unemployment forecast  marginally to take  account of recent data.  I also slightly reduced my  estimate  of  longer  run GDP  growth  and  slightly  raised  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  fed  funds rate. .

Respondent 7: The  longer  we  experience  real  GDP  growth  close  to  2  percent,  the  more  weight  I place on the possibility that we  are already  at trend, with  little meaningful  economic  slack. Consequently,  I  have  lowered  my  longer-run  growth  outlook  since  the  last  SEP.

Respondent 8: My  forecast  today  is  essentially  unchanged  from  what  I  submitted  in  December.

Respondent 9: Since  the  December  SEP,  my  forecasts  have  improved  slightly  for  several  reasons. First, I think that structural impediments  in  the  economy  (such  as  credit constraints arising from, e.g., improvement in the functioning of the HARP  program  and  slight reductions in the amount of put-backs  by  the GSEs)  have  been  slightly relieved, meaning  that  financial market  variables  are transfering  to  effects  in  the  real  economy  with  less  attenuation. Secondly,  I  believe  that  the  FOMC's credibility  to  communicate effectively its intent to provide growth-enhancing  support has improved, to the ultimate benefit of possibly assisting in the ability  to see  more positive effects on the real  economy. Thirdly,  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  emanating  from  Europe  have  been  slightly  (but  probably  only temporarily)  reduced.

Respondent 10: Not much  overall change. Data flow has been generally positive (employment report,  UI  claims,  ISMs,  retail  sales,  house  prices,  orders  and  shipments). Markets  continue  to  signal greater  optimism. However,  federal  fiscal  policy  is  shaping  up  to  be  somewhat  more  restrictive  than anticipated.

Respondent 11: Somewhat better  than  expected  incoming data  since December, particularly  on job  creation  (including  significant  upward  revisions  in  numbers  for  late  last  year).

Respondent 12: Since the December SEP, I have reduced my  forecast  for growth  and increased my forecast for unemployment in  2013 and  2014 due to the fiscal  cliff deal and  sequestration. However, my forecasts  for  2015  are  basically  unchanged. With  somewhat  weaker  near-term  growth,  I  have  pushed the  date  for  lift-off in the  federal  funds  rate  to  2014.

Respondent 13: The  economy is a  little stronger  and  my business  contacts a  little  more optimistic. The fiscal negotiations have been  less disruptive than I  expected. In addition, there is reason to believe that we will get through  the  rest  of this year without  a  government  shutdown,  a  debt  ceiling  crisis, or significant additional  near  term  fiscal tightening. On  balance,  that  has  led me  to raise my  GDP number  for  2013.

Respondent 14: The resolution of the  'fiscal cliff' at the turn of the year was roughly in line with our expectations in the December  SEP,  so it had little effect on our outlook. However, the implementation  of  sequestration  was  not  anticipated, and we have raised the amount  of  fiscal drag for this  year. In addition,  we  see  a  larger  decline  in  federal  government  expenditures  in  2014  than  we previously  had  anticipated.

We had  expected  the end of the payroll tax holiday to have a significant restraining effect on consumer spending  in the first quarter of this year. So  far, the data  on  consumer spending  have been stronger than we had  expected, and hence  we have raised  our near-term projection  for real PCE. Because of this  and  some  additional surprises in  other spending  categories,  our Q1 projection of real GDP  growth  projection has increased about one percentage point since the beginning of the year to around  2 1 2 / %. The  effects of the stronger recent data and expected  greater  fiscal drag roughly offset, so the 2013 (Q4/Q4) real GDP growth projection  is  little  changed from  that in December, in part because  we do  not  expect  that  the  recent  strength  of consumer  spending  will be  sustained. These  surprises  also  had  little net effect on the real activity forecast in the subsequent  years  of  our projection.

The  core inflation data at the end of  2012  were somewhat lower than we projected in December. In response, we have reduced  modestly  our near-term projections  for  core  PCE inflation. However, because we see much of the reduction reflecting temporary factors, we have not made significant changes  to  our  medium-term  inflation projections.

Respondent 15: There have been three key developments since the December  SEP. First, the incoming private sector data related  to GDP growth  and  labor  markets have been somewhat stronger than I had  anticipated. In particular, the unemployment  rate has surprised to the downside in the  last several forecasting  rounds. Second,  fiscal policy over the next  several years is likely to be a greater headwind  compared  with  my  previous  forecast. Taking  into  account  these  developments,  I  see  these factors as roughly  offsetting in terms  of their effects on GDP  growth,  but  I  have  modestly  reduced my  expected path  for the unemployment rate.  The third development is that recent inflation readings have  surprised  to  the downside,  including  those  related  to  food  price  inflation, though  I  expect  this softness  to  be  transitory.

Respondent 16: The modal outlook has changed  little relative to what I had previously submitted. Reflecting  recent data releases, my projected path  for the unemployment rate is  modestly lower than before,  as  are my  near-term inflation projections. The important change is that downside risks to the outlook  have  been  trimmed.

Respondent 17: My  forecast  is  the  same  as  in  the  last  SEP

Respondent 18: My  inflation  outlook has changed because I  anticipate  that  our  accommodative monetary  policy  will  produce  inflation  in  excess  of  2  percent. I have  made  some  minor  adjustments to real GDP  growth  and  inflation  for  2013  based  on  recent  data.

Respondent 19: The  private  sector  has  been  stronger  than  I  would  have  anticipated. That's  led me  to  shift  my  assessment  of  risks  to  real  economic  activity  to  be  balanced,  as  opposed  to  'weighted to the  downside'.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Relative to the Tealbook, we  are projecting  a somewhat lower unemployment rate by  2015, largely because we assume a quicker return of the natural rate to its long-run level. We are projecting  somewhat higher inflation, in part reflecting  the signalling  effects of the  more  accommodative monetary  policy  in our forecast. Finally, we do not see as large of an increase in longer-term interest rates, in part  due  to our LSAP  assumption  and  in  part  to  be  consistent  with  readings  from our  asset  pricing  models.

Respondent 2: I assume that sequestration is a slightly larger drag on the economy  this year. Nevertheless,  my  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection.

Respondent 3: My  forecast is conditioned  on more  policy stimulus than in the Tealbook. This additional stimulus supports a faster pace of GDP  growth. When  conditioned  on  the same  policy assumptions,  the  two  forecasts  are  very  similar.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: As before, I  am very  close to the Tealbook, though a shade  more optimistic, particularly  for  unemployment.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: With  a  lower  amount  of  slack, I see a sustained  period  of above-trend  growth  as less likely. Inflation  returns  to  2  percent  more  rapidly. And  I  think  the  labor  force  participation  rate is likely to decline more  rapidly  than  in the Tealbook,  and  thus  the  unemployment  rate  should  fall more  rapidly.

Respondent 8: My  inflation forecast follows a path  closer  to our longer-term  inflation  objective. Otherwise  there  are  no  important  differences  between  my  outlook  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Slightly  more pessimistic about sequester.  Slightly  more optimistic about potential growth.

Respondent 11: No  major  analytical  differences.

Respondent 12: In comparison  with  Tealbook,  I  see  greater  inflationary  pressures  in  the  next  few years from a continuation of the currently highly accommodative  monetary  policy. In response to these pressures  that  threaten  the stability  of  long-term  inflation  expectations  and  increase  the risks of future economic  and  financial  imbalances,  my  views  of  appropriate  policy  would  call  for  a  lift-off of the federal funds rate in 2014. In addition, since I believe that the benefits of assets purchases are small while the potential  costs are larger, I  would  tilt asset purchases toward Treasury  securities, begin  to  taper  asset  purchases,  and  end  them  by  the  end  of  the  year.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: As stated in our response to question 3, we assume (based on our modal  economic forecast) that the asset purchase program lasts through  2014Q1 (with a slowing of the pace of purchases beginning  in  2013Q4)  rather  than  through  mid-2013  as  the  Tealbook  assumes. Because  of  the  greater size and  duration  in the balance  sheet over the forecast horizon, we thus assume  that  term  premia rise to normal  levels  more  slowly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

On  fiscal policy, we assume  that the full sequester will continue through the year, or that any substitute that is passed will have a similar fiscal restraint. We thus have somewhat  more fiscal drag  in our  forecast  than  the  'modified  sequester'  in  the  Tealbook. Our  assessment  of  the  difference between  the  full  and  modified  sequester  is  similar  to  that  of  the  Tealbook,  about 1 4 / percentage point on  real  GDP  growth.

We  see  some  of  the  headwinds  restraining  economic  growth  subsiding  somewhat  more  quickly  in 2014  than  in  the  Tealbook. Thus  we  expect  the  output  gap  to  begin  to  close  more  quickly  that  year, and  our  2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast  is  modestly  above  that  of  the  Tealbook.

We  expect a greater decline in the unemployment rate in  2014 than is projected in the Tealbook, even  accounting  for  the  differences  in  the  GDP  forecasts  and  having  similar  projections  for  the  labor force participation  rate. The source of this difference appears to be a different interpretation of  labor market  dynamics  as  expansions  mature.

Besides  the  difference  in  the  unemployment  rate,  compensation  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  is above  that  in  our  forecast. The  source  of  that  difference  is  not  yet  clear.

We see a stronger influence of  anchored inflation  expectations  on inflation dynamics than does the Tealbook. Consequently,  our  inflation forecast and the Tealbook  forecast are similar for 2013, but beyond  that we see total and core inflation near 2%  whereas  the Tealbook  has inflation fairly flat through  2015. This  difference  may  also  partially  reflect  the  differing  monetary  policy  assumptions  in the  two  forecasts.

The  Tealbook  has  a  downside  balance  of  risks  to  real  growth,  while  we  assess  the  risks  as  roughly balanced. In part, this difference may  reflect divergent views about the  amount of downside risks that could  emanate from fiscal policy  after the realization of sequestration. For inflation, we agree that the risks are broadly  balanced. However,  we  see  uncertainty  around  both  the  real  activity  and  inflation forecasts as still higher than normal  whereas the Tealbook  sees uncertainty at near normal levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual  nature  of  the  current  expansion  leaves  uncertainty about  both  real  activity  and  inflation  above  normal  levels.

Respondent 15: My  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  with  GDP  growth  rising  over  the forecast horizon  and  the unemployment  rate  moving  lower. I also share the Tealbook's  assumption that it  will be appropriate to wind down our asset purchase program sooner than  market participants currently  expect. One notable difference  is  that I do not  expect  as much disinflationary pressure  on headline PCE  inflation as the Tealbook  forecasts; my forecast for headline PCE  inflation is much closer  to  2 percent.

Respondent 16: I see somewhat  faster GDP  growth  this year than does the Tealbook, with a correspondingly  more  rapid  reduction  in  the  unemployment  rate. My  inflation  forecasts  converge  to 2 percent  more  quickly  than do the Tealbook's. These  differences imply  that there is less need for monetary-policy  accommodation.

Respondent 17: My forecast  calls for stronger growth, higher inflation, and tighter  monetary policy in 2013  than  the  Tealbook. I anticipate  a lower  unemployment  rate  than  the  Tealbook  in  2013  and 2014.

Respondent 18: I anticipate  faster  real  GDP  growth  in  2013  and  slower  real  GDP  growth  in  2015 than the Tealbook. For 2013-2015, I foresee lower unemployment  than the Tealbook. Finally, I anticipate an overshooting  of inflation before its  convergence to 2 percent.

Respondent 19: My  forecast has unemployment  falling  more  rapidly and inflation being higher than does the Tealbook.  That's because my path of appropriate policy is different than the Tealbook's assumed  policy  path.
