<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level for the federal funds  rate  at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  March  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  20-21,  2018. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  March  20-21,  2018,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such projections  in  conjunction  with  the  June  12-13,  2018,  meeting.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines are based  on  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the  Committee's  target for the federal funds  rate at the end  of the year indicated. The  actual  values  are the midpoint  of  the target range; the median  projected values are based on either the midpoint  of the target range or the target level. The  confidence  interval around  the median  projected  values  is based  on root mean  squared  errors  of various private and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years. The  confidence  interval  is  not  strictly  consistent  with  the projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  primarily  because  these  projections  are  not  forecasts  of  the  likeliest  outcomes  for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments  of appropriate  monetary  policy. Still, historical  forecast  errors  provide  a  broad  sense  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate generated  by  the  uncertainty  about  the  macroeconomic  variables  as  well  as  additional  adjustments  to  monetary  policy that  may  be  appropriate  to  offset  the  effects  of  shocks  to  the  economy.

The  confidence  interval  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  except  when  it  is  truncated  at  zero-the  bottom  of  the  lowest target range  for the federal funds  rate that has been  adopted  in  the past by the Committee. This truncation  would not be intended  to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative  interest rates to provide  additional  monetary  policy accommodation  if  doing  so  was  judged  appropriate. In such  situations,  the  Committee  could  also  employ  other  tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  their  projections.

* The  confidence  interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term  interest rates in the fourth quarter  of  the  year  indicated;  more  information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. The  shaded  area  encompasses less than  a  70  percent  confidence  interval  if  the  confidence  interval  has  been  truncated  at  zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: We  are  at  or  very  near  our  inflation  target,  but  likely  headed  well  past  full  employment.  The challenge  is  to  gradually  rein  in  growth-leaving  the  economy  vulnerable  to  policy  missteps  and  adverse  shocks. Full  convergence  is  likely  to  take  at  least  5  years.

Respondent 5: The  forecast  for  the  rest  of  this  year  and  next  calls  for  further  declines  in  the  unemployment rate. Thereafter,  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy  will  need  to  slow  below  potential  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time in  order  to  achieve  a  soft  landing. The  historical  record,  however,  suggests  that  the  'growth  recession'  implicit in  a  soft  landing  scenario  runs  a  high  risk  of  morphing  into  a  full-blown  recession. In  sum,  while  a  purely  modeldriven  forecast  would  suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below  around  2024-25,  the probability  that  the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice  is  sizable.

Respondent 6: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  by  2019. However,  it  will  take  some  more  time  to achieve  complete  convergence  to  longer-run  levels. The  effects  from  sustained  accommodative  monetary  policy will  generate  a  modest  degree  of  overshooting  of  inflation  and  an  unemployment  rate  that  remains  well  below  the natural  rate  for  a  number  of  years,  before  returning  back  to  longer-run  levels.  Recent  data  show  no  indication  of  a shift  in  longer-run  levels  of  GDP  growth  or  the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 7: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years

Respondent 12: Weexpectheadlineandcoreinflationof2.0percentin2018andbeyond, butGDPgrowthand unemployment  are  expected  to  deviate  from  their  long-run  values  conditional  on  the  current  regime.  This  regime, characterized  by low  productivity growth  and  a  low real  interest rate on  short-term  government debt,  features  GDP growth  of  2.0  percent,  an  unemployment  rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0  percent.  The  projected  deviations, due  in  part  to  federal  stimulus,  are  expected  to  be  temporary. We  project  that  overshooting  of  GDP  growth  will end  in  2020  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment  will  end  in  2021. Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term outcomes,wecannotprovideasinglesetofprojectionsforGDPgrowthandunemployment.  Calculatinganaverage of  these  variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run inflation  projection  that  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: We  still  assume  the  potential  GDP  growth  rate  is  1.8  percent. We  continue  to  judge  that the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  is  between  4  and  6  percent,  and  place  the  mode  of  that  distribution in  the  lower  half  of  that  interval  at  4.3  percent.

At  this  time,  we  tentatively  judge  that  any  supply-side  impacts  from  fiscal,  trade,  and  immigration  policies will  have  only  a  limited  effect  on  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment.  We  will continue  to  monitor  the  impact  of  policy  changes  on  these  variables.

Based  on  our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long expansions,  we  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  significantly  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  through 2020,  and  probably  not  return  to  that  level  until  at  least  few  years  into  that  decade.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective. Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  projected  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  normal unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  price  index  to  be  mildly above  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective  in  2019-20,  before  returning  to  that  level  early  in  the  next  decade.

Respondent 15: Having  essentially  achieved  our  objectives  for  inflation  and  unemployment,  the  current stance  of  monetary  policy  will  likely  cause  a  further  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  longer-run  level. Policy  rates  will  need  to  adjust  over  several  years  to  bring  unemployment  back  in  line  with  the  longer-run  objective and  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  with  price  stability.

I reduced  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  in  light  of  the  downward  unemployment  surprises since  September  2017,  when  I  last  revised  this  estimate.  A  lower  longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  consistent  with ongoing  demographic  changes,  such  as  the  aging  of  the  workforce.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: Near-term  uncertainty  is  likely  somewhat  below  average.  Uncertainty  two  or  three  years  out may  be  above  average: We  have  seldom  succeeded  in  stabilizing  the  unemployment  rate-much  less  engineering a non-trivial  increase  in  unemployment-without  triggering  a  recession. Strong,  unpredictable  fiscal- and  tradepolicy  crosswinds  have  the  potential  to  make  the  convergence  process  more-than-usually  challenging.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during  the Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 5: While  the  forecasting  exercise  under  current  conditions  may  not  be  as  uncertain  as  during the  Great  Recession,  it  is  worth  noting  that  spells  with  an  economy  significantly  above  full  employment  for  a considerable  amount  of  time  -  the  kind  of  scenario  implied  by  our  forecast  -  have  been  rare  in  the  post-WWII period.  Therefore,  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  ability  of  our  forecasting  models  to  capture  adequately  some  of the  relevant  features  associated  with  the  current  state  of  the  economy.

Respondent 6: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 7: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  on  an  economy  that  is  near  full  employment.  Trade  policy  is  a  source of increased  uncertainty  as  well. The  impact  on  inflation  uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve seems  to  be.

Respondent 8: Changes  to  the  tax  code  and  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  (BBA)  continue  to  add  uncertainty to  the  outlook.  Tax  cuts  will  boost  consumption  and  investment  and  the  BBA  will  increase  government  spending over  the  next  few  years.  However,  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  fiscal  impulse  and  the  multiplier  and  crowding out  effects  are  all  uncertain. The  potential  for  trade  barriers  to  intensify  adds  uncertainty  both  in  terms  of  the impact  of  the  policies  ultimately  enacted  (or  not)  and  through  its  current  and  prospective  influence  on  business sentiment  and  spending.  These  considerations  raise  the  uncertainty  of  our  projections  for  real  activity,  but  not  by enough to  move  us  out  of the'broadly  similar'uncertainty box.  Recent data  have  lowered  our  uncertainty  about the  inflation  outlook  somewhat,  but,  as  with  growth,  it  remains  broadly  similar  to  historical  uncertainty  for  the inflation  projection.

Respondent 13: As  noted  under  question  2b, risks concerning  the  global  outlook  are  greater  than  they were  earlier  in  the  year. While  these  heightened  risks  don't  yet  tilt  the  balance  to  notably  greater-than-average uncertainty,  the  degree  of  uncertainty  is  clearly  greater  than  it  was  late  last  year.

Respondent 14: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  widths  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the New  York  Fed  forecast  distributions  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. For  inflation,  the  increased prospects  for  the  imposition  of  significantly  restrictive  trade  and  immigration  policies  in  the  U.S.  has  increased uncertainty  around  the  outlook  to  somewhat  above  the  SEP  standard.  This  factor  also  increases  the  uncertainty around  the  real  growth  outlook;  however,  continued  indications  that  the  U.S.  economy  is  progressing  roughly along  the  lines  of  our  outlook  suggest  some  o ffsetting  reduction  in  uncertainty. Consequently,  we  assess  that  the uncertainty  around  the  real  growth  outlook  has  not  changed  significantly  since  the  March  SEP  and  remains  near the  SEP  standard.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1:

Respondent 4: Risks  are  roughly  balanced. On  the  one  hand,  the  effective  lower  bound  limits  monetary policy's  ability  to  respond  to  negative  shocks. On  the  other,  the  recent  changes  in  fiscal  policy  present  increased upside  risks  to  activity.

Respondent 5: Over  the  period  2018-2020,  we  view  the  risks  around  our  projections  as  roughly  balanced.  At a  longer  horizon,  however,  our  baseline  forecast  delivers  a  soft  landing  from  a  very  low  level  of  the  unemployment rate  to  a  higher  level  consistent  with  full  employment. As  already  mentioned,  these  smooth  transitions  are  rare in practice. We  would  therefore  judge  the  risks  to  our  projection  of  real  activity  growth  beyond  2020  as  being weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 6: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. There  still  remains  uncertainty  about the  effects  of  recent  tax  and  budget  changes  on  the  economic  outlook. The  possibility  of  retaliatory  responses  to U.S.  trade  policies  adds  additional  risk  around  the  outlook

Respondent 7: I  anticipate  fiscal stimulus  from  the  tax reform  and BBA through  2019  that  will  boost demand, raise  output  growth,  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further. However,  my  uncertainty  about  the  magnitude of  the  effect  on  demand  from  fiscal  stimulus  remains  high. Though  I  am  concerned  about  possible  adverse  effects from  international  trade  conflicts,  I  have  not  yet  factored  that  into  my  forecast.

Respondent 8: We  see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  both  growth  and  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.  In  the  near term,  domestic  demand  appears  quite  robust,  and  we  may  be  underestimating  its  momentum. Overall,  we  see the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  fiscal  policy  will  result  in  a  bit  more,  or  a  bit  less,  stimulus  than  we  built  into  our projection. Our  projection  does  incorporate  a  fairly  large  fiscal  boost  in  2018,  and  we  see  some  risk  that  more  of the  stimulus  will  occur  later  in  the  forecast  period  than  we  have  assumed. Trade  and  international  risks  appear to  have  become  tilted  to  the  downside,  but  not  by  enough  to  change  our  overall  risk  assessment. That  said,  these risks  could  become  more  acute  if  developments  in  Italy  generate  financial  stress  that  spreads  to  other  Eurozone countries,  a  strengthening  dollar  challenges  emerging  market  economies,  or  trade  barriers  intensify. Indeed,  the reports  from  our  contacts  suggest  that  business  concerns  related  to  trade  policy  have  increased  since  March  and some  say  that  these  worries  could  soon  begin  to  have  a  measureable  effect  on  investment.

With  regard  to  inflation,  we  think  the  modest  increase  to  our  2018  inflation  forecast  balances  the  near-term risks.  Over  the  medium  term,  there  is  a  risk  that  we've  underestimated  the  underlying  inflationary  pressures  in  our forecast,  particularly  given  our  projection  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  average  almost  one  percentage  point below  our  estimate  of  its  natural  rate  over  most  of  the  projection  period.  However,  on  the  downside,  continued  low levels  of  inflation  compensation  in  financial  markets  and  some  surveys  suggest  low  long  run  inflation  expectations could  hold  back  inflation  more  than  we  assume  in  our  baseline  forecast.  In  addition,  the  international  risks  noted above  could  generate  a  higher  dollar  and  lower  U.S.  inflation.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Icontinuetoviewtherisksaroundmyforecastasbroadlybalanced,conditionalonamonetary policy  path  that  is  slightly  steeper  than  the  median  path  in  the  March  SEPs.

The  underlying  fundamentals  of  the  domestic  economy  are  healthy.  The  outlook  for  foreign  economies  remains sound,  with  growth  supported  by  accommodative  monetary  policy. Nonetheless,  downside  risks  have  risen  in the  euro  area  surrounding  the  formation  of  an  Italian  government  and  financial  stresses  have  increased  in  some emerging  market  economies  that  face  large  current  account  deficits  and  external  debt  burdens.

Fiscal  policy  (the  effects  of  tax  cuts  and  increased  federal  spending  in  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act)  is  an  upside risk to the  forecast  over  the  forecast  horizon. The  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  effects  of  fiscal  policy  remain uncertain  but  I  expect  the  effects  to  become  apparent  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  carry  through  over  the forecast horizon.  I am estimating that the combined effect will provide an additional 0.5 percentage point to Q4/Q4 GDP  growth  in  2018-2020,  but  there  is  an  upside  risk  that  the  effect  could  be  larger.  Beyond  the  forecast  horizon, these  fiscal  policy  actions  pose  some  downside  risk  to  the  outlook  because  higher  fiscal  deficits  could  necessitate reduced  fiscal  spending,  an  increase  in  taxes,  and  higher  longer-term  interest  rates.

The  uncertainty  over  trade  policy  poses  a  downside  risk  to  the  forecast,  which  could  grow  over  time.  Escalating rhetoric  of  tariff threats  and  retaliatory  threats,  along  with  steps  toward  actual  tariff  actions  and  the  lack  of progress  in  renegotiating  trade  agreements,  raise  the  level  of  uncertainty  in  the  economy.  Higher  uncertainty  could negatively  a ffect  business  investment  apart  from  the  impact  of  actual  tariffs.

I continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced,  but  this  is  contingent  on  a  path  of  gradually  increasing policy  rates. If  policy  were  not  expected  to  tighten  over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  would  view  inflation  risks  as  tilted to  the  upside.  Incoming  data  suggest  that  inflation  is  firming.  My  modal  forecast  is  that  inflation  will  move  up  to 2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis  by  the  end  of  this  year,  and  remain  near  2  percent  over  the  medium  run.

If  the  dynamics  of  inflation  have  fundamentally  changed,  then  I  may  be  underestimating  the  persistence  of  low inflation  outcomes.  But  if  labor  markets  tighten  more  than  I  expect,  or  if  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  begin to  kick  in,  inflation  could  move  higher  than  I  anticipate, especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is slower  than  I've  assumed.  Even  absent  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary accommodation  than  I've  assumed  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

After  depreciating  over  much  of  the  past  year,  the  dollar  has  begun  to  strengthen.  I  expect  further  appreciation given  the  strength  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  prospects  for  tighter  monetary  policy. But  the  risks  around  the  path of the  dollar  are  two-sided. A  considerably  stronger  (weaker)-than-expected  appreciation  in  the  dollar  poses  a downside  (upside)  risk  to  the  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far.  There  does  not  seem  to  be excessive  leverage  and  banks  are  holding  relatively  high  levels  of  capital  and  liquid  assets.  However,  equity  prices still  appear  to  be  somewhat  high  relative  to  earnings  even  accounting  for  the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  reduced tax  rates,  and  the  tempering  of  stock  price  increases  this  year. Commercial  real  estate  valuations  also  continue to  be  lofty. These  signs,  the  relatively  low  level  of  interest  rates,  and  the  outlook  for  continued  strength  in  the economy  suggest  that  financial  stability  risks  could  rise  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation at  an  appropriate  pace.

Respondent 12: With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity growth  regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Recent  changes  in productivity  growth  still  leave  productivity  in  its  low  regime.  However,  as  changes  in  fiscal  and  regulatory  policy continue  to  impact  the  economy,  we  see  the  possibility  of  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  we  see  US trade  policy  as  generating  some  downward  risk  for  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion. If a  recession  were to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially. We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  recession during  the  forecast  horizon. US  trade  policy  also  raises  the  possibility  of  trade  disruptions  that  might  increase unemployment.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  if  GDP growth  surprises  on  the  upside.  Federal  stimulus  associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  might  produce such  a  surprise.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. In  addition,  federal  stimulus associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  could  push  prices  higher. Trade  policy  changes  might  also  put

some  upward  pressure  on  import  prices.  Anecdotal  reports  are  consistent  with  building  price  pressures.  Thus,  we see  the  risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  the  variable  depends  on  the behavior  of  energy  prices. While  an  upward  energy-price  shock  is  a  possibility,  a  case  can  also  be  made  for  some downward  drift  in  energy  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  for  PCE  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 13: There  are  several  risks  to  the  outlook,  chiefly  concerning  the  global  outlook. First,  while the  Italian  political  situation  appears  to  be  settled  for  the  time  being,  the  recent  imbroglio  is  a  reminder  that  the rise  of  populist,  euroskeptic  governments  continues  to  pose  risks.  Second,  although  rising  U.S.  interest  rates  have been  signaled  for  some  time,  their  arrival  seems  to  have  led  to  heightened  stress  in  a  number  of  emerging-market economies;  with  U.S.  rates  likely  to  rise  further,  these  stresses  may  intensify.  Finally,  U.S.  trade  policy  has  become even  more  aggressive  in  recent  weeks,  raising  the  risk  of  a  widening  trade  war.

Respondent 14: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  of  the  New  York  Fed  forecast  distribution. We  see  two-sided  risks  to  real  activity  associated with  recent  and  possible  future  changes  in  government  policies. On  the  one  hand  the  recent  changes  in  fiscal policies  could  have  more  positive  supply-side  and/or  demand-side  effects  than  we  currently  anticipate;  on  the other,  government  policies,  particularly  possible  more  restrictive  trade  and  immigration  policies,  could  lead  to adverse  supply-side  and  demand-side  effects.  Along  with  other  risks,  such  as  the  possibility  of  stronger  momentum associated  with  robust  household  and  business  confidence,  these  forces  appear  to  roughly  o ffset,  and  so  we  judge these  risks  to  be  roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

We  now  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced,  as  opposed  to  the  upside  skew  in  our  March  submission. The heightened prospectsof more restrictive trade  and  immigration  policies raise  both  upside  and  downside  risks,  as the supply-side  effects  of  such  policies  raise  upside  risks  while  the  demand-side  effects  raise  downside  risks.  Beyond  the risks  associated  with  those  policies,  dollar  appreciation  and  continued  soft  global  inflation  data  suggest  somewhat less  upside  risks  than  in  March.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Policy  to  date  has  kept  nominal  demand  growth  on  a  fairly  steady,  moderate  path.  This  gives me hopethat arelativelygradual transitionto a modestly restrictive monetary policy stancewillbe sufficient to put the  economy  on  a  path  that  sustains  the  expansion  while  holding  inflation  to  mandate-consistent  levels.  There  are two  important  risks  to  that  scenario,  working  in  opposite  directions.  First,  there  is  a  risk  of  disappointing  growth or  financial  instability  overseas  that  could  blow  back  onto  U.S.  financial  markets,  putting  downward  pressure  on r*. Shifting  U.S.  trade  policy  is  unhelpful  in  this  regard. Second,  there  is  a  risk  that  U.S.  fiscal  policy  will  have larger  or  more  persistent  positive  effects  on  real  activity  and  r*  than  I  currently  anticipate.  My  base  case  continues to  be  3  rate  hikes  during  2018  and  another  3  during  2019,  but  I  will  be  keeping  a  close  watch  for  signs  of  strain  in foreign  financial  markets,  shifts  in  the  U.S.  economic  outlook,  and  changes  in  the  shape  of  the  U.S.  yield  curve.

Respondent 2: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual  rise in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate.

Respondent 3: I believe  that  a  gradual  path  of  funds  rate  increases  is  likely  to  be  appropriate  for  the  next few  years,  since  I  do  not  believe  that  inflation  is  likely  to  increase  rapidly.  Accordingly,  a  gradual  path  should  give us  the  time  and  latitude  to  assess  the  data  flow  and  make  adjustments  as  necessary. In  addition,  my  forecast  for labor  productivity  growth  in  the  longer  run  is  1  1/2  percent  per  year,  which  is  a  key  factor  supporting  my  longer run  interest  rate  projection.

Respondent 4: Although  inflation  appears  to  be  firming,  it  has  been  running  below  our  2  percent  target  for quite  some  time.  While  the  labor  market  continues  to  strengthen  with  unemployment  falling  the  past  two  months, it  is  not  clear  that  we  have  reached  maximum  employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employmentpopulation  ratio  for  prime  age  persons  remain  well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains subdued.  Given  the  persistent  undershooting  of  our  inflation  target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy implies  a  very  gradual  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 5: With  the  economy  running  already  well  above  full  employment  and  a  policy  stance  that  is still  accommodative,  it  is  difficult  to  chart  an  appropriate  path  for  policy.  Optimal  control  simulations  prescribe  a higher  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  than  the  one  penciled  in  here.  A  more  aggressive  policy  tightening,  however, could  increase  the  probability  of  a  recession  in  ways  that  our  linear  models  are  unable  to  capture. Our  projected path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  tries  to  balance  this  concern  against  the  concern  that  running  an  economy  above  full employment  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time  might  create  distortions  that,  too,  increase  the  probability  of  a  future downturn.  Given  that  the  near  term  outlook  calls  for  GDP  growth  well  above  potential,  it  may  be  appropriate  to reach  a  neutral  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  sooner  rather  than  later,  and  then  raise  rates  more  gradually  in  2019

and  2020  as  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  turns  restrictive. Such  a  strategy  would  reduce  the  scope  for  further declines  in  the  unemployment  rate,  while  providing  policymakers  with  more  time  later  to  assess  how  the  economy responds  to  a  contractionary  stance,  thus  lowering  the  risk  of  tipping  the  economy  into  a  recession.

Respondent 6: The  labor  market  has  exceeded  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  and  I  expect it to continue  to  strengthen  over  the  next  couple  of  years  with  impetus  from  fiscal  policy. Given  the  strong momentum  in  the  economy,  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  3.5  percent  by  next  year.  With  the  economy above  potential,  I  anticipate  inflation  will  modestly  overshoot  our  2  percent  objective  in  2020.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest  of 1 / 2 percent.

My  fed  funds  rate  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  reflects  an  inflation  rate  that  has been  rising  only  gradually  toward  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term,  I  envision  a  path  for  the  fed funds  rate  that  moderately  overshoots  its  long-run  level  in  2019  and  2020  as  policy  acts  to  unwind  the  overshooting in  inflation  and  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 7: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  three  years  is unchanged  from  March.  My  forecasts  for  output  growth  and  inflation  in  2018  are  somewhat  higher  compared  to March  based  on  incoming  data  and  anticipated  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus.  I  am  willing  to  accept  inflation  that  runs modestly  above  the  FOMC  target  over  the  medium  term  given  the  Committee's  symmetric  inflation  objective. Consequently,  my  path  for  the  funds  rate  calls  for  a  gradual  pace  of  increases  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 8: We  assume  three  total  funds  rate  increases  in  2018,  leaving  the  funds  rate  in  the  range  of  2.00 to  2.25  percent  at  the  end  of  the  year. We  see  the  choice  between  three  or  four  moves  in  2018  as  a  close  call  and could  envision  one  more  rate  increase  if  inflation  expectations  firm  more  noticeably  as  we  move  through  the  year. In  2019,  the  policy  rate  moves  modestly  above  our  estimate  of  the  long  run  neutral  rate  of  2.75  percent,  reaching 3.00  to  3.25  percent  at  the  end  of  the  year  and  remaining  at  that  moderately  restrictive  setting  through  2020.  We assume  balance  sheet  normalization  proceeds  according  to  the  announced  plan.

For  some  time,  our  view  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  has  been  predicated  on  gradual  increases  in  the  funds rate  in  order  to  firm  inflation  expectations  at  2  percent  and  ensure  that  inflation  is  firmly  on  a  trajectory  toward our  symmetric  2  percent  objective. A  number  of  factors  suggest  this  approach  is  working  and  that  inflation  and inflation  expectations  are  headed  in  the  right  direction: the  recent  inflation  data  have  firmed;  reports  from  our contacts  point  to  higher  wage  and  cost  pressures,  some  of  which  are  being  passed  through  to  prices;  TIPS  inflation compensation  has  moved  up  some  over  the  past  year;  and  some  tentative  model  results  suggest  that  the  underlying inflation  trend  may  have  firmed  a  bit  recently.

Nonetheless,  the  low  levels  of  inflation  expectations  in  surveys  and  implied  by  TIPS  pricing  remind  us  of  the need  to  stay  the  course  for  a  while  longer,  and  our  appropriate  policy  path  remains  modestly  accommodative  until mid-2019. At  that  time,  assuming  inflationary  trends  and  expectations  firm  as  we  expect,  we  think  it  will  be appropriate  to  generate  moderately  restrictive  financial  conditions. In  our  forecast  higher  rates  lead  to  growth slightly  below  potential  by  2020. Although  our  assumed  rate  path  is  flat  between  2019  and  2020,  we  would  be prepared  to  move  policy  either  way  depending  on  events. Our  policy  trajectory  is  consistent  with  some  modest overshooting  of  our  2  percent  inflation  objective  in  2020,  which  we  see  as  a  virtue  that  will  help  to  firm  inflation expectations  symmetrically  around  the  2  percent  target.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  for  the  funds  rate  as  appropriate;  the  slope  of the  path  will  depend  on  the  evolution  of  the  economy,  medium  run  outlook,  and  the  risks  around  the  outlook,  in particular,  for  inflation  and  labor  markets.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  project  growth  above  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  4.5  percent estimate  of  its  longer-run  level. Labor  markets  are  tight  and  wages  are  accelerating. I anticipate  that  further tightening  in  the  labor  market  will  translate  into  some  continued  firming  in  the  labor  compensation  measures, in line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups. However,  given  slow productivity  growth,  I  expect  wages  to  rise  at  a  slower  pace  than  in  past  expansions.

Inflation  is  firming,  as  expected. Firms  report  increased  price  power;  there  is  a  rising  number  of  reports  that firms  are  passing  along  higher  input  costs  to  their  customers. Inflation  expectations  are  well  anchored  and  the economy  is  strong,  so  my  modal  projection  is  that  inflation  will  be  sustainably  at  our  goal  by  the  end  of  this  year and  remain  there  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should  reflect both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals.  Based  on  the  outlook  and  risks,  I  believe  it  will be  appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  move  rates  up  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon. This  strategy  would  seem to  prudently  balance  the  risk  of  stronger-than-expected  growth  leading  to  overheating  in  labor  markets,  which would  necessitate  sharper,  and  potentially  destabilizing,  rate  increases  in  the  future  versus  the  risk  that  inflation will  continue  to  undershoot  our  goal,  causing  an  unanchoring  of  inflation  expectations  and  possible  loss  of  Fed credibility. Indeed,  the  inflation  risks  may  be  tilting  to  the  upside,  and  that  combined  with  strong  growth  and strong  labor  markets  has  led  me  to  steepen  my  policy  path  somewhat. With  above-trend  growth,  labor  markets beyond  full  employment,  and  inflation  moving  back  to  2  percent  by  year-end,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  for  the funds  rate  to  rise  somewhat  above  my  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent  in  order  to  promote  our  longer-run  goals  of maximum  employment  and  price  stability.

Respondent 11: My  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  not  changed  since  the previous  SEP.

Respondent 12: A  target  of  1.88  percent  for  the  forecast  horizon  is  consistent  with  our  assessment  of  current economic  conditions  and  for  the  convergence  of  inflation,  GDP  growth,  and  unemployment  to  their  values  in  a regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. In the  event  of  a  regime  change,  such  as  a  shift  from  low  productivity  growth  to  high  productivity  growth,  our  target federal  funds  rate  will  change.

Respondent 13: My  funds  rate  path  reflects  two  key  considerations. First,  owing  to  the  recent  fiscal  policy changes,  the  short-run  neutral  rate  is  likely  rising,  and  will  may  exceed  its  long-run  level  before  too  long. As  a consequence,  the  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  will  need  to  be  higher  than  it  would  otherwise  be.  At  the  same  time, it is likely  that  underlying  inflation  is  currently  running  somewhat  below  the  Committee's  2  percent  target. An important  part  of  raising  that  target  will  be  actively  signaling  that  the  Committee  is  serious  about  achieving  its target  -  which  will  require  patience  in  raising  the  funds  rate.  I  believe  that  a  gradual  path  of  funds  rate  increases, along  the  lines  that  I  have  penciled  in  above,  will  most  appropriately  balance  these  two  considerations.

Respondent 14: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The steepness  of  the  policy  path  also  depends  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

ff DSGE  model. The  near-term  real  growth  outlook  has  improved,  but  the  medium-term  outlook  is  little  changed  since  March. Financial  conditions  have  modestly  tightened,  the  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  significantly,  and  the  risks for  inflation  have  moved  back  toward  balance.  Consequently,  our  projection  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  the same  as  in  the  March  SEP  submission: the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2018,  2019  and  2020  are  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / 2 percent,  3  - 3 1 / 4 percent  and  3 1 / 2 - 3 3 / 4 percent,  respectively.  We  judge  this  policy  stance  as  appropriate  to  ensure achievement  of  the  FOMC's  objectives  over  the  longer  run.  Our  policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  is  consistent with  the  gradual  rising  path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as  projected  by  the  New  York  Fed  sta

Our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  remains  in  the  range  of  0  -  2  percent, consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety  of  models.  Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2  percent) gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2  -  4  percent. Our  modal  projection  remains  in  the center  of  this  range,  taking  into  account  fairly  subdued  trend  productivity  growth,  little  change  in  longer-term sovereign  yields,  and  demographic  factors. Consequently,  as  reported  in  the  response  to  question  3(a),  our  point estimate  of  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  is  still  3.0  percent. Our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  thus slightly  overshoots  the  longer-run  FFR.

Respondent 15: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. The  economy  has  gone  beyond  full  capacity  and  we have  essentially  achieved  price  stability,  yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my

estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2018.  That  the  federal  funds  rate  is  still  low  despite  the  economy's  return  to  full employment  and  price  stability  reflects  the  Committee's  past  decisions,  and  I  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  federal funds  rate  as  important  to  promote  economic  and  financial  stability.  Balancing  a  gradual  path  of  the  federal  funds rate  with  accommodative  monetary  policy,  stronger  growth,  lower  unemployment,  and  higher  inflation,  I  believe the  funds  rate  will  need  to  rise  above  its  longer-run  level  in  2019  and  beyond.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Near  term,  expansionary  fiscal  policy  and  accommodative  monetary  policy  are  pushing  real activity  forward  at  a  rapid  clip,  increasing  pressure  on  an  already  strained  labor  market.  With  longer-run  inflation expectations  well  anchored,  the  tightening  labor  market  is  likely  to  drive  inflation  to,  and  then  past,  our  2-percent longer-run  objective.  In  this  setting  it  is  appropriate  that  we  continue  to  move  toward  a  neutral  policy  stance  while remaining  cognizant  of  potential  shifts  in  financial-market  conditions  and  inflation  pressures.  The  longer  that  we maintain  growth  above  potential,  the  more  difficult  it  will  be  to  achieve  a  smooth  transition  to  sustainable  growth with  stable,  on-target  inflation. Over  the  medium  and  longer  runs,  I  continue  to  be  concerned  about  eroding demographic  trends,  education  and  skill  levels  that  are  not  keeping  pace  with  business  needs  and  are  contributing to  sluggish  productivity  growth,  and  the  likely  unsustainable  path  of  U.S.  government  debt  relative  to  GDP.

Respondent 2: My  outlook  consists  of  above  trend  growth  for  the  next  two  years  before  converging  to  trend in  2020. The  recent  tax  reform  and  an  increase  in  federal  discretionary  spending  are  the  primary  drivers  of  the overshoot  of  potential.  The  change  in  the  tax  code  accelerates  capital  investment  plans,  pulling  some  investment spending  forward  into  the  latter  half  of  this  year  and  2019. However,  it  is  my  judgment  that  the  tax  reform  will only  lead  to  modest  changes  in  output  growth.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  roughly  balanced. Uncertainty  has  grown  markedly  following  changes  in U.S.  trade  policy  and  firms  could  pull  back  on  plans  by  more  than  I  currently  marked  in. On  the  other  hand,  this uncertainty  could  abate  quickly  and  the  recently  enacted  fiscal  measures  could  have  a  much  more  transformative effect  on  growth  than  I  currently  expect.

By  most  estimates,  measured  inflation  appears  to  be  running  at  or  very  close  to  target  already. Given  the absence  of  slack  in  my  projection,  I  see  inflation  continuing  at  or  modestly  above  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective through  2020.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  roughly  balanced.  Given  high  rates  of  resource  utilization,  we  could  see  a more  pronounced  inflation  response  than  a  linear  Phillips  curve  would  suggest.  However,  after  a  prolonged  period ofbelowtargetinflation,  inflationexpectationsoffirmsandhouseholdsmaybeanchoredbelowmandate-consistent levels.

Respondent 3: In  conversations  with  senior  business  executives,  I  have  heard  very  optimistic  remarks  on  the broad  economic  outlook  and  on  the  outlook  for  their  own  firms. I believe  that  this  optimism  will  support  abovetrend  GDP  growth  this  year  and  next. In  addition,  expansive  fiscal  policy  will  continue  to  boost  growth. While the  unemployment  rate  is  now  below  its  long  run  level,  I  do  not  expect  inflation  to  spike,  as  expectations  appear to  be  well  anchored.  Factors  such  as  improved  transparency  of  pricing,  o ffshoring  of  production,  and  competition from  foreign  sellers  will  make  it  difficult  for  many  domestic  firms  to  raise  prices  significantly  in  the  near  term.

Respondent 4: Core  inflation  remains  below  target  and  the  economy  continues  to  add  jobs  with  only  modest increases  in  wage  growth.  This  reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  continues  to  be  some  slack  in  the  economy.

Respondent 5: Activity  in  the  first  half  of  the  year  is  expanding  at  a  somewhat  faster  pace  than  what  was projected  in  March.  The  unemployment  rate  has  already  declined  to  a  level  that,  according  to  the  March  median SEP,  was  expected  to  be  reached  only  by  the  end  of  the  year.  Support  to  demand  appears  to  be  fairly  broad  based, with  firms'  business  investment  now  contributing  more  steadily  to  growth,  and  relative  strength  from  net  exports. Given  the  state  of  the  labor  market,  the  underlying  momentum,  and  the  ongoing  fiscal  stimulus,  we  expect  growth in  the  second  half  of  the  year  to  outstrip  potential  by  a  full  percentage  point. With  monetary  policy  tightening, the  pace  of  growth  is  expected  to  slow  down  in  2019,  and  to  eventually  fall  below  potential  in  2020,  when  the effects  of  monetary  policy  take  hold  more  fully.  We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  drop  this  year  to  3.6  percent, and  to  3.4  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. This  level  is  roughly  1 1 / 4 percentage  point  below  our  assessment  of  the equilibriumunemploymentrate,whichstandsat4.7percent.  Withtheunemploymentrateprojectedtostaybelow its  equilibrium  level  over  the  forecast  horizon,  inflation  is  expected  to  increase  modestly  above  2  percent.

Given  the  economy's  momentum,  monetary  policy  needs  to  become  restrictive  to  raise  the  unemployment rate  to  a  level  consistent  with  full  employment. The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  increases  in  the  federal funds  rate  that  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon  steer  policy  to  a  stance  that  is  only  moderately  restrictive. By historical  standards,  this  is  a  cautious  pace  of  policy  tightening  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  already  below its  estimated  equilibrium  level.  Such  an  approach  tries  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  risks  associated  with  an  even moregradualincreaseinrates, andtheriskthatfasterpolicytighteningmayincreasetheprobabilityoftheeconomy falling  into  a  recession. It  is  nevertheless  important  to  recognize  that  the  past  does  not  provide  much  guidance  in terms  of  how  to  conduct  policy  so  as  to  achieve  a  soft  landing  when  the  economy  is  beyond  full  employment.

We  view  the  risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced  in  the  near  term. We  take  a  fairly conservative  view  of  the  effect  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  on  GDP  growth,  and  it  is  possible  that  the  tax  cuts will  stimulate  activity  by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  expecting,  for  example  via  business  sentiment  effects that  are  outside  of  our  forecasting  model.  Recent  events  highlight  the  risk  that  concerns  about  Italy's  solvency  and continued  membership  in  the  euro  area  may  trigger  a  confidence  crisis  with  widespread  adverse  spillovers  to  the rest  of  the  world.  Such  a  development  could  have  even  more  dire  consequences  if  coupled  with  a  loss  of  confidence in Deutsche  Bank,  whose  ongoing  troubles  pose  a  threat  to  financial  stability. In  the  medium  term,  the  ability to  achieve  a  soft  landing  remains  questionable,  and  a  scenario  such  as  the  one  outlined  in  the  current  Tealbook ('A  Strong  but  Precarious  Projection')  in  which  the  economy  eventually  falls  into  a  recession  as  monetary  policy tries  to  move  the  unemployment  rate  back  up  to  its  natural  level  would  have  several  historical  precedents. The probability  of  such  a  scenario  would  be  even  higher  if  in  the  presence  of  persistently  tight  labor  market  conditions inflation  reacts  more  forcefully,  thus  eliciting  a  stronger  monetary  policy  response.  Still,  in  the  near  term  we  view the  risks  to  inflation  as  fairly  balanced,  as  a  countervailing  risk  to  a  nonlinear  inflation  response  may  be  given  by an  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  that  is  lower  than  what  we  are  currently  estimating.

Respondent 6: The  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  trend,  which  has  pushed  the unemployment  rate  lower. As  in  my  March  SEP,  I  have  factored  in  a  sizable  amount  of  fiscal  stimulus  to  the economic  outlook. Going  forward,  ongoing  strength  in  households  disposable  income  coupled  with  past  gains  in household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  outlook  for  fixed  business  investment  also appears  strong  given  the  tax  changes  and  continued  optimism.  However,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the  impact of  rising  oil  prices,  an  appreciating  U.S.  dollar,  and  possible  retaliatory  tariffs  from  U.S.  trading  partners

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  expansion  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  well  above  potential. With considerable  fiscal  stimulus  and  some  monetary  accommodation  still  in  place,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for the  next  few  years,  leading  to  a  further  pickup  in  inflation. I continue  to  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent target  by  2019,  and  to  overshoot  slightly  through  2020. Normalization  of  monetary  policy  and  a  tightening  of fiscal  policy  will  help  bring  inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the following  years.

Respondent 7: My  forecast  calls  for  above-trend  growth  of  2.8  percent  in  2018,  edging  down  to  2  percent  in 2020.  Mynear-termforecastisslightlyhigherthaninMarchbasedonthestrengthofincomingdataandanticipated effects  on  demand  from  fiscal  stimulus. However,  my  uncertainty  about  the  demand  effects  from  fiscal  stimulus remains  high,  especially  given  the  high  level  of  resource  utilization  in  the  economy. As  well,  uncertainty  about trade  policy  and  the  potential  for  escalating  trade  frictions  with  our  trading  partners  is  elevated. I expect  the unemployment  rate  to  remain  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  as  output  grows  at  a healthy  pace  and  the  labor  force  participation  rate  path  flattens.  My  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  slightly lower  over  the  forecast  horizon  compared  to  March  largely  because  of  strong  incoming  data  on  the  labor  market. I anticipate  that  inflation  will  run  modestly  above  the  Committee's  target  in  2019  and  2020. With  above-trend output  growth,  low  unemployment,  and  slightly  above-target  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon  I  anticipate  a gradual  increase  in  the  federal  funds  to  a  level  in  2020  that  is  slightly  above  my  longer-run  projection.

Respondent 8: The  fundamentals  underlying  private  domestic  final  demand  are  strong. Accommodative monetary  and  fiscal  policy,  a  robust  labor  market,  and  improved  balance  sheets  support  strong  gains  in  consumer spending  and  investment.  Although  recent  indicators  of  international  growth  are  mixed,  we  continue  to  see  healthy foreign  demand  as  another  plus  for  the  outlook.  We  also  expect  tax  cuts  and  higher  government  spending  to  boost growth  in  2018  by  close  to  1  percent.  The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  accommodation  and  a  smaller  impulse  from fiscal  policy  are  projected  to  bring  GDP  growth  down  in  2019  and  2020. (We  assume  the  fiscal  impulse  is  only  a tenth  or  two  in  2020.)  On  the  supply  side,  we  assume  that  robust  capital  spending,  due  in  part  to  the  tax  bill,  will

boost  potential  growth  a  bit  over  the  forecast  period.  Our  assumptions  regarding  fiscal  policy  are  unchanged  and our  forecast  does  not  incorporate  any  changes  in  trade  or  immigration  policy.  In  sum,  we  project  growth  will  run more  than  a  full  percentage  point  above  potential  in  2018,  a  little  less  than 1 / 2 percentage  point  above  in  2019,  and then  slow  to  modestly  below  potential  in  2020.

We  think  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  currently  4.4  percent  and  that  it  will  fall  to  its  long-run  level  of 4.3  percent  by  2019. We  expect  the  actual  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  3.3  percent  in  2019  and  then  rise to  3.5  percent  in  2020,  leaving  a  0.8  percentage  point  gap  from  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

Although  we  have  some  tentative  indications  that  the  trend  in  inflation  may  be  firming,  relatively  low  readings on  key  measures  of  inflation  expectations  suggest  that  underlying  inflation  is  likely  still  below  2  percent. Various features  of  our  forecast  will  help  boost  this  trend  closer  to  target.  With  unemployment  forecast  to  undershoot  the natural  rate  substantially,  resource  pressures  should  provide  a  notable  lift  to  inflation  going  forward.  We  also  rely on  a  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent inflation  target  to  solidify  inflation  expectations  around  our  2  percent  inflation  objective. A  non-accelerationist Philipps  curve  limits  the  upside  risk  to  inflation,  even  with  the  unemployment  rate  a  little  below  3  1/2  percent.  All told,  we  see  inflation  reaching  2.0  percent  this  year,  remaining  at  that  level  in  2019,  and  then  modestly  overshooting our  objective  in  2020.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 9: I believe  that  the  economy  has  considerable  momentum,  helped  along  by  expansionary  fiscal policy.  Strong  growth  will  push  down  the  unemployment  rate,  but  by  a  fairly  modest  amount  as  workers  are  drawn into  the  workforce,  increasing  labor  force  participation. The  bu ffering  effect  of  higher  potential  growth,  both  in response  to  policy  changes  as  well  as  increased  investment  and  labor  force  participation,  will  limit  the  spillover  of growth  into  inflation.

Respondent 10: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  accommodative financial  conditions,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  strong  labor  market conditions,  and  accommodative  monetary  and  fiscal  policy. Oil  prices  have  risen,  but  remain  relatively  low  and the  economy  is  less  sensitive  to  oil  prices  than  in  the  past. The  tax  changes  imply  higher  disposable  personal income  and  after-tax  corporate  profits,  which  should  lead  to  somewhat  higher  spending  over  the  forecast  horizon. The  budget  package  will  expand  federal  government  spending,  although  the  timing  is  uncertain. Consumer  and business  sentiment  remain  positive.  Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  ongoing  tightness  in  labor markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified  workers,  and  the  increasing  need  to  raise  wages  in  order to  retain  workers  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations. The  global  outlook  remains  positive,  although risks  to  the  euro  area  have  risen.

I  project above-trend  growth  and that labor  market strength will continue,  moving  the economy  further  beyond maximum  employment.

Incoming  data  indicate  that  inflation  is  firming  and  anecdotal  reports  indicate  firms  have  increasing  pricing power  to  pass  along  higher  input  costs  to  their  customers. Inflation  is  near  our  goal  and  I  expect  inflation  to be  sustainably  at  2  percent  by  year  end  and  to  remain  at  that  level  through  the  forecast  horizon,  based  on  my projection  that  growth  will  be  above  trend,  labor  markets  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  expectations will  continue  to  be  well-anchored.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  the  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy and  inflation,  but  this  is  contingent  on  an  upward  policy  rate  path.

Respondent 11: The  main  factors  shaping  my  economic  outlook  include  an  increasingly  strong  labor  market, still-supportive  domestic  financial  conditions,  growth  abroad,  accommodative  domestic  fiscal  policy,  and  more data  suggesting  that  inflation  will  move  to  around  2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis.

Respondent 12: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  US  economy. In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them.  The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. We  are,  however,  paying  close  attention  to  many  factors  that  might  precipitate  a  regime  change,  such

as  a  change  in  tax  policy  that  might  move  the  economy  to  a  high  productivity  state. Monetary  policy  is  regimedependent  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  the  previously  mentioned  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  may  require  adjustment,  However,  predicted when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast  that  the  economy  will  remain  in  the  current regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 13: Fiscal  policy  is  a  key  factor  in  my  outlook,  providing  a  boost  to  aggregate  demand  this  year and  next. With  the  unemployment  rate  already  significantly  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  value,  it  will  be appropriate  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  several  years,  to  a  level  that  exceeds  that  in  the  longer-run. These  competing  factors  net  out  to  above-trend  GDP  growth  this  year  and  next,  and  the  unemployment  rate drops  to  3.3  percent  next  year. With  fiscal  impetus  fading  and  interest  rates  rising  still  further,  GDP  growth drops  below  potential  in  2020  and  the  unemployment  rate  edges  up. Inflation  moves  up  in  my  outlook  to  a  pace that  slightly  exceeds  the  Committee's  objective. In  my  projection,  an  important  factor  boosting  inflation  is  the FOMC's  patience  in  raising  interest  rates.  Patience  in  the  face  of  low  unemployment  and  inflation  that  is  close  to the  Committee's  objective  will  help  re-anchor  trend  inflation  at  target.

Respondent 14: The  recent  expenditure  data  indicate  a  stronger  rebound  of  growth  in  Q2  than  had  been previouslyanticipated,withourprojectionforrealGDPgrowthnowaround4percent(annualrate).  Consequently, the  real  GDP  growth  rate  for  2018H1  now  looks  to  be  about  3  percent,  which  is  about  the  same  as  that  over  2017H2 and  about 1 / 2 percentage  point  above  our  projection  in  the  March  SEP.  We  view  some  of  the  Q2  strength  to  be transitory,  reflecting  the  unwinding  of  factors  that  held  down  growth  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  As  in  the  March SEP,  we  expect  growth  to  remain  near  3  percent  over  2018H2,  so  that  the  2018  Q4/Q4  growth  rate  is  3.0  percent, up  from  2.6  percent  in  March.  We  expect  growth  to  slow  to  around  2 1 / 2 percent  in  2019,  and  then  slow  further  to 2  percent  in  2020,  due  to  ongoing  tightening  of  financial  conditions  and  fading  of  fiscal  stimulus.

Even  though  we  have  marked  up  our  projection,  the  pickup  in  growth  in  2018  is  generally  consistent  with  the narrative  of  the  U.S.  economy  that  we  have  had  for  the  past  few  SEP  rounds.  After  a  soft  patch  from  mid-2015  to early-2016,  the  economy  has  regained  its  footing  and  is  now  in  a  strong  cyclical  position.  Household  balance  sheets appear  to  be  in  the  best  shape  in  years,  and  indices  of  consumer  confidence  are  at  high  levels. Housing  starts  per capita  remain  below  their  long-run  average  and  home  prices  continue  to  increase,  suggesting  that  housing  could provide  a  positive  growth  impulse  for  some  time,  although  supply  constraints  could  limit  that  impulse  over  the short  term. Businesses  appear  to  have  begun  to  ramp  up  investment  spending,  with  new  orders  for  nondefense capital  goods  ex-aircraft  trending  higher.  Global  demand  remains  solid,  supporting  U.S.  exports.  Furthermore,  a substantial  amount  of  fiscal  stimulus  has  been  added  through  the  Tax  Cut  and  Jobs  Act  of  2017  and  the  Bipartisan Budget  Act  of  2018: These  changes  are  expected  to  reduce  the  primary  budget  balance  by  0.3  and  0.4  percent  of GDP  in  2018  and  2019,  respectively,  according  to  the  CBO.

With  growth  above  our  estimate  of  its  potential  rate  over  the  entire  forecast  horizon,  we  see  the  unemployment rate  trending  lower,  averaging  3.6  percent  in  2018Q4  and  3.4  percent  in  2019Q4. It  is expected  to  remain  near  3 1 / 2 percent  in  2020.  Our  projected  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  dampened  by  anticipated  modest  increases in productivity  growth  and  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate. The  growth  rate  of  compensation  per  hour  is projected  to  trend  higher  over  the  forecast  horizon,  with  the  quarterly  change  exceeding  4  percent  by  2019Q4.  The projected  increase  in  compensation  growth  surpasses  that  of  productivity  growth,  resulting  in  a  gradual  upward trend  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  unit  labor  costs. This  in  turn  leads  to  a  gradual  upward  trend  in  the  labor  share  of national  income.

As  in  the  March  SEP,  inflation  is  projected  to  overshoot  the  FOMC's  2  percent  objective,  with  the  core  PCE inflation  at  2.1  percent  in  2018  (Q4/Q4)  and  2.3  percent  in  2019  and  2020. Near-term  overall  PCE  inflation  is somewhat  higher  than  core  inflation  because  of  the  rise  of  energy  prices,  but  it  is  expected  to  be  at  a  similar  rate over  the  medium  term.  Nevertheless,  we  anticipate  that  inflation  expectations  will  remain  at  levels  consistent  with the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

Respondent 15: Central  economic  outlook:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend growth  from  2018  to  2020,  where  fiscal  policy  is  the  main  factor  boosting  growth  above  trend.  With  the  economy already  beyond  full  capacity,  the  growth  forecast  indicates  that  the  gap  between  real  GDP  and  its  potential  level

will  widen  over  the  forecast  period. I expect  headline  and  core  inflation  to  rise  above  2  percent  over  the  forecast horizon,  reflecting  accommodative  monetary  policy  and  real  GDP  above  potential.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad.  The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly  balanced.  On  the  downside,  possible  changes  in  government  policies,  including  the  risk  of  escalating  trade  restrictions and  tighter  immigration  policies,  could  harm  economic  growth.  Softer  data  in  Europe  along  with  renewed  political concerns  there  also  pose  downside  risk  to  economic  growth. Furthermore,  as  monetary  policy  becomes  less  accommodative  and  heads  toward  a  restrictive  policy  stance,  the  combination  of  tightening  financial  conditions  and tightening  labor  market  conditions  is  likely  to  make  monetary  policy-making  more  difficult,  increasing  the  risk  of  a policy  error.  In  the  past,  periods  of  overheating  have  often  led  to  higher  inflation  and/or  financial  imbalances,  and ultimately  recession.  Upside  risks  to  my  forecast  stem  from  greater-than-expected  momentum  in  the  economy  and the  possibility  that  deregulation  and  elevated  business  confidence  translate  into  sustained  increases  in  investment and  productivity.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Marginally  stronger-than-expected  incoming  data  have  led  me  to  revise  my  GDP  growth projections  modestly  upward  in  2018  and  2019,  and  to  revise  my  unemployment  projections  modestly  downward. With  a  somewhat  tighter  labor  market,  inflation  rises  a  little  bit  faster  to  a  little  bit  higher  level  over  the  projections horizon.

Respondent 2: The  economic  data  released  since  the  March  meeting  have  led  me  to  arithmetically  adjust  my 2018:H1  projection. However,  I  view  much  of  the  unexpected  strength  in  the  recent  data  as  transitory,  not  as  a signal  of  an  accelerated  pace  of  growth.

I have  marked  down  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  incorporate  its  surprise  decline  over  the  last  two employment  reports.

In  response  to  a  higher  near-term  trajectory  of  gasoline  prices,  I've  marked  up  my  2018  headline  PCE  forecast. However,  the  slope  of  oil futures  would  translate  into  a  moderate  decline  in  gasoline  prices  should  historical relationships  hold.  As  such,  I've  marked  down  headline  inflation  in  2019  by  a  tenth.

Respondent 3: My  projection  for  GDP  growth  this  year  increased  slightly,  due  to  strong  consumer  spending recently.  And  my  projection  for  the  PCEPI  this  year  increased  in  order  to  reflect  the  higher  trajectory  of  gasoline prices  since  the  last  SEP.

Respondent 4: Energy prices  have  moved  up  more  than  I  had  expected,  causing  me  to  move  up  my  projections for  near-term  inflation.

Respondent 5: Revisions  to  the  real  outlook  have  been  minor,  and  the  inflation  outlook  is  essentially  unchanged. These  outcomes  are  achieved  with  less  policy  tightening  in  this  forecast,  as  we  are  estimating  a  larger response  of  economic  activity  to  an  increase  in  interest  rates.

Respondent 6: My  assumptions  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  on  the  economic  outlook  are  unchanged from  the  March  SEP.

My  inflation  projection  is  largely  unchanged  from  September. I continue  to  expect  inflation  to  reach  the  2 percent  target  by  2019  and  modestly  overshoot  in  2020.

Respondent 7: I have  revised  down  my  unemployment  rate  path  slightly  and  edged  down  my  estimate  of longer-run  unemployment  compared  to  March  -  largely  on  the  strength  of  incoming  data.  My  forecast  continues to  build  in  some  fiscal  stimulus  in  2018  and  2019,  however  I  remain  uncertain  about  its  effective  magnitude.

Respondent 8: Our current forecast  incorporates  a revised  estimate of the natural  rate of unemployment that, in  addition  to  changes  in  the  age  and  gender  composition  of  the  population  over  time,  also  accounts  for  changes  in skills  as  measured  by  completed  years  of  education.  As  a  result,  our  current  estimates  of  the  NAIRU  are  0.2  -  0.3 percentage  point  lower  over  the  forecast  period,  and  our  long-run  normal  unemployment  rate  is  now  4.3  percent. We  also  incorporated  a  revised  estimate  of  potential  GDP  which  takes  into  account  the  new  NAIRU  as  well  as  the usual  range  of  factors  that  go  into  our  regular  growth  accounting  exercise;  these  boosted  our  numbers  for  potential output  a  bit  in  2018-2020,  but  left  our  long-run  growth  assumption  unchanged  at  1.8  percent.

On  net,  our  GDP  growth  forecast  is  little  changed  compared  to  March.  Our  projections  of  the  GDP  gap  and  the gap  between  the  unemployment  rate  and  the  natural  rate  are  0.1  to  0.2  percentage  points  smaller  over  the  forecast period.

The  incoming  data  and  anecdotal  reports  from  our  business  contacts  point  to  a  bit  firmer  inflation  trend. Accordingly,  we  raised  our  forecast  for  core  CPE  inflation  by  0.2  percentage  point  in  2018  and  0.1  percentage  point in  2019. In  response,  we  made  monetary  policy  slightly  less  accommodative  (moving  forward  a  rate  increase  into 2019).  This  forecast  continues  to  generate  modest  overshooting  of  inflation  in  2020.

Respondent 9: My outlook  is  little  changed.  I  have  lowered  my  near-term  unemployment  forecast  in  response to  the  incoming  data.  I  have  boosted  near-term  headline  inflation  to  incorporate  the  recent  run  up  in  oil  prices.

Respondent 10: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  is  similar  to  that  in  March. Economic  fundamentals  remain healthy  and  fiscal  policy  will  add  to  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon. Reflecting  incoming  data,  I  have  edged  up my  growth  and  inflation  forecasts  and  edged  down  my  unemployment  rate  forecast  over  the  projection  horizon.  I expect  growth  to  be  above  trend,  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  below  its  longer  run  level  over  the  forecast  horizon, and  inflation  to  be  sustainably  at  2  percent  by  the  end  of  this  year  and  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Given  current  conditions,  the  medium  run  outlook,  and  risks,  I  view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as appropriate  and  a  prudent  course  that  balances  the  risks.  My  funds  rate  path  is  slightly  steeper  than  in  my  March projection  reflecting  the  changes  I've  made  to  my  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  forecasts  (consistent  with steeper  paths  seen  across  a  number  of  monetary  policy  rules).

Respondent 11: My  projection  has  not  changed  all  that  much  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 12: Recent  data  has  caused  us  to  increase  our  projections  for  GDP  growth  for  2018  and  2019  and decrease  our  projections  for  unemployment  for  2018,  2019,  and  2020.

Respondent 13: A  key  factor  underlying  my  forecast  revision  has  been  the  strong  incoming  data,  especially on  the  labor  market. As  a  consequence  of  those  incoming  data,  my  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  at  the end  of  the  year  is  now  0.2  percentage  point  lower  than  in  March.  That  stronger  outlook  has  led  me  to  revise  up  my estimate  of  the  short-run  neutral  rate  and  as  a  consequence,  my  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  somewhat  steeper than  in  March.

Respondent 14: As  noted  earlier,  the  recent  expenditure  data  indicate  stronger  growth  over  2018H1  than  we anticipated  in  March;  however,  we  see  some  of  that  strength  as  transitory  and  have  not  made  substantial  changes to  the  medium-term  projections.  We  assume  no  material  effect  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  on  the  potential  growth  rate. Similarly,  we  currently  see  no  material  effect  of  trade  and  immigration  policies  on  the  potential  growth  rate  or  other longer-run  variables.

Although  greater  prospects  for  more  restrictive  trade  and  immigration  policies  do  not  have  a  significant  effect on  our  modal  projections,  they  have  increased  our  assessment  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  outlook  as noted  in  the  response  to  question  2(a).

As  noted  in  the  response  to  question  2(b),  we  now  see  the  inflation  risks  as  returning  to  a  rough  balance  after being  modestly  skewed  to  the  upside  in  March.  This  shift  reflects  the  impact  of  the  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar and  continued  soft  global  inflation  data  on  our  risk  assessment.

Respondent 15: I have  made  no  significant  changes  to  my  forecast  or  underlying  assumptions  since  March.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Despite  a  fed-funds-rate  path  that  is  less  aggressive  than  that  of  the  Tealbook,  I  see  a  bit more  of  a  deceleration  in  real  activity  in  2019  and  2020. In  my  submission,  consequently,  the  unemployment  rate begins  to  turn  up  at  the  end  of  the  projections  horizon.  Fading  fiscal  stimulus  contributes  to  the  anticipated  growth slowdown.

My  inflation  path  is  slightly  higher  than  the  Tealbook's,  principally  because  I'm  not  convinced  that  the  longerterm  inflation  expectations  relevant  to  price  setting  are  currently  below  our  2-percent  inflation  objective.

Respondent 2: My  baseline  growth  projection  remains  muted  relative  to  the  Tealbook  baseline. I am  continuing  to  mark  in  a  smaller  impact  from  tax  reform  on  overall  growth  than  the  Tealbook,  resulting  in  a  lower growth  profile  over  the  next  two  years. Much  of  the  divergence  between  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  and the  projection  marked  into  the  Tealbook  owes  to  differences  in  our  employment  growth  projections  over  the  next several  years.

Respondent 3: In  both  the  Tealbook  and  this  submission,  real  GDP  growth  is  near  trend  in  2020;  however, my  estimate  of  trend  is  a  quarter  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook's,  due  to  my  higher  forecast  for  labor  productivity. That  difference  also  leads  my  unemployment  path  to  be  higher  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 4: Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  my  forecast  for  economic  activity  is  a  bit  stronger,  but  my  forecast for  inflation  is  broadly  similar.  I  believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market will  continue  to  keep  the  labor  force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job growth  on  the  unemployment  rate.  I  believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually than  in  the  Tealbook.  Even  with  lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  return  to  target  at  about the  same  time  as  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: We  view  our  forecast  as  qualitatively  similar  to  the  Tealbook. In  both  forecasts  monetary policy  needs  to  tighten  noticeably  more  than  what  financial  markets  are  currently  expecting  for  the  unemployment rate  to  revert  back  to  a  level  consistent  with  full  employment.  Our  outlook  features  a  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate which  is  somewhat  less  steep,  consistent  with  empirical  evidence  suggesting  that  a  monetary  policy  tightening  has a  greater  impact  on  economic  activity  than  a  monetary  policy  easing  of  the  same  magnitude.

Respondent 6: The  two  projections  are  largely  in  alignment,  with  the  exception  of  the  anticipated  path  for the  federal  funds  rate.

In  both,  the  waning  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation slow  growth  closer  to  potential  by  the  end  of  2019.  Finally,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  pushes inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  2019  and  results  in  a  slight  overshooting  of  inflation  for  some  time  afterwards. The  Tealbook  projects  a  slightly  more  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment,  with  the  unemployment  rate declining  to  3.4  percent  at  the  end  of  2020.  In  my  projection,  the  unemployment  rate  bottoms  out  at  3.5  percent  by the  middle  of  2019.  My  projection  for  the  funds  rate  path  shows  a  more  gradual  rise  and  less  overshooting  relative to  the  funds  rate  path  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 7: My  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  remains  considerably  more  accommodative  than the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 8: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  next  three  years,  ending 2020  at  3.25  percent. We  assess  the  long-run  neutral  funds  rate  to  be  2.75  percent,  so  we  do  not  overshoot  the long-run  fed  funds  rate  by  nearly  as  much  as  the  Tealbook  does.

Our  projection  for  Q4-to-Q4  GDP  growth  in  2018  is  2  tenths  higher  than  that  of  the  Tealbook,  but  very  similar in 2019  and  2020. Our  forecast  is  based  on  a  touch  smaller  but  more  front-loaded  impulse  from  tax  cuts  and

government  spending,  and  a  shallower  path  for  the  funds  rate. We  continue  to  view  the  current  output  gap  to be  narrower  than  the  Tealbook  so  that  by  the  end  of  2020  it  remains  about  1  percentage  point  smaller  than  the Tealbook's.  Our  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook's,  although  we  see  unemployment rising  slightly  (albeit  to  a  level  still  well  below  the  natural  rate)  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period. Our  revised estimates  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  are  three  to  four  tenths  lower  than  the  Tealbook  estimates. As a result,  our  3.5  percent  unemployment  rate  projection  for  2020:Q4  undershoots  the  natural  rate  by  about  0.5 percentage  point  less  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Our  forecast  for  inflation  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook's,  although  it  is  conditioned  on  a  more  accommodative monetary  policy  path.

ff outlook. Respondent 9: I  have  a  stronger  outlook  for  potential  growth  than  the  Tealbook.  Consequently,  I  believe  that the  economy  can  grow  faster  in  the  near-term  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook  without  much  additional  upward impetus  to  price  inflation. My  more  optimistic  outlook  for  potential  growth  is  consistent  with  a  slightly  higher long-run  neutral  interest  rate  compared  to  that  in  the  Sta

Respondent 10: As  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  an  above-trend  pace, labor  market  conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  remain  near  our  2  percent  goal  over  the forecast  horizon. The  Tealbook  has  revised  its  unemployment  rate  path  up  and  its  inflation  forecast  down  since March,  so  the  Tealbook  and  my  forecast  are  now  quantitatively  similar  along  many  dimensions. However,  to  get these  similar  outcomes,  the  Tealbook  has  a  steeper  funds  rate  path,  especially  in  2020.  By  the  end  of  the  forecast horizon,  the  Tealbook  policy  path  is  about  90  basis  points  higher  than  mine. Thus,  the  Tealbook  sees  a  slightly stronger  underlying  economy  that  needs  to  be  tempered  by  more  restrictive  monetary  policy  compared  to  my projection.

Respondent 11: MyprojectionsforGDPgrowth, theunemploymentrate, andinflationarebroadlyconsistent with  the  Tealbook.  I  have  slightly  stronger  growth  and  a  slightly  higher  path  for  inflation.  My  path  for  the  target federal  funds  rate  is  substantially  lower  than  the  Tealbook  path.

Respondent 12: For  GDP  growth  and  inflation,  our  projections  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook.  Differences  arise  with  respect  to  monetary  policy  implications  because  the  Tealbook  projections  incorporate  the  idea of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is  converging. Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as the  economy  transitions  to  the  longer-run  steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. Our  regime  conception,  in  contrast,  views  monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed as  persistent. It is acknowledged  that  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  these regime  are  difficult  to  forecast. This  suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to that  contained  in  the  Tealbook.  The  Tealbook  also  has  a  substantial  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate,  far more  than  our  undershooting,  before  returning  to  its  longer-run  value  of  4.7  percent.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Our  growth  projections  are  fairly  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  (and  in  the  Tealbook update),  but  there  are  larger  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and  our  projections  for  the  other  SEP variables.

Although  the  unemployment  rate  paths  in  our  projection  and  in  the  Tealbook  are  essentially  the  same,  the Tealbook  features  a  larger  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate,  as  its  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal unemployment  rate,  at  4.7  percent  is  0.4  percentage  point  above  our  estimate. This  larger  undershooting  of unemployment  is  the  counterpart  of  a  sizable  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation. In  our projection,  the  participation  rate  rises  gradually  to  just  above  63  percent  in  2019,  while  in  the  Tealbook  this  rate is steady  at  62.7  percent  at  end-2019. This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  continue  to  differ,  as  they  did  in  March.  We  see  core  PCE  inflation  rising  to  2.1 percent  in  2018  and  further  to  2.3  percent  in  2019-2020,  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade.  The Tealbook  projects  inflation  still  below  target  in  2018  and  mildly  overshooting  in  2020:  core  inflation  is  projected  at

2.1  percent,  despite  a  larger  undershooting  of  unemployment  than  in  our  projection.  The  considerable  persistence of inflation  and  the  flat  Phillips  curve  in  the  Tealbook  appear  to  require  a  prolonged  period  of  above-potential growth  in  order  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. The  overshoot  of  inflation  in  our projectionhelpstoensurethatinflationexpectationsdonotfallbelowlevelsconsistentwiththeFOMC'slonger-run objective.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  both  projections  see  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels  and risks  to  real  growth  and  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  below  the  Tealbook  path  for  2018  -  20. In  addition,  our  assumption  for the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  50  basis  points  above  that  of  the  Tealbook,  which  is  unchanged  at  2.50  percent. Both  policy  paths  have  an  overshooting  of  the  longer-run  FFR  in  2019  -  20,  although  the  Tealbook's  is  appreciably larger,  which  is  a  reflection  of  the  larger  projected  positive  output  gap  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 15: My  assumptions  and  projections  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook.
