Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.   Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.   Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The January projections were made in conjunction with the FOMC meeting on January 25-26, 2011.

- 1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c).  If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  shorter  or  longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estim ate  of the duration  of the  convergence  process.  You  may  also  include  below  any  other explanatory  com m ents  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

The convergence process may be slightly shorter than 5-6 years.

Respondent  5:

N/A

Respondent  6:

Convergence may well take the full 5-to-6 years.  Inflation is likely to overshoot the level I think is consistent with price stability.

Respondent  7:

I  expect  the  convergence  process will be  similar to that  outlined in the long-run projection reported in the Tealbook.  In five to six years,  unemployment  and output gaps close,  with PCE price inflation  approaching its long-run value of 2 percent soon thereafter.

Respondent  8:

N/A

Respondent  9:

I  anticipate that  the convergence process for real  GDP growth will be substantially shorter than 5-6 years, perhaps on the order of 3-4 years  for real growth  (with  a period of overshoot  of real  growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an  overshoot  (above  1.5%)  in the interim in  inflation  as  a consequence  of significant past  growth in the monetary base supported by longer term asset purchases that cannot  be sold off over  a very short time period.  I  anticipate that the decline in the unemployment rate will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  10:

In general,  I expect the convergence process to take five to six years.  However,  I am concerned that a delay in the removal of the extraordinary level of monetary policy accommodation could cause long-term inflation expectations to become unanchored and lead to financial imbalances, both of which could eventually desta­ bilize the economy and further prolong the convergence process.

Respondent  11:

Respondent  12:

Real activity is anticipated to reach maximum employment within a five-year horizon.  Inflation, however, is

Respondent  14:

In my baseline projection,  the economy converges to the long-run trend by the end of 2016.

Respondent  15:

N/A

Respondent  16:

I  remain  highly uncertain  about  the  long-term  (5  year)  outlook  for  E/P.  Will  it  rise  back  above  0.6?  I  do not know.

Respondent  17:

Our current  estimate of the  economy's  potential growth rate  is in the  2.5%  to  2.7%  range.  By 2015-16  we anticipate  potential  growth  to  slow  to  2.4%,  reflecting  slower  trend  growth  of hours  worked  as  the  baby boomers retire.  A reasonable estimate  for the long-run unemployment rate is 4%  to 6%.  Assuming appro­ priate policy and no further significant shocks, we expect the unemployment rate to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-2016.

We assume that long-term inflation expectations will continue to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a CPI  basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective is and will be about 2% for the PCE deflator and around 2.5% for the CPI. Under these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to be near zero, we expect inflation as measured by the PCE deflator to be around 2% in 2015-16.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Respondent  4:

The  incoming data  has  been  somewhat  weaker  than  my  January  projection. However,  I  view  this  recent weakness  as  temporary. Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economic  recovery  will continue to gain momentum.  It remains the case that the effect of the extraordinary monetary policy in place and uncertainties surrounding the future path of policy, including the timing of the exit from accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

Respondent  5:

There is a good deal of uncertainty over both the behavior of individuals exhausting extended unemployment insurance benefits  and  the  speed  at  which improvements in labor  market  conditions  will draw  discouraged workers back into the  labor  force. Though these work in offsetting directions,  they still  induce  heightened uncertainty to the unemployment rate forecast.

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

This  is  a  close  call,  but  uncertainty  appears  to  be  broadly  similar  to  its  average  over  the  past  20  years. Importantly,  my  forecast  errors  have  been  relatively  small  since  the  recovery  began  a  year  and  half ago, which is consistent with less,  not more,  uncertainty.

Respondent  9:

Respondent  10:

The uncertainty surrounding my projections remains higher than normal.  In addition to Tealbook's assess­ ment  of the  uncertainty,  I  would  add  fiscal  policy to the  list. The unsustainable fiscal  policy,  and policies that  may  (or  may not)  be  adopted  by Congress  or  forced by the  market,  adds  considerable  uncertainty to the outlook.

With the recovery process more  firmly in  place,  uncertainty  for projected  real  GDP  and unemployment  is below average.  Inflation expectations would be more firmly anchored under an appropriate monetary policy, and uncertainty would therefore be lower than the trailing 20-year average.

Respondent  16:

Uncertainty was unusually low in the past  20 years.

I  view  the  risks  to  growth  and  inflation  as  weighted to the  upside. Historical  patterns  in the  data suggest the rebound might be stronger than my baseline forecast.  Over the longer term, inflation risk is tilted to the upside reflecting uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Fed' s withdrawal of accommodation.

Respondent  7:

We  continue  to  view  the  risks  to  the  forecast  as  broadly  balanced. The  incoming  spending  data  suggest weaker  near-term  real  activity. But  business  surveys  and  labor-market  indicators  suggest  more  strength, and  financial  conditions  are  more  supportive  of growth. In  terms  of inflation,  there  could  be  even  more pass-through than we expect from food and energy inflation to underlying inflation; but, if commodity prices stabilize  or  recede,  then  anemic  wage  pressures  could  push  unit  labor  costs  down  further  and  may lead to another round of disinflation.

Appropriate  M onetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of the  appropriate  path  for  m onetary  policy  differ  m aterially from  that  assum ed  by  the  staff in  th e  Tealbook?

Respondent  1: No

N/A

Respondent  2: No

N/A

Respondent  3: No

Although my expected policy path is broadly similar, with a somewhat weaker recovery offsetting somewhat higher  inflation,  the  possibility  remains  that  higher  inflation  and  inflation  expectations  could  require  an earlier exit than suggested by the Tealbook.

Respondent  4: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the appropriate monetary policy as one that begins raising the funds rate sometime in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  5: Yes

We condition our forecast on market expectations for the funds rate and implied expectations for the 10-year treasury  rate. The  former  assumes  a  slightly  earlier  lift-off  for  the  removal  of accommodation;  the  latter have a slightly lower path for the  10-year rate.  The differences,  however,  are small.

Respondent  6: Yes

I  am  more  concerned  than  the  Tealbook  that  recent  and  prospective  headline  inflation  will  have  adverse effects on inflation expectations and impact core inflation.  Much will depend on how firmly we communicate our resolve regarding price stability.  In any case, my long-term inflation objective is lower than the 2-percent Tealbook rate.  Accordingly, I believe it will be necessary to begin removing monetary-policy accommodation earlier than is assumed by Board staff,  and to pursue normalization more vigorously.

Respondent  7: No

N/A

Respondent  8: No

N/A

Respondent  9: Yes

While  the  pattern  of recovery  from  the  recession  is  uncertain,  I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate and allow the SOMA portfolio to run off sooner than assumed in the  Tealbook.  In the interim,  depending on  how  the  economy evolves,  it  may be  appropriate  to  accelerate  or  slow  down  the  growth  of the  SOMA portfolio.

Respondent  10: Yes

In my view, under the appropriate path, policy would immediately begin the normalization process.  I would stop  the  purchases  of longer-term  Treasury  securities  and  remove  the  commitment  to  maintain  the  funds

rate target  at exceptionally low levels  for  an extended period.  I would  allow our balance sheet to shrink as agency securities  are redeemed.

Respondent  11: No

N/A

Respondent  12: Yes

With inflation still well below target in 2012 and a considerable amount of slack, the Federal funds rate's lift off from the zero lower bound occurs somewhat later in the forecast horizon compared to the Tealbook.

Respondent  13: No

N/A

Respondent  14: Yes

My expected date for the first increase of the federal funds rate is one quarter earlier than the Tealbook.

Respondent  15: Yes

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary the  committee  would  adopt  a  numerical  inflation  objective. In  accordance with that  objective,  the  committee  would begin to raise its interest  rate target  considerably sooner than the Tealbook projects.

Respondent  16: Yes

My forecast  is  that  increases  in core  inflation  will  be  sufficiently rapid that  we  will  need  to reduce  accom­ modation more rapidly than the staff anticipates.

Respondent  17: No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  econom ic  outlook and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent  1:

Economic  indicators  continue  to  suggest  a  reasonably  well-grounded  recovery,  but  one  that  continues  to have difficulty picking up sustainable momentum.  Commercial and residential real estate market  problems continue to prevent  realization  of the  kind  of growth  rate  that  might  be  expected  on the  other  side  of the sharp downturn that followed the financial crisis.  Job creation prospects  are looking more favorable than  a few months ago but,  again,  there is  as yet  no indication of the kind of rapid growth that  would be  needed to return the economy to full employment in the next  few years.

Major  downside  risks  continue  to  be  largely  external  -   eg,  additional  oil  shocks,  spillover  from  possible Eurozone stress,  a rapid deceleration of growth in some emerging markets  looking to contain inflation.  To the degree one or more of these risks is realized, negative repercussions for the U.S. economy could obviously ensue.  On the other hand, were each of these risks to recede significantly and not be replaced by others, there could be boost to business and consumer confidence in the U.S.,  with ensuring positive effects on economic performance

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

On the positive side,  labor markets  (and in particular the unemployment rate and the last couple of payroll reports)  improved  somewhat  since  January,  the  resulting income  allowing  moderate  gains  in  consumption, Business optimism remains good, supporting investment in E and S. Notwithstanding the Japanese disaster, global  growth  also  remains  solid;  together  with  the  weaker  dollar,  that  growth  should  spur  US  exports. Profits and equity values have continued strong.  Much of the anticipated slowdown in  11:Q1  appears to be reflecting temporary factors,  including anomalous drops in defense spending and exports,  so that I discount a good bit of that slowing.

On the other hand, importantly, oil prices are up $25 since the last forecast round, and the effect on consumer confidence  and inflation expectations appears to have been fairly significant.  Construction  (res  and nonres) has been disappointing,  and UI claims have been stuck around 400K.  Overall, the forward momentum of the recovery is not  as strong as I had hoped;  because of that,  the higher oil price,  and  an increasing fiscal drag at both the federal and state/local levels I have marked down my growth forecast somewhat.  I take most of the decline in unemployment since November as  'real'  but assume that Okun' s Law will work fairly well in the future;  thus,  the somewhat slower projected pace of recovery leads to correspondingly slower declines in unemployment going forward.

Higher  oil  prices,  and  to  a  lesser  extent  higher  food  prices,  have  caused  a jump  in  headline  inflation. I expect  commodity prices  to stabilize so that  headline  inflation returns  close  to core  next  year.  However,  I project core inflation to be a bit higher also, based on incoming data.  (The small surprise in core also led me to revise  up  my long-run unemployment estimate  a bit.)  Going  forward,  higher  inflation  expectations  will allow a small amount of passthrough of commodity price increases into core inflation.  A similar effect could come from the weaker dollar and import price inflation.  There seems to be little risk of deflation at this point.

Respondent  4:

The  recent  economic  data  has  been  somewhat  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  January  forecast. I

expect  this  recent  weakness  to  be  temporary  and  that  the  economy is  poised  for  moderately  above-trend growth in 2011  and 2012.

As  the  recovery  strengthens,  I  expect  a  modestly  above-trend  pace  of  3.2  percent  growth  in  2011,  down slightly  from  my  January  forecast. Factors  that  contribute  to  my  growth  projection  include  improving financial market conditions,  greater credit  availability to households  and firms,  the  affects of policy accom­ modation,  and normal recovery dynamics.

I  expect  growth  in  2012  to  run  at  about  a  3.4  percent  pace  and  then  fall  to  a  3  percent  pace  in  2013, which  remains  slightly  above  my  long-run  trend. The  labor  market  recovery  is  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment  rate to move  down to  about  6.5  percent  by the  end  of the  forecast  horizon,  at  which  time it  remains  above my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  I  anticipate that inflation will run  at  a strong pace in the first  half of 2011  and then pull back a bit over the forecast horizon as temporary factors wane and in response to tighter monetary policy than that anticipated in the Tealbook.

In  my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk  that inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels  and  that  inflation  expectations  may  become  unan­ chored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  5:

Our  forecast  assumes  that  the  slower  growth  evident  in  the  indicators  for  the  first  quarter  will  prove  to be  transitory. Continued  high  oil  prices,  fragile  consumer  confidence,  and  further  bad  news  from  housing markets  pose  downside  risks  to  this  assessment. However,  improving  labor  market  conditions  are  an  im­ portant offsetting positive  factor for household sector spending.  Replacement  demand should further boost business  investment  in  equipment,  particularly  in  the  manufacturing  sector,  where  all  of our  contact  re­ ports have been quite positive.  And continued easing of credit conditions will continue to support business spending.  A variety of econometric models also support the assessment that the first-quarter slowdown was transitory. Accordingly,  we  see  growth  picking  up  in  the  current  quarter  and  again  in  the  second  half of the year.  We are projecting growth to average a bit over 4 percent from the second half of 2011 through 2013.

Core  inflation  has  risen  from  the  very  low  levels  recorded  in  the  second  half of last  year,  and  food  and energy prices have pushed headline inflation  up  a  good  deal.  We  do not,  however,  see  these  developments as dictating  a major change to the  inflation  forecast  much  beyond the  near term.  Accordingly,  we  still  see both total and core PCE inflation running about  1-1/2 percent in 2013.

A  number  of  factors  underlie  this  judgment. The  recent  increases  in  core  were  largely  expected;  for  ex­ ample,  the  Tealbook  has  discounted  the  signal  in  last  year's  low  readings  for  some  time. We  also  think that the passthrough of higher costs for energy and other commodities will be contained.  One reason is the downward influence on inflation from resource slack, which we think currently is quite large.  Another is that we  are  not  seeing  (or  hearing  of)  a  marked  pickup  in  wage  growth,  which  would  be  evidence  that  higher inflationary expectations are becoming more firmly embedded in the behavior of households and firms.  Our assessment of the inflation outlook is informed by a variety of econometric analyses.  On the structural side, our DSGE model attributes much of the pickup in core inflation in early 2011 to transitory shocks that largely dissipate by 2012.  This interpretation is supported by models that embed inflation forecasts in no arbitrage models of the term structure of interest rates.  And on the statistical  front,  a battery of Stock-Watson style models continue to forecast very low inflation in 2012  and 2013.

Respondent  6:

Familiar  constraints  on  growth  remain  in  place:  an overhang  of homes,  squeezed public  finances,  concerns

about future tax hikes and benefit cuts,  and the leakage of employment and capital investment across inter­ national borders.  With recent and continuing consumer price increases, real household purchasing power has taken a significant new hit.  Business contacts report an acceleration of production and distribution costs for a wide variety of goods.  There is significant and growing risk that the marketplace will misjudge our resolve to maintain price stability.

Respondent  7:

The  economic  recovery  appears  to  have  ongoing  momentum,  and  labor  markets  are  improving  gradually. Monetary stimulus  and  improvements  in  banking  and  financial  market  conditions  provide  key  drivers  for economic expansion over the next few years, even as firms and households adjust to higher food and gasoline prices and fiscal policy at all levels turns increasingly contractionary.  Still, it will take several years of robust growth to return the  economy to  full  employment. In  the  near-term,  rising  energy  and  commodity prices will  boost  headline  inflation. However,  significant  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets  will  keep  underlying inflation  low. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  should  help  avoid  significant  pass-through  of food  and energy inflation to wages and core inflation; conversely, as the impulse from commodity price increases wanes, well-anchored inflation expectations should keep underlying inflation from falling further.

Respondent  8:

I  anticipate  that  real  GDP  will  grow  at  a  slightly  above  trend  pace  in  the  second  half of  this  year  and that output growth will strengthen in 2012  and 2013.  With above trend growth,  I expect unemployment to decline gradually over the forecast horizon.  Household spending is currently expanding at  a moderate rate, but  it  remains  constrained  by slow  growth  in  employment  and  wages,  continuing  declines  in  house  prices, and the negative impact on household purchasing power of the surge in energy and food prices.  Over time, I  anticipate  that  a  strengthening  labor  market,  accommodative  credit  conditions,  progress  by  households in  balance  sheet  deleveraging,  and  the  stabilization  of commodity  prices,  will  boost  consumption  growth over time.  Construction spending,  both residential and nonresidential,  remains moribund but I anticipate a pickup in  spending,  from low  levels  over  time. In  contrast,  spending  on  equipment  and  software  has  been growing at a healthy pace and should provide continued support to the recovery.  With respect to inflation, I  anticipate that recent outsized commodity price increases will raise headline inflation for the next  several months  and I  anticipate  some  pass  through  into  core  inflation. However,  assuming that  commodity prices level  off and inflation  expectations remain contained,  I expect the increase in both headline  and core to be transitory.  Importantly,  I expect that,  owing to considerable slack in the labor market,  wages will continue to increase at  a modest pace and,  when coupled with solid productivity gains, unit labor costs will rise only gradually, holding down cost pressures and core inflation.  I see unusually large risks to my forecasts for both real  activity  and  inflation  at  the  present  time. Commodity prices  are  an important  risk  factor.  Although futures  prices  point  to  a  stabilization  of commodity prices  going  forward,  their  track  record  is  quite  poor and commodity prices could either increase or decline substantially relative to present levels.  An increase in commodity prices would harm the prospects for output  growth  and raise,  at  least  temporarily my forecast of inflation.  Large further increases also have the potential to raise inflation expectations,  thereby touching off  a  wage  price  spiral  to  which  monetary  policy  would  have  to  respond. Fiscal  policy  both  here  in  the United States  and,  to  a lesser extent,  in other advanced economies,  also poses notable risks to growth.  An agreement by Congress and the President to a significant fiscal consolidation package could diminish growth over the next few years even though such cuts are essential to longer-run growth and financial stability.  The prospect of further house price declines also pose risks to consumer spending and the health of the financial sector.

Respondent  9:

In  2011  through  2013  I  anticipate  that  real  growth will  occur  at  greater  than steady-state  rates,  reflecting normal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by the  substantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been  in  train  since  late 2008.  I expect that beginning in 2013 real growth will slow and subsequently approach steady-state rates.  I expect  that  core  PCE inflation over  all  of 2011  to be higher  that  of 2010  and increases in  food  and energy prices  to  drive  headline  inflation  above  the  core  rate  for  2011. Subsequently,  under  appropriate  monetary

policy,  inflation should approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent,  though I believe that it will rise above that  rate in an interim period.  I do not  believe that  future energy shocks can be  forecasted,  so with available information I expect  that the core  and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  10:

I  believe  the  transition  from  a  stimulus-supported  recovery  to  a  self-sustaining  one  is  proceeding. While economic  activity in  the  first  quarter  was  weaker  than  I  expected,  I  believe  it  is  temporary  and  partly re­ flects  the  restraining  effects  of higher  energy and commodity prices.  The  continued gains  in labor markets should support growth going forward.  As a result,  the general contour of my outlook for growth  (increasing in coming quarters) remains unchanged.  However, growth has been marked down marginally for the rest of 2011  and 2012 due to the lingering effects of higher energy and commodity prices.

High  energy  and  commodity  prices,  along  with  a  greater  pass  through  of  costs,  are  expected  to  boost headline  and core inflation  in  the near-term.  If energy prices  stabilize,  then  headline  inflation should drop back to below  2  percent  in  2012  and  2013. As the economy rebounds,  a depreciating dollar  and long-run inflation expectations that  are  anchored  at  more than  2 percent should move core inflation higher over the forecast horizon.

The  risks  to  the  economic  outlook  remain  considerable. In  the  near-term,  fiscal  policy,  problems  in  the real estate sector,  and high energy and commodity prices-along with the prospect of even higher prices-pose downside risk to the economic outlook.

As  for  inflation,  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices,  along  with  a  greater  pass  through  of  costs,  pose upside risk to  near-term  and  medium-term headline  and core inflation.  Longer term,  the  expansion of our balance sheet  and  federal borrowing needs create a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations, and,  in turn,  inflation.  In  addition,  there is  a risk that  monetary policy will remain too accommodative  for too long,  creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  11:

The recovery is expected to proceed at  a moderate pace.

High rates of personal saving and slow jobs growth are expected to restrain the pace of consumer spending relative  to  a more  typical recovery. New business startups are likely to be constrained by lack of access to credit.  Uncertainties about  the economic environment  are expected to restrain business expansion plans in favor of liquidity.  Commodity prices are expected to stabilize and firms will likely absorb much of these cost pressures by way of reduced margins and productivity growth.

My  growth  projection  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  oil  prices  have  leveled  off. The  possibility  that oil  prices  will continue to climb higher represents a significant downward risk to my outlook.

My  assessment  of the  inflation  risks  are  clearly  weighted  to  the  upside. In  my  projection,  inflation  ex­ pectations are acting as  a restraining influence on underlying inflation.  The risk that inflation expectations could rise is significant.

Respondent  12:

Information received since the time of the January economic projections indicates that the economic recovery is proceeding at a slower pace than previously anticipated.  The average rate of growth in GDP over the first half of this year is unlikely to be faster than potential.  This setback in the progress towards reducing the ac­ tivity gap is likely to prove temporary, but the slower underlying pace of growth also affects the medium term outlook,  which has  been  revised down somewhat.  Real  interest  rates  continue  to be  supportive  of growth, but other factors are providing a noticeable offset.  In particular,  high energy prices are reducing consumers'

purchasing  power  and  have  the  potential  to  increase  uncertainty  and  delay  some  spending. Fiscal  policy is  turning contractionary over  the  course  of the  forecast  horizon,  thus  limiting gains  in disposable  income. The evolution of households'  net worth is constrained by continued weakness in the housing market.  So far, there is little suggesting a rapid turnaround in residential investment,  and gains in nonresidential structures are  likely to  be  held down  by high  office  and commercial  vacancy rates.  In  addition,  the  outlook  for state and local spending remains grim,  and the  potential  for more  aggressive  budget  cuts  over the  course  of the forecast horizon cannot be ruled out.

Overall, the ongoing recovery is undesirably slow relative to the depth of the recession.  Growth in GDP this year should be modestly above potential,  with a more vigorous pace of growth expected in 2012  and 2013. The potential downside risks to the real outlook remain costlier than the potential upside risks.

The projected pace of growth leaves a considerable amount of slack in the economy.  The unemployment rate is still  at  7 percent  by the end of 2013.  Recent revisions to JOLTS  data on vacancy rates have reduced the outward shift in the Beveridge curve noticeably,  and do not suggest a significant increase in the equilibrium unemployment rate.  In this context, slack in the labor market is projected to remain significant even if hiring steps up not just to meet increasing demand, but also to catch up with the hiring that was postponed in the early stages of the recovery.

Given  the  amount  of labor  market  slack,  the  rate  of core  inflation  is  expected  to  remain  well  below  tar­ get.  Recent  increases in core inflation likely reflect  some pass-through from higher commodity prices.  This effect  should  prove  transitory. One  reason  is  that  the  current  stance  of monetary  policy,  because  of the zero-lower  bound  on nominal  rates,  is  tighter  than what  an  optimal  reaction  function  would  suggest,  thus implying that policy remains more tilted toward inflation-fighting than on average over the past 20 years.

Respondent  13:

The economy is moving to a self-sustaining expansion.  Moderating the pace of this expansion are the head­ winds of higher  gasoline  prices,  reduced  government  spending  at  both the  state  and  national  levels,  and  a housing market characterized by low equity values, poor servicing, supply overhang and deteriorating quality.

These factors weigh on consumer confidence, Consumer sentiment tumbled in early March, primarily driven by  higher  prices  at  the  pump  as  well  as  higher  food  prices. The  sharp  reversal  of what  had  been  an  up­ ward trajectory in consumer sentiment between October and February does not bode well for growth.  The rising  cost  of food  and  fuel,  especially if they continue  to  rise,  together  with  the  effect  of stagnant  wages, sub-optimal job creation and reduced home equity values, could hinder growth in consumer demand.

I  am  uncertain  as  to  the  extent  that  upward  pressure  on  underlying  higher  commodity  prices  will  be  re­ lieved  if  global  demand  continues  to  grow  unabated  without  an  accompanying  steady  increase  in  supply sources. Accordingly,  despite  what  appears  to  be  weaker  consumer  demand  in  the  U.S.,  my estimates  for inflation are weighted to the upside.  Although I do not believe that wage pressures will play a role in creating an price inflation/wage inflation spiral, I am uncertain as to whether sustained increases in commodity prices could themselves contribute to higher levels of inflation.

Labor markets appear far from recovery.  While the unemployment rate may be trending downward,  down­ ward pressure on wages remains significant.  All  bargaining  agreements  are  concessionary,  meaning that  at least  for  the  small  portion  of the  market  that  is  unionized,  the  net  value  of compensation  packages  is  de­ creasing.  Federal workers, who comprise the largest employee group, have had wages frozen this year.  Labor force participation is at historic lows.  Discouraged workers are not re-entering the labor force.  Accordingly, the pace of economic growth is not robust enough to absorb all those who want to be working.

Respondent  14:

The  recent  rise  in  energy  and  other  industrial  material  input  prices  places  downward  pressure  on  output growth and upward pressure on consumer price inflation.  Although I  expect  the  rise  in  input  prices  to  be temporary,  considerable uncertainty surrounds that  assumption.  The key questions to be  answered are the following:  How long will political unrest in the Middle East  and North Africa keep oil prices elevated?  How much pressure will  global  demand  from the  emerging markets  exert  on energy and non-energy commodity prices?  Working in the other direction,  recent  improvements in employment and industrial output indicate the potential  for stronger growth going forward.

Respondent  15:

I  believe  that  the  recovery is  firmly  in  place,  and  will  be  led  by  consumer  spending,  business  investment, and exports.  GDP growth is likely to be above trend.  Residential investment is likely to contribute little to growth in overall  activity.  The stock of federal debt  will grow much more rapidly than GDP under current legislation,  leading to uncertainty on the nature and timing of policy actions that will put the stock of debt on  a  more  sustainable  path. That  uncertainty  could  make  households  and  firms  more  cautious  in  their spending plans.

Respondent  16:

My outlook  for  inflation  is  shaped  by the  assumption  that  the  recovery will  continue  on  track. A  slowing the pace of economic recovery might lead to disinflationary pressures.

Respondent  17:

The  expenditure  data  for  2011Q1  generally have  been  weaker  than  we  had  anticipated  at  the  time  of the January SEP,  with notable downgrades in real PCE,  residential  investment,  nonresidential  structures,  and government expenditures.  Adding up these data, the rate of growth of real GDP in 2011Q1 appears to have been below our projection in the January SEP. In contrast, business survey and production indicators have been  relatively robust,  and  payroll  growth  and  other  labor  market  indicators  strengthened  in  the  quarter. Taking some solace from these data, we expect that the 2011Q1 weakness in expenditures will be temporary and thus the broad contours of the  forecast over the  remainder of the projection period  are essentially un­ changed.

As  has  been  the  case  for  several  FOMC  cycles,  we  believe  that  fiscal  and  monetary  stimulus  in  combi­ nation  with  the  economy's  natural  healing  process  have  created  conditions  favorable  for  growth  above  its potential  rate. Consistent  with  this  position,  financial  conditions  have  improved  over  the  last  six  months, including a substantial increase in equity values and a narrowing of credit spreads.  While still tight,  lending conditions have begun to ease,  as indicated in the latest SLOOS, and there have been increases in nonmort­ gage consumer debt as well as C&amp;I loans.  Based on historical relationships, the personal saving rate appears to be consistent with the current level of household net worth.  Moreover, the household financial obligations ratio has declined to levels that prevailed in the mid-1990s.

Beyond financial conditions,  continued favorable growth prospects among our major trading partners and a lower  exchange  value of the  dollar  are expected  to produce sustained strong growth of exports.  Improving foreign  and  domestic  demand  is  likely  to  induce  stronger  growth  of business  investment. While  still  low, housing market  activity may begin  to  improve  as  the  labor  market  improves  and  housing  affordability re­ mains  high. Indeed,  over  the  past  several  weeks  there  has  been  a  notable  increase  in  purchase  mortgage applications,  albeit  from  a  very  depressed  level. Inventory-sales  ratios  throughout  the  manufacturing  and trade sectors are low by standards of recent history.  With incomes and spending rising,  the 2010Q4 level of state  and local government  tax receipts was roughly equal to the previous peak level in 2008Q2,  indicating that  the fiscal  position of those  governments has begun to heal.  Lastly,  the passage of the fiscal  agreement in late 2010  added additional fiscal stimulus for 2011.

Nevertheless,  the  economy faces  some  new  headwinds  that  were  not  present  at  the  beginning  of the  year,

in  particular  a  considerably  higher  level  of energy  prices. Our  assumed  level  of oil  prices  for  2011Q4  in this forecast is over $15 per barrel  above that in the  January SEP.  We have shaved another tenth from our projected growth of real GDP in 2011, bringing it to 3.7%  (Q4/Q4), with the total downward adjustment in the wake of the run-up of energy prices since December to 0.3 percentage points.  With the national average retail  gasoline  price  now just  shy of $4 per gallon,  up  $1  from early December,  the energy price increase is one factor behind the risks to the growth outlook being skewed to the downside.

In  contrast  to  the  expenditure  data,  data  on  inflation  for  2011Q1  have  tended  to  come  in  higher  than expected. The increase  in  energy prices,  combined  with  the  fact  that  the  rise  in  the  energy component  of the CPI  over  2011Q1  was  larger  than expected,  has led  to boosting the  expected  change  of the  total  PCE deflator to over 3%  (Q4/Q4)  for 2011.  The  12-month changes of the total PCE deflator are likely to top out in the 3% to 3  ¼   %   range  during 2011Q3.

The  projected  path  of  core  inflation  is  also  higher  in  this  forecast,  with  both  core  goods  and  core  ser­ vice prices moving up more than expected in 2011Q1.  Within the core goods category, price of new vehicles rose  at  a  2  ½   %   annual  rate  in  2011Q1  after  falling  at  a  0.5%  rate  in  2010Q4. Within  the  core  services category, transportation services prices rose 22%  (annual rate) in 2011Q1, likely reflecting an effect of higher energy prices.  The  core  PCE  deflator  is  likely to  increase  at  a  1   ½ %   annual  rate  in  2011Q1,  and rise  at  a similar  rate  in  2011Q2  even  if monthly changes  begin to  slow  as  we  expect.  For  2011  as  a whole,  the  core PCE deflator is expected to increase  1.4%  (Q4/Q4),  up from around  1% in the January SEP.

The path of the unemployment rate for 2011 has been lowered, with it falling to a little above 8% by 2011Q4 compared to about  8  ½  %  expected in  January.  The projected growth of employment is little  changed,  but the path of the labor force participation rate is somewhat lower due to its decline to an average of 64.2% in 2011Q1  from 64.4%  in  2010Q4.  We  continue to believe  that  the  decline  of the  participation rate has  been greater than what would have been the case if the trends of the past decade had continued over the past few years.  Therefore, we still anticipate some upward movement of the participation rate as the economy recovers.

The  underlying  fundamentals  of the  economy  are  expected  to  continue  to  improve  in  2012,  with  stronger employment  growth,  a  sustained  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate,  a  better  established  recovery  of the housing sector,  and  a  modest  recovery of business  investment  of nonresidential  structures.  In  addition,  oil prices are expected to be somewhat lower than in 2011, which provides a modest boost to growth and pushes down the rate of increase of the PCE deflator.  However, the federal fiscal impulse will turn negative with the return of the payroll tax rate and depreciation schedules to their previous levels and the start of a reduction of outlays  from already enacted reductions of budget  authority.  Overall,  we  expect  growth of real  GDP  in 2012  of around  4%,  with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  to slightly  above  7%  by the  end  of that  year  and core inflation returning to the mandate-consistent range of 1   ½   %  to 2%.

Forecast  N arratives  (continued)

4(c).  Please  describe  any  im portant  differences  betw een  your  current  econom ic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent  1:

I  am not quite as optimistic about equity prices over the next couple of years.  I continue to be less confident that oil prices will flatten out  and remain there over the forecast period.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

Was slightly more  pessimistic  than  the  Tealbook  in  the  last  round. Have  marked down growth  prospects somewhat  more  than  in  the  Tealbook this  time  because  of greater  concerns  about  the  direct  and  indirect effects of commodity inflation  and fiscal drag and because we  are not yet seeing growing momentum of the recovery, at least  not  to the extent  as in the  Tealbook scenario.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

Our  forecast  for  2011  is  somewhat  above  the  Tealbook  because  we  are  assuming  a  bit  stronger  pickup  in growth from the first-quarter soft patch.

Respondent  6:

I am considerably more concerned about the inflation outlook than is the Tealbook, and less optimistic about real  GDP growth.  I  believe  that  the  Tealbook  mistakes  the  pace  at  which  policy stimulus  will  need  to  be withdrawn in order to keep inflation under control, and I have  a more stringent definition of price stability.

Respondent  7:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent  8:

My views on growth are in line with Tealbook.  My forecast for both wage and price inflation is below that of Tealbook

Respondent  9:

Compared to the 70% confidence intervals  for the Tealbook forecasts,  the differences between the point es­ timates in the  Tealbook baseline forecast  and my projections are not different in any meaningful statistical sense.  However I see higher inflation in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent  with  appropriate  monetary policy.  In  contrast  the  Tealbook  forecast  sees  an  'extended  period' of low inflation.

Respondent  10:

The key difference is  the  monetary policy path.  In  my view,  appropriate  monetary policy should  follow  a path considerably different than in Tealbook,  to foster the longer-run stability of the economy.  As a result, I  expect  slower  growth  in  2012  and  2013. In  addition,  I  expect  inflation  to  be  higher. The  difference  in inflation forecasts reflects different  views on the relative importance of inflation expectations  and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

Respondent  11:

Growth in 2012 is projected to be lower than the Tealbook forecast,  in part due to an assumed higher rate of personal saving, slower jobs growth, and a slower-than-typical rate of new business formation.  I have also assumed a lower level  of potential  output,  resulting in  an inflation path  that  is more  responsive to  growth over the near-term.

Respondent  12:

The forecast  for real  activity is very similar to the  Tealbook forecast.  Core inflation,  however,  is  projected to stay lower than in the Tealbook.

Respondent  13:

My forecast is similar to the weaker recovery scenario described in the Tealbook.  I continue to believe that the current predominant mortgage servicing model is contributing to the uncertain pace of foreclosures; until the  significant  inventory of housing  is  cleared  efficiently  and  fairly  housing  markets  will  continue  to  exert downward pressure on growth.  In addition,  I continue to believe that incoming data signal a more sluggish recovery in  which  anticipated improvements in credit  availability,  consumer confidence  and the  willingness of firms to hire are slower to materialize than in the baseline forecast.

Respondent  14:

My forecast calls for less growth in 2012 and 2013 than in the Tealbook.  Beyond the one-year-ahead forecast horizon, my outlook does not build in a period of accelerated growth in order to close a notional output gap. Instead,  these  years  are  characterized  by comparatively moderate  above-trend real  GDP growth. My core inflation profile remains similar to the Tealbook in the near-term, but my forecast path returns more quickly to  the  'mandate  consistent'  range  of  1.7-2.0%  which  is  reach  by  2013,  in  line  with  current  market-based measures of inflation expectations.

Respondent  15:

I  believe that there will be a greater pass-through of energy prices into core inflation this year.

Respondent  16:

I  see core  inflation picking up faster than the Tealbook

Respondent  17:

We  assume  lower  inflation  persistence  than  does  the  Tealbook. Therefore,  under  the  assumption  of well anchored inflation  expectations,  we  project  that  core  inflation  returns  to  within  the  'mandate  consistent' range more quickly than it does in the Tealbook forecast; however, the latest increase in the Tealbook fore­ cast  has narrowed these differences.

We project  somewhat more pass-through of oil and commodity price increases into overall consumer prices over  the  near  term,  with  the  result  that  our  overall  PCE  inflation  forecast  in  2011  is  above  that  in  the Tealbook.

With the labor  force  participation rate  expected to remain flat  through the  year,  we  expect  real  economic growth over the rest of this year to be sufficient to lead to a greater decline in the unemployment rate than is projected in the Tealbook.

Forecast  N arratives  (continued)

4(d).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since  the previous  quarter's  projections.

Respondent  1:

Significant  downward revision of first  quarter  growth  estimates  and  increased  chance  of somewhat  greater fiscal contraction during the forecast period.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

Gains seen in January projections  are  partly reversed.  Main negatives  are commodity prices, especially oil prices,  and  construction. Fiscal  drag  may be  larger  than  was  anticipated. Somewhat less  confidence  that momentum is building for the recovery, although labor market reports were reasonably good and better than in late 2010.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

The incoming data point to less robust GDP growth in the first half of 2011 than we had assumed in January. We have not offset with this with stronger growth later in the year,  and accordingly are projecting a lower level  of output  for  2011:Q4.  In contrast,  the  labor  market  solidified more than we  expected.  In particular, the  unemployment  rate  averaged  a good  deal  lower  than  we  had  anticipated,  and  despite  our  lower  GDP projection,  we  are  forecasting a lower unemployment  rate  for the end of this year.  We have  also reassessed our assumptions concerning the effects of unemployment insurance exhaustions, and concluded that a larger portion  of the  decline  in  the  unemployment  due  to  exhaustions  has  already occurred. Accordingly,  future decreases in unemployment due to such effects are likely to be smaller than we previously thought, reducing our forecast  for the decline in the unemployment rate in 2012  and 2013.

Core and total inflation also have risen  a bit  faster than we projected.  However,  as described above,  we do not think these increases will have much influence on inflation beyond the near term.

Respondent  6:

I  have substantially upwardly revised my inflation forecasts to reflect widespread,  ongoing global cost pres­ sures.  Partially, this reflects my skepticism regarding the Phillips Curve applied solely in a domestic context. These global pressures amount to an adverse supply shock from the perspective of the U.S.,  and I have ac­ cordingly revised downward my estimates of future real output growth.  As a result of the sharp declines we saw in December and January, my path for the unemployment rate starts a bit lower than before.  However, it  has  also flattened-consistent with the downward revisions I've made to my GDP growth forecast.

Respondent  7:

The data since January have been a major factor driving my forecast revisions to real activity and inflation. Indicators  of real  economic  activity  have,  on  balance,  surprised  to  the  downside,  while  core  inflation  has surprised to the upside.  Commodity prices have also generally risen more than I' d expected in January,  and going forward,  my projected path for oil prices this year is significantly higher.  Elevated commodity prices are  a  drag on real  activity over the  forecast horizon  and have led me to raise  the projected contribution of food and energy prices to headline inflation in the first half of 2011.  In addition,  there are stiffer headwinds to real  activity  from fiscal  contraction  at  all  levels  of government,  and  the  recovery in  the  housing market now  appears  further  off. Although recent  economic  activity has  been  weaker than  anticipated  in  January, the unemployment rate is also markedly lower.  The lower starting point  for the unemployment rate implies

that despite slower real  GDP growth in 2011  and 2012 the expected unemployment rate by the end of next year is little changed from my projection in January.

Respondent  8:

I  have  marked down my forecast for real  GDP growth in 2011  due to weak incoming data.  I  marked down my unemployment  forecast  slightly  due  to  a  larger  than  anticipated  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate. I raised my forecast  for headline inflation in  2011  considerably and my forecast  of core inflation slightly due recent increases in food and energy prices.

Respondent  9:

My forecasts for near-term real growth have been revised downward reflecting slower growth in the first quar­ ter than I had previously expected.  My forecast path for the unemployment rate has been revised downward to reflect the unexpected decline in the unemployment rate over the past several months.  I have revised my near-term projections of inflation upward to reflect the unanticipated rise in oil prices on headline inflation, and higher than expected core PCE inflation since the beginning of 2011.

Respondent  10:

The main change in my forecast  (lower real GDP growth and higher inflation in 2011  and 2012) reflects the effects of higher energy and commodity prices.

Respondent  11:

My projection for real GDP growth in 2011  has been  revised downward marginally in response to weakerthan-expected first quarter numbers.  My projection for overall  PCE inflation in 2011  has been increased to account for higher gasoline and food prices.

Respondent  12:

The most  important  factors  contributing to the  real  outlook's  downward revision  are higher  energy prices, continued setbacks in construction, and a tighter stance of fiscal policy.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

Weaker-than-expected  first  quarter  indicators  on  output  led  me  to  mark down  my projection  for  first-half 2011  real  GDP  growth.  Since the  January meeting,  the economy has been hit by a number of large shocks which have also lowered my near-term growth projection.

Severe winter  weather,  with effects confined mainly to the first  quarter,  disrupted supply chains  and likely held back construction spending and retail sales.  Supply bottlenecks due to the March 11  Japanese disaster continue  to  weigh  on  industries  reliant  on  components  imported  from  Japan  (e.g. automotive  parts  and semiconductors). But  these  effects  are  likely  to  be  relatively  minor  in  comparison  to  the  drag  on  output created by the rise in oil prices associated with the continuing political unrest in the Middle East and North African countries.  In sum, these shocks pushed industrial materials prices much higher than I had previously anticipated, leading to my weaker first-half 2011 growth outlook.  My forecast beyond 2011, however, is little altered by these events.

Despite  weaker  near-term  growth,  my  unemployment  outlook  has  improved  since  the  January  meeting, as I  have taken onboard much of the recent declines in the unemployment rate.

Higher-than-anticipated  underlying  and  overall  consumer  price  inflation  so  far  this  year  has  raised  both my core  and  headline  PCE  inflation  forecasts  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  with  most  of the  upward adjustment occurring this year.  The sharp rise in input  prices also contributes to the rise through the pro­ ductivity  channel. As  firms  substitute  toward  more  economical  but  technically  less  efficient  input  mixes,

each labor hour becomes less productive,  driving unit labor costs higher.

Respondent  15:

The  real  data  flow  has  softened,  on  balance,  since  the  last  projection. Consumer  spending decelerated  in the  first  quarter,  and  auto  sales  declined  in  March. New orders  for  capital  goods  have  been  weaker  than expected. On  the  other  hand,  employment  growth  has  gained  momentum. Energy and  other  commodity prices have moved sharply higher, boosting inflation in the last  few months.

Respondent  16:

There has been a pick-up in commodity prices and that has led me to revise upward my forecast for headline inflation.  2011:Q1  growth has been slow -  and so I've revised downward my forecast for 2011  GDP growth.

Respondent  17:

The weaker expenditure data for 2011Q1  have led us to lower our  central  forecast  for real  GDP  growth  in that quarter.  Beyond that quarter, our higher assumed path for oil prices has led to some modest reductions in  real  GDP  growth  in  the  rest  of 2011  and  in  2012. With  oil  prices  at  current  levels,  the  possibility  of further  increases  that  are  not  incorporated  in  futures  prices  is  a  downside  risk  for  real  activity. Although the  recently enacted budget  agreement  did  not  affect  our  central  forecast  much,  the  possibility of greaterthan-expected fiscal consolidation is another downside risk to our real GDP growth forecast.  Consequently, we have maintained a downside balance of risks for real GDP growth.

The  unemployment  rate  for  2011Q1  was  lower  than  we  expected  in  January,  prompting  a  lower  projected path  for  the  rest  of  2011  and  2012. The  lower  path  also  reflects  a  lower  assumption  for  the  labor  force participation rate,  as its level in 2011Q1  was below our assumption in January.

The  inflation  data  so  far  in  2011Q1  have  been  higher  than  we  expected  in  January,  and  we  have  raised our near-term projection for core inflation.  In part,  the increase reflects an initial response to the increases in oil,  commodity,  and import prices that  we do not  expect  to persist;  thus,  medium-term inflation projec­ tions  are  little  changed. The  oil  price  increase  also  appears  to  be  passing  through  into  consumer  energy prices to a greater extent than previous historical patterns suggest,  leading us to raise our near-term overall PCE inflation projection substantially.

Besides  the  higher  US  inflation  data,  inflation  in  many  foreign  economies  has  been  higher  than  expected, and growth in emerging market economies has been maintained, suggesting that there has been some reduc­ tion in global deflationary pressures.  The relatively high levels of TIPS-implied inflation compensation  and household survey inflation expectations indicate  an increased risk that  inflation expectations could become unmoored.  We thus have shifted our risk assessment for inflation from a downward skew to broadly balanced.
