Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds rate at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  September  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee on September  19-20,  2017. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with the  September  19-20,  2017,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  December  12-13,  2017,  meeting.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years.

Respondent 3: Reflecting  recent  data,  we  project  a  temporary  undershooting  of  inflation  for  2017. GDP growthandunemploymentarealsoexpectedtodeviatetemporarilyfromaregimecharacterizedbylowproductivity growthandalowrealinterestrateonshort-termgovernmentdebt.  ThisregimefeaturesGDPgrowthof2.0percent, an  unemployment  rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0  percent.  We  project  that  the  undershooting  of  inflation will  end  in  2018,  the  overshooting  of  GDP  growth  will  end  in  2019,  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment  will  end in  2020.  Because  there  are  multiple  potential  medium-term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  projections for GDP  growth  and  unemployment. Calculating  an  average  of  these  variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  is potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run  inflation  projection  that  is  independent  of  the regime.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  by  2019. However,  it  will  take  a  couple  more  years  to achieve  complete  convergence  to  longer-run  levels. The  effects  from  sustained  accommodative  monetary  policy will  generate  a  modest  degree  of  overshooting  of  inflation  and  an  unemployment  rate  that  remains  well  below  the natural  rate  for  a  number  of  years,  before  returning  back  to  longer-run  levels.

Respondent 9: We  are  already  below  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate.  I  expect that  we  will  be  close  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  by  the  end  of  next  year,  although  the  exact  timing  is uncertain. I expect  unemployment  to  remain  low  during  2019  and  2020,  and  inflation  to  move  above  2  percent. Underappropriatepolicy, itmighteasilytakeanadditional3-to-5yearsforunemploymentandinflationtoconverge to  their  respective  longer-run  rates.

Respondent 10: Having  essentially  achieved  our  objectives  for  inflation  and  unemployment,  the  current stance  of  monetary  policy  will  likely  cause  tightening  of  the  unemployment  rate  beyond  its  longer-run  level.  Policy rates  will  need  to  adjust  gradually  over  several  years  to  bring  unemployment  back  in  line  with  the  longer-run objective,  ensuring  sustainable  economic  growth  with  price  stability.

Respondent 11: Given  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate,  the  economy  is  now  operating above  potential  and  the  underlying  pace  of  activity  suggests  a  significant  risk  of  further  undesirable  overshooting of  full  employment  in  the  near  term. In  order  to  converge  back  to  full  employment,  a  prolonged  period  of  growth below  potential  will  be  needed. The  historical  record, however,  places  a  significant  probability  on  a  'growth recession'  eventually  morphing  into  a  full-blown  recession. In  sum,  while  a  purely  model-driven  forecast  would suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below  around  2023,  there  is  a  nontrivial  risk  that the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice.

Respondent 12: We  still  assume  the  potential  GDP  growth  rate  is  1.8  percent.  We  continue  to  judge  that  the longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  is  between  4  and  6  percent,  with  the  mode  of  that  distribution  between  4.5 and  5  percent;  for  now,  we  have  maintained  our  point  estimate  at  4.6  percent.  However,  the  recent  developments in  the  labor  market  and  inflation  suggest  there  is  a  higher  probability  that  u*  could  be  below  4.5  percent.

Atthistime, wetentativelyjudgethatthesupply-sideimpactofanylikelytaxlegislationwillbefairlysmall, and thus  it  has  little  effect  on  our  estimates  of  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment. Assuming  that  the  legislation  is  finalized  and  enacted  into  law,  we  will  undertake  over  the  coming  FOMC  cycles  a further  assessment  of  its  impact  on  potential  growth  and  u*.

We  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  through  2020,  and  probably not  return  to  that  level  until  at  least  a  couple  of  years  into  that  decade. Our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate  that  there  is  a  significant  probability that  the  unemployment  rate  could  fall  even  further  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  than  occurs  in  our  central forecast.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-runobjective.

Respondent 13: Full  convergence  will  likely  take  six  years  or  so,  for  two  reasons.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  the  heightened  uncertainty  about  the  course  of  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  trade  policy. The  impact  on  inflation uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: The  impending  changes  to  the  federal  tax  code  certainly  add  uncertainty  to  the  outlook.  Tax cuts  will  boost  consumption  and  investment  and  will  increase  the  level  of  potential  output  over  time. However the  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  effects  are  inherently  difficult  and  complicated  to  assess. The  wide  range  of possible  aggregate  demand  and  supply  effects  also  implies  substantial  uncertainty  over  resource  utilization.  These considerations  add  to  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our  projections  for  both  inflation  and  real  activity,  but  not  by enough  to  move  us  out  of  the'broadly  similar'uncertainty  box.

Respondent 5: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during  the Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 9: Uncertainty  about  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years  is high,  with  little  room  for  error  on  either  side. The  adverse  economic  consequences  of  any  policy  errors  will  be  felt in  late  2019  and,  especially,  2020. At  those  horizons,  uncertainty  about  the  paths  of  real  activity  and  inflation  is elevated.  Over  2018  and  early  2019,  however,  economic  uncertainty  is  about  average.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Our  baseline  forecast  delivers  a  soft  landing  from  a  low  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  a higher  level  consistent  with  full  employment.  As  already  mentioned,  these  smooth  transitions  are  rare  in  practice, even  when  considering  the  international  evidence.  For  this  reason,  we  view  the  uncertainty  around  our  projection of  real  activity  as  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 12: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  widths  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distributions  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation.  The  widths  of  these  intervals  are  not substantially  different  from  those  in  our  September  SEP  submission. Even  though  the  economic  data  have  been solid,  financial  market  volatility  generally  has  been  subdued,  and  the  probability  of  a  tax  package  has  increased markedly  (all  of  which  should  reduce  uncertainty);  however,  the  macroeconomic  impact  of  the  likely  tax  legislation remains  quite  uncertain  and  significant  geopolitical  uncertainties  are  still  apparent.  The  probability  intervals  for real  activity  and  core  PCE  inflation  forecasts  thus  are  broadly  in  line  with  the  SEP  standard-for  inflation,  this assessment  takes  into  account  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE inflation.

Respondent 13: While  I  think  the  uncertainty  attached  to  my  projection  remains  broadly  similar  that  experienced  over  the  past  20  years,  it  is  worth  noting  that  it  is  probably  a  bit  greater  than  it  was  at  the  time  of the  September  projection  because  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  tax  package  now  under  consideration  are complicated  and  difficult  to  judge.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: With  GDP  growth  above  trend,  the  unemployment  rate  below  4  percent,  and  fiscal  stimulus kicking  in,  the  Phillips  Curve  could  awaken  and  rise.

Respondent 2: While  I  anticipate  some  small  stimulus  from  tax  reform  beginning  in  2018  that  will  boost demand,  raise  output  growth,  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further,  my  uncertainty  about  the  magnitude  and timing  of  fiscal  stimulus  and  its  effects  on  the  economy  remains  high.

Respondent 3: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity  growth  regime  is possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time.  Recent  increases  in  productivity  growth still  leave  productivity  in  the  low  productivity  regime. However,  as  changes  in  tax  policy  become  more  likely,  we foresee  the  possibility  of  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  Thus,  we  see  an  upside  risk  for  GDP  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion. If a  recession  were to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially. We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  recession during  the  forecast  horizon.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines  in  the  unemployment rate.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  broadly  balanced.

For  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects. There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It  is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  this  variable  depends  on  the behavior  of  energy  prices  and  an  upward  price  shock  is  a  possibility. Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the upside.

Respondent 4: We see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  as  broadly  balanced.  Our  forecast  assumes  a  modest impetus  to  growth  from  fiscal  policy  in  2018;  we  see  the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  the  policy  process  will  result  in a  bit  more  or  a  bit  less  stimulus.  Similarly,  the  likelihood  of  stronger  world-wide  demand  appears  balanced  against the  potential  for  some  future  weakness,  most  notably  from  a  slowdown  in  China.  With  regard  to  inflation,  we  judge that  the  risks  to  the  forecast  continue  to  be  balanced. Once  again,  this  was  a  close  call. We  could  see  stronger fiscal  effects  on  growth  that  put  more  upward  pressure  on  inflation  than  we  have  assumed. But  persistently  low inflation  readings,  as  well  as  the continued  low  levels  of inflation  compensation  in financial markets  and  some  survey expectations,  remain  disconcerting. Although  these  latter  risks  seem  somewhat  more  important,  we  did  not  feel they  were  enough  to  tip  the  balance  of  risks  to  the  downside.

Respondent 5: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  effective  lower  bound limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks.  For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a  countervailing  risk  that  it  will  fall  more  rapidly  if  the  labor  force  participation  rate  resumes  its  downward  trend.  Therefore I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. We  have  exceeded  our  objective  of maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  wide  array  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  remain  beyond full  employment  for  the  next  few  years.  The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long.

There  remains  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  the  size  and  timing  of  proposed  changes  to  corporate  and personal  taxes  and  their  ultimate  effects  on  the  economic  outlook. This  uncertainty  will  diminish  only  when  the final  legislation  is  formulated  and  fully  implemented.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

Despite  soft  inflation  readings  earlier  this  year  I  continue  to  see  inflation  moving  gradually  to  our  2  percent  goal and  view  the  risks  to  this  forecast  as  balanced. On  the  upside,  there  is  the  risk  that  very  tight  labor  markets  may foster  a  more  rapid  increase  in  inflation  than  I  assume  in  my  forecast. On  the  downside,  there  are  other  factors, such  as  muted  healthcare  services  inflation,  which  if  sustained  could  slow  the  pace  of  inflation  going  forward.

Respondent 9: While  I  see  some  potential  upside  for  regulatory  reform,  broader  prospects  for  thoughtful policy  changes  have  faded. In  particular,  prospective  tax  changes  are  unlikely  to  result  in  meaningful  long-term improvementinGDPgrowth,butwillleaveuswithahigherlevelofdebttoGDPatatimewhentheU.S.government is  already  highly  leveraged.

Respondent 12: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  New  York  Fed  forecast  distribution.  We  see  two-sided  risks  associated  with  any  likely tax  legislation. It  could  have  more  positive  supply-side  and/or  demand-side  effects  than  we  currently  anticipate; however, becausethelegislationalsoappearstohavesignificantregionalandsectoraldistributionaleffects, frictions in  capital  stock  adjustment  and  in  labor  mobility  could  lead  to  adverse  supply-side  and  demand-side  effects. In addition,  the  risks  associated  with  other  changes  in  U.S.  fiscal,  regulatory,  and  trade  policies  as  well  as  notable outstanding  geopolitical  issues  still  seem  two-sided.  Therefore,  as  in  September,  we  judge  the  real  activity  risks  to be  roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  also  remain  roughly  balanced  throughout  the  forecast  horizon.  Longer-term  inflation  compensation,  the  Michigan  survey  long-run  inflation  expectations,  and  our  SCE  3-year  inflation  expectations  remain at  low  levels,  consistent  with  continued  downside  risks. By  contrast,  global  disinflationary  forces  appear  to  have abated  somewhat  and  financial  conditions  have  eased,  indicating  still-significant  upside  risks. Also,  the  October CPI  and  PCE  price  index  were  consistent  with  transitory  factors  beginning  to  fade,  as  is  implied  in  our  central projection.  Measures  of  underlying  inflation  have  provided  varying  signals  since  the  September  FOMC  meeting, with  some  rising  modestly,  some  being  little  changed,  and  a  few  falling  slightly.

Respondent 13: My  assessment  of  the  overall  risks  to  real  activity  continue  to  be  broadly  balanced,  although it  is  worth  noting  that  I  have  modestly  steepened  the  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  in  my  current  projection,  which has  the  effect  of  diminishing  the  asymmetric  risks  associated  with  the  zero  lower  bound.

Because  my  current  outlook  for  real  activity  is  somewhat  stronger  than  in  my  previous  forecast  (thereby implying  somewhat  tighter  labor  market  conditions  over  the  medium  term),  I  no  longer  view  the  risks  to  the inflation  outlook  as  weighted  to  the  downside.

My  baseline  forecast  continues  to  incorporate  a  small  fiscal  stimulus effect  from  the  tax  package,  on  the  order  of  an  addition  of  0.25  to  0.50  percentage  points  to  Q4/Q4  GDP  growth  in 2018-2020.  Even  without  the  tax  cuts,  there  is  momentum  in  the  economy  given  healthy  underlying  fundamentals.

I see  the  risks  due  to  fiscal  policy  as  being  balanced:  there  are  upside  risks  to  growth  in  the  near  term  because  the tax  cuts  could  be  more  stimulative  than  I've  assumed,  but  there  are  downside  risks  in  the  out  years  and  beyond  the forecast  horizon  because  higher  fiscal  deficits  could  necessitate  reduced  fiscal  spending.

The  global  outlook  has  improved  over  the  last  year,  though  there  remain  some  vulnerabilities  in  emerging market  economies,  as  well  as  geopolitical  risks. Even  with  a  gradual  reduction  in  the  level  of  accommodation, monetary  policy  is  expected  to  remain  accommodative  and  supportive  of  growth  in  many  countries.

I continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced. After  softening  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,  the  most recent  inflation  readings  have  shown  some  stability. My  modal  forecast  is  that  inflation  will  gradually  return  to our  goal  of  2  percent  over  time,  with  this  goal  being  achieved  on  a  sustainable  basis  in  the  first  half  of  2019.

If the  dynamics  of  inflation  have  fundamentally  changed,  then  I  may  be  underestimating  the  persistence  of low  inflation  and  this  persistence  might  mean  I  am  overestimating  the  long-run  unemployment  rate. This  would mean  inflation  would  be  weaker  than  in  my  modal  forecast. But  if  the  forces  weighing  on  inflation  are  transitory (as  assumed),  if  labor  markets  tighten  more  than  I  expect,  or  if  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  begin  to  kick in,  inflation  could  move  higher  than  I  expect,  especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  slower than  I've  assumed. Even  absent  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary accommodation  than  I've  assumed  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

After  appreciating  over  most  of  the  last  two  and  a  half  years,  the  dollar  has  depreciated  this  year. I assume that  this  downward  trend  will  reverse  given  the  strength  in  the  U.S.  economy  and  prospects  for  tighter  monetary policy.  However,  a  continuation  of  the  depreciation  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far.  There  does  not  seem  to  be excessive  leverage  and  banks  are  holding  relatively  high  levels  of  capital  and  liquid  assets.  However,  equity  prices appear  to  be  somewhat  high  relative  to  earnings  even  accounting  for  the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  and  commercial real  estate  valuations  continue  to  be  lofty. These  signs,  the  relatively  low  level  of  interest  rates,  and  the  outlook for continued  strength  in  the  economy  suggest  that  financial  stability  risks  could  rise  should  we  fail  to  remove monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an  appropriate  pace. Indeed,  the  low  level  of  market  volatility  coupled  with the  low  equity  premium  suggests  that  these  risks  are  building.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Recent  data  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  toward  2  percent  in  the  near  term. With inflation  expectations  well  anchored,  I  believe  that  gradual  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  will  continue  to  be appropriate.  I  also  believe  that  balance  sheet  normalization  should  continue  to  play  out  in  the  background  or  on 'autopilot'as  has  been  discussed.

Respondent 2: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  is  lower  over  the  next  two  years compared  to  September. While  I  expect  somewhat  stronger  economic  growth  and  lower  unemployment  due  to fiscal  policy,  I  am  concerned  about  the  realization  of  generally  soft  inflation  over  the  course  of  2017.  Looking  ahead, I anticipate  that  a  slightly  more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  be  necessary  to  return  inflation  to its  target  level  over  the  medium  term.

Respondent 3: A  target  of  1.38  percent  for  the  forecast  horizon  is  consistent  with  our  assessment  of  current economic  conditions  and  the  convergence  of  inflation,  GDP  growth,  and  unemployment  to  their  values  in  a  regime characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.  In  the  event of  a  regime  change,  such  as  a  shift  from  low  productivity  growth  to  high  productivity  growth,  our  target  federal funds  rate  will  change.

Respondent 4: We  think  it  is  appropriate  to  leave  the  range  for  the  funds  rate  unchanged  at  this  meeting, followed  by  two  increases  in  2018,  four  in  2019,  and  one  in  2020.  We  assume  balance  sheet  normalization  proceeds according  to  the  announced  plan.

Webelievethispolicypackagerepresentsabalancedapproachtoachievingbothofourdualmandateobjectives. Givenour projection ofcontinuedlow inflation inthenearterm,  aswellasconsiderable uncertainty overits outlook, we  think  it  is  appropriate  to  forego  increasing  the  funds  rate  until  2018. Eschewing  a  rate  change  at  the  current meeting  is  meant  to  send  a  strong  signal  to  markets  that  we  are  concerned  about  inflation  developments.  Even  with this  delay,  we  feel  policy  has  more  work  to  do  in  order  to  solidify  inflationary  expectations  symmetrically  around 2  percent,  which  is  a  pre-requisite  for  achieving  our  inflation  objective.  That  is  why  we  have  only  two  increases  in 2018,  and  why  in  2020  we  have  the  funds  rate  at  3.00  percent,  only  25  basis  points  above  its  longer-run  level,  even though  we  project  inflation  at  2.1  percent  and  the  unemployment  rate  a  full  percentage  point  below  the  natural rate. This  configuration  should  generate  some  further  modest  overshooting  of  2  percent  inflation  beyond  2020, which  would  reinforce  the  symmetry  of  our  inflation  target  and  mitigate  the  risk  that  inflation  expectations  could settle  in  below  2  percent.

Respondent 5: Inflation  continues  to  come  in  below  our  2  percent  target;  in  fact  it  had  been  falling  since February  until  recently. Even  though  the  labor  market  continues  to  strengthen,  it  is  not  clear  that  we  have

reached  maximum  employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime age  persons  remain  well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued.  Given  the  persistent undershooting  of  our  inflation  target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy  implies  a  very  gradual  path  for the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 6:

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: The  labor  market  has  exceeded  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  and  I  expect it to  continue  to  strengthen  over  the  next  year. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  below  4  percent  next  year before  gradually  returning  to  its  natural  rate  of  4.7  percent.  I  expect  the  strong  economy  gradually  to  push  inflation up  over  the  next  few  years,  reaching  our  2  percent  objective  by  2019  and  a  modest  overshooting  in  2020.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest  of 1 / 2 percent.

My  fed  funds  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  reflects  an  inflation  rate  that  has  been rising  only  gradually  toward  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term,  I  envision  a  path  for  the  fed  funds rate  that  modestly  overshoots  its  long-run  level  in  2019  and  2020  as  policy  acts  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in inflation  and  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 9: As  the  economy's  momentum  carries  it  further  past  full  employment  and  eventually  past 2-percent  inflation,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  transition  to  a  mildly  restrictive  policy  stance. A  mildly  restrictive policy  maintained  over  several  years  will  give  us  our  best  chance  of  moving  the  economy  along  a  smooth  glide  path back  to  full  employment  and  price  stability.

Risks  to  my  funds-rate  projections  are  balanced. However,  my  confidence  that  the  funds-rate  path  I  have specified  will  prove  to  be  appropriate  is  lower  than  usual. I am  cognizant  that  the  10-year  Treasury  yield  now stands  at  approximately  2.35  percent.  At  issue  is  whether  we  can  slow  the  economy  to  a  sustainable  rate  of  growth without  inverting  the  yield  curve.  I  think  that  we  can,  but  the  margin  for  error  is  small.

Respondent 10: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. The  economy  has  reached  full  capacity  and  we  have essentially  achieved  price  stability,  yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate of  its  longer-run  level  in  2017  and  2018.  That  the  federal  funds  rate  is  still  low  despite  the  economy's  return  to  full employment  and  price  stability  reflects  the  Committee's  past  decisions,  and  I  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate as  important  to  promote  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 11: Optimal  control  policy  simulations  as  reported,  for  example,  in  the  current  Tealbook  prescribe  a  much  higher  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  than  the  path  penciled  in  here.  While  the  simulations  penalize changes  in  the  federal  funds  rate,  aggressive  policy  tightening  could  increase  the  probability  of  a  recession  in  ways that  our  linear  models  are  unable  to  capture. Our  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  balances  this  concern against  the  concern  that  continuing  to  provide  monetary  policy  accommodation  when  the  economy  has  already surpassed  full  employment  will  create  distortions  that,  too,  increase  the  probability  of  a  future  downturn. Our estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  now  stands  at  2.75  percent. Lower  values  of  the equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  are  becoming  more  difficult  to  reconcile  with  the  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate we  have  seen  so  far  this  year.

Respondent 12: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The steepness  of  the  policy  path  also  depends  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

Even  though  the  real  growth  outlook  has  improved  and  financial  conditions  have  eased,  the  near-term  inflation outlook  remains  subdued  and  the  balance  of  risks  is  little  changed.  Consequently,  our  projection  of  the  appropriate policy  path  is  only  modestly  different  from  that  in  the  September  SEP  submission:  The  target  FFR  ranges  at  the end  of  2017,  2018,  and  2019  are  1 1 / 4 - 1 1 / 2 percent,  2  -  2 1 / 4 percent,  and  2 3 / 4 -  3  percent  respectively.  For  2020,  we anticipate  that  a  small  further  tightening  of  the  policy  stance  will  be  needed  to  ensure  achievement  of  the  FOMC's

ff DSGE  model. objectives  over  the  medium  term  following  the  small  inflation  overshoot  and  the  unemployment  undershoot.  Our policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  is  consistent  with  the  gradual  rising  path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as projected  by  the  New  York  Fed  sta

Our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  remains  in  the  range  of  0  -  2  percent, consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety  of  models.  Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2  percent) gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2  -  4  percent.  Our  modal  projection  is  in  the  lower  half of  this  range  due  to  the  combination  of  continued  fairly  subdued  productivity  growth,  low  longer-term  sovereign yields,  continued  indications  of  a  global  'saving  glut,'  and  demographic  factors. As  reported  in  the  response  to question  3(a)  we  maintained  our  point  estimate  of  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  at  2 3 / 4 percent.  Our  appropriate policy  path  thus  slightly  overshoots  the  longer-run  FFR.

Respondent 13: My  assessment  that  the  federal  funds  rate  will  need  to  rise  gradually  over  the  next  several years  rests  on  three  assumptions. First,  the  real  neutral  rate  is  currently  close  to  zero,  implying  that  one  or  two additional  hikes  will  be  needed  in  the  near  term  in  order  to  stabilize  the  unemployment  rate.  Second,  the  nominal neutral  rate  is  likely  to  rise  modestly  over  the  next  several  years  as  a  result  of  easier  fiscal  policy,  somewhat  faster productivity  growth,  and  a  rise  in  inflation  to  2  percent.  Finally,  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation  will  be  facilitated by  the  maintenance  of  strong  labor  conditions,  which  in  turn  depends  on  not  raising  the  funds  rate  too  quickly.

Respondent 14: As  has  been  the  case  for  some  time,  there  is  a  tension  between  the  data  on  the  real  economy, which  are  quite  strong,  and  the  inflation  data,  which  have  remained  below  our  objective. Tipping  the  balance for  me  at  the  current  meeting  is  the  high  likelihood  of  tax  cut  legislation,  which  is  likely  to  be  quite  stimulative over  the  next  several  years: In the  current  proposals,  tax  cuts  are  strongly  front-loaded,  deficit-financed,  and business-focused.  They  are  also  quite  large  by  historical  standards,  especially  given  how  late  in  the  cycle  they  will arrive.

Over  the  medium  run,  the  funds  rate  in  my  projection  rises  gradually,  balancing  the  increase  in  aggregate demand  -  which  is  in  part  fiscally-related  -  against  inflation  that  is  likely  to  remain  below  our  objective  for  some time. On  balance,  the  path  in  this  projection  is  shallow  enough  to  convince  the  public  that  the  Committee  is committed  to  its  inflation  objective  -  and  should  thus  help  boost  underlying  inflation  over  time  -  while  at  the  same time  curbing  excessive  overshooting  on  the  real  side  of  the  economy.

I have  boosted  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  in  my  projection  by  25  basis  points,  to  2.75  percent,  reflecting the  likely  effect  of  the  higher  level  of  government  debt.

Respondent 15: I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  for  the  funds  rate  as  appropriate;  the  slope  of the  path  will  depend  on  the  evolution  of  the  economy,  medium  run  outlook,  and  the  risks  around  the  outlook,  in particular,  for  inflation  and  labor  markets.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  project  growth  above  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  estimate  of  its longer-run  level.  I  expect  some  firming  in  labor  compensation  measures,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups. However,  if  productivity  growth  remains  low,  wage  gains  will  likely be  slower  than  in  past  expansions.

ff in I continue  to  see  the  softness  in  inflation  this  year  as  largely  reflecting  transitory  factors  rather  than  a  fallo demand  that  would  put  more  persistent  downward  pressure  on  inflation.  The  stability  in  recent  inflation  readings and  in inflation  expectations  lends  some  support  for  this  view. My  modal  projection  has  inflation  gradually increasing  to  our  goal  over  the  forecast  horizon.  However,  if  there  has  been  some  fundamental  change  in  inflation dynamics,  it  could  be  that  low  inflation  will  be  more  persistent,  even  as  labor  markets  remain  tight  and  growth remains  above  trend. In  such  a  scenario,  delaying  further  rate  increases  or  taking  other  actions  (such  as  forward guidance)  to  try  to  raise  inflation  may  be  appropriate,  but  this  would  have  to  be  balanced  against  labor  market developments  and  financial  stability  risks.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should  reflect both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals.  Based  on  the  outlook  and  risks,  I  believe  it  will be  appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  gradually  move  rates  up  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon. This  strategy wouldseemtoprudentlybalancetherisksofstrongerthanexpectedgrowthleadingtooverheatinginlabormarkets, which  would  necessitate  sharper,  and  potentially  destabilizing,  rate  increases  in  the  future  versus  the  possibility that  the  softness  in  inflation  will  persist  and  lead  to  an  unanchoring  of  inflation  expectations  and  possible  loss  of Fed  credibility.  I  assume  that  the  funds  rate  will  end  2019  at  a  level  slightly  higher  than  my  longer-run  estimate  of 3  percent,  and  then  move  down  to  3  percent  in  2020.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Economic  growth  is  likely  to  continue  to  be  slightly  above  trend  in  2018  and  2019. Debtfinanced  tax  cuts  are  likely  to  have  small,  temporary  effects  on  aggregate  demand;  in  my  projection,  they  add  0.1 percent  to  real  GDP  growth  in  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  In  addition,  the  rising  federal  debt-GDP  ratio  is  likely  to  put upward  pressure  on  long-term  interest  rates,  which  will  likely  prove  to  be  an  increasing  drag  on  growth  over  the longer  term.

Respondent 2: My  forecast  calls  for  slightly  above-trend  growth  of  2.4  percent  in  2018,  edging  down  to  2 percent  in  2020,  which  is  about  my  estimate  of  trend  growth.  I  now  expect  some  stimulus  from  fiscal  policy  and  so have  slightly  more  output  growth  and  lower  unemployment  in  my  projection  compared  to  last  time.  However,  my uncertainty  about  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  tax  reform  and  fiscal  stimulus  is  high.  I  expect  the  unemployment rate  to  remain  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  as  output  grows  at  a  healthy  pace and  the  labor  force  participation  rate  declines  further. Headline  inflation  was  soft  in  2017  and  while  it  may  have been  held  down  by  temporary  factors,  my  concern  about  underlying  trend  inflation  is  now  higher.  Consequently, I have  a  more  gradual  pace  of  federal  funds  rate  increases  over  the  next  two  years.  My  forecast  calls  for  inflation  to rise  gradually  to  a  level  that  is  slightly  above  target  2019  -  but  inflation  then  moves  down  to  the  2  percent  target in  2020.

Respondent 3: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy. In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them.  The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. We  are,  of  course,  paying  close  attention  to  many  factors  that  might  precipitate  a  regime  change,  such as  a  change  in  tax  policy  that  might  move  the  economy  to  a  high  productivity  state. Monetary  policy  is  regimedependent  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  the  previously  mentioned  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast  that  the  economy  will  remain  in  the  current regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 4: The  fundamentals  underlying  private  domestic  final  demand  are  solid  and  stronger  than  we were  seeing  in  September. Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  and  improved  household balance  sheets  are  supporting  solid  gains  in  consumer  spending  and  investment. Our  baseline  scenario  envisions such  momentum  carrying  forward  into  next  year.  We  also  assume  growth  in  2018  and  2019  will  be  boosted  a  bit  less than 1 2 / percentagepointperyearduetotaxcuts,withaboutequalpartscomingfrominvestmentandconsumption. We  assume  the  tax  bill  adds  a  tenth  of  a  percentage  point  to  growth  in  2020,  entirely  through  investment. The gradual  removal  of  monetary  accommodation  and  a  smaller  impulse  from  fiscal  policy  are  projected  to  bring  GDP growth  down  in  2019  and  2020.  On  the  supply  side,  we  project  the  tax  bill  to  increase  capital  deepening  and  labor supply,  and  so  we  have  nudged  up  our  potential  growth  rates  for  2018  through  2020.  In  sum,  we  now  expect  growth to  run  nearly  a  full  percentage  point  above  potential  in  2018  before  slowing  gradually  to  potential  in  2020.

We  think  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  currently  is  4.6  percent  and  that  it  will  trend  down  to  4.5  percent by  2020. So,  at  4.1  percent,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  50  basis  points  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural rate.  We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  further,  reaching  3.5  percent  in  2019  and  then  staying  there in  2020,  leaving  a  1.0  percentage  point  gap  from  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

We  have  maintained  our  view  that  the  string  of  disappointing  news  on  inflation  implies  that  the  persistent component  in  underlying  inflation  is  currently  below  2  percent. But  we  are  projecting  factors  that  will  help o ffset  the  downdraft  from  the  persistent  component  and  subsequently  help  boost  this  trend  closer  to  our  inflation target. With  unemployment  projected  to  undershoot  the  natural  rate  substantially,  resource  pressures  should provide  a  more  palpable  lift  to  inflation  going  forward. Furthermore,  our  assumption  of  a  shallow  path  for  policy

normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  play  critical roles  in  solidifying  inflation  expectations  and  helping  to  bring  actual  inflation  toward  target.  While  we  see  inflation reaching  only  1.7  percent  next  year,  but  by  2020  we  see  a  modest  overshooting  of  our  inflation  objective.

Respondent 5: Near-term  core  inflation  has  remained  well  below  target  and  the  economy  continues  to  add jobs  without  increasing  wage  pressures. This  reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  continues  to  be  slack  in  the economy.  At  this  point  I  am  concerned  that  the  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  since  late  2015  may  have  had  an adverse  effect  on  inflation  expectations.

I now  expect  that  a  tax  cut  will  be  enacted  in  the  near  future. I expect  that  it  will  somewhat  increase  both output  and  employment.

Respondent 6: I believe  that  the  enactment  of  significant  tax  cuts  will  provide  a  boost  to  both  the  near-term economic  outlook  as  well  as  to  the  long-term  potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy.  The  boost  to  potential  growth allows  GDP  growth  to  remain  relatively  strong  without  pushing  up  inflation  all  that  much.  I  think  there  is  a  chance that  the  effects  of  the  tax  cut  could  be  even  larger  than  I  have  written  down,  suggesting  that  the  risks  to  my  GDP forecast  are  on  the  upside.

Respondent 7: Data  on  the  labor  market,  nonfarm  productivity  ,  and  inflation  have  all  been  somewhat stronger  than  I  anticipated  in  my  September  projection,  and  in  addition  I  have  incorporated  effects  from  the  tax package  now  that  the  details  are  better  known  and  the  likelihood  of  passage  is  high. As  a  result,  I  now  expect output  to  grow  faster  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  more  over  the  next  several  years,  and  while  I  have  also slightly  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  my  projection  now  incorporates  a  faster  pace  of  tightening  in  2018 in  order  to  respond  to  a  larger  and  more  sustained  reduction  in  economic  slack.

Respondent 8: I have  increased  my  estimate  of  the  economy's  longer  run  growth  rate  by  0.2  percentage point.  This  decision  is  based  on  a  reassessment  of  the  underlying  trend  growth  rate  of  labor  productivity  and  the incorporation  of  supply-side  effects  stemming  from  anticipated  corporate  and  personal  income  tax  cuts.

The  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  trend,  which  has  pushed  the  unemployment  rate lower.  Goingforward,thestrengthinlabormarkethiring,fasterwagegrowth,andgainsinhouseholdwealthshould support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  outlook  for  fixed  business  investment  appears  to  have  improved  given the  recent  tax  proposals  and  the  continued  expectation  of  lighter  regulatory  burdens.  However,  there  is  substantial uncertainty  regarding  the  size  and  timing  of  the  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  above  potential.  Output  and unemployment  gaps  were  closed  in  2016.  With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  place,  I  expect  these  gaps  to overshootforthenextfewyears,leadingtoagradualpickupininflationoverthenextfewyears.  Icontinuetoexpect inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  2019,  and  to  overshoot  slightly  in  2020.  Normalization  of  monetary  policy will  help  bring  inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the  following  year or  two.

Respondent 9: Business  pricing  power  is  being  increasingly  challenged  and  profit  margins  are  under  pressure. Companies are seekingtodefendmargins byinvestingintechnology thatallows themto replace peopleandimprove productivity. They  are  also,  increasingly,  looking  to  merger  activity  as  a  way  to  lower  costs  and  increase  scale. This  aggressive  pursuit  of  lower  costs  continues  to  act  as  an  inflation  headwind.

Nevertheless,  with  the  labor  market  tight  and  still  tightening,  cyclical  inflationary  forces  are  building. We should  see  confirmation  of  those  building  pressures  toward  the  middle  of  2018,  but  I  do  not  expect  to  see  inflation hit  2  percent  with  regularity  until  sometime  in  2019.

The  more  immediate  danger  is  the  economic  excesses  and  imbalances  that  can  develop  when  firms  and households  come  to  believe  that  above-trend  growth  can  be  sustained. Unrealistic  expectations  lead  to  unwise commitments-commitments  that  have  the  potential  to  produce  out-sized  responses  when  growth  slows  and  imbalances  must  be  unwound.  While  real  imbalances  are  not  yet  evident,  they  have  the  potential  to  develop  if  we  do not  continue  to  remove  policy  accommodation.

Financial  imbalances  are  another  threat. By  many  measures,  valuations  are  rich. That  suggests  a  need  for heightened  vigilance  to  monitor  the  build-up  of  leverage  and  other  imbalances  often  associated  with  historically high  levels  of  valuation.  A  correction  could  lead  to  a  sudden  tightening  in  financial-market  conditions.

Our'Statement  on  Longer-Run  Goals  and  Monetary  Policy  Strategy'recognizes  that  realized  inflation  is  not an  adequate  guide  to  policy  by  itself: It calls  for  us  to  look  at  the  size  and  likely  persistence  of  full-employment overshoot  in  addition  to  the  size  and  likely  persistence  of  inflation  undershoot. The  unemployment  rate  cannot stay  below  the  natural  rate  indefinitely,  and  a  large  full-employment  overshoot  necessarily  implies  either  a  very sharp  or  a  very  persistent  slowing  of  output  and  employment  growth  at  some  point  in  the  future-a  slowing  that  will leave  the  economy  vulnerable  to  adverse  shocks  and  policy  mistakes.  Our  best  chance  for  achieving  and  sustaining price  stability  is  to  extend  the  expansion  of  the  US  economy,  and  our  best  chance  for  extending  the  expansion  is  to moderate  it,  sooner  rather  than  later.

Respondent 10: Government  policies: As  the  likelihood  of  an  expansionary  fiscal  package  has  increased significantly  since  September,  I  now  assume  a  tax  reform  will  boost  real  GDP  growth  by  0.2  percentage  point  per year  in  2018,  2019,  and  2020,  and  lead  the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  by  0.1  percentage  point  per  year  in  this period. I see  negligible  effects  on  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation. These  assumptions  include  multiplier  effects and  take  into  account  the  o ffsetting  effects  of  a  higher  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate. Such  a  tax  reform  would reinforce  my  view  that  four  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be  appropriate  in  2018. For  2019  and  in  2020, such  a  tax  reform  would  call  for  one  additional  rate  hike  in  each  year.

Modal  forecast:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  in  the  period  from 2017  to  2020,  which  is  partly  attributable  to  the  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance. Without  the  fiscal  stimulus, and  as  monetary  policy  accommodation  is  gradually  removed,  real  GDP  would  likely  increase  at  its  longer-run rate  from  2019  onward,  based  on  modest  increases  in  the  labor  force  and  moderate  productivity  gains.  Despite  the softness  in  consumer  prices  this  year  I  expect  core  inflation  to  rise  to  near  2  percent  next  year,  consistent  with  real GDP  above  potential  and  tightening  labor  market  conditions.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad. The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly balanced.  On the downside, possible changes in government policies appear to be a source of uncertainty, including the  risk  of a deterioration  in  financial  market  conditions  and  broader  sentiment  if  tax  reform  disappoints  and the  risk  of  more  restrictive  trade  policies. Furthermore,  an  overly  expansionary  monetary  policy  could  lead  the unemployment  rate  to  significantly  undershoot  its  natural  level,  as  periods  of  overheating  have  historically  often ended  with  a  recession. In  addition,  an  overly  expansionary  monetary  policy  would  increase  financial  stability risks.  Upside risks to my forecast stem from greater-than-expected momentum in the economy,the possibility that elevated  business  confidence  translates  into  sustained  increases  in  investment  and  productivity,  and  the  possibility that  tax  reform  may  increase  inflationary  pressures.

Respondent 11: Incoming  data  have  been  roughly  in  line  with  previous  expectations. As  a result, our assessment  of  the  underlying  strength  of  the  economy  in  2017:H2  has  not  changed  since  September. Financial conditions,  however,  remain  more  favorable  than  previously  thought. In  particular,  equity  valuations  are  higher than  expected,  and  the  tightening  of  monetary  policy  so  far  does  not  appear  to  have  translated  into  noticeable upward  pressures  on  long-term  yields.  For  these  reasons,  the  near- and  medium-term  outlook  for  real  activity  has been  revised  up.  With  the  unemployment  rate  already  running  somewhat  below  our  expectations,  we  now  expect the  unemployment  rate  to  drop  below  4  percent  in  2018  and  2019.

ff's  recent  upward  revision  to  their  assessThe  contours  of  the  outlook  have  not  changed. Near-term  growth  is  boosted  not  just  by  the  favorable  conditioning  assumptions  in  terms  of  household  net  worth  and  interest  rates,  but  also  by  the  fiscal  stimulus. While uncertainty  about  the  package  has  not  been  fully  resolved,  the  Board  sta ment  of  the  effect  of  the  stimulus  on  real  activity  highlights  the  risk  that  the  pace  of  growth  might  be  even  stronger than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning.  By  the  end  of  2018,  we  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  at  3.7  percent. The  tightening  of  monetary  policy  brings  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  near  potential  in  2019,  and  below  potential  in 2020. As  a  result,  the  unemployment  rate  is  by  then  projected  to  start  to  increase  modestly. Recent  readings  on prices  are  consistent  with  the  view  that  the  softness  in  inflation  earlier  this  year  was  a  temporary  phenomenon. Nevertheless,  core  inflation  measures  have  yet  to  show  a  noticeable  acceleration  relative  to  the  readings  prevailing in 2015  and  2016. With  the  unemployment  rate  projected  to  stay  below  its  equilibrium  level  over  the  forecast horizon,  we  expect  inflation  to  eventually  increase  above  2  percent.

The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  25  bp  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  current  meeting,  and  on future  rate  increases  that  cumulate  to  275  bp  by  the  end  of  2020.  By  historical  standards,  this  represents  a  cautious pace  of  policy  tightening  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  already  below  its  estimated  equilibrium  level.  Such

an  approach  tries  to  strike  a  balance  between  the  financial  stability  risks  associated  with  an  even  more  gradual increase  in  rates,  and  the  risk  that  faster  policy  tightening  may  increase  the  probability  of  the  economy  falling  into a  recession.  It  is  nevertheless  important  to  recognize  that  the  past  does  not  provide  much  guidance  in  terms  of  how to  conduct  policy  so  as  to  achieve  a  soft  landing  when  the  economy  is  beyond  full  employment.  The  optimal  policy mix  under  current  circumstances  may  well  entail  an  active  use  of  supervisory  tools.

We  view  the  risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. As  already  mentioned,  there  is  the risk  that  the  tax  cuts  will  stimulate  activity  by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  expecting. At  the  same  time, the  historical  evidence  highlights  the  risk  that  a  prolonged  period  of  monetary  policy  tightening  may  weaken  real activity  by  more  than  we  think.  As  concerns  prices,  there  is  the  possibility  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate is  lower  than  what  we  are  currently  estimating.  A  countervailing  risk  is  a  nonlinear  response  of  inflation  associated with  low  levels  of  the  unemployment  rate.  From  a  policy  standpoint,  it  is  worth  mentioning  that  long-term  yields remain  very  low  by  historical  standards,  even  when  taking  into  account  a  reduction  in  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of interest. If this  pattern  persists,  the  federal  funds  rate  may  need  to  increase  by  more  than  what  we  are  currently assuming.

Respondent 12: Our  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017Q4  is  about  2 1 / 2 percent  (annual  rate),  resulting in  a  Q4/Q4  growth  rate  of  2.5  percent  for  2017,  slightly  above  that  in  the  September  SEP  projection.  Moreover,  the U.S.  and  global  economies  appear  to  have  greater  forward  momentum  going  into  2018  than  we  anticipated  earlier this year.  In particular, manufacturing activity has rebounded smartly in the U.S. and the euro area, and to a lesser extent  in  China.  Relatively  low  inventories-sales  ratios  in  the  U.S.  should  support  manufacturing  activity  over  the near  term. In  addition,  there  is  clear  evidence  of  a  sustained  strengthening  in  the  pace  of  business  investment,  a development  we  have  been  expecting  for  some  time. In  response  to  these  signals,  we  have  significantly  upgraded our  real  growth  projection  for  2018  since  the  September  SEP  submission,  even  before  we  had  begun  to  factor  in possible  tax  legislation.

Given  the  high  likelihood  that  a  tax  reform/cut  will  be  enacted  in  the  near  future,  after  deferring  until  this cycle,  we  have  now  incorporated  the  broad  outlines  of  this  legislation  into  our  modal  forecast. The  House  and Senate  versions  are  conceptually  similar,  lowering  marginal  income  tax  rates  for  individuals  and  businesses  while broadening  the  tax  base. Based  on  our  initial  assessment,  we  anticipate  that  the  reduction  of  individual  tax liabilities  will  be  about  0.2  percent  of  GDP  in  2018  and  then  rise  around  0.6  -  0.8  percent  of  GDP  in  2019.  The  bulk of this  reduction  will  accrue  to  upper-income  households  with  relatively  low  marginal  propensities  to  consume. Thus,  while  we  anticipate  some  boost  to  real  consumer  spending,  we  also  expect  the  personal  saving  rate  to  rise  by 1 / 2 -3 / 4 percentage  point,  as  occurred  following  the  tax  cuts  of  the  early  2000s.

The  magnitude  of  the  cuts  in  corporate  taxes  is  less  certain,  as  the  House  version  has  the  20  percent  corporate tax  rate  effective  in  2018  while  the  Senate  version  delays  it  to  2019  (also,  there  has  been  discussion  of  setting  the marginal  rate  at  22  percent  in  the  bill  reconciliation).  More  importantly,  we  are  not  certain  about  the  impact  that a  lower  corporate  tax  rate  and  full  expensing  of  investment  will  have  on  business  capital  spending. At  this  point, we  have  boosted  business  fixed  investment  moderately  in  both  2018  and  2019.

The  combined  impact  of  these  assumed  effects  on  real  PCE  and  real  BFI  raises  projected  growth  of  final  sales to  domestic  purchases  by  roughly 1 / 4 percentage  point  in  both  2018  and  2019. Some  of  this  increase  in  domestic demand  is  satisfied  through  more  imports.  In  addition,  it  is  likely  that  financial  conditions  will  tighten  somewhat more  over  the  forecast  horizon  than  we  previously  thought.  We  thus  anticipate  that  the  tax  bill  boosts  projected growth  rates  for  2018  and  2019  by  about  0.2  percentage  point, to  2.5  percent  (Q4/Q4)  and  2.0  percent,  respectively. For  now,  we  expect  those  effects  to  fade  by  2020,  so  that  real  GDP  growth  in  that  year  is  projected  to  fall  to  just below  its  longer-run  potential  rate.

We  want  to  emphasize  that  these  projected  impacts  of  the  tax  bill  are  very  tentative  at  this  point,  and  may  be adjusted  as  the  legislation  is  finalized  and  our  thinking  on  its  impacts  progresses.

With  a  stronger  growth  outlook,  we  have  lowered  the  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon. It  is  now  expected  to  reach  3.8  percent  by  2018Q4,  and  then  gradually  rise  to  4.0  percent  by  2019Q4  and  4.2  percent by  2020Q4.  The  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  would  have  been  even  lower  except  that  we  anticipate  somewhat higher  productivity  growth  and  labor  force  participation.

Finally,  with  less  slack  in  the  economy,  we  have  raised  slightly  our  inflation  projection. We  anticipate  that it overshoots  the  FOMC  objective,  reaching  2.3  percent  (Q4/Q4)  in  2019  and  2.2  percent  in  2020. We  see  this overshoot  as  appropriate  to  ensure  that  inflation  expectations  are  consistent  with  a  symmetric  objective  of  2 percent.

Respondent 13: Key  factors  include: incorporation  of  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  tax  provisions  now under  consideration  in  Congress;  a  gradual  pickup  in  productivity  growth  over  the  next  few  years;  continued  solid growth  in  global  activity;  and  a  gradual  rise  in  the  federal  funds  rate  that  will  bring  it  into  line  with  its  neutral rate  next  year  and  keep  it  in  line  with  a  (rising)  neutral  rate  thereafter.  This  monetary  policy  should  facilitate  the maintenance  of  strong  labor  market  conditions,  which  in  turn  will  speed  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation.

Important  risks  to  this  outlook  include: the  possibility  that  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  changes  in  tax policy  now  in  train  will  turn  out  to  be  materially  different  (up  or  down)  from  what  I  have  assumed;  the  risk  that  the neutral  rate  is  currently  higher  than  I  have  assumed, or  will  fail  to  rise  as  I  anticipate;  and  that  returning  inflation  to 2  percent  will  prove  to  be  more  difficult  that  I  have  assumed,  perhaps  because  inflation  expectations  are  consistent with  PCE  inflation  of  less  than  2  percent.

Respondent 14: In  my  projection,  I  have  assumed  that  a  large  tax  cut,  similar  to  the  proposals  that  have passed  both  the  House  and  the  Senate,  will  be  enacted  into  law. My  estimates  of  the  effects  of  the  tax  cuts  are broadly  similar  to  those  of  the  Board  sta ff,  with  real  GDP  growth  boosted  0.3  or  0.4  percentage  point  per  year  over the  medium  term,  with  about  a  third  of  the  boost  to  real  GDP  coming  in  the  form  of  higher  potential  GDP.  One exception  is  that  I  have  assumed  a  somewhat  more  rapid  ramp-up  in  investment  spending  than  the  sta  , reflecting a  greater  initial  response  to  the  expensing  provisions.

Respondent 15: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  accommodative monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement in  labor  markets,  and  relatively  low  oil  prices. The  likely  tax  package  should  provide  a  moderate  boost  to  growth over  the  forecast  horizon. Consumer  and  business  sentiment  remain  positive.  Consistent  with  the  data,  business contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified  workers,  and the  increasing  need  to  raise  wages  in  order  to  retain  workers  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations. The global  outlook  has  improved  over  the  last  year. Inflation  rates  here  and  abroad  are  fluctuating  around  a  general upward  trajectory,  supported  by  accommodative  monetary  policy.  However,  the  inflation  levels  generally  remain below  targets.

I project  above  trend  growth  and  that  labor  market  strength  will  continue  and  move  the  economy  somewhat further  beyond  maximum  employment.

Readings  on  inflation  have  come  down  since  the  start  of  the  year,  with  transitory  factors  playing  a  role,  but recent  readings  have  shown  some  stability.  Measured  year-over-year,  PCE  inflation  is  notably  higher  than  it  was in  2015  and  most  of  2016  and  is  not  that  far  from  our  2  percent  goal. I view  inflation  expectations  as  reasonably well-anchored. This,  coupled  with  continued  strengthening  in  labor  market  conditions  and  ongoing  economic growth,  suggests  that  inflation  will  gradually  move  to  2  percent  on  a  sustained  basis  over  the  forecast  horizon.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  the  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy and  inflation.

Respondent 16: My  outlook  has  output  growth  continuing  to  outstrip  potential  next  year,  before  converging to trend  by  2020,  supported  by  a  moderate  pace  of  consumption  and  investment  spending. Growth  next  year receives  a  modest  boost  from  changes  to  the  existing  tax  code  that  accelerate  capital  investment  plans,  pulling some  investment  spending  into  2018. My  judgment  that  the  legislative  changes  will  only  lead  to  modest  changes in  output  growth  is  informed  by  recent  survey  results  from  businesses  on  their  likely  responses  to  the  proposed  tax reform  and  sentiment  from  district  contacts.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  weighted  to  the  upside. Changes  to  the  tax  code  could  have  a  much  more transformative  effect  on  growth  that  I  currently  expect. I am  also  treating  any  positive  supply  effects  that  could come  from  increased  capital  deepening  as  an  upside  risk.

Consistent  with  some  of  the  stronger  readings  in  recent  months  and  given  the  absence  of  resource  slack  in  my projection,  I  see  inflation  converging  to  target  by  the  end  of  next  year.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  balanced.  While  recent  history  suggests  that  the  response  of  inflation  to resource  slack  is  somewhat  muted,  it  may  be  more  pronounced  at  high  rates  of  resource  utilization. On  the  other hand,  after  a  number  of  years  with  below-target  inflation,  it  is  possible  that  inflation  expectations  are  becoming entrenched  at  a  level  lower  than  is  consistent  with  our  mandate.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: In  large  part,  the  upward  revision  in  our  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  and  the  lower  path  for unemployment is  due  to  our  incorporating  new  data  in  the  forecast.  In  addition,  our  quantitative  models  suggested some  upside  risk  to  the  growth  path.  And,  the  prospect  of  debt-financed  tax  cuts  added  a  small  amount  to  growth projections.

Respondent 2: I have  incorporated  a  small  fiscal  stimulus  from  tax  reform  into  my  forecast. Lower-thanexpected  inflation  in  2017  has  led  me  to  revise  down  my  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  over  the  next  two years.  Under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  I  now  anticipate  that  inflation  will  slightly  overshoot  the  FOMC  target in  2019.

Respondent 3: Recent  data  has  caused  us  to  change  our  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  for 2017  and  2018.

Respondent 4: We  revised  our  GDP  forecast  for  2017  up  0.1  percentage  point  in  light  of  stronger  incoming data.  We boosted our forecast for growth in 2018 and 2019 by 0.3 and 0.4 percentage point, respectively, and moved up  the  outlook  for  2020  by  0.1  percentage  point. The  bulk  of  these  changes  are  due  to  our  assumed  impact  of  the impending  tax  cuts  compared  to  the  more  modest  assumptions  we  had  in  place  before;  we  also  revised  2018  up  a tad  to  reflect  the  greater  momentum  in  the  incoming  data. Strong  investment  in  2017  and  the  additional  capital deepening  and  labor  supply  we  anticipate  coming  from  the  tax  cuts  have  led  us  to  revise  upward  our  assessment  of potential  growth  by  0.1  percentage  points  in  each  of  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  We  see  actual  growth  rising  by  more  than potential,  so  that  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period  the  projected  overshooting  of  potential  is 1 / 2 a  percentage  point more  than  in  our  September  forecast.  This  configuration  also  led  to  a  downward  revision  to  our  unemployment  rate forecast  throughout  the  projection  period. Due  to  the  larger  overshooting  of  potential  in  our  current  projection, we  have  revised  up  our  forecast  for  inflation  in  2019  and  2020  by  0.1  percentage  point.

Respondent 5: The  unemployment  rate  has  come  in  a  little  lower  than  I  had  expected.

Previously,  I  had  not  incorporated  any  assumptions  about  tax  cuts  in  my  projections.

ff memo  from  December  7,  2017.  (I  previously  assumed  no  changes  in  tax Respondent 8: Since  September,  I  have  introduced  an  assumption  of  corporate  and  personal  income  tax changes  along  the  lines  of  the  Board  sta policy.)  I  boosted  my  projection  for  growth  in  2018  through  2020  based  on  greater  momentum  in  recent  economic data  than  I  had  previously  expected  as  well  as  the  effects  of  the  tax  changes.  Based  on  research  showing  that  fiscal multipliers  are  lower  in  expansions  and  other  considerations, I  assume  a  somewhat  smaller  impact  of  the  tax  reform than  that  described  in  the  special  memo  issued  by  the  Board  on  December  7th.

My  inflation  projection  is  largely  unchanged  from  September.  I  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  gradually  reach target  by  2019.

Respondent 9: Real  growth  seems  likely  to  stay  stronger  for  longer  than  I  had  anticipated  in  September. Partly,  that  is  a  result  of  the  stimulus  to  demand  from  tax  changes  that  seem  increasingly  likely  to  be  put  into effect. Accordingly,  I've  revised  upward  my  GDP  growth  forecasts  for  2017  and  2018,  revised  downward  my unemployment-rate  forecasts  over  the  entire  forecast  horizon,  and  call  for  policy  to  move  a  bit  faster  toward  a mildly  restrictive  stance. I've  left  my  inflation  projections  largely  unchanged,  however,  as  I  believe  it  likely  that stronger  growth  in  capital  spending  will  be  accompanied  by  accelerated  technology-enabled  disruption.

Respondent 10: The  changes  in  my  forecast  reflect  both  the  change  in  my  fiscal  policy  assumption  and  the incoming  data  since  September.  The  recent  data  accounts  for  the  upward  revision  of  my  projection  for  real  GDP growth  fully  for  2017  and  partially  for  2018. It  also  accounts  for  0.2  percentage  point  of  the  downward  revision  in my  projected  unemployment  path.  With  unemployment  now  projected  to  move  farther  below  its  longer-run  level than  in  September,  I  view  a  higher  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  in  2019  and  2020  as  appropriate.

Respondent 11: Conditioning  assumptions  are,  overall,  more  favorable  relative  to  September. As  a  result the  real  outlook  has  been  revised  upward,  and  so  has  the  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 12: As  noted  earlier,  with  the  passage  of  tax  legislation  now  appearing  to  be  quite  likely,  we  have incorporated  into  our  projection  a  tax  package  consistent  with  the  broad  outlines  of  the  bills  passed  in  the  House and  the  Senate. We  have  tentatively  assessed  that  this  package  will  raise  modestly  the  real  GDP  growth  rate  in the  next  two  years,  but  have  no  material  effect  on  the  potential  growth  rate  or  on  the  longer-run  normal  level  of  the unemployment  rate.

We  see  stronger  momentum  in  the  global  economy,  which  also  contributed  to  raising  our  projected  path  for  real GDP  growth  in  2018  and  2019.  Nevertheless,  we  still  expect  real  growth  to  slow  to  near  its  potential  rate  in  2020. The  combination  of  a  stronger  growth  projection  along  with  the  recent  below-projection  unemployment  rate  has led  us  to  lower  notably  the  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon.

With  projections  of  tighter  resource  constraints,  we  forecast  that  inflation  will  rise  a  bit  more  than  we  projected in  September,  resulting  in  a  slightly  larger  overshoot  of  the  FOMC's  longer-run  inflation  objective  in  2019  -  20. This  overshoot  helps  to  sustain  inflation  expectations  and  thus  helps  to  achieve  the  Federal  Reserve's  mandated objectives  over  the  longer  run.

Our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  unchanged  through  the  end  of  2019.  In  2020,  we  now  assume a  little  bit  more  tightening,  putting  the  policy  rate  modestly  above  its  longer-run  normal  level.  The  mild  overshoot of  the  longer-term  policy  rate  is  meant  to  ensure  that  the  overshoot  of  inflation  and  undershoot  of  unemployment are  temporary,  and  the  longer-run  objectives  are  met  within  5  -  6  years.

Respondent 13: I have  raised  my  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  modestly  to  take  on  board  the  effects  of the  tax  changes  now  under  consideration  by  the  Congress,  as  well  as  the  movements  in  equity  prices  and  the  dollar since  the  September  FOMC  meeting.  I  have  lowered  my  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  in  response  to  both the  upward  revision  in  my  GDP  forecast  and  recent  readings  on  labor  market  conditions.  My  inflation  projection is  essentially  unchanged.

Respondent 14: As  discussed  above, I introduced  a  tax  cut, which  was  not  a  feature  of my  September projection.

I also  reduced  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  by  0.2  percentage  point,  largely  because inflation  -  for  both  wages  and  prices  -  remains  subdued  despite  a  low  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 15: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  has  changed  little  since  September. Both  growth  and  labor market  conditions  have  been  somewhat  stronger  than  I  assumed,  so  I've  edged  up  my  growth  forecast  and  edged down  my  unemployment  forecast  over  the  forecast  horizon.  Recent  readings  on  inflation  have  shown  some  stability and  I  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  gradually  firm  over  the  forecast  horizon.  However,  there  is  uncertainty  about the  speed  of  that  return  to  goal.

Given  current  conditions,  the  medium  run  outlook,  and  risks,  I  view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as appropriate  and  a  prudent  course  that  balances  the  risks  given  that  growth  is  expected  to  be  above  trend,  the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  remain  below  its  longer-run  level,  and  inflation  is  projected  to  gradually  move to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.  My  funds  rate  path  is  slightly  flatter  compared  to  my  September projection  for  two  reasons: (1)  I  don't  think  the  Committee  will  go  back  to  targeting  a  point  rather  than  a  range for  the  fed  funds  rate  until  sometime  in  2020  (or  even  later);  (2)  my  inflation  path  is  slightly  shallower.

Respondent 16: I have  raised  my  current  year  growth  projection  because  of  stronger  than  expected  thirdquarter  growth.  Given  the  details  of  the  recently  passed  House  and  Senate  tax  reform  bills,  and  the  high  likelihood of  a  bill  being  signed  into  law,  I  have  marked  in  a  modest  increase  to  my  2018  growth  projection. This  increase  is

December 12-13, 2017

attenuated  by  my  lowering  the  trajectory  of  potential  GDP  growth  in  light  of  the  continued  sluggish  performance in  labor  productivity.

My  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  last  submission  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  owing  to  its recent  decline  and  a  downward  adjustment  of  my  judgment  about  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  informed  in part,  by  a  reassessment  of  the  impact  of  demographic  and  technological  changes  on  the  labor  market  that  appear to  have  lowered  frictional  unemployment.

I have  also  marked  down  my  projection  for  the  longer-run  neutral  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  a decrease  in  my  estimate  for  longer-run  output  growth.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2: My  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  remains  considerably  more  accommodative  than the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 3: For  GDP  growth  and  inflation,  our  projections  are  quite  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook. Differences  arise  because  the  Tealbook  projections  incorporate  the  idea  of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the  economy  transitions  to  the  longer-run steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. Our  regime  conception,  in  contrast,  views monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  these  regimes  are  quite  difficult  to  forecast,  this suggest  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook. The Tealbook  also  has  a  substantial  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate,  far  more  than  our  undershooting,  before returning  to  its  longer-run  value  of  4.7  percent.

Respondent 4: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  next  three  years,  ending 2020  at  3.00  percent.  This  is  only 1 / 4 percentage  point  above  our  long-run  normal  level,  so  we  do  not  overshoot  the long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate  by  nearly  as  much  as  the  Tealbook  does.

Our  projections  for  growth  in  2018,  2019  and  2020  are  close  to  the  Tealbook's. They  are  based  on  similar assumptions  for  the  net  effect  on  GDP  growth  of  tax  cuts. Our  forecast  of  potential  growth  has  been  adjusted upward  much  like  the  Tealbook,  and  consequently  remains  a  tenth  or  two  stronger.  However,  given  we  assess  the current  output  gap  to  be  narrower,  our  output  gap  at  the  end  of  2020  remains  about  1/2  percentage  point  smaller than  the  Tealbook's. In  terms  of  labor  market  slack,  our  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  averages  about 0.1  percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook,  and  we  assume  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  about  0.1 percentage  point  lower.  Accordingly,  our  3.5  percent  unemployment  rate  projection  for  2020:Q4  undershoots  the natural  rate  by  less  than  in  the  Tealbook.

We  do  not  see  quite  as  much  of  an  increase  in  inflation  over  the  next  couple  of  years  as  in  the  Tealbook,  despite our  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  path. However,  we  do  see  this  path  and  additional  fiscal  stimulus eventually  generating  a  0.1  percentage  point  overshooting  of  our  inflation  objective  in  2020,  a  year  sooner  than  the overshooting  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  my  forecast  for  economic  activity  is  a  bit  stronger,  but  my  forecast for  inflation  is  broadly  similar.  I  believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market will  continue  to  keep  the  labor  force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job growth  on  the  unemployment  rate.  I  believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually than  in  the  Tealbook. Even  with  lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  return  to  target  more gradually  than  the  Tealbook.

ff outlook. Respondent 6: I  have  a  stronger  outlook  for  potential  growth  than  the  Tealbook.  Consequently,  I  believe  that the  economy  can  grow  faster  in  the  near-term  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook  without  much  additional  upward impetus  to  price  inflation. My  more  optimistic  outlook  for  potential  growth  is  consistent  with  a  slightly  higher long-run  neutral  interest  rate  compared  to  that  in  the  Sta

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: The  December  8th  update  to  the  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment,  with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  to  3.3  percent  at  the  end  of  2020,  and  inflation returning  to  the  2  percent  target  very  gradually. In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output  through  early  2019,  and  those  gaps  begin  to  close  later  in  that  year.  Despite  strong  financial conditions  and  favorable  consumer  sentiment,  I  am  not  seeing  much  evidence  in  the  data  that  this  is  translating into  markedly  higher  growth  in  business  or  consumer  spending.  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  3.7 percent  by  the  third  quarter  of  next  year.

The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows growth  to  below  potential  in  2019. This  pushes  up  the  unemployment  rate  to  3.9  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. Finally,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  2019  and  results  in  a slight  overshooting  of  inflation  for  some  time  afterwards.  Tighter  monetary  policy  brings  inflation  back  to  target and  unemployment  closer  to  its  long-run  sustainable  level  in  2020.

ff considerably  earlier  than  is  assumed  by  Board  sta  , Respondent 9: I have  the  federal  funds  rate  level  o and at  a  lower  level. The  key  to  achieving  sustainable  price  stability,  in  my  view,  is  to  prolong  the  economic  expansion. Our  best  chance  for  prolonging  the  expansion  is  to  continue  to  remove  accommodation,  and  then  shift  to  a  policy stance  that  is  restrictive,  but  only  mildly  so.

Respondent 10: My  assumptions  and  projections  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook.

ff's  more  optimistic  assessment  of  the  effect  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  on  economic Respondent 11: TheTealbookisprojectingafasterpaceofGDPgrowthovertheforecasthorizon.  Partofthe difference  stems  from  the  Board  sta activity.  Another  reason  for  the  difference  is  that  we  are  assuming  that  the  tightening  of  monetary  policy  will  raise long-term  rates  by  more  than  what  the  Tealbook  is  envisioning.  Absent  such  additional  tightening  at  the  longerend  of  the  maturity  spectrum,  the  two  forecasts  would  be  closer  in  terms  of  unemployment  rate  outcomes. Our forecast  also  features  more  inflationary  pressures,  though  our  baseline  outlook  for  inflation  remains  very  benign.

Respondent 12: As  in  the  September  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast andourprojectionsforthekeySEPvariables.  Thesedifferencespartlyreflectdivergencesinsomeoftheunderlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts. In particular,  the  Tealbook  forecast  (based  on  the  update  of  December  8) incorporates  stronger  effects  of  the  likely  tax  package  than  we  have  incorporated  into  our  projections.

Although  the  projections  for  2018  are  similar,  the  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2019  -  20  than  in  our outlook.  Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential  GDP  growth,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to a  notably  positive  output  gap  in  those  years  that  appears  to  be  larger  than  our  rough  assessment.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  two  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption.  The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2018  -  19  than  in  our  projection;  this  is  a  long-standing  difference between  the  two  forecasts.  Related  to  this  difference,  the  Tealbook's  projected  saving  rate  is  above  our  projection in  2018  -  19. In  part,  the  difference  this  time  appears  to  reflect  the  Tealbook's  somewhat  larger  consumption  effect (and  thus  smaller  saving  impact)  from  the  tax  package  than  is  incorporated  into  our  projection.

Because  the  Tealbook  has  reduced  its  assumption  on  the  longer-run  natural  rate  of  unemployment  to  4.7 percent,  it  is  now  close  to  our  estimate  which  stands  at  4.6  percent.  However,  with  its  stronger  growth  projection, the  Tealbook  projects  that  the  unemployment  will  undershoot  the  longer-run  natural  rate  in  2018  -  20  by  a  larger extent  than  in  September  (again,  based  on  the  December  8  update). This  pattern  is  a  counterpart  of  the  sizable positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast. The  lower  unemployment  rate  path  also  contributes  to higher  projected  payroll  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation. In  our projection,  the  participation  rate  rises  gradually  to  63.1  percent  in  2019.  In  the  Tealbook  this  rate  still  declines  to 62.5  percent  at  end-2019.  This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  differ  notably. We  see  inflation  rising  to  2  percent  in  2018  and  modestly  above that  level  in  2019  -  20  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade. In  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects core  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  in  2019,  despite  an  even  larger  undershooting  of  unemployment,  and  then  running persistently  slightly  above  that  level  in  the  early  2020s. The  considerable  persistence  of  inflation  and  the  flat Phillips  curve  within  the  Tealbook  framework  appear  to  require  a  prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  in order  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. As  mentioned  previously,  the  overshoot  of

December 12-13, 2017

inflation  in  our  projection  occurs  to  prevent  inflation  expectations  from  falling  below  levels  consistent  with  the FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  both  projections  see  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels  and risks  broadly  balanced.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  below  the  Tealbook  path  for  2018  -  20. In  addition,  our  assumption  for the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  25bps  above  that  of  the  Tealbook.  Both  policy  paths  have  an  overshooting  of the  longer-run  FFR  in  2019  -  20,  although  the  Tealbook's  is  appreciably  larger,  which  is  a  reflection  of  the  larger projected  positive  output  gap  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

ff estimates. Respondent 13: My  assessment  of  the  likely  macroeconomic  effects  of  the  House/Senate  tax  bills  is  similar to those  of  the  sta  , except  that  I  have  not  taken  on  board  their  assessment  of  the  medium-term  effects  of  the fiscal initiatives  on  labor  supply; accordingly,  I  have  assumed  that  the  boost  to  potential  output  from  the  tax changes  is  quite  small.  In  addition  to  this  difference,  my  forecast  continues  to  assume  that,  over  the  next  few  years, the  neutral  rate  will  be  appreciably  lower  than  the  sta Finally,  I  continue  to  assume  that  inflation expectations  are  anchored  at  2  percent,  unlike  the  sta ff;  thus,  my  forecast  assumes  that  less  undershooting  of  the long-run  unemployment  rate  will  be  needed  to  return  inflation  to  2  percent.

ff forecast Respondent 14: Myassumptionsabouttheeffectsoffiscalpolicyaresimilartothoseinthelateststa update;  those  effects  are  about  twice  as  large  as  the  ones  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 15: As  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  (revised  to  include  updated  tax  policy  assumptions),  I  expect that  the  economy  will  grow  at  an  above  trend  pace,  labor  market  conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and inflation  will  gradually  rise  to  our  2  percent  goal. The  inflation  and  labor  market  dynamics  in  my  outlook  differ from  those  in  the  Tealbook  forecast: our  inflation  paths  are  similar  but  I  do  not  project  as  great  a  fall  in  the unemployment  rate.  Thus,  compared  to  the  Tealbook  forecast,  I  see  inflation  somewhat  better  anchored  at  target and  see  somewhat  stronger  inflationary  pressures.  On  balance,  my  funds  rate  path  over  the  next  two  years  is  similar to  that  in  the  Tealbook  forecast. My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  but  I might  be  a  little  more  skeptical  about  supply-side  responses  to  the  tax  package.

Respondent 16: My projectionfor realGDPgrowth is lowerthantherevisedTealbook projectionthroughout the  medium-term  forecast  horizon.  However,  I  see  inflation  converging  to  target  by  the  end  of  next  year,  owing  to an  assumption  that  longer-run  inflation  expectations  remain  at  mandate-consistent  levels.  Also,  I  am  forecasting much  less  of  a  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  than  the  Tealbook  due  to  a  lower  projection  for  employment growth.
