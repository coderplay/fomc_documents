Respondent  1:

Convergence process likely to take somewhat longer than 5 to 6 years

Respondent  2:

I  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  be  substantially  shorter than 5-6 years, perhaps on the order of three years for real growth (with a period of overshoot of real growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an overshoot  in the interim in inflation  as  a consequence of significant past  growth in the  monetary base supported by longer term  asset purchases that cannot  be sold off over  a very short time period.  I  anticipate that the decline in the unemployment rate will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  3:

It  will take longer than 5 or 6 years for unemployment.

Respondent 4:

In  light  of the  severity  and  breadth  of shocks  to  the  economy  and  the  continuing,  though  reduced,  risk of more to come, the convergence process may well extend beyond five or six years to something closer to eight years.

Respondent  5:

If appropriate policy is followed, I would expect convergence to occur within five to six years.  However, I am concerned that delaying the removal of policy accommodation and the shrinkage of our balance sheet could result  in  long  term  inflation  expectations  becoming  unanchored,  leading  to  higher  inflation  and  therefore more time would be required to reach our longer term objectives.

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

Convergence to the real economy's equilibrium and to the inflation objective within five years requires lower long-term interest rates in the near-term than what is assumed in the baseline outlook.  As a result,  while it is possible that the maximum employment goal will be achieved within a five-year horizon,  inflation is likely to remain below the target.

Respondent  12:

The convergence process may be slightly shorter than 5-6 years.

Respondent  13:

By 2015-16 potential growth is  2.4%,  down  from our current  estimate of 2.5-2.7%,  as  the babyboomers re­ tire. A reasonable  estimate  for  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4.5%  to  5.5%. We would expect,  with appropriate policy and no further adverse shocks, unemployment to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-16.

We assume long-term inflation expectations to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's inflation objective to be  around 2%  for the  PCE deflator and around 2.5%  for the  CPI.  Under these condi­ tions,  with the output gap around zero,  we would expect PCE inflation of around 2%.

Respondent  14:

The convergence process will likely be longer than six years because of the current massive output gap, very low inflation,  and limits on possible monetary stimulus resulting from the zero lower bound on interest rates.

Respondent  15:

At  a  5-6  year  horizon,  the  economy  has  yet  to  fully  converge  for  output  and  unemployment. Given  the substantial weakness in my near-term projection,  the convergence process will likely take 7-8 years.

Respondent  16:

N/A

Respondent  17:

Given the depth of the recession, the damage inflicted on the financial sector,  and the difficult domestic and global adjustments that are needed,  convergence may well require the  full five-to-six years.

Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economy is  in  recovery.

In  addition,  the  effect  of the  extraordinary monetary  policy  accommodation  in  place  and  the  uncertainty about the timing of when we will exit  from that  accommodation have increased the uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

In  addition,  the  unexpected  jump  in  the  unemployment  rate last  year  raises  questions  about  the  evolution  of the  labor  market  going  forward.

Going forward into 2010 as the economy recovers from the recent recession and experiences the fiscal stimulus program  as  well  as  a  substantial  persistent  increase  in  the  monetary base,  I  believe  that  the  risks  to  real growth and inflation will become weighted to the upside.

By 'weighted to upside'  for unemployment, I mean that I am concerned that unemployment might turn out to be even higher than my already pessimistic mean forecast.

Respondent 4:

Respondent  5:

In the near-term, the weakness of the economy and recent price trends pose some downside risks to core and overall  inflation. However,  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  expansion  of our  balance  sheet  and  increased public nervousness about increases in our balance sheet  and federal borrowing create  a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations,  and therefore create upside risks to inflation.  In addition,  there is a risk that monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  11:

The incoming high-frequency data-as aggregated by summary statistics such as the CFNAI-are quite con­ sistent  with the near term projections for growth.  However,  looking later into 2010  and beyond,  the degree of uncertainty  is  greater  than  it  has  been  over  the  past  20  years. In  part  this  reflects  the  severity  of the recession  and the resulting uncertainty over the  endogenous cyclical dynamics  of the recovery.  The  degree of repair necessary in the banking sector and the massive change in the Federal Reserve's balance sheet  also impart a greater-than-usual degree of uncertainty surrounding financial conditioning assumptions-both with regard  to  the  most  appropriate  assumptions  to  make  and  the  influence  of those  assumptions  on  economic activity and inflation expectations.

Respondent  12:

The incoming data have led me to revise up slightly my near-term path for growth compared to my Octo­ ber  forecast. I  view  the  risks  to  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  as  roughly balanced.  Over the  longer term,  inflation  risk is  tilted  to  the  upside  reflecting  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and efficacy of the  Fed' s withdrawal of accommodation.

Respondent  13:

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  projection  and  the  expected  value  from  the FRBNY forecast distribution.  For inflation,  risks  are modestly to the downside in the near term and mod­ estly to the upside in the medium to longer term.

Respondent  16:

The incoming data suggests a pace of spending and production that, if continued, would lead to GDP growth much stronger in the medium term than I have marked into my forecast.

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent  1: Yes

Expect policy rates to move sooner and with greater force than Greenbook forecast -  closer to current market forecast

Respondent  2: Yes

While the pattern of recovery from the recent  recession is uncertain,  I believe that  under  appropriate mon­ etary  policy  to  maintain  price  stability  we  will  have  to  move  away  from  the  current  target  range  for  the funds rate as part of the process of withdrawing from quantitative easing much sooner than assumed in the Greenbook forecast.

Respondent  3: No

The path of interest rates is likely to be appropriate.  If expected inflation were to tick up appreciably,  then we would have to re-evaluate.

Respondent 4: No

N/A

Respondent  5: Yes

I  expect  it will  be necessary to begin raising the target  for the federal funds rate in 2010,  in contrast to the Greenbook assumption that the current target range is maintained until late  2011.  Holding rates down so low for so long would invite asset imbalances and risk repeating past mistakes.  In my judgment,  appropriate policy will also involve taking steps to reduce the size of our balance sheet  and normalize its composition in a timely manner.  Finally,  I also believe we need to change the language in our press statement  from saying economic conditions  'are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period'  to  'are likely to warrant low levels of the federal  funds rate for some time.'

Respondent  6: Yes

tightening begins in H1  2011  rather than H2.

Respondent  7: Yes

The forecast is conditioned on a somewhat lower path for the Federal funds rate in 2011  and 2012.

Respondent  8: Yes

Anticipate a modest move toward normalization in 2010:H2,  further slow rate increases in 2011.

Respondent  9: Yes

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary policy  the  committee  would  announce  a  numerical  inflation objective.  In order to achieve that objective, I believe that policy rates may well need to increase by the end of this year.

Respondent  10: No

N/A

Respondent  11: Yes

We assume the funds rate to be close to the path currently embedded in futures markets in 2010 and the first

part of 2011.  We expect a slightly higher path for the funds rate than the markets do later in the projection period.

Respondent  12: Yes

My forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy than in  the  Greenbook  baseline.  I  view the appropriate monetary policy as one that raises the funds rate to about 2 percent by the end of 2010 and 3.5 percent by the end of 2011.  By the end of 2012,  I see the  funds rate at  about 4.5 percent.

Respondent  13: Yes

For 2010 identical.  We assume the normalization of interest rates starts in 2011Q1  and continues at a faster rate  in  2012. Because of differences  in  our  inflation  forecast,  the  difference  in real rates  is  less  substantial. Our views on the size of the balance sheet  are close to the Greenbook assumption.

Respondent  14: No

N/A

Respondent  15: Yes

Yes.  Due to a stronger inflation profile in my outlook,  the federal funds rate begins to increase sooner than in the Greenbook.

Respondent  16: No

N/A

Respondent  17: No

No, but given the uncertainty regarding the outlook, we must be careful not to lock ourselves in to a particular rate or path for rates.

Forecast  Narratives

Respondent  1:

Pace of GDP growth significantly influenced by pace of improvement in labor incomes

Respondent  2:

The path of economic activity in the first three quarters of 2009 was consistent with my earlier expectation of a  slowing contraction  in  the  first  half of the  year,  with  output  bottoming  out  in  the  middle  of the  year and recovery in the second half.  Hence I  have not  revised my previous  forecast  for real growth in  2010.  In 2010  and  2011  I  anticipate that real growth will  occur  at  greater than steady-state rates,  reflecting normal cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by  a  modest  impact  of the  fiscal  stimulus  package  and  the  impact  of the  sub­ stantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been  in  train  since  late  2008. I  expect  that  subsequently growth  will slow and approach steady-state rates.  I do not see inflation abating in the near future.  While headline PCE inflation from the fourth quarter of 2008 through the third quarter of 2009 is slightly less than one percent at  annual rates,  recent  increases in energy prices lead me to expect that the headline rate will approach the core  rate  as  2010  progresses. Subsequently,  under  appropriate  monetary policy,  inflation  should  approach my preferred  long-run  rate  of  1.5  percent,  though  I  believe  that  it  will  rise  above  that  rate  in  an  interim period.  I  do not  believe that  future  energy shocks can be  forecasted,  so with available information I expect that core  and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  3:

Financial  markets have normalized.  However,  unemployment remains high.  At the same,  hiring rates  and job  openings  remain  at  historical  lows. I  see  little  chance  for  significant job  growth  in  2010. Large  fiscal imbalances  and  large  holdings  of excess  reserves  create  the  possibility  of  a  low-probability  high  inflation scenario.

Respondent 4:

Key  factors  include  slow  but  steady  spread  of expectation  that  recovery  has  taken  hold,  but  continuing likelihood  of  slow  employment  growth  and  consequent  drag  on  consumption,  drag  from  commercial  real estate,  and  uneven  nature  of housing  market  recovery. Key uncertainty is  timing  of turnaround  in  credit availability for consumers  and small businesses.  The  impact  of diminution in effects of stimulus  and of our LSAP program in first half of 2010 remain important uncertainties.

Respondent  5:

The economic outlook is improving and growth is likely to be above trend over the forecast horizon.  Even so,  the  recovery  is  likely  to  be  sluggish  by  historical  standards. Growth  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  is driven  in  part  by  temporary  factors,  such  as  highly  stimulative  fiscal  policy,  inventory  accumulation,  and census hiring concentrated in the second quarter.  However,  with the  tax credit  for home buyers  ending in the second quarter,  and fiscal stimulus more generally slowing in the second half of this year,  growth in the second  half of 2010  and  beyond  requires  a  transition  from  growth  driven  by  temporary  factors  to  growth driven by private final demand.  I expect such a transition to occur through a few channels:  As firms exhaust productivity  gains,  hiring  and  new  investment  should  pick  up;  then,  as  labor  markets  improve,  consumer spending should also trend upward; and finally,  strong foreign demand, particularly in Asia,  should support export growth.

I  expect  core  inflation  to  remain  low  but  move  higher  over  the  forecast  horizon. Disinflationary  pressure from low resource utilization is currently being offset by stable inflation expectations,  a decline in the dollar, and accommodative monetary policy.  Over time, as the recovery continues, inflation is likely to move higher, to a level more in line with long-term inflation expectations.

While  problems  in  commercial  real  estate  pose  downside  risks  to  GDP  growth,  the  easing  of  financial stress,  the  resiliency  of the  U.S.  economy,  and  traditional  business  cycle  dynamics-especially  following  a deep  recession-may  lead  to  even  stronger  consumer  and  business  spending  than  anticipated. In  the  near term,  the  weakness  of the  economy  and  recent  price  trends  pose  some  downside  risks  to  core  and  overall inflation. However,  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  expansion  of our  balance  sheet  and  increased  public nervousness about increases in our balance sheet and federal borrowing create a risk to the stability of long­ term inflation  expectations,  and  therefore  create  upside  risks  to inflation. In  addition,  there  is  a  risk  that monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  6:

The growth rate of final demand strengthens gradually,  supported by accommodative monetary policy,  fur­ ther improvement in financial conditions  (including for bank credit),  and a rebound on spending on houses, consumer durables,  and business capital equipment  form unsustainably low levels.  Expansion is held back, especially in the next  few quarters,  by still-tight  credit  for some borrowers,  and by caution and uncertainty resulting from the recent events and the still-developing governmental response.  Upside risks include a faster rebound in household and business spending on durables and capital; downside risks include slower recovery of credit  availability,  especially from banks  partly resulting  from much tighter  expected  and  actual  capital and other requirements on them,

Respondent  7:

Recent  data have  been  broadly in  line  with  expectations. Average growth in final  sales  during the  second half of 2009  was  mildly  positive,  and  the  fluctuations  in  inventories  have  altered  the  projected  quarterly pattern of GDP  growth but not  the assessment of the  underlying strength of the  economy.  In this  regard, the  recovery  in  activity  this  year  is  likely  to  be  relatively  muted. Banking  problems  remain  even  if the banking  crisis  has  passed. Lending  standards  continue  to  be  tight  as  banks  are  unwilling  to  take  on  too much additional risk given the ongoing problems with existing loans.  As a result, credit  availability is likely to  place  constraints  on  both  households'   and  firms'   spending. Housing prices  remain  well  off their  peaks, and the desire to build a more meaningful buffer of savings may also dampen consumption in the near term. Growth in private  sources of income,  while  expected to increase during the  recovery,  is  still  modest  at  this point  and  the  high  level  of unemployment  suggests  only small  advances  in the  wage  rate  over  the  forecast horizon.  These factors,  together with a waning support from the fiscal stimulus,  are likely to result in a slow recovery in spending compared to past episodes.  In addition,  many businesses may expand investment only gradually,  at least  until  they are more confident  that the economy will continue expanding even after some of the stimulative government support winds down.

In  all, we  expect  the  ongoing  recovery  to  make  only  a  relatively  small  dent  to  the  unemployment  rate gap by the  end of 2011. Given the sizable  slack  in  the  labor  market  over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  rate  of core inflation remains well below target in 2011  and 2012.

The risks to activity have become somewhat more balanced,  but the downside risks at this point  are much more  costly  than  the  potential  upside,  given  that  a  faster-than-expected  recovery  is  unlikely  to  generate meaningful inflationary pressures.  The  risks to inflation continue  to be on the downside.  Given the  unem­ ployment  rate  forecast,  several  accelerationist  Phillips  curve  models  would  predict  outright  deflation  over the course of the forecast horizon.

Respondent  8:

Firms  have  slowed  inventory  liquidation  more  quickly  than  expected,  leading  to  a  strong  09:Q4  and  sug­ gesting  perhaps  a  bit  more  optimism  on  the  part  of firms  about  2010. However,  the  broad  outline  of the forecast-a moderate recovery in  2010,  picking up steam thereafter-remains the  same,  or perhaps just  a bit stronger.  Key to recovery is that  private final  demand take  over  from the  inventory cycle  and fiscal  policy as the principle source of growth;  it is early to tell whether that will occur,  but recent  growth in consumer

spending and firms'  investment in equipment and software is encouraging.  Global economic conditions con­ tinue to improve,  especially in emerging markets.  Manufacturing has been stronger  (moreso than services), perhaps  reflecting  strengthening  foreign  demands  and  the  greater  cyclicality  of the  manufacturing  sector. Housing remains relatively weak,  with prices likely to fall a bit  further and gains in construction moderate.

Outside of banking, financial conditions are approaching normal, with equity prices up, credit spreads tighter, money markets functioning well, and larger firms (including banks) having good access to public capital mar­ kets.  Banks have continued to stabilize,  except that regional and smaller banks still face serious concerns in commercial real estate.  Bank credit  has  continued  to contract,  however,  reflecting tight  lending terms  but also lower  credit  demand  and  weak  borrower  balance  sheets. Presumably the continued tightness  in  bank lending is having the greatest effects on consumers and small businesses.  Continued financial normalization and slow improvement in bank credit conditions will be needed for a sustainable recovery.

The labor market continues to be very weak, with no signs yet of significant hiring.  Labor market weakness is  also  a  risk  to  the  recovery,  as  households  are  unlikely to  regain  confidence  with  unemployment  so  high. The relatively moderate expected pace of recovery suggests slow improvement in unemployment.  However, the productivity gains of recent quarters,  the result of cost-cutting,  are unsustainable; some reversal of this trend might lead to somewhat better job growth than implied by the expected pace of output growth.  Un­ certainties  about  output  and  employment  remain  high,  however,  because  of continuing  financial  restraint, political uncertainty,  and the usual difficulties of forecasting around turning points.

Core inflation is likely to respond to slack, but the decline is likely to be relatively modest given the stability of inflation expectations.  Energy and commodity prices will rise faster than other prices as the global econ­ omy strengthens, so that headline inflation will exceed core inflation.  The dollar has shown greater stability recently. The  stability  of inflation  expectations  limits  the  amount  of uncertainty  one  can  have  about  the inflation forecast.

Respondent  9:

I  believe  that  the  pace  of expansion  will  be  solid,  although  less  rapid  than  has  often  occurred  in  previous recoveries, due in part to further significant declines in nonresidential construction and low levels of activity in  residential  construction  and  autos. In  addition,  under  current  legislation  the  stock  of federal  debt  will grow  rapidly  relative  to  GDP  for  the  foreseeable  future. There  is  considerable  uncertainty  on  the  nature and timing of the fiscal  policy  actions  that  will  put  the  stock  of debt  onto  a more  sustainable  path. That uncertainty, in combination with the likelihood of higher future taxes, is likely to make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans

Respondent  10:

N/A

Respondent  11:

We  continue  to  see  important  bimodal  aspects  to  the  forecast. The  downside  scenario  is  a  function  of slower-than-anticipated repair of the banking system and more persistent effects of depreciated worker skills and resulting difficulties in matching job  applicants to labor demand.  The upside scenario reflects greaterthan-expected impulses from accommodative monetary policy and pent up demand from the recession.  Our baseline forecast  averages these cases.

Respondent  12:

The recent data on the economy has been broadly in line with what I anticipated in my October forecast.

In  my  view,  the  economy  is  now  is  in  recovery  and  I  expect  an  above-trend  pace  of  3.4  percent  growth in  2010  as recovery dynamics take hold.  I expect  growth slightly above  trend in  2011  and 2012.  The labor market recovery is gradual - I expect the unemployment rate edges down to about 6.5 percent by the end of

the forecast horizon,  at which time it remains above the natural rate of unemployment by about 1  percentage point.  I  anticipate that  inflation will rise into  2011  then pull  back in  2012  in response to tighter monetary policy than anticipated in the  Greenbook.

In  my view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  raises  the  risk  that  inflation  will rapidly accelerate to unacceptable levels  and that  inflation expectations may become unanchored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in 2010.

Respondent  13:

In  our  central  projection,  the  recovery  of  the  US  economy  began  in  2009Q3  after  a  post  WWII  record four-quarter decline of real  GDP  of nearly 4%.  Indeed,  at  this writing it  appears that  real  GDP  rose  3.7% (annual rate) over the second half of 2009, somewhat stronger than expected last October.  After falling 1.7% over  the  preceding  four  quarters,  real  personal  consumption  expenditures  increased  2.8%  (annual  rate)  in 2009Q3, led by a significant increase in light-weight vehicle sales fueled by the  'cash for clunkers'  program. Similarly,  single-family housing starts rose by nearly 40%  from 2009Q1  to 2009Q3,  reflecting a larger-thananticipated  response  to  the  first  time  home  buyer  tax  credit  as  well  as  the  success  of the  Fed's  purchases of agency MBS  in lowering mortgage  interest  rates. Despite  a  very low  capacity utilization  rate,  business investment  in  new  equipment  and  software  eked  out  a  modest  gain  in  Q3  and  looks  to  have  increased  at a  roughly  10%  annual  rate  in  Q4,  likely  due  in  part  to  the  pending  expiration  of the  bonus  depreciation provision in the stimulus bill.  Finally,  the economy experienced an unusually large inventory cycle that  we estimate to have contributed a full  2 percentage points to growth over the second half of 2009.

Despite  the  stronger-than-expected  second  half growth  of real  GDP,  labor  market  conditions  turned  out to  be  roughly  as  expected. Based  on  available  data,  it  appears  that  productivity  growth  remained  very high in  2009Q4  and that  hours  worked continued to decline,  although  at  a much slower rate than over the preceding seven quarters.  The unemployment rate averaged  10.0% in the fourth quarter,  slightly below our expectations,  due to a steeper than expected decline of the labor force participation rate.

The  PCE  deflator  probably  increased  at  a  2  2 %  annual  rate  in  the  second  half  of  2009  after  being  es­ sentially zero  over  the  first  half of the  year. This  is  somewhat  higher  than  we  previously expected  due  to larger  than  assumed  increases  of energy prices. The  overall  rate  of increase  of the  core  PCE  deflator  over the  second half of 2009  was  in  line with our expectations,  at  a  1.2%  annual rate versus  1.6%  over the  first half of 2009.  This is consistent with our view that the high degree to which resources are underutilized has put downward pressure on core inflation.

For 2010 we have raised our projected growth rate to 2  4  %  (Q4/Q4)  from 2%,  reflecting an upward revision to  labor  compensation  which  feeds  through  into  somewhat  more  rapid  growth  of real  consumer  spending. This  still  is  very  sluggish  growth  for  the  first  full  year  of recovery  and  is  below  the  consensus. As  before, we expect  the  first  half of the  year to be  notably weaker than the second half.  As growth in  2010  remains below our estimate of potential, we expect the unemployment rate to rise to about 10  1  % by midyear.  A key feature of our modal forecast is that the current cycle is qualitatively different  from the typical post WWII cycle  such  that  we  are  unlikely  to  see  the  robust  growth  of consumer  spending  that  normally  occurs  over the first year of recovery.  A major factor for this relatively tepid growth is the large declines in employment and hours during the recession, which will continue to impact household income.  In addition, the household sector continues  to have  a substantial debt  overhang,  the effects of the stimulus bill on taxes  and transfers are largely behind us, and energy prices have increased from their recent lows.  While equity and home prices have  recovered  somewhat,  we  estimate  that  as  of 2009Q4  the  ratio  of household  net  worth  to  disposable income  remains  over  20  percent  below its  peak. Finally,  while  financial  conditions  appear  to  be  gradually easing,  we expect credit  availability to be tight relative to the standards of the recent past.

A  second  key  feature  of  our  modal  forecast  is  that  while  it  appears  that  the  correction  in  housing  pro­ duction is over,  it is unlikely that we will experience the surge of residential investment typical of the early stages of post WWII recoveries.  In addition to tightened mortgage underwriting standards,  a large number of homes will continue to come onto the market  through the foreclosure process.  Finally,  new construction of multifamily units has moved downward reflecting excess supply of condos and high rental vacancy rates. With consumption and residential investment recovering only gradually-in conjunction with historically low capacity utilization rates, rapidly rising retail and office vacancy rates,  and sharply declining prices for com­ mercial real estate-any recovery of business investment in new equipment and software and new structures is likely to be weak.  Also contributing to the relatively tepid growth expected for 2010 is the ongoing structural adjustment  taking  place  in  state  and  local  governments  which  is  expected  to  result  in  significant  declines in  employment in this sector  for much of the  first  half of the year.  Finally,  while  growth prospects  for  our trading partners have generally improved, suggesting a continued rebound of exports, the modest upgrade in final demand as the US recovers will be associated with rising imports.  Thus, while net exports will not be a major drag on growth, they are unlikely to be a major positive contributor to growth over the forecast horizon.

By  the  second  half  of  2010  and  into  2011  we  expect  the  recovery  to  gather  steam  with  growth  of  4% (Q4/Q4) in 2011, placing the level of real GDP very close to the consensus forecast.  We expect the recovery to gather further momentum in 2012 with a 5% growth in GDP and a fall in the unemployment rate below 7%.  Underlying this projection is  the  expectation that  financial market  functioning continues to return to a  more  normal state  and that  consumer  and business  confidence  and the  general  appetite  for risk continue to  recover. With  household  income  and  balance  sheets  improving  and  credit  flowing  more  normally,  the substantial pent-up demand for consumer durables, housing, and business equipment and software will start to be satisfied.  Moreover,  the structural  adjustments of state and local governments and of the commercial real  estate sector will likely have run their course by that time.

Barring  a  significant  decline  in  (either  or  both)  the  level  of the  economy' s  potential  output  or  its  poten­ tial  growth  rate,  this  point  forecast  implies  that  a  large  output  gap  will  persist  over  most  of the  forecast horizon. Accordingly,  we  expect  core  inflation  to  slow  to  around  1%  (Q4/Q4)  in  2010. But  by late  2010 and into  2011,  as final demand firms  within the  context  of anchored inflation expectations,  we expect  core inflation to move up to within the  'mandate consistent'  range.

The  risks  to  our  central  projection  for  real  activity  are  somewhat  more  balanced  than  in  October  but remain skewed to the downside.  A key downside risk is that  the loss of income  and wealth suffered by the household  sector  induces  a  steeper-than-expected  increase  of the  personal  saving  rate,  keeping  consumer spending weaker for longer.  The sharp decrease in the prime age employment to population ratio during the current cycle,  combined with the large share of workers nearing retirement  age,  makes this risk particularly acute.  Finally, an important risk over the medium term is the uncertainty surrounding our assumption of the economy's potential growth rate.  On the one hand,  given the weakness of business investment  and the nec­ essary reallocation of labor and capital,  the economy' s potential growth rate may have slowed significantly. On  the  other  hand,  current  estimates  of labor  productivity  continue  to  surprise  to  the  upside. Another source of risk to the forecast  is fiscal policy.  Under current law many of the tax provisions enacted in  2001 and 2003 are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010.  The outcome of the debate over these provisions could potentially have a significant impact on both growth prospects and inflation expectations.  Finally, relatively modest changes in variables such as productivity growth, the participation rate,  and the average work week could have a significant impact on the path of the unemployment rate.

The  risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  are  relatively  balanced. Clearly,  the  downside  risk  to the growth projection combined with the possibility of no meaningful decline in potential implies downside risk  to  the  inflation  projection.  In  contrast,  with  the  aggressive  global monetary and fiscal  policy response to the financial crisis,  there is a risk of higher inflation.

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  the  shape  of  recoveries  from  periods  of  banking  and  finan­ cial crisis as well  as the uncertainty associated with the timing and synchronization of the removal of global policy accommodation result in greater uncertainty around our central projection compared to typical levels over the last twenty years.

Respondent  14:

Although labor markets remain very weak, recent  economic indicators suggest  that  a moderate recovery is in  train. Financial  conditions  have  improved;  however,  the  process  of repairing  the  banking  and  financial sectors  will  proceed  slowly,  and  financial  intermediation  will  remain  impaired  for  some  time  and  will  hold back  the  pace  of recovery. In  addition,  households  are  in  the  midst  of repairing  balance  sheets  that  have been weakened by equity and housing losses and debt  accumulation.  Fiscal and monetary stimulus provide key drivers  for recovery this year.  Significant  slack in labor  and goods markets  will keep inflation low,  but well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid sustained deflation.

Respondent  15:

The consumer continues to be under considerable strain well into 2010  and possibly beyond,  facing  a weak labor market, high debt burdens, and tight credit conditions.  A renewed respect for economic uncertainty in the wake of the recession also produces a stronger precautionary saving motive further restraining consumer spending. Although  business  equipment  spending  recovers  in  2010,  many  firms  delay  purchases  to  await further resolution in demand uncertainty limiting the strength of the rebound compared to historical norms. Business spending on structures continues to contract in 2010 hampered by high vacancy rates and ongoing credit  problems  in  commercial  real  estate. The  robust  resumption  of foreign  growth,  notably  from  Asia, supports both strong export  and import growth in the near-term.

My forecast  assumes that  inflation  expectations  will  remain  'anchored'  near  current  levels  of roughly  2% throughout  the  forecast  period. However,  considerable  uncertainty  surrounds  this  assumption. Incoming data indicating further and substantial core price deceleration balances worries of an impending inflationary episode due to the Federal Reserve' s balance sheet  actions that could move expectations higher.

Respondent  16:

The influence of fiscal and monetary stimulus is expected to moderate during 2010 in an environment where the  supply of credit  to households  and small businesses remains constrained  as  banks  deal with continuing problems.  These  forces,  and ongoing uncertainty over the  general business environment,  will restrain busi­ ness  investment  and jobs  creation  relative  to  a  more  typical  recovery experience. In  addition,  I  anticipate an elevated personal savings rate that will dampen spending as households attempt to rebuild their balance sheets. I  assume  that  adverse  forces  affecting  economic  growth  over  the  medium-term  are  also  weighing, somewhat, on economic potential.

Respondent  17:

Recent developments have been encouraging,  but  much of the recent  growth impetus has come  from fiscal stimulus  and  a slowing rate of inventory liquidation,  which will carry us only so far.  Significant  retardants remain. For  example,  the  drag  from  delayed  losses  in  residential  real  estate  coupled  with  consumer  and commercial  real  estate  losses  threatens  to  delay  a  recovery  in  credit  availability,  and  the  uncertainty  cre­ ated by a plethora of new economic and regulatory initiatives is discouraging commitments to expansion of employment and CAPEX in the U.S.

Compared to  the  70%  confidence  intervals  indicated  for  the  Greenbook  forecasts,  the  differences  between the point estimates in the Greenbook baseline forecasts and my forecasts are not different in any meaningful statistical sense.  However the time path of my projections does differ from the Greenbook baseline, in that I see stronger near-term growth than that in the Greenbook baseline in 2010, slightly weaker real growth than the Greenbook in 2011 and real growth subsequently tapering off in 2012.  This contrasts with the higher real growth rates that  the  Greenbook shows in  2011  and  2012.  I  see inflation higher in the  intermediate period before  returning to the  rate that  I  believe is consistent  with  appropriate monetary policy.  In contrast,  the Greenbook forecast sees inflation declining and persisting at very low rates for  'an extended period'.

Respondent  3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

I  continue to be moderately more pessimistic on job creation,  with concomitant  effects on some other vari­ ables.

Respondent  5:

I  believe that we will need to be normalize policy sooner and more aggressively than in Greenbook.  Holding rates so low through late 2011  will invite asset imbalances and lead to a problematic rise in inflation expec­ tations  and,  eventually,  inflation. With  a  more  restrictive  fiscal  policy,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  will  be somewhat slower than in Greenbook and the unemployment rate will be somewhat higher.  Even with a less accommodative monetary policy, I expect inflation to be higher in 2011  and 2012.

Respondent  6:

slightly  slower  growth  and  lower  inflation. assumed  constant  exchange  rate  and  slight  uptilt  in  household saving rate.

Respondent  7:

We expect a somewhat slower recovery in activity and employment than in the Greenbook.  As concerns in­ flation,  we expect core inflation to be lower than in the Greenbook as a result of a more meaningful trade-off between inflation and unemployment.

Respondent  8:

Similar  to  the  Greenbook;  perhaps  slightly  more  pessimistic  in  the  near  term  due  to  concerns  about  the labor market  and bank credit.

Respondent  9:

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy the  public's  inflation  expectations  would  be  well  an­ chored,  and  the  inflation  path  would  be  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook. An  appropriate  monetary  policy might place policy rates on an upward trajectory by year-end.

Respondent  10:

N/A

Respondent  11:

Despite similar GDP growth forecast,  we do not  see the unemployment rate falling as sharply in 2012.  We are  putting  more  weight  on  the  possibility  that  the  erosion  of worker  skills  due  to  the  long  duration  of unemployment spells in this recession will prove a more persistent drag on labor markets than  assumed by the Greenbook.

Respondent  12:

My inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy and so I project a higher pace of inflation over 2010-2012 than does the Greenbook.  Given the strength of economic growth in my forecast  and the higher inflation path,  the  policy path is less  accommodative over the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent  13:

We assume lower inflation  persistence  than  does the  GB.  Thus,  for  our  medium-term inflation  outlook  we project inflation within the  'mandate-consistent'  range in late 2011  under the assumption of well-anchored inflation expectations.

Respondent  14:

My forecast is very similar to the Greenbook forecast.

Respondent  15:

My forecast calls for considerably slower growth in  2010  largely due  to  a weaker business fixed  investment profile.  Despite weaker growth,  my outlook entails higher core PCE inflation in the second half of 2010 and beyond.  My assumption of stable inflation expectations in the neighborhood of 2% and a notionally smaller measure  of excess  capacity  pulls  the  inflation  rate  upward  as  the  economy  recovers,  and  into  the  1.7-2% range by the end of 2012.

Respondent  16:

My forecast for unemployment and inflation is reasonably well aligned to the Greenbook baseline.  However, I  project  a  more  restrained  pace  of real  GDP  growth  that  is  reflected  across  most  expenditure  categories, and particularly business fixed investment,  where I judge uncertainties about the business environment  and access to credit to be especially constraining.

Respondent  17:

The Greenbook baseline forecast underestimates the drag on the economy arising from the uncertainty cre­ ated  by new economic  and regulatory initiatives.  It  does not  take into  account  inducements  deriving  from regulatory and taxation initiatives for corporations and investors to invest in more promising markets abroad at  the  expense of job creation and CAPEX at home.  It may also underestimate future upward pressure on commodity prices and headline inflation due to a strengthening world economy.

Recent  measures  of  economic  activity  appear  to  be  evolving  as  I  had  expected  in  my  projections  from last  quarter,  hence  I  have  not  revised  my  projected  path  of real  output  for  2010  . My  forecasts  for  the unemployment  rate  are  unchanged,  as  are  my  inflation  forecasts  (headline  and  Core  PCE)  for  2010  and beyond.

Respondent  3:

I  am more pessimistic about unemployment because I have been looking at the turnover data in JOLTS.

Respondent 4:

Continued overall improving trend over the last quarter strengthens my expectation of modestly above trend growth in 2010,  though the unexpectedly large GDP increase in Q4 has likely pulled some growth from the early part of 2010

Respondent  5:

My forecasts have not changed appreciably since the November FOMC meeting.  However,  there have been some minor timing changes.

Respondent  6:

no material difference.  economic activity and core inflation tracking reasonably closely to expectations.

Respondent  7:

There were only small changes to both the real and the inflation outlook.

Respondent  8:

Incoming data have generally been positive, making me slightly more optimistic and also a bit more confident about the outlook.  Financial markets generally continue to improve and the banking system is a bit stronger. My concerns  about  a jobless  recovery remain but  have  diminished somewhat,  since  firms have cut  costs  so deeply that they are likely to need to hire to meet new orders.

Respondent  9:

My forecast is very similar to the one submitted last  fall.  One small change is that  PCE inflation is higher early this year due to energy prices.

Respondent  13:

Releases  since  the  end  of  October  were  on  net  broadly  consistent  with  our  central  scenario. The  most

significant  changes in the output  forecast were produced by the revisions to labor compensation in the first half of 2009.  For our inflation forecast the main change was in our assessment of the upside risks to inflation. The  level  of concern  about  the  potential  inflationary  impact  of large  government  deficits  and  an  enlarged Federal  Reserve  balance  sheet  has  lead  us  to  increase  the  level  of  inflation  associated  with  a  temporary unanchoring of inflation expectations.

Respondent  14:

Since  October,  economic  news  and  financial  conditions  have  been  about  what  I  had  anticipated,  and  my forecasts for real activity and inflation are little changed.

Respondent  15:

A quicker resolution of the inventory cycle compared to my previous outlook shifts some GDP growth from the  first  half  of  2010  into  the  fourth  quarter  of  2009. The  underlying  weaknesses  that  I  had  previously identified remain,  and will likely produce a weaker recovery relative to historical norms.

Respondent  16:

I  have  pushed up my growth estimate for the  fourth quarter of 2009 on the basis of the  stronger Incoming data. As  a  result,  I  have  also  marginally increased  my  real  GDP growth  forecast  relative  to  the  previous quarter's projection.

Respondent  17:

Recent reports confirm growth in household incomes and consumer purchases, the stabilization of residential investment, the beginnings of an upturn in business equipment and software investment,  and the elimination of the negative  growth contribution  from cuts in business inventories.  Job cuts  and the  tightening of bank lending standards may soon be ending.  Consequently, the near-term outlook for real activity has brightened.
