NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The November projections were made in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on November 1-2, 2011.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER  OR LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estimate of the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include  below  any other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

By  2016, the unemployment  rate  is  about  one  percentage  point  above  the  assumed  NAIRU,  and  inflation remains  below  the  2  percent  target. Convergence  to  full  employment  and  to  the  2  percent  inflation  target rate  is expected  to  take  6  to  7  years.

Respondent 2:

Respondent 3:

I believe the  convergence process  will  take  more than about five or six years. I think  convergence  could  take two  more  years  -  to  2018.

Respondent 4:

Can't be precise. It will take  more than 5  to 6 years for unemployment to reach its long  run value. Inflation will be  close  to its long-run  value  over  the  next  2-3  years.

Respondent 8:

I expect the  convergence process will be  only  slightly  faster than in the long-run Tealbook projection. That is, it will  likely  to  take  almost  a  decade  for  the  large  unemployment  and  output  gaps  to  completely  close  and for PCEPI  inflation  to  converge  to  its  long-run  target  of  2  percent.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

I anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  will  be  shorter  than  5-6 years, likely  on the  order  of 4 years. Similarly,  and quite possibly  even quicker, I  think inflation  will  converge to 2 percent.

Respondent 12:

Our  current  estimate  of the economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  in the 2%  to 1 2 2 %  range. By  2017-18  we anticipate  potential  growth  of  around  2 1 4 %. A reasonable  estimate  of  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is 4% to 6%.  Assuming appropriate policy and  no further significant shocks, we expect the unemployment rate to be  in this range  and  the  output  gap  to  be  around  zero  by  2017-18.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis and  that  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective  is  and  will  remain  at  about  2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around 2.5%  for the CPI.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  be  near  zero,  we  expect inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  around  2%  in  2017-18.

Respondent 13:

The unemployment  and inflation rates might not  converge to their long-run values until late in the  5-6 year window.

Respondent 14:

Full  convergence  may  well  take  six  years,  but  may  take  place  at  a  faster  pace  than  I  earlier  anticipated.

Growth  has  surprised  to  the  downside  consistently,  suggesting  that  we  do  not  fully  understand  the  restraints on growth. No postwar  US  recession is comparable. Depth  of decline in employment,  unusual  degree  of long-term  unemployment  and  part-time  employment  make  labor  market  hard  to  forecast. Fiscal policy is very  unsettled. In all, uncertainty with  respect to GDP  and  unemployment is higher than normal.  Core PCE inflation is not particularly uncertain; although  the  output  gap  is hard  to measure,  inflation expectations are well anchored  and  core  inflation  has  in  fact  been  quite  stable. PCE  inflation  is  affected  by  commodity prices and thus global demand  conditions; although commodity  prices have been somewhat  more  stable recently,  both  economic  and  noneconomic  forces  could  contribute  to  volatility  in  the  prices  of  oil  and  other key  commodities.

The  possibility  that  the  European  debt  crisis  is  not  resolved  in  an  orderly  fashion  is  a  concern. It remains the case that the effect of the extraordinary monetary  policy in place and uncertainties surrounding  the future path of policy, including  the timing  of the  exit from  accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty around  my  inflation  forecast.

Our base case assumes a relatively modest impact of developments  in Europe  on activity in the United States  and  that there will  not be a  major U.S. fiscal  consolidation over the projection period. However, there are significant  downside  risks  in  these  dimensions. In addition,  like  the  Tealbook,  we  assume  that  potential

output growth is recovering  from  sup-par rates over the past  several years. This recovery  might be impaired if we  have  underestimated  the  damage  to  labor  quality  from  increased  long-term  unemployment.

Respondent 14:

Respondent 15:

The risks to GDP growth  and  unemployment appear broadly  balanced.  While risks  emanating  from Europe and  emerging  markets pose  downside risks to  growth (upside risks to unemployment), the resilience  of the U.S.  economy and  signs  of improvement  among labor  market indicators  and  consumer  sentiment pose upside risks to the growth  outlook (downside risks to unemployment). The risks to inflation on net are skewed to the  upside. While  there  are  near-term  downside  risks  to  inflation  as  temporary  factors  unwind,  the  current highly  accommodative stance  of  monetary policy  and long-term  fiscal imbalances  pose  much larger upside risks to inflation  farther  out  on  the  horizon.

Respondent 16:

N/A

Respondent 17:

I view  the  risks  to  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside  in  the  medium  run  and  over  the  longer  term.

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

The baseline forecast is  conditioned  on  $500 billion of additional purchases  of mortgage-backed  securities in the Spring  of  2012. As the  crisis in Europe intensifies,  another round  of  asset purchases  of  similar  magnitude is undertaken  later  in  the  year. The  Federal  Reserve's  holdings  of  securities  start  to  decline  only  after  the lift off of the  federal  funds  rate  from  the  zero  lower  bound,  which  is  expected  to  occur  in  2015.

Respondent 9: Yes

I believe  that  it is desirable  for  the  Committee  to  engage  in  further  asset  purchases. Even  with  the  federal funds  rate held at zero through  2015, my  forecast, like that in the Tealbook,  envisions  unemployment  remaining  well above  NAIRU  and inflation running  below the  Committee's 2 percent target. Projected  misses in the same direction with respect to both of the Committee's objectives implies that additional policy stimulus is appropriate as long as policy actions are available whose  costs do not exceed their projected benefits. A program  of  additional  MBS  purchases  is  warranted,  in  my  view,  unless  incoming  data  lead  to significant upward  revisions  to the forecast in the months  ahead. My  forecast  incorporates  a $500 billion purchase program. Given that my  forecast still envisions a prolonged period of high unemployment  and inflation  below  target,  there  exists  some  case  for  a  larger  program.

Respondent 10: Yes

I believe that it will optimal to initiate  exit  more rapidly  than is  contemplated by  the Tealbook. In particular, my optimal path of  monetary policy, given my  current forecast, involves stopping  re-investment in  early 2013  and  initiating  asset  sales  in  mid-2014.

I should emphasize that I  am  assuming  that  market participants' beliefs are shaped by  my preferred optimal plan,  not  the  Committee's.

Respondent 11: Yes

My  view is that the FOMC  should begin reducing  the SOMA portfolio in  advance  of raising  the federal funds rate target. My judgment is that the federal funds rate should be increased in late  2013. Thus, reducing  the SOMA  portfolio  should  begin  in  early  2013.

Respondent 12: Yes

Because  of the  continued  strains in  financial  conditions (despite  official  actions to  address  the  concerns related to the  more dire  outcomes  of the European  debt crisis), a weaker foreign  economic  outlook, prospects for greater fiscal drag in 2013, and  indications  of ongoing  caution  from  both  households  and  business, we believe that additional monetary  accommodation  is necessary to lead to outcomes for economic growth, unemployment, and inflation that are fairly close to our rather tepid projections from November. Such accommodation  also  provides  some  additional  insurance  against  some  of  the  downside  risks  to  our  outlook. To provide that accommodation,  we  assume  a  $500  billion MBS  purchase  program,  beginning  in  2012Q2 through  the  end  of  2013Q1.

Respondent 13: No

N/A

Respondent 14: Yes

I am  very  skeptical  of  the usefulness  of additional  purchases  of  Treasury  securities  and  of  ongoing  changes to the maturity  distribution  of our Treasury  portfolio. As I think it desirable to begin raising short-term interest  rates  substantially  earlier  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  I  also  think  it  desirable  to  begin  shrinking the balance  sheet  earlier  than  is assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  in  order  to  minimize  the  period  over  which remittances  might  be  pushed  to  zero.

Respondent 15: Yes

Because  my  view  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  includes  an  earlier  liftoff from  zero for the federal funds rate, I  would also start the normalization process  for the balance sheet  earlier than in the Tealbook, in line with  the  exit  strategy  principles  agreed  upon  by  the  FOMC  in  June  2011.

Respondent 16: Yes

Following  the  Committee's  exit  principles  adopted  last  year,  I  would  commence  balance  sheet  adjustments later than  contemplated  in  the  Tealbook,

Respondent 17: Yes

If the incoming data  are  consistent  with  my forecast, I  would  want to  consider  ending  the  maturity  extension program  earlier  than  the  end  of  June. Because  my  funds  rate  path  is  steeper  than  in  the  Tealbook,  I  would anticipate that following  the  Committee's exit strategy principles would  mean that we would  reduce the size of the  balance  sheet  more  quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Key Factors Informing Your Judgments Regarding the Appropriate Path of the Federal Funds Rate

3(c).  Please describe the key factors informing your judgments regarding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate.  You may include any comments on appropriate monetary policy here as well.

Respondent 1:

The path for the federal funds rate is informed by an objective function that balances the dual mandate's inflation and employment objectives. This projected path for the federal funds rate takes into account additional stimulus over the course of this year, in the form of $1 trillion of asset purchases.

Respondent 2:

While unemployment is likely to remain elevated, I expect that it will be appropriate to begin raising the target for the federal funds rate in mid-2014 to prevent inflation from rising above levels consistent with price stability. Despite today's very weak economy, the underlying inflation rate is not very far below 2 percent.  By 2014, the economy will have recovered enough that preserving the stability of long-term inflation expectations and, in turn, inflation will warrant some tightening of monetary policy.  This view of the appropriate path of policy reflects the importance I place on keeping the underlying inflation rate close to 2 percent, to preserve our credibility and to maintain price stability.

Respondent 3:

Pushing off lift-off until 2016 provides additional monetary accommodation and improves outcomes relative to the statutory mandate.

Respondent 4:

Forecast embodies continued slow acceleration in growth, inflation at target.   A modest increase in the funds rate in 2015 is roughly what is implied by Taylor (1999).  The late 2015 date lies between the predictions of the outcome-based estimated rule and the optimal control simulation.

Respondent 5:

Computed using a forecast-based Taylor rule consistent with the projections I submitted for this meeting.  I impose an inflation objective of 2.0 percent.

Respondent 6:

In order to keep inflation near 2 percent, I believe we will need to begin to move the funds rate towards its longer run level in 2013, despite the persistence of significant 'slack' in the economy.

Respondent 7:

Underlying strength of the economy is greater than the baseline but not as strong as the faster snap-back scenario. Using Taylor 99 rule for the fed funds path results in values similar to the faster snapback scenario in the Tealbook.

Respondent 8:

Large and persistent output and unemployment gaps coupled with very moderate inflation call for continuing very accommodative monetary policy through late 2014.

Respondent 9:

My policy path is designed to push out market expectations concerning the onset of policy firming until late 2015. I have also incorporated an assumption of further MBS purchases into my policy path.  The onset of policy

I believe that additional stimulus, over and above what would be called for by the tightening occurs at a slightly lower unemployment rate than would be called for by the Taylor (1999) rule but slightly sooner than would occur under a fully optimal policy with commitment.  With inflation of 1.7%, Taylor (1999) calls for liftoff when the unemployment rate is about 7.0%.  I would defer liftoff until unemployment has declined to around 6.5%.  I also assume a slightly shallower path of tightening for several years than would be called for by Taylor 1999. Taylor (1999) benchmark, is appropriate under conditions in which monetary policy has been long constrained by the zero lower bound.  In particular, substituting future policy accommodation for the easing that would have occurred in the absence of the lower bound is a strategy that has been studied in the research literature (e.g. Reifschneider and Williams) and it could prove effective in promoting a somewhat stronger recovery.  A strategy of holding the funds rate below values that are called for by a rule such as Taylor 1999 as the recovery proceeds is appropriate in light of asymmetric downside risks to the forecast.

Respondent 10:

According to Taylor (1999), such a fall should result in a decrease in accommodation equivalent to a Over the course of 2012, I'm expecting the unemployment rate to fall by 50 basis points (from 2011:Q4 to 2012:Q4). 100 basis points increase in the fed funds rate (given an Okun's Law coefficient of 2).  I'm achieving that reduction in accommodation over the course of the year in two ways: increasing the fed funds rate by 50 basis points, and reducing the length of time over which the Fed plans to hold its securities.

Respondent 11:

Assuming appropriate policy and my forecast of above-trend growth in the near term, my judgment is that the federal funds rate should be increased in late 2013.

Respondent 12:

Over the near to medium term, the path and composition of the SOMA will be a factor influencing our assessment of the appropriate path for the target federal funds rate (FFR).  As stated in the economic projections, we assume that the Federal Reserve will initiate a new $500 billion MBS purchase program in 2012Q2 that will last approximately one year.

The crucial factors behind our assessment of the appropriate path for monetary policy and the FFR are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook.  Some indicators of economic and financial conditions have improved since the November trial run, and we see previous policy accommodation as a contributing factor to this improvement.  Nevertheless, we still see the combination of substantial resource underutilization; a forecast of slow growth, high unemployment, and below-objective inflation; and downside risks to the real activity and medium-term inflation outlooks as calling for continued policy accommodation.  In the current environment where the policy rate is constrained by the zero lower bound and the financial system remains somewhat impaired, such accommodation will lead to the target FFR remaining near zero until late 2014.  We expect that long-term inflation expectations will remain anchored over this period. The pace of renormalization of the target FFR following the period of near zero policy rates will depend upon our assessment of economic conditions and inflation expectations as well as upon credit spreads and overall financial conditions.

An important factor informing our assessment of the appropriate path for the target FFR is our estimate of the equilibrium real short-term interest rate.  In normal times, we assume that the equilibrium real rate is in the range of 1% - 3%; adding our objective for inflation (2%) then gives our estimate of the longer-run rate given in the table above.  However, given the weak state of the economy and continued strained financial conditions, our assessment of the current equilibrium real rate, and thus the 'neutral' FFR, is below that range and is expected to remain so for some time.

Respondent 13:

My appropriate policy is premised on a loss function which equally weights deviations of inflation from target and unemployment from its natural rate.  I maintain a flexible inflation targeting framework, in which a deviation in inflation or unemployment from its longer-run goal could be allowed in order to facilitate a more prompt closure in an outsized or persistent deviation in the other objective.

We assume that the economic outlook will justify that the period of exceptionally low policy rates will run well into 2015.  Our projection is that the unemployment rate will fall below 7 percent sometime in the first half of 2015, but that the outlook for inflation over the medium-term would not require policy lift off until late in the year.

In addition to low rates, we assume that appropriate policy will incorporate forward guidance that ties changes in the policy rate to economic outcomes.  Such forward guidance may need to be complemented by additional asset purchases if, as we move through the forecast period, progress towards our policy objective is slower than anticipated.

Respondent 14:

At the December FOMC meeting, I spoke to my concerns about the proposed expansion of the SEP exercise to include funds rate projections.

To summarize, I believe that the exercise risks damaging our credibility and is more likely to confuse private-sector decision makers than to provide useful guidance on the future conduct of monetary policy.

I agree that monetary policy should be based on the state of the economy, and should not be time dependent (e.g. stating that we expect interest rates will remain low at least until mid 2013, an initiative I argued against). Yet I also recognize that forecasting the likely state of the economy-- even one year forward but especially over the intermediate and longer time intervals--is largely guesswork, informed by models of various degrees of sophistication at the Board, the twelve Federal Reserve Banks, and the private sector, all of which have poor records.

Moreover, not all policy-relevant economic variables are included in the SEP, making it unrealistic to expect the public to draw valid inferences about the future conduct of policy from the funds-rate paths that are to be reported.  The inference problem is exacerbated by the zero bound and the fact that the SEP policy paths will not be linked to specific projections of real activity and inflation.

In the corporate world, any CEO will tell you that providing "forward guidance" is vexing; at best, they might get it correct for the next quarter; at worst they manage to their guidance and can miss opportunities for fear of disappointing "the Street". To be sure, there are some corporations that have internal exercises that forecast out three years but as one of the most prominent of the former champions of this exercise at one of the largest and richest corporations admonished me this week, "what happens is that even with all the sophistication and economic expertise we can buy, you end up projecting forward a bias shaped by the current economy; in the end, the projections have to be re-based frequently. You then have to spend time explaining publically why you were wrong and what you missed, taking your eye off what you actually do rather than what you said you would do." Nearly every CEO I have talked to in preparing for the January FOMC, echoed this warning, unsolicited: to a person, they think we have lost our marbles. Our job of forecasting forward is even harder than that of an Exxon or a WalMart: they at least have control over many of the variables they work with. The business leaders I talk to are amused that we somehow think we can do a better job in providing forward guidance than can the very best run corporations in the country.

I submit the requested projections with the misgivings articulated above.

For the purpose of this exercise I assume that the funds rate is governed by a Taylor rule keyed to movements in the unemployment rate and inflation. Barring some dramatic exogenous shock, the rule suggests that it will become appropriate to begin moving the funds rate upward sometime during 2012.  This prescription accords with my belief that zero-bound interest rates are distorting savings and investment decisions in the economy and are having a perverse impact on the banking system without stimulating economic activity.

Respondent 15:

recovery that reduces unemployment.  To preempt the Key factors informing my judgments regarding the appropriate path of monetary policy are achieving an inflation objective of 2 percent and ensuring a sustainable economic potential for rising inflationary pressures and the buildup of risks in the financial system that could impede the achievement of these goals, I currently anticipate it will be necessary to begin removing accommodation in the first half of 2013.

Respondent 16:

Continued relatively slow pace of recovery, combined with expectation of fiscal consolidation.

Respondent 17:

Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation. Economic growth will be slightly above trend in 2012 and beyond and unemployment will decline slowly. The Committee will find it necessary to adjust policies to prevent inflation from rising above its target.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook.

Respondent 1:

Recent  data remain  consistent with an economy  growing  at  a pace close to potential. As a result, scope for further improvements in the labor  market remains limited. Households' income  growth has  been  disappointing  of late, and  this, together  with  unfavorable  developments  in  households'  net  worth  in  the  first half of this year, is expected  to restrain spending  in the near term. The  limited scope for monetary  and fiscal policy actions in Europe  is likely to induce  a noticeably  more  severe  Euro-area  recession  than  what financial  markets  are  currently  pricing  in. In the  coming  months,  we  thus  expect  an  increase  in  uncertainty and  risk premia, in the  context of a still fragile U.S. recovery. The worsening of financial  conditions prompts two  rounds  of  monetary  policy  stimulus  this  year,  which  we  have  embedded  in  our  baseline  forecast. This additional  stimulus is  expected to lower the unemployment rate by  roughly half of  one percentage point over the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon.

We continue to expect an acceleration in the pace of growth starting in 2013, as the crisis in Europe moderates  and  credit  supply  constraints  recede. However,  the  speed  of the recovery  is tepid by historical standards  as  fiscal policy remains  contractionary. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  reach  about  7.5 percent by  the end of  2014. With  considerable slack in the labor  market, inflation is subdued over the  course of the  forecast  horizon.

Risks to the projection for real activity remain highly skewed to the downside. The baseline forecast is predicated  on  a  pessimistic  outlook  for  Europe. The  recession  in  Europe  has  increased  the  risks  of  a  disorderly  sovereign default  and/or the failure of a large financial institution significantly. The potential downside risks to the real outlook also remain  costlier than the potential upside risks. Ongoing developments in Europe run  counter  to  the  view  that  fiscal  contractions  are  expansionary,  and  any  worsening  of  the  economy  in  the current  situation  would  be  aggravated  by  the  limited  scope  for  further  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  actions. Moreover,  tensions  with  Iran  could  lead  to  disruptions  in  oil  markets  that  would  threaten  the  stable  outlook for oil prices that underpins  our baseline forecast. This outcome  is not as unlikely as we had previously thought.

Respondent 2:

I expect  the  economy  to  recover  at  a  slow  to moderate  rate  from  2012  through  2014,  reflecting  a  range  of forces. The  positive  forces  include  considerable  monetary  stimulus  and  the  economy's  usual  self-correcting forces. The  negative  forces  include: consumer  de-leveraging;  the  struggles  of  the  housing  sector; cutbacks in state and local government  spending; and uncertainty about the effects of a recession in Europe, the resolution  of  federal,  state,  and  local  budget  problems,  and  the  regulatory  environment.

In this environment, I expect inflation to remain at or below 2 percent from 2012 through 2014. This projection reflects incoming  inflation data for a broad  range of products  that have been soft, commodity prices that  are no longer  trending  higher,  stable  inflation  expectations,  and  wage  growth  that  continues  to be moderate. With the job  market  still  weak, there is unlikely  to be much  wage  or inflation pressure over the  next  couple  of  years.

I continue  to  see  the  outlook  for  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  as  highly  uncertain. The  key  risk  to growth (downside) and  unemployment (upside)  is a  severe recession in Europe and the additional financial stress the recession  would  cause. For  inflation, the weakness  of  the  economy  could  create  more  disinflation than  expected. On  the  other  hand,  the  potential  for  renewed  volatility  of  commodity  prices  and  extremely accommodative  monetary  policy  are  upside  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 3:

While  some  data  sets  indicate  better  growth  in  the  economy, others  indicate  that growth  remain  sub  par. Growth  in  consumption,  while  modestly  higher  than  expected,  continues  to  not  be  supported  by  the  fundamentals  of  higher  disposable  real  income. In fact, disposable  real  income  edged  down  .5%  in  the  second quarter  of 2011  and  2%  in the third quarter  of 2011. Consumer  sentiment  has  improved  from  its  historic lows,  but  remains  pessimistic. Home  equity  values  remain  depressed,  and  non  monetary  policy  obstacles  to refinancing  remain  attenuating  factors  in  translating  home  wealth  into  greater  consumption. Accordingly, the  engine  for  further  growth  does  not  yet  seem  to  be  propelled  by  sustainable  consumption.

At the time of this current projection, I am concerned about higher oil prices which could further hurt income, demand  and  GDP.  I  also  am  concerned  about  a  renewed  worsening  of  the  European  crisis  which could further  exacerbate the risks  of a European  recession  and lead to further drops in  our  ability  to  drive growth  through  greater  net  exports.

In terms of relative bright spots, state and local government  payrolls, which remain pressured, may  begin  to stabilize  in  2012  as  tax  receipts  increase,  stimulus  measures  stop  their  phase  out  and  house  prices  hit bottom. These  factors  could  bring  state  and  local  payroll  cuts  to  an  end  in  2012,  although  any  meaningful growth  in  this  segment  of  the  labor  market  may  not  occur  until  2013  or  2014.

Respondent 4:

Although recent news  regarding GDP  and employment has been  somewhat better, much of the strength of Q4  reflects factors that are temporary  or  likely  to  be temporary,  including  increased  inventory  investment and  a  significant  increase  in  auto  sales. Growth  in  the  near  term  is  still  likely  to  be  restrained  by  problems in financial  and  credit  markets (notably, in Europe)  and in the housing  market. Consumer  spending looks likely to continue  at  a  moderate  pace  -  although  household  fundamentals  have  improved  since  last  summer (sentiment up, wealth  up, labor  market a bit better,  some deleveraging accomplished), household income  and employment  expectations remain downbeat and  strength of durables purchases won't be  continued.  Business sentiment  has  also  improved  somewhat  but  firms  do  not  see  much  need  to  expand  capacity. Fiscal factors are becoming  an  increasing  drag,  global  growth  and  thus  US  exports  are  slowing  somewhat. As  mentioned, Europe poses  significant downside risks -  although the news  there is a little better lately, fundamental problems have not been solved.  Commodity prices are down (though still high in absolute terms), which is a boost. Unemployment is closely tied to overall growth,  and indeed has been  slightly better than  one would expect  given the pace of the expansion. Going  forward,  unemployment  should  fall  faster  than  implied  by Okun's  Law because  of the phasing  out  of EEB.

Core inflation is receding as expected, as commodity  price passthrough wanes and special factors (e.g., auto  prices)  unwind. Uncertainty  about  commodity  prices  translates  into  uncertainty  about  headline  inflation, although  the  expected  commodity  price  profile  seems  relatively  flat  and  volatility  has  been  somewhat less lately. Factors  affecting  core inflation, including  slack, unit labor costs, other  costs, inflation expectations,  are  all suggesting  that  inflation  will  be  quite  tame,  barring  much  faster  growth  or  a  commodity  price spike  that  passes  through  to  the  core.

Respondent 5:

Deleveraging is  continuing  and holding down the  economy's performance.  Uncertainty about the outlook and other  concerns  are  restraining  household  and  business  confidence. Demand  for  labor  and  capital  expansion have been especially  hard-hit. The slowdown in Europe  combined with shifts in the growth  and  composition of emerging  economies  is  restraining  demand  for  U.S.  exports.

Nevertheless,  the  economy  is  well  on  the  way  to  recovery  and  economic  activity  is  strengthening  as  a  result. Jobs  growth  is  slowly  improving.

Price pressures have eased recently, in part because  of declining commodity  costs during the second half

of 2011. Wage  growth  remains  moderate  and  inflation  expectations  appear  to  be  reasonably  well  anchored. As a result, my  outlook for inflation remains steady  at,  or slightly  below 2 percent over the forecast horizon.

My  assessment of the risk to the growth outlook has improved some since my last forecast submission, but still remains weighted to the downside as a result of potential adverse developments  in Europe  and energy  markets.

Regarding  inflation,  I  see  the  risks  as  being  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 6:

Growth  in the second half of the 2011 was notably above growth  in the first half. The  firming we have seen in the labor market,  along  with  improving  consumer  confidence,  will  support  a  gradual  improvement in consumer  spending. Business  fixed investment  should  continue  to  expand. Although  excess  inventories continue  to  weigh  on  the  single-family  housing  market,  modest  expansion  is  occurring  in  multi-family  construction  and  in home  improvements. Government  consumption  and  investment  will  be  held  down  by  the dismal  budget  outlook.

Respondent 7:

Underlying  strength  of  the  economy  is  greater  than  the  baseline  but  not  as  strong  as  the  faster  snap-back scenario. Using  Taylor 99 rule for the fed funds path  results in values similar to the faster snapback  scenario in the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8:

The  economic recovery  appears to be proceeding, but  at a disappointing pace. Continuing  monetary  stimulus, improvements  in banking and financial market conditions, and improvements  in household balance sheets  should  support  a  moderate  expansion  over  the  next  few  years,  even  as  fiscal  policy  at  all  levels  turns increasingly contractionary. Still, it will take years of above-trend growth to return the economy  to full employment. In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  will keep underlying  cost and  inflation pressures  low. In addition, well-anchored  inflation  expectations  should  help  avoid  significant pass-through  of  any  volatility  in  food  and  energy  prices  to  wage  and  prices  inflation  more  generally.

Respondent 9:

U.S.  economic  growth  has  strengthened  somewhat  in  recent  months  and  the  labor  market  shows  some  improvement. In part, recent  growth  has  benefitted  from  a  reversal  of  the  temporary  factors  that  weighed  on activity earlier in the year. Even  so, unemployment  remains  exceptionally  high  and  the  pace  of  growth  is disappointingly  slow. My  forecast  for growth  going  forward  is  that  it will be weak-barely  at  trend  during 2012 and strengthening only gradually over time as the effects of the financial crisis ebb and household deleveraging proceeds. Persistent factors weighing on growth  include numerous  impediments  to  recovery in the housing sector, a shift from fiscal stimulus to fiscal drag, continued sluggishness in nonresidential construction  and  state and local spending,  and  weakness in foreign growth, particularly  in Europe, that will take  a toll on  U.S.  export  growth. I anticipate  the  sovereign  debt  crisis  in  Europe  will  continue  to  produce strains  in  financial  markets  for  a  long  time  to  come. It is difficult  to rule  out  extremely  disruptive  scenarios which  could  trigger  a  financial  crisis. I therefore  see  exceptionally  large  downside  risks  to  my  forecast. At  a minimum,  continued uncertainty about Europe  and  the path of fiscal policy  are likely  to have a chilling effect on  investment. Inflation  has  come  down  considerably  over  the  last  six  months  as  the  impact  of  commodity prices and supply disruptions has ebbed  and  is now  running  at levels below  2%. With  a continued  large output  gap  and  slack  in  the  labor  market,  I  anticipate  that  inflation  will  be  under  2%  for  the  next  several years. With  downside risks to my forecast for growth, I consider the risks pertaining to inflation to be weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 10:

Growth  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  both  demand  and  supply  forces. On  the  demand  side,  household

spending  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  the  significant  loss  of  wealth  and  net  worth. On  the  supply  side, there have been significant changes relative to four years  ago. Firms are finding  it harder to find appropriate workers. Entrepreneurs  lack  resources  to  initiate  start-ups,  which  robs  the  economy  of  an  important  source of employment  growth. The  high level of corporate  profits suggests that firms enjoy more  market  power, which  reduces  labor demand. Finally, of course, there is considerable  uncertainty  about  future  taxes  and regulations.

Both demand  and supply forces push up -temporarily -on the unemployment  rate. They operate in opposite directions on inflation, and the upward  impact  of the supply considerations on inflation can be amplified  by  downward  real  wage  rigidities.

If low demand  alone  were  responsible  for  the  elevated  unemployment  rate,  I  believe  that  current  and  past inflation rates would have been  considerably  lower than what we've  seen. Hence, I  tend  to put  more weight on  the  supply  effects  that  I've  listed  above  than  does  the  Tealbook. As  a result, my  forecast  for  inflation  is higher  than  that  in  the  Tealbook.

Several  of  the  supply  side  forces  that  I  mention  will  result  in  a  permanently  lower  level  of  the  employmentpopulation  ratio.

Respondent 11:

The improvement in the labor  market  - job growth and  reduced unemployment  - is the key to my  view that the  economy  has  momentum  and  that  the  convergence  to  steady  state  is  well  underway.

Respondent 12:

Although  some  recent  economic indicators have been a bit  stronger than they have been, the  economic data still  generally point to  only  a gradual improvement in  real  economic  conditions. We project real GDP growth of around  3%  to  3 1 2 % (annual  rate)  in  2011Q4,  which  would  be  the  best  performance  since  the  first  half  of 2010. However, our projection of real final sales growth is only  around 2 1 4 % (annual rate), which is  actually slightly  less  than  the  average  of  2011Q2  and  2011Q3. The  continued  tepid  final  sales  growth  reflects  ongoing caution  from  both  households  and  businesses.

Similarly, while there has been some improvement  in labor market conditions, it has been gradual and there  remains  considerable  slack  in  the  labor  market. The  unemployment  rate  has  declined  0.5  percentage point  in  the  past  three  months,  aggregate  hours  worked  rose  smartly  in  2011Q4,  and  payroll  growth  picked up in December.  Even  so, wage  growth  remained  subdued  and  the labor force participation rate (particularly in the  25-54  age  group)  as  well  as  the  employment-population  ratio  remained  at  weak  levels,  indicating  that conditions  remain  far  from  satisfactory.

Financial conditions also have improved from November, which probably reflect that official actions-the changes  in  the  conditions  of  the  foreign  currency  swap  lines,  the  3-year  LTROs  offered  by  the  ECB,  and  reductions in the ECB policy rate-have reduced  momentarily  the perceived probability  of  market participants of a more  dire outcome  in the European  debt  crisis. Nevertheless, indicators of dollar funding pressures remain strained and susceptible to changes in sentiment about official commitments. Moreover, the low nominal  yields  of longer-term  U.S.  and  German  government  debt  suggest  that  financial  market  conditions remain  tenuous.

Against this backdrop, there are two major factors that influence our outlook: the path of fiscal policy and  the  foreign  economic  outlook,  particularly  that  of  Europe.

As far as fiscal policy, we now assume that the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment  benefits will be extended  for all of 2012. Nevertheless, the stance of fiscal policy at the federal level has become contractionary. We  expect  that  it  will  exert  a  significant  drag  in  2013  as  the  payroll  tax  cut  and  emergency

unemployment  benefits expire that year, and federal spending remains constrained. Beyond  2013, fiscal policy is still expected to exert  some  drag because of  constraints on spending, but we expect that drag to be  less than  in  2013. The  decline  in  state  and  local  government  spending  and  employment  has  continued  in recent  months,  although  we  envision  this  decline  ending  soon. However,  a  greater  fiscal  consolidation  at  the federal  as  well  as  the  state  and  local  levels  is  a  risk to our  outlook.

Our foreign  economic  outlook has deteriorated  some since November.  In particular, we now expect a mild  recession in the  euro  area  as a  consequence  of the debt  crisis  and increased  austerity  measures in  many  nations in the area. There  have  also  been  signs  of slowing  in some  emerging  market  countries. To  this point  U.S. export  performance  has  been  strong,  but  these  developments  can  be  expected  to  have  some  adverse  impact on  exports. Moreover, a further significant deterioration in the foreign  outlook, particularly in Europe,  could have  significant economic  and  financial  market  spillovers  on  the  U.S.  economy  that  represent  a  significant risk to our  outlook.

With  this background, we believe that the economy  continues to face significant near-term impediments to a robust  recovery. In our  modal  forecast,  we  anticipate  growth  of  real  GDP  of  about  2 1 4 % (annual  rate) over  the  first half of 2012,  slightly  less  than  that  over  the  second  half  of  2011. Then,  as  the  year  progresses and  the impediments to growth gradually  recede, growth is  expected to rise to  around 3% (annual rate) over the  second  half  of  2012.

As the economy  enters  2013, we expect the US  economy  will have entered a more  self-sustaining growth phase,  assisted by  the additional  monetary  accommodation from  our  assumed MBS purchase program.  Foreign GDP  growth  should  pick  up  as  the  fiscal  crisis  in  the  euro  area  reaches  a  more  permanent  resolution. Domestic  credit  supply  conditions  will  have  significantly  improved, helping  to promote  stronger  growth  of many  components of  expenditures. Combined, these forces  could be  expected to  generate well above potential growth  given  the  large  amount  of  slack  we  still  see. However,  the  outlook  for  2013  is  clouded  by  the  fact that while it is likely  that fiscal policy will  exert a  substantial drag  on growth, the  amount  and  composition of that drag is unknown  at  this time, but we assume  fiscal drag in 2013 will be in the order of about 1 percent  of  GDP.  Under  these  assumptions,  real  GDP  growth  is  expected  to  be  around  3 1 4 % (Q4/Q4).  With impediments to growth  receding further  and  somewhat less fiscal drag, real GDP growth in  2014 is projected to be  somewhat higher. Because of the risks previously cited, the balance of risks to  our real  activity  outlook is to the  downside.

With growth  expected to be significantly  above our  estimate of the  economy's potential growth  rate starting in  2012H2, we should  see a  more pronounced decline of the unemployment  rate, which  we expect will  average about  8%  in 2012Q4. It is then  expected  to  fall  to  around  7 1 2 %  in  2013Q4  and  finally  fall  below  7%  by  the end  of  2014.

Regarding the inflation outlook, the economy continues to have a large amount of slack. Once again, this large amount  of  slack is showing  through  in  the trend inflation data. After rising in the first half of 2011-reflecting  some pass through of higher  commodity prices, rapidly  rising import prices, and  temporarily large increases of  motor vehicle prices  associated with  supply disruptions-inflation has slowed over the  second half of  2011 such  that in the fourth quarter the  core PCE deflator rose  at just a 0.9% annual rate. Because of the  continued impact of this slack, we expect the four-quarter percent change of the  core PCE deflator to bottom  out  around  1%  in  mid-2012  and  then  begin  edging  higher,  reaching  around  1 1 4 %  by  2012Q4. Then as slack dissipates  and inflation expectations remain well  anchored, PCE inflation should  rise to just above in 2013  and  2%  in  2014. Largely  reflecting  the  downside  risks  to  the  real  activity  outlook,  the  balance of risks to our  inflation  outlook  also  is  to  the  downside. 1 1 2 %

Respondent 13:

While  overall  economic  activity  has  improved  in  the  second  half  of  2011, we  have  yet to see a breakout  in household  or business  spending-growth  appears to be recovering  to rates  only  modestly above  our view of

potential (which is  similar to the Tealbook's). The list  of headwinds  contributing  to the disappointing pace of recovery  is  familiar.

In the absence of a major shock and with support from accommodative  monetary  policy, we expect the recovery  to gain  momentum as we move through  2012 and  2013.  The financial repair process  will  eventually reach the point that households  will feel confident enough  to pick up their pace of spending, including a more  pronounced  increase  in  housing  markets. Once  businesses  see  such  stronger  household  spending,  there should  be  a  commensurate  increase  in  BFI  and  hiring.

Our  forecast is premised  on slower growth  in potential during the recession and first several years of recovery; nonetheless,  we  still are projecting  a  significant degree  of resource  slack  throughout  the  projection period. Even  with  a  fairly  flat  Phillips  curve,  this  slack  is  large  enough  to  keep  inflation  contained. We  are not seeing any signs of inflation pressures  today: Wage  gains  remain  muted  and  inflationary  expectations are in check. Indeed,  models  we  run  that  use  the  term  structure  of  interest  rates  to estimate  inflation  expectations  are  forecasting  very  low  medium-term  inflation  throughout  the  projection  period. (For  example, the  expected  three-year  forward  inflation  rate  in  2014  is  still  below  1.5  percent.)

Respondent 14:

We  continue  to  suffer  from  overhangs  of  housing  and  of  household  debt,  though  there  are  signs  that  these drags  on  consumer  spending  and  residential  investment  may  be  easing. The  sharp  deterioration  in  the  fiscal outlook that has occurred as a result of the recession  means that cuts in government purchases  and prospective tax  increases  are  likely  to continue  to  limit  the  pace  of  the  expansion. Energy  prices  remain  high,  and banks  continue to be squeezed by  the low, flat yield  curve. Although they  are  generally  flush with liquidity, and overseas labor costs are rising, businesses continue  to be more  interested in foreign than in domestic expansion. The potential for job-creating investment  within the  U.S. is  stymied by  uncertainty  over  fiscal policy and concerns about regulatory excess. Judging by long-term government  bond  yields, underlying structural  problems  in  the  euro  area  remain  unresolved. Emerging  markets  have  shifted  to  a  slightly  slower growth  gearing. For  all of these  reasons,  U.S.  growth  is  likely  to  be  subdued  in  2012.

Respondent 15:

I continue  to  expect  a  modest  economic  recovery  over  the  next  several  years  with  a  gradual  improvement  in unemployment.  As  a  testament  to  the  economy's  resilient  nature  after  some  adverse  events  in  the  first  half of the  year,  economic  growth  picked  up  over  the  course  of  2011,  and  recent  data  releases  suggest  improving conditions in labor markets, brightening  household  sentiment, and even some  signs of hope  in residential investment. Pent-up  demand,  accommodative  monetary  policy,  and  improving  labor  markets  will  support economic growth  over the forecast horizon. However, financial headwinds, deleveraging by households, reductions in government spending, and  the slow healing of the housing  market will  weigh on growth. Considerable uncertainty  about the European sovereign debt  crisis and U.S. fiscal policy remains unresolved. But barring a financial  crisis,  I expect  slowdowns  abroad  will  have  only  a  moderate  impact  on  U.S.  exports.

The  recent  deceleration  in  inflation  from  its  elevated  levels  in  early  2011  is  a  welcome  development. While it is likely to run below  2 percent  for a time, I expect  that  a gradually  improving  economy  and  stable  inflation expectations  will pull inflation back  toward  2  percent  over the forecast horizon. Over  the medium term, a highly accommodative  monetary  policy  and  large  long-run fiscal imbalances  pose upside risks to inflation  expectations  and,  hence,  inflation. In addition,  the  current  extraordinary  level  of  monetary  policy accommodation raises the possibility  of distortions in  financial  markets  and  the  mispricing  of risk that  could eventually  destabilize  the  economy.

Respondent 16:

As of yet, no fundamental change in the pattern of a slow-moving  recovery  with  enough  momentum to ward off recessionary  risks (in the absence of  external shocks), but not  enough to  achieve significantly above-trend growth,  at least over the next  five  or six quarters. Considerably  more uncertainty  attaches to my projections

for the middle  of  2013  and  2014. It seems  possible  that,  by  then,  the  balance  sheets  of  households,  smaller banks,  and  small  businesses  will  have  improved  sufficiently  that  a  clear  bottom  to  the  housing  market  could combine  with  improved  business  and  consumer  confidence  to  spark  a  somewhat  stronger  recovery. However, the Tealbook  expectation  that this  modest  takeoff will not occur until  2015  seems equally plausible right now. In any  case,  the  odds  of  a  sustained  period  of  rapid  growth  still  seem  low.

Major  downside  risks continue to be external. Despite some  helpful measures, particularly by the ECB, Eurozone  risks  are  still  high,  with  Greek  negotiations  coming  to  a  head  soon  and  large  amounts  of  sovereign debt rollovers looming in the first half of this year. It appears that risks of military  action in the Middle East  are  also  increasing,  with  concomitant  risks  to  energy  prices  and  confidence  more  generally.

Respondent 17:

Incoming data  on  economic  activity have been  largely  consistent with my forecast of slightly above trend growth. The  unemployment  rate  has  declined  faster  than  I  anticipated  in October. The  economy  has  rebounded from the negative shocks  earlier in  2011 such  as higher oil prices, bad weather, European sovereign debt  developments,  and  the  supply  chain  disruptions  associated  with  the  Japan  disaster  and  is  now  poised for moderately  above-trend  growth  in  2012.

I expect  3  percent  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. The  unexpected strength  in the recent labor market  data  led  me  to  revise down  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate. But with  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  labor  market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect the unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6.3  percent  by  the  end of the forecast horizon, at which  time  it remains  above  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline inflation will pull back  to a 2 percent pace in  2012 and  remain at that level in  2013 and  2014. Inflation stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the Tealbook.

In my view, the substantial liquidity that is now in the financial system continues to imply a risk that inflation will rapidly accelerate to unacceptable  levels and that inflation expectations may  become  unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening  of  monetary policy  that  begins  some  time  in  2012.

Forecast  Narratives (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1:

The  forecast  for  real  activity  entails  somewhat  faster  growth  than  in  the  Tealbook,  largely  as  a  result  of  the additional  monetary  policy  stimulus  that  is  factored  into  our  forecast.

Respondent 2:

My  2012-2013  outlook for  economic  activity (both GDP growth  and  unemployment)  is  modestly  more optimistic than Tealbook's forecast. The difference in the forecasts appears to be due in part to  consumer spending. While  I  certainly  see  headwinds  slowing  consumption,  I  don't  see  them  as  being  quite  as  strong as does  Tealbook.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

Very  similar  at this point. I don't see any  basis to expect  a sharp  increase  in growth  in  2014, so I have  a smoother path  of improvement. See a little more  core inflation, in part because  of the  attractive power  of anchored  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 5:

My  growth  and  inflation  forecasts  are  both  higher  than  the  Tealbook  in  2012  and  2013.

Respondent 6:

Inflation  is  a notch  higher  in  my  forecast,  since  I  put  less  weight  on  slack  as  a  determinant  of  inflation.

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection, though with slightly  stronger GDP growth in  2013 and  slightly  slower  growth  in  2014.

Respondent 9:

I have forecast  a slightly  more rapid pickup  in growth  than Tealbook largely  because I have  assumed a  more accommodative  monetary  policy.

Respondent 10:

I expect unemployment to be lower at the end of  2014 (my forecast  is close  to 7%, as opposed to 7.8%). I expect inflation to be higher  at the  end  of  2014 (close  to  2%,  as  opposed to  1.4%).

Respondent 11:

I anticipate  faster  near-term  GDP  growth,  lower  unemployment,  and  higher  inflation.

Respondent 12:

As  stated  above,  we  now  assume  a  MBS  purchase  program  to  provide  additional  monetary  accommodation over  the  forecast  horizon.

We continue to assume lower inflation persistence than does the Tealbook. Given changes in both our forecast and the Tealbook forecast, this differing assumption has little impact for the 2011-13 forecasts. However,  at the 2014 horizon and beyond, under  the assumption  of well anchored  inflation expectations,

we project that core and overall inflation will move  more  quickly  toward  the 2%  objective than does the Tealbook  forecast.

We have a  somewhat lower path for the personal saving  rate than the Tealbook despite similar  consumption paths. Apparently  this reflects a  somewhat lower path of disposable income  in our forecast  as we expect the profit  share  to  remain  higher  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Based on our assumptions of modest increases in the labor force participation rate and average weekly hours,  we  expect  a  somewhat  greater  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  than  is  projected  in  the  Tealbook, particularly  in  2013  and  2014.

Respondent 13:

Our  baseline  does  not  include  as  much  fiscal  restraint  from  the  caps  on  discretionary  spending  in  the  Budget Control Act as the Tealbook. We  also have not built in as much  spillover to the cost and availability of credit  to  U.S.  firms  from  developments  in  Europe.

Respondent 14:

I am  somewhat  more optimistic about near-term growth prospects than is the Tealbook,  and  this difference is reflected in a  slightly lower path for the unemployment  rate, a  somewhat higher path for the inflation rate, and  a  steeper  trajectory  for  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 15:

My  forecast  is  now  quite  different  from  Tealbook,  whereas  they  were  more  similar  at  the  last  SEP  submission. Tealbook  expects  a  weaker  outlook,  higher  unemployment,  and  lower  inflation  than  are  contained  in my  forecast.

Respondent 16:

I am  even  less  confident  than  usual  that  oil  prices  will  remain  subdued  over  the  projection  period.

Respondent 17:

My  forecast calls for a stronger economy  over the next two years and tighter monetary  policy than the Tealbook.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

The  contours  of  the  forecast  have  not  changed  significantly. The  unemployment  rate  is  now  lower  than  the level we  were  expecting  at  the  time  of the previous  projections,  but  we  view  some  of  the  recent  decline  as transitory. The recession in Europe is now a reality,  and  more  stimulative policy is needed  to  achieve roughly the  same  unemployment  rate  outcome  by  the  end  of  2014  as  in  the  previous  projections.

Respondent 2:

The changes in my forecast are primarily driven by data received between meetings. In particular, the unemployment rate fell  unexpectedly  in November  and December, while inflation (both  overall  and  ex food and  energy)  slowed  more  than  I  anticipated.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

Forecast  is very similar to the last round. Data  have  been  a little stronger than  I expected, especially in the labor  market, but weak  consumer fundamentals  and  the  other restraints  on recovery (financial, housing) remain  similar  to  November. A  weaker  global  economy  offsets  some  signs  of  domestic  strength.

Respondent 5:

I have  not  revised  my  growth  or  inflation  forecast  in  a  significant  way  since  the  November  submission.

Respondent 6:

Impediments  to  growth  seem  to  be  a  little stronger. For example,  a  lower  path  for output  in Europe  will pull down  U.S.  exports  in  the  near  term.

Respondent 7:

steady  improvement  in  credit,  signs  of  firming  in  labor  and  beginning  signs  of  improvement  in  housing

Respondent 8:

Since  October,  we  have  made  relatively  modest  downgrades  to  our  outlook  for  GDP  growth. Some  data  on labor  markets have  shown more  improvement than  expected, but  most indicators have been  largely in line with  expectations. At  the  same  time,  our  projections  for  the  global  economy  as  well  as  for  fiscal  policy  are less optimistic, which  is tempering  the  outlook. The  recent data led us to lower our unemployment  path in the near  term,  but  slower  growth  and  a  higher  long-run  NAIRU  have  led  us  increase  the  unemployment path  farther  out. Data  on  inflation  have  come  in  largely  in  line  with  expectations  in  recent  months.

Respondent 9:

Both  consumer  and investment spending have proven to be less robust than I  assumed in my last forecast.  In addition, the global  outlook has weakened  substantially. As a  consequence, I have revised down my  estimates for growth  and  revised upward  my  estimates  for  unemployment  over  the  forecast  horizon. In light of my weaker  growth  projection  and  incoming  data  I  have  revised  down  my  forecast  for  inflation.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

My  forecasts  have  changed  little. However,  to  reflect  inflation  targeting, I have  modified  my  long-term  in-

flation  goal  and  made  corresponding  changes  in  the  long-run  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 12:

Our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  would  be  further  below  that  of  November  except  for  the  additional  monetary  accommodation from the MBS purchase program we now  assume will  occur in  our  outlook.

Relative to November, we now assume that the payroll tax cut and emergency unemployment  benefits will be extended  through  the  end  of  2012. Consequently,  we  assume  less  fiscal  drag  in  2012  but  more  drag in 2013  than  in  the  November  SEP.  We  also  assume  greater  fiscal  drag  in  2014  than  in  the  November  SEP, which  is  a  major  factor  in  the  lower  2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast.

We  also now  assume  a  mild  recession  in Europe  that  was  not  a feature of our outlook  in November. The slower  foreign  growth  and  the  continued  associated  financial  strains  contribute  to  constrain  U.S.  growth  in 2012.

The  assumed  path  of  oil  prices  is  above  our  assumptions  in  November,  contributing  somewhat  to  the  lower forecast path  for real GDP  growth. The  projected  inflation  path  is little different from  November  despite higher  oil prices because they  are  offset by  other factors, including  the low inflation data in  2011Q4.

Because of the decline in the unemployment  rate  in recent months, we have lowered the projected path of the unemployment  rate  compared  to  November. The  effect  is most  evident  in  the  near-term  projections as the  slower  projected  growth  leads  to  a  somewhat  slower  fall  in  unemployment  in  subsequent  years.

Core inflation in 2011Q4 has  been  slightly below  our projections, but it has had only very minor effects on  our  inflation  forecasts.

Respondent 13:

Our  forecast  has  not  changed  a  great  deal  since  the  November  SEP.  The  recent  pickup  in  economic  activity is broadly in line  with that  earlier projection. Europe  still poses  significant downside risks, but we do not think  the  developments  over  the  past  two  months  have  changed  the  distributions  of  possible  outcomes  very much. Inflation  has  come  down  as  we  had  expected. The  biggest  surprise  has  been  the  decline  in  the  unemployment rate,  and we have reduced  our projection for the unemployment  rate in  2012  accordingly. However, our  forecasts  of the rates for the out-years  have  not  changed  much,  in  part  reflecting  some  reassessment  of the  effects  of the  EUI  program.

Respondent 14:

We  have seen a larger-than-anticipated decline in the unemployment  rate. Private sector businesses are slowly becoming  more  confident;  they have become  extremely productive, have improved their financials  and have tightened their cost structures dramatically. The  private sector is poised for job creating expansion under  improved  conditions  for  final demand  and  with  greater  clarity about  fiscal and regulatory  matters, which I presume  will occur  after the  election  of  2012,  regardless  of  who  captures the White  House. In response,  I have  shifted  downward  the  projected  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  without  much  change  to  its slope. In addition,  my  forecasted  paths  for  inflation  and  the  funds  rate  reflect  a 50-basis-point  increase  in my  preferred  long-run  inflation  objective.

Respondent 15:

On  net,  my  forecast  is  little  changed  from  the  last  SEP  submission. On  the  negative  side,  economic  growth abroad  appears  to  be  a little weaker  than  anticipated  which  will  weigh  on  exports, and  recent softness in retail  sales  and  business  capital  spending  suggest  less  momentum  heading  into  2012. On  the  positive  side,  a number  of  labor  market  indicators  have  shown  more  improvement  than  anticipated,  consumer  sentiment  has rebounded  sharply,  and  cyclically  sensitive  auto  sales in the fourth quarter  averaged  their  best pace since mid-2008.

Respondent 16:

My  forecasts  haven't  change  materially  since  the  last  quarter's  projections. Recent  spate  of  slightly  better than  anticipated  data  doesn't  offset  the  basic  patter  described  in  response  to  4(a).

Respondent 17:

Recent  labor  market  data  have  led  me  to  revise  down  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate.
