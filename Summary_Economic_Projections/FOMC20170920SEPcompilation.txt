<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for the federal funds  rate are the value of the midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or the projected  appropriate  target  level  for the federal funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  June  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on June  13-14,  2017. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  June 13-14,  2017,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  September  19-20,  2017,  meeting.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: Full  convergence  of  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  inflation  and  interest  rates  to  their longer-run  values  will  likely  take  six  years  or  so,  for  two  reasons.  First,  I  anticipate  a  gradual  rise  in  the  neutral  rate through  2020  and  beyond  as  productivity  growth  gradually  picks  up  and  the  dollar  depreciates  modestly.  Second, the  unemployment  rate  is  likely  to  remain  modestly  below  its  longer-run  level  over  the  next  couple  of  years,  and only  in  2020  to  begin  moving  back  towards  its  sustainable  level. I also  anticipate  that  inflation  will  run  slightly above  2  percent  for  a  time  until  the  unemployment  rate  settles  back  at  its  longer-run  sustainable  level.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: I expect  real  GDP  growth  and  PCE  inflation  to  converge  to  their  longer-run  rates  in  the  next year  or  two,  while  the  unemployment  rate  will  likely  reach  its  longer-run  rate  only  later.  The  unemployment  rate has  declined  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  and  I  expect  the  convergence  process  for  the  unemployment rate  to  last  five  or  six  years.

I reduced  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  to  4.8  percent  from  5.0  percent,  primarily  in  light of  ongoing  demographic  changes-such  as,  importantly,  the  aging  of  the  workforce-that  exert  downward  pressure on  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: We  continue  to  push  past  full  employment.  Inflation  is  likely  to  be  just  shy  of  our  longer  run objective  at  the  end  of  next  year  and  to  rise  above  our  objective  in  2019.  At  that  point  it  will  be  challenging  to  rein the  economy  in  without  triggering  a  recession.  I  suspect  that  we  will  not  have  achieved  full  convergence  even  after six  years.

Respondent 7: We  believe  that  convergence  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  its  long-run  level  of  2.75  percent  is likely  to  take  about  2  years.

Respondent 8: Given  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate,  the  economy  is  now  operating above  potential  and  the  underlying  pace  of  activity  suggests  a  significant  risk  of  further  undesirable  overshooting of  full  employment  in  the  near  term. In  order  to  converge  back  to  full  employment,  a  prolonged  period  of  growth below  potential  will  be  needed. The  historical  record, however,  places  a  significant  probability  on  a  'growth recession'  eventually  morphing  into  a  full-blown  recession. In  sum,  while  a  purely  model-driven  forecast  would suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below  around  2022,  there  is  a  nontrivial  risk  that the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: The  annual  revisions  to  GDP  and  productivity  have  not  led  us  to  change  our  long-run assumptions. We  still  assume  potential  GDP  growth  is  1.8  percent,  as  in  the  past  several  SEP  submissions. We also  continue  to  judge  that  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  is  within  the  range  of  4  to  6  percent,  with the  mode  of  that  distribution  between  4.5  and  5  percent. Given  the  recent  trends  in  labor  market  conditions,  we set  our  point  estimate  in  the  lower  portion  of  that  range  at  4.6  percent.

We projectthat the currentunemployment rate will remain modestly belowitslonger-run normal level through 2020.  Our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions indicate  that  there  is  a  significant  probability  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  further  below  its  longer-run normal  level.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-runobjective.  Undertheseconditionsandwithsomeundershootingofthelonger-runnormalunemployment rateovertheforecasthorizon,weexpectinflationasmeasuredbythePCEpriceindextobemildlyabovetheFOMC's longer-run  objective  in  2019-20,  before  returning  to  that  level  afterwards.

Respondent 11: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years.

Respondent 12: Reflecting  recent  data,  we  project  a  temporary  undershooting  of  inflation  for  2017. GDP growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  have  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and a low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of  2.0  percent,  an unemployment rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0  percent.  Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes, we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  of  these variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run  inflation projection  that  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  three  to  four  years.

Respondent 16: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  by  2019. However,  it  will  take  a  couple  more  years  to achieve  complete  convergence  to  our  longer-run  projections. The  effects  from  accommodative  monetary  policy will  generate  some  overshooting  of  inflation  and  undershooting  of  unemployment  before  dissipating  over  the  longer run.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during  the Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 6: Uncertainty  about  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years  is unusually  high,  with  little  room  for  error  on  either  side. The  adverse  economic  consequences  of  any  policy  errors will be felt in 2019 and, especially, 2020.  At those horizons, uncertainty about the paths of real activity and inflation is  elevated.  At  shorter  horizons,  however,  economic  uncertainty  is  about  average.

Respondent 7: On  balance,  we  continue  to  judge  that  the  levels  of  uncertainty  for  the  growth  and  inflation forecasts  are  broadly  similar. Factors  that  previously  had  the  potential  for  generating  higher  uncertainty  -  such as  large  changes  in  government  fiscal  and  regulatory  policies,  global  growth  concerns,  etc.  -  have  receded  further since  June. The  effects  of  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  add  a  good  deal  of  uncertainty  to  the  near-term  outlook for  both  growth  and  inflation. However,  the  hurricanes  are  unlikely  to  have  any  effect  on  the  more  fundamental contours  of  the  forecast.

Respondent 8:

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. (We  have  revised  our  methodology to incorporate  greater  use  of  the  New  York  Fed  Bayesian  VAR  and  DSGE  models  in  constructing  the  forecast distribution.)  The  widths  of  these  intervals  are  somewhat  narrower  than  in  our  June  SEP  submission,  as  economic data  have  been  roughly  consistent  with  our  central  projection  and  financial  market  volatility  generally  has  been subdued.  Nevertheless,  the  probability  intervals  for  real  activity  and  core  PCE  inflation  forecasts  are  still  broadly in  line  with  the  SEP  standard  (for  inflation,  this  assessment  takes  into  account  the  differences  between  forecast errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation).

Respondent 11: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  the  heightened  uncertainty  about  the  course  of  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  trade  policy. The  impact  on  inflation uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: The  lack  of  any  slowdown  to  date  in  employment  and  output  growth  despite  tighter  monetary policy  by  itself  might  suggest  that  the  risks  to  real  activity  are  weighted  to  the  upside,  but  this  concern  is  o ffset  by the  downside  risks  implied  by  the  effective  lower  bound  on  nominal  interest  rates  and  the  limitations  it  places  on our  ability  to  o ffset  adverse  shocks.

A  string  of  unexpectedly  low  monthly  price  readings,  wage  increases  that  remain  subdued  despite  stronger labor  market  conditions,  and  other  evidence  have  increased  my  concern  that  returning  inflation  to  our  2  percent goal  will  prove  to  be  more  difficult  than  envisioned  in  my  baseline  forecast. Hence,  I  now  view  the  risks  to  the inflation  outlook  as  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  effective  lower  bound limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks.  For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a  countervailing  risk  that  it  will  fall  more  rapidly  if  the  labor  force  participation  rate  resumes  its  downward  trend.  Therefore I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 6: WhileI seesomepotentialupsidefromtax-policychanges, regulatoryreform, andappropriate infrastructurespending,prospectsforthoughtfulpolicychangeshavefaded.  Meanwhile,Icontinuetobeconcerned about  the  potential  negative  impacts  of  healthcare  reform  and  immigration  policies,  and  about  tax  changes  that ultimately  do  not  create  sustained  improvement  in  GDP,  but  leave  us  with  a  higher  level  of  debt  to  GDP  at  a  time when  the  US  government  is  already  highly  leveraged.  I  am  hopeful  that  trade  policy,  despite  recent  rhetoric,  will be  done  in  a  way  that  doesn't  dismantle  logistics  and  other  integrated  supply  chain  arrangements  which  I  believe help  US  competiveness  and  employment  opportunities.

Respondent 7: We see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  as  broadly  balanced.  Our  forecast  assumes  a  modest impetus  to  growth  from  fiscal  policy  in  2018;  we  see  the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  the  policy  process  will  result  in a  bit  more  or  a  bit  less  stimulus.  Similarly,  the  likelihood  of  stronger  world-wide  demand  appears  balanced  against the  potential  for  some  future  weakness,  most  notably  from  a  slowdown  in  China. With  regard  to  inflation,  given the  downward  adjustments  we  made  to  our  inflation  outlook,  we  judge  that  the  risks  to  the  forecast  continue  to  be balanced.  Once  again,  this  was  a  close  call. Persistently  low  inflation  readings,  as  well  as  the  continued  low  levels of  inflation  compensation  in  financial  markets  and  survey  expectations,  remain  disconcerting. However,  we  feel our  forecast  revisions  were  enough  to  re-center  the  balance  of  risks.

Respondent 8: OurforecastforGDPgrowthinthenearterm, smoothingthroughtheeffectsofthehurricanes, remains  upbeat.  The  recent  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  continues  to  be  consistent  with  a  low  estimate  of the  potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy.  In  this  context,  if  our  real  growth  forecast  materializes,  there  is  the  risk that  the  unemployment  rate  may  fall  by  more  than  what  we  are  envisioning  absent  some  improvement  in  potential GDP  growth.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  New  York  Fed  forecast  distribution. With  little  resolution  concerning  U.S.  fiscal, regulatory,  and  trade  policy  changes  as  well  as  notable  outstanding  geopolitical  issues,  risks  remain  significant  on both  sides  of  the  real  activity  outlook.  Overall,  as  in  June,  they  are  roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  also  remain  roughly  balanced  throughout  the  forecast  horizon.  Longer-term  inflation  compensation,  the  Michigan  long-run  survey  inflation  expectations,  and  our  SCE  3-year  inflation  expectations  remain at  low  levels,  consistent  with  continued  downside  risks. In  addition,  some  measures  of  underlying  inflation  have moved  down  modestly  since  the  June  FOMC  meeting. By  contrast,  global  disinflationary  forces  appear  to  have abated  somewhat  and  financial  conditions  have  eased,  indicating  still-significant  upside  risks. Also,  the  August CPI  suggests  that  the  softer  inflation  data  in  recent  months  largely  reflected  transitory  factors,  which  is  consistent with  our  central  projection.

Respondent 11: Fiscal  uncertainty  remains  high. Some  stimulus  may  be  forthcoming  that  would  boost demand,  raise  output  growth,  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further. The  magnitude  and  timing  of  any  such stimulus  remains  uncertain.

Respondent 12: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity  growth  regime  is possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time.  We  do  not  see  the  fiscal  and  deregulation proposals  of  the  administration  as  sufficiently  concrete  or  close  enough  to  enactment  to  forecast  a  high  productivity regime.  Such  a  possible  switch,  however,  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  Our  assessment of  the  effects  of  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  on  output  is  that  the  negative  effects  in  Q3  would  be  reversed  in  Q4.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion.  If  a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially.  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon;  however,  such  a  possibility  leads  us  to  allow  for  a  higher  unemployment rate. On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate. Overall,  we  see the  risks  as  broadly  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It  is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  this  variable  also  depends  on the  behavior  of  energy  prices. We  considered  the  effects  of  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  and  concluded  that  the energy  price  increases  in  Q3  would  likely  by  reversed  in  Q4.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 15: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.  This  view  continues  to be  based  on  a  monetary  policy  path  that  is  a  bit  steeper  than  the  median  path  in  the  June  SEPs.

The  recent  hurricanes  have  caused  loss  of  life,  considerable  property  damage,  and  disruptions  in  economic activity  in  Texas  and  Florida.  Rebuilding  efforts  have  already  begun  and  will  continue  for  some  time  to  come.  The effects  are  beginning  to  show  up  in  some  of  the  monthly  economic  indicators,  and  this  will  continue  in  the  near  term. As  a  result  of  the  hurricanes,  I  expect  that  growth  will  be  depressed  in  the  third  quarter  and  boosted  somewhat over  the  subsequent  couple  of  quarters. Some  measures  of  inflation  will  be  a ffected  in  the  short-run  as  well,  as the  prices  of  gasoline  and  other  materials  related  to  rebuilding  efforts  increase. I anticipate  that  the  hurricanes will  exert  little  effect  on  the  outlook  for  the  economy  over  the  medium  run,  which  is  the  time  horizon  over  which monetary  policy  operates.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  there  could  be  some  form  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  but  there  continues  to  be uncertainty  about  what,  if  anything,  will  be  passed  and  the  timing.  My  baseline  forecast  incorporates  a  small  fiscal stimulus  in  line  with  the  size  and  timing  of  the  package  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. Like  the  Tealbook,  my  modal expectation  is  for  a  smaller  fiscal  package  than  I  assumed  in  the  June  SEP,  but  with  some  o ffset  due  to  increased

federal  spending  and  transfer  payments  in  response  to  the  hurricanes. My  projections  are  not  dependent  on  a sizable  fiscal  policy  package;  I  assume  only  a  modest  increase  in  output  growth  in  2018  and  2019  due  to  fiscal  policy. Instead,  my  forecast  reflects  healthy  underlying  fundamentals.  I  see  the  risks  due  to  fiscal  policy  as  being  balanced.

The  global  outlook  has  improved  over  the  last  year. Some  risks  remain,  including  the  weak  banking  system in Italy,  the  continued  rebalancing  of  the  Chinese  economy,  vulnerabilities  in  emerging  market  economies,  and geopoliticalrisks.  Monetarypolicyremainsaccommodativeinmanycountries,helpingtosupporttheireconomies, even  if  there  is  some  gradual  reduction  in  the  level  of  accommodation.

At  this  point,  I  continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced  and  I  continue  to  expect  that  inflation  will gradually  return  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  time. The  weaker  readings  on  inflation  in  recent  months  suggest  it may  take  slightly  longer  to  achieve  a  sustained  return  to  2  percent  inflation;  I  expect  this  goal  to  be  met  in  the  first half  of  2019.

If the  dynamics  of  inflation  have  fundamentally  changed,  then  I  may  be  underestimating  the  persistence  of low  inflation,  or  overestimating  the  long-run  unemployment  rate. This  could  lead  to  a  weaker  inflation  forecast relative  to  my  modal  forecast.  But  if  the  forces  weighing  on  inflation  are,  indeed,  transitory  and  idiosyncratic  (as assumed),  and  if  labor  markets  tighten  more  than  I  expect  and  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  kick  in,  inflation could  move  higher  than  I  expect,  especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  slower  than  I've assumed.  Even  absent  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation than  I've  assumed  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

The  risks  to  inflation  from  oil  prices  appear  balanced  over  the  medium-run  despite  near-term  upward  pressure from  the  hurricanes.

Afterappreciatingovermostofthelasttwoandahalfyears,thedollarhasdepreciatedthisyear.  Acontinuation of  this  depreciation  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far,  but  given  the  outlook  and the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an  appropriate  pace, these  risks  would  rise.  Indeed,  the  low  level  of  market  volatility  coupled  with  the  low  equity  premium  suggests  that these  risks  may  be  building.

Respondent 16: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. We  have  reached  our  objective  of maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  wide  array  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  be  beyond  full employment  for  the  next  few  years.  The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long.

I no  longer  expect  a  meaningful  boost  to  growth  in  2018  and  2019  from  government  fiscal  policy  initiatives. That  said,  there  remains  some  possibility  of  a  tax  cut,  which  is  a  source  of  upside  risk  to  the  outlook  on  activity.

Downside  risks  to  the  foreign  economic  outlook-notably  in  China  and  continental  Europe-  have  receded somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  geopolitical  concerns  related  to  North  Korea  have  risen.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

I see  inflation  moving  very  gradually  to  our  2  percent  goal  and  view  the  risks  to  this  forecast  as  balanced. On the  upside,  there  is  a  risk  that  an  extended  period  of  very  tight  labor  markets  may  foster  a  more  rapid  increase  in inflation  than  I  assume  in  my  forecast.  On  the  downside,  there  are  other  factors,  such  as  muted  healthcare  services inflation,  which  if  sustained,  could  slow  the  pace  of  inflation  going  forward.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: My  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  continues  to  rest  on  three  assumptions.  First, keeping  the  unemployment  rate  near  4  percent-modestly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate-will  facilitate  the return  to  2  percent  inflation  over  the  next  two  years.  Second,  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  appears  to  be  currently near  zero,  suggesting  that  only  a  modest  amount  of  accommodation  is  still  in  place.  And  third,  the  neutral  rate  is likely  to  rise  modestly  over  time  as  productivity  growth  picks  up,  suggesting  that  the  federal  funds  rate  will  need to  rise  in  tandem  in  order  to  keep  the  economy  from  overheating.

Respondent 2: The  low  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  been  necessary  to  move  inflation  and  unemployment back  toward  our  targets.  This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low  rate  of  productivity  growth and  other  factors. Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring  a  low  federal  funds  rate  for  some time  in  order  to  deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 3: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. As  the  economy  has  reached  full  capacity  and  we  have essentially  achieved  price  stability,  I  view  a  federal  funds  rate  of  1.63  percent  by  the  end  of  2017  as  most  consistent with  keeping  the  economy  in  its  current  desirable  state,  even  though  it  would  require  two  additional  25  basis  point increases  by  the  end  of  the  year.

My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  to  be  close  to  two percent  in  2017.  Yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run level  in  2017.  The  reason  is  that  the  federal  funds  rate  is  still  low  despite  the  economy's  return  to  full  capacity  and price  stability,  reflecting  the  Committee's  past  decisions,  and  I  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate  as  important to  promote  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Inflation  continues  to  come  in  below  our  2  percent  target;  in  fact  it  has  been  falling  since February. Even  though  the  labor  market  continues  to  strengthen,  it  is  not  clear  that  we  have  reached  maximum employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime  age  persons  remain well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. Given  the  persistent  undershooting  of our  inflation  target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy  implies  a  very  gradual  path  for  the  federal  funds rate.

I have  lowered  my  long-run  normal  value  for  the  federal  funds  rate  because  of  model-based  estimates  that indicate  the  neutral  real  interest  rate  is  close  to  zero  as  well  as  long-term  interest  rates  that,  even  after  accounting for  term  premiums  that  are  notably  lower  than  historical  averages,  imply  a  very  low  normal  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 6: I've  lowered  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  value  of  the  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points,  but left  my  projected  funds-rate  path  largely  unchanged. Implicitly,  accommodation  is  removed  slightly  faster  than before. A  slightly-more-rapid  removal  of  accommodation  is  appropriate,  in  my  view,  given  the  stronger  outlook for  real  growth  here  and  abroad.

Risks  to  my  funds-rate  projections  are  balanced,  in  my  view.  However,  my  confidence  that  the  funds-rate  path I have  specified  will,  in  fact,  prove  to  be  appropriate  is  lower  than  usual.  I  am  cognizant  that  the  10-year  Treasury yield  now  stands  at  approximately  2.2  percent.  At  issue  is  whether  we  can  slow  the  economy  to  a  sustainable  rate of  growth  without  inverting  the  yield  curve.

I assume  that  we  will  vote  to  begin  scaling  back  reinvestment  of  funds  from  maturing  Treasury  and  MBS securities  at  this  meeting. The  policy  change  is  widely  expected,  and  I  do  not  believe  its  announcement  will appreciably  a ffect  overall  financial  conditions. Nor  does  the  policy  change  have  more  than  a  very  marginal  effect on  my  thinking  on  the  appropriate  path  for  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 7: After  updating  and  reviewing  projections  for  the  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  from  a  range of  models,  we  lowered  our  estimate  of  its  long-run  level  by  25  basis  points  to  2.75  percent. Our  assumed  path  for appropriate  policy  brings  the  federal  funds  rate  gradually  up  to  its  long-run  value  by  the  end  of  2019  and  then  has the  funds  rate  remaining  at  that  level  in  2020. Specifically,  we  anticipate  no  additional  rate  hikes  for  the  rest  of 2017,  followed  by  three  rate  increases  per  year  in  2018  and  2019.  We  assume  balance  sheet  normalization  begins  in October  of  this  year  and  proceeds  according  to  the  announced  plan.

Webelievethispolicypackagerepresentsabalancedapproachtoachievingbothofourdualmandateobjectives. Givenourprojectionofcontinuedlowinflation,aswellasuncertaintyoveritsoutlook,wethinkitwillbeappropriate to  forego  increasing  the  funds  rate  further  until  2018. More  generally,  we  feel  policy  has  work  to  do  in  order  to solidifyinflationaryexpectationssymmetricallyaround2percent,whichisapre-requisiteforachievingourinflation objective.  That  is  why  in  2020  we  have  the  funds  rate  at  only  its  longer-run  level  even  though  we  project  inflation at  2  percent  and  the  unemployment  rate  0.6  percentage  point  below  the  natural  rate. This  configuration  should generate  some  modest  overshooting  of  2  percent  inflation  beyond  2020,  which  would  reinforce  the  symmetry  of  our inflation  target  and  mitigate  the  risk  that  inflation  expectations  could  settle  in  below  2  percent.

Respondent 8: We  have  revised  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  down to 2.5 percent,  from  3.0  percent  in  June. The  lower  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  appears  to be  more  consistent  with  the  dynamics  of  the  unemployment  rate  gap  over  the  most  recent  period. This  revision notwithstanding,  monetary  policy  is  projected  to  tighten  over  time  while  still  giving  policymakers  the  opportunity to probe  for  a  lower  equilibrium  unemployment  rate. The  extent  of  probing  is  pushed  to  what,  by  historical standards,  is  likely  the  limit  before  the  probability  that  a  soft  landing  will  turn  into  a  recession  becomes  too  high. Our  federal  funds  rate  assumption  is  coupled  with  a  contraction  in  the  SOMA  portfolio  starting  in  October  of  this year.

Respondent 9: I believe  that  monthly  annualized  inflation  rates  will  average  about  2  percent  for  the  rest  of the  year.  Appropriate  policy  will  be  to  gradually  raise  interest  rates,  beginning  in  December.

Respondent 10: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The steepness  of  the  policy  path  also  depends  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

ff DSGE  model. Even  though  the  near-term  real  growth  outlook  has  improved  and  financial  conditions  have  eased,  the  nearterm  core  inflation  outlook  is  lower  and  the  medium-term  economic  outlook  and  balance  of  risks  are  little  changed. Consequently,  our  projection  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  the  same  as  in  the  June  SEP  submission:  The  target FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2017,  2018,  and  2019  are  1 1 / 4 - 1 1 / 2 percent,  2  -  2 1 / 4 percent,  and  2 3 / 4 -3 percent respectively.  For  2020,  we  do  not  anticipate  that  further  tightening  of  the  policy  stance  will  be  needed  to  achieve the  FOMC's  objectives  over  the  medium  term.  Our  policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  is  consistent  with  the gradual  rising  path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as  projected  by  the  New  York  Fed  sta

Our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  remains  in  the  range  of  0  -  2  percent, consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety  of  models.  Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2  percent) gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2  -  4  percent.  Our  modal  projection  is  in  the  lower  half of  this  range  due  to  the  combination  of  continued  fairly  subdued  productivity  growth,  low  longer-term  sovereign

yields,  continued  indications  of  a  global  'saving  glut,'  and  demographic  factors. As  reported  in  the  response  to question  3(a)  we  maintained  our  point  estimate  of  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  at  2 3 / 4 percent.  Our  appropriate policy  path  thus  slightly  overshoots  the  longer-run  FFR.

As  for  the  balance  sheet  policy,  we  assume  that  the  conditions  for  starting  the  phase-out  of  reinvestment  have been  met  and  that  the  plan  outlined  in  June  addendum  to  the  Policy  Normalization  Principles  and  Plans  will  be implemented  in  October.

Respondent 11: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  unchanged  from  last time.  My  view  is  that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  gradual  pace  given  low  productivity  growth,  uncertainty  about  the future  path  of  labor  force  participation,  and  inflation  that  has  been  running  below  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 12: We  see  no  reason  to  change  the  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  during  the  forecast  horizon. By  2018  all  variables  will  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a still  low  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.

Respondent 13: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate.

Respondent 14: In my  projection,  the  real  neutral  federal  funds  rate  rises  from  around  zero  today  to  0.5 percent  in  the  longer  run.  Because  inflation  in  my  projection  runs  below  the  Committee's  objective,  my  funds  rate path  is  somewhat  below  the  neutral  rate  for  the  next  several  years.

I have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  because  of  the  reduced  prospects  for  fiscal stimulus.

Respondent 15: I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  for  the  funds  rate  as  appropriate. There  is  little change  to  my  forecast  from  my  June  projections. My  inflation  forecast  is  a  little  bit  flatter  so  my  policy  path  is slightly  flatter  in  2018.  I  believe  it  is  appropriate  to  initiate  our  balance  sheet  normalization  plan  at  the  September 2017  FOMC  meeting.

The  near-term  data  will  be  a ffected  by  the  hurricanes,  but  we  need  to  smooth  through  those  fluctuations and  focus  on  the  medium-run  outlook. In  2018  and  2019,  I  project  that  growth  will  be  somewhat  above  and  the unemployment  rate  will  be  below  my  estimates  of  their  longer-run  levels. I anticipate  that  labor  compensation measures  will  firm  moderately,  in  line  with  the  rising  number  of  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  a  variety  of  data  showing  that  wage  and  compensation  gains  have  been  picking  up over  time.  However,  if  productivity  growth  remains  low,  these  gains  will  likely  be  slower  than  in  past  expansions.

ff in  demand  that  could  be  putting  more  persistent  downward  pressure  on  inflation. I  continue  to  see  the  weaker  readings  on  inflation  in  recent  months  as  largely  reflecting  transitory  factors  rather than  a  fallo I view  inflation expectationsasreasonablystable,andthis,coupledwithcontinuedstrengthinlabormarketsandongoingeconomic growth  at  or  slightly  above  trend,  suggests  that  inflation  will  gradually  increase  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the forecast  horizon.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals.  Based  on  the  outlook,  I  believe  it  will  be appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  gradually  move  rates  up  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon,  as  the  Committee has  been  consistently  communicating  for  some  time. The  gradual  path  allows  for  the  types  of  fluctuations  we've seen  in  the  data  without  having  to  change  strategy. I assume  that  the  funds  rate  will  end  2019  at  a  level  slightly higher  than  my  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent,  and  then  move  down  to  3  percent  in  2020.

Respondent 16: The  labor  market  is  beyond  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  of  slack.  Labor markets  will  continue  to  tighten  this  year  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls  further  below  its  natural  rate  before gradually  returning  to  its  long-run  steady-state  value.  On  inflation,  despite  some  recent  weakness  due  to  transitory factors,  I  expect  a  continued  gradual  increase,  reaching  our  2  percent  objective  by  2019  and  a  modest  overshooting in  2020. Underpinning  this  path  is  my  view  that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run  above potential,  and  that  this  will  contribute  to  upward  pressure  on  inflation.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  this  year  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest. This reflects  the  fact  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only  gradually  to  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term, I envision  a  faster  pace  of  fed  funds  rate  normalization  than  predicted  by  fed  funds  futures. The  fed  funds  rate will  reach  its  long-run  level  a  bit  by  the  end  of  2018  and  in  2019  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in  inflation  and  labor market  conditions.  Similarly  to  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  the  SOMA  portfolio  to  gradually  decline  beginning  in  the fourth  quarter  of  this  year  with  the  reduction  in  reinvestments.

September 19-20, 2017

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Key  factors  include:  a  gradual  pick-up  in  productivity  growth  over  the  next  few  years,  similar to  that  projected  in  the  Tealbook;  little  change  in  fiscal  policy  other  than  hurricane-related  spending;  continued solid  growth  in  global  demand;  and  a  gradual  rise  in  the  federal  funds  rate  that  will  bring  it  into  line  with  its  neutral rate  sometime  next  year  and  keep  in  line  with  the  (rising)  neutral  rate  thereafter. These  factors  should  enable labor  market  conditions  to  strengthen  a  bit  further  before  beginning  to  ease  in  2020. A  moderately  tight  labor market,  coupled  with  the  assumption  that  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored  at  around  2  percent,  should enable  actual  inflation  to  gradually  move  up  2  percent  over  the  next  two  years.

ff assumes. On  the  real  side,  key  risks  include  the  possibility  of  changes  in  federal  economic  policy  (including  ones  with potentially  adverse  effects);  the  risk  that  the  lack  of  any  slowdown  in  employment  growth  to  date  indicates  that the  neutral  rate  is  higher  than  I  have  judged;  and  the  potential  for  a  market  correction  given  rich  valuations  for corporate  equities  and  bonds. For  inflation,  the  key  risk  is  that  returning  inflation  to  2  percent  may  prove  to  be more  difficult  than  assumed  in  my  model  projection,  possibly  because  the  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment  is lower  than  I  have  judged,  or  perhaps  because  inflation  expectations  are  consistent  with  expected  PCE  inflation stabilizing  at  less  than  2  percent,  as  the  sta

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Modal  forecast:  My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  growth  near  trend  in  the period  from  2017  to  2020.  I  expect  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  to  temporarily  a ffect  indicators  of  real  activity  and energy  prices,  with  minor  effects  on  real  GDP  growth  and  PCE  inflation  in  2017  and  beyond.  In  the  medium  term, as  the  stance  of  monetary  policy  becomes  less  accommodative,  I  expect  growth  to  become  more  self-sustaining, based  on  modest  increases  in  the  labor  force  and  a  moderate  pace  of  productivity  gains.  I  view  the  economy  as  at  or beyond  full  capacity,  and  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  remain  below  its  longer-run  level  in  the  next  few  years, before  gradually  moving  back  toward  its  longer-run  rate.  The  softness  in  consumer  prices  this  year  appears  more persistent  than  initially  anticipated;  however,  I  expect  core  inflation  to  rise  to  2  percent  next  year,  consistent  with real  GDP  above  potential,  tightening  labor  market  conditions,  and  a  lower  dollar.

Uncertainty  and  risks: In  the  near  term,  the  effects  of  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  add  uncertainty  to  the pattern  of  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2017. In  the  medium  term,  however,  I  view  uncertainty  surrounding  my projections  as  broadly  similar  to  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical projection  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy  uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad.  The  risks  to  economic  growth, inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly  balanced.  A  downside  risk  emanating  from  the  U.S.  is  the  possibility that  an  overly  expansive  monetary  policy  could  lead  the  unemployment  rate  to  significantly  undershoot  its  natural level,  as  periods  of  overheating  have  historically  often  ended  with  a  recession. In  addition,  an  overly  expansive monetary  policy  would  increase  financial  stability  risks,  which  could  necessitate  a  quicker  than  expected  monetary policy  tightening  that  would  raise  the  risk  of  recession. Upside  risks  to  my  forecast  are  related  to  the  resilience  of the  U.S.  economy  and  the  possibility  of  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance.

Government policies:  My  assumption  for  fiscal  policy  has  not  changed  since  June.  My  forecast  does  not  assume major  changes  in  fiscal  policy  because  any  possible  changes  in  taxes,  government  spending,  or  regulations  remain highly  uncertain.  The  likelihood  of  a  more  accommodative  fiscal  policy  stance,  while  diminished  since  earlier  this year,  still  poses  upside  risk  for  growth  and  inflation  and  downside  risk  for  the  unemployment  rate.  I  did  not  assume any  major  changes  in  trade  policy  or  immigration  policy  either,  but  view  them  as  posing  downside  risk  to  my forecast. Considering  the  risks  related  to  government  policies  in  the  context  of  the  array  of  global  and  domestic risks  to  the  outlook,  I  view  uncertainty  as  broadly  similar  to  the  past  20  years  and  the  risks  around  my  outlook as  broadly  balanced. Given  that  my  assumptions  about  government  policies  do  not  imply  changes  in  the  modal outlook  or  in  my  assessment  of  uncertainty  and  risks,  they  did  not  alter  my  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 4: I see  the  path  of  economic  activity  as  broadly  unchanged  from  the  June  SEP.  Although  I  am still  inclined  to  see  the  recent  weakness  in  inflation  as  mostly  driven  by  transitory  factors,  I  see  somewhat  greater

risk  that  underlying  inflation  my  have  declined.  I  have  therefore  slowed  my  assumed  pace  of  policy  tightening  this year  as  we  await  clearer  signs  on  inflation.

Respondent 5: The  continued  low  level  of  inflation  and  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of  allowing  further improvement  in  the  labor  market  suggest  a  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy. I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 6: While  the  recent  hurricanes  are  likely  to  significantly  a ffect  the  pattern  of  quarterly  growth and  near-term  headline  inflation,  I  do  not  expect  much  impact  on  GDP  growth  over  the  second  half  of  2017  taken as  a  whole,  or  on  trend  inflation  as  captured,  for  example,  by  the  Dallas  Fed  trimmed  mean  PCE  inflation  rate.

ff by  sharply  higher  energy  prices  over  the  projections A  brightening  overseas  growth  outlook  and  a  somewhat  weaker  dollar  should  reduce  the  growth  drag  from  net exports  and  support  continued  expansion  in  capital  investment. Consumer  spending  remains  on  a  solid  growth track. Substantial  oil  inventories  and  the  high  price-elasticity  of  shale  oil  production  reduce  the  danger  that continued  expansion  of  the  world  economy  will  be  choked  o horizon.

On  inflation,  I  assume  that  the  cyclical  forces  driving  inflation  upward  eventually  more  than  o ffset  the  secular pricing  restraint  arising  from  new  technologies  that  threaten  traditional  business  models.

Monetary  policy  remains  accommodative,  and  with  labor-market  strains  increasingly  in  evidence  it  is  appropriate  to  continue  withdrawing  monetary  stimulus. However,  in  light  of  aging  demographics  leading  to  slowing workforce  growth,  I  believe  that  r*  may  stay  lower  for  longer  than  is  commonly  recognized. A  low  long-run  r* will  help  support  historically  high  asset  valuations  and  limit  the  size  of  the  funds-rate  increase  that's  required  to remove  accommodation.

Transitions  to  sustainable, non-inflationary  growth  are  always  difficult, but  this is especially  so once  the unemployment  rate  has  fallen  below  the  natural  rate. The  exact  mechanisms  are  unclear,  but  probably  revolve around  levels  of  debt,  physical  capital,  and  staffing  that  suddenly  become  problematic-inducing  sharp  cutbacks  in spending  and  hiring-when  it  becomes  apparent  that  the  growth  outlook  must  be  revised  downward.  It  sometimes seems  that  the  economy  has  only  two  distinct  modes-(1)  growth  above  potential  and  (2)  recession-with  very different  dynamics.  Substantial  unemployment  undershoot  now  seems  all  but  inevitable,  and  it  will  take  unusual skill  and  a  good  measure  of  luck  to  engineer  a  soft  landing.

Respondent 7: We  expect  growth  to  run  moderately  above  potential  through  2020. The  fundamentals underlying  private  domestic  final  demand  are  solid.  Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  and improved  household  balance  sheets  are  supporting  solid  gains  in  consumer  spending,  and  business  outlays  appear at  last  to  be  growing  at  a  healthier  pace. Our  baseline  scenario  envisions  such  momentum  carrying  forward  into next  year.  We  also  assume  growth  in  2018  will  be  boosted  about  1/4  percentage  point  by  higher  defense  spending and  tax  cuts. Subsequently,  gradual  removal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  projected  to  return  GDP  growth  to its  potential  by  2020.

Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  clearly  will  alter  the  quarterly  patterns  in  growth  over  the  near  term.  Our  working assumption  is  that  the  storms  will  reduce  growth  in  the  third  quarter  by  about 3 / 4 percentage  point  and  that  the recovery  in  activity  and  beginning  of  rebuilding  efforts  will  add  almost  that  amount  to  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter and 1 / 4 percentage  point  to  growth  in  early  2018. We  assume  total  inflation  readings  will  be  slightly  higher  in the  near  term  due  to  higher  energy  prices,  but  that  there  will  be  no  measurable  impact  on  core  inflation  from  the hurricanes.

At  4.4  percent,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  slightly  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate.  We  expect  it to  move  somewhat  further  below  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  period. The  unemployment  rate  is  at  3.9  percent in  2020  -  0.6  percentage  point  below  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.  (We  think  the  natural  rate currently  is  4.6  percent  and  will  trend  down  to  4.5  percent  by  2020.)

With  unemployment  projected  to  modestly  undershoot  the  natural  rate,  resource  pressures  should  provide some  lift  to  inflation  going  forward. Furthermore,  our  assumption  of  a  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and a strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  play  critical  roles  in  solidifying inflation  expectations  and  helping  to  bring  actual  inflation  toward  target. Still,  the  string  of  disappointing  news on  inflation  has  led  us  to  assume  a  somewhat  weaker  persistent  component  in  underlying  inflation,  and  we  have lowered  our  projection  accordingly. We  now  see  inflation  reaching  only  1.7  percent  next  year,  and  not  achieving target  until  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 8: Real  activity  rebounded  noticeably  in  the  second  quarter,  and  the  underlying  pace  of  growth appearstobewellabovepotential.  WecontinuetoexpectGDPgrowthinthesecondhalfofthisyeartoaverageclose to  3  percent,  with  the  negative  impact  of  hurricanes  this  quarter  being  o ffset  by  faster  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter. Conditioning  assumptions  remain  favorable,  with  households'  net  worth  higher  and  long-term  rates  lower  than anticipated. These  developments,  coupled  with  ongoing  gains  in  employment  and  favorable  sentiment  readings, should  be  consistent  with  solid  advances  in  consumer  spending  in  the  near-term.

In  2018,  fiscal  policy  is  expected  to  provide  some  support  to  disposable  income  at  a  time  when  the  effect  on consumption  from  net  worth  appreciation  is  starting  to  wane. Uncertainty  surrounding  the  timing,  nature,  and size  of  the  Trump  Administration's  fiscal  policy  measures  persists.  As  in  the  Tealbook,  we  have  halved  the  size  of the  fiscal  policy  expansion,  with  the  stimulus  now  widening  the  primary  budget  deficit  by  half  of  one  percentage point  of  GDP.  The  smaller  size  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  is  in  part  o ffset  by  lower  interest  rates  and  a  weaker  dollar. Overall,  we  continue  to  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  a  low  of  4.0  percent  by  the  end  of  2018.

In 2019,  the  tightening  of  monetary  policy  brings  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  below  potential,  and  thus  the unemployment  rate  starts  to  rise. We  view  the  recent  slowdown  in  inflation  as  a  temporary  phenomenon,  and continue  to  expect  inflation  to  stay  close  to  target  in  2018  and  beyond. The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on another  25  bp  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  in  December,  and  four  25  bp  increases  in  both  2018  and  2019.  Our federal  funds  rate  assumption  is  coupled  with  a  contraction  in  the  SOMA  portfolio  starting  in  October  of  this  year. The  projected  removal  of  policy  accommodation  is  more  gradual  than  in  June,  reflecting  a  lower  estimate  of  the equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  and  a  smaller  fiscal  stimulus.

We  view  our  current  assessment  of  the  likely  size  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  package  as  providing  a  baseline  with risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  that  are  roughly  balanced.  As  concerns  prices,  there  is  the  possibility  that the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  what  we  are  currently  estimating. A  countervailing  risk  is  a nonlinear  response  of  inflation  associated  with  low  levels  of  the  unemployment  rate.  From  a  policy  standpoint,  it  is worth  mentioning  that  long-term  yields  remain  very  low  by  historical  standards,  even  when  taking  into  account  a reduction  in  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest.  If  this  pattern  persists,  the  federal  funds  rate  may  need  to  increase by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  assuming.

Respondent 9: My  basic  forecast  is  for  real  GDP  to  grow  slightly  above  its  trend  rate,  1  3/4  percent,  this  year andnext.  I have modified that forecast for storm effects, lowering the growth rate by 1.2 percent in the third quarter and  raising  it  by  0.6  percent  in  each  of  the  next  two  quarters. I expect  that  real  GDP  will  grow  at  its  trend  rate in  2019. And  with  the  funds  rate  above  its  longer-run  level,  growth  is  slightly  below  trend  in  2020. This  forecast assumes  no  change  in  fiscal  or  other  economic  policies,  since  the  prospects  for  significant  change  are  uncertain  at this  time.

Respondent 10: We  project  real  GDP  growth  to  average  2.7  percent  over  2017H2,  up  from  2.2  percent  in the  June  SEP  submission. Growth  of  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers  is  projected  to  be  a  little  below  2 1 / 2 percent,  while  inventory  investment  contributes  about  +0.3  percentage  point  to  growth.  On  balance,  net  exports are  expected  to  be  a  modest  drag  on  growth,  due  largely  to  an  anticipated  faster  pace  of  growth  of  real  imports  in Q4. With  the  upward  revision  to  H2,  we  project  real  GDP  growth  of  2.4  percent  for  2017,  up  from  2.1  percent  in June.  Growth  is  then  projected  to  slow  to  slightly  below  our  assumption  of  the  potential  growth  rate  (1.8  percent) over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon  due  largely  to  a  tightening  of  financial  conditions  associated  with  the gradual  normalization  of  monetary  policy.

In  thinking  about  the  details  to  this  forecast,  we  see  the  fundamentals  for  consumer  spending  as  remaining solid,  with  strong  labor  market  conditions  prompting  continued  real  disposable  income  growth,  high  aggregate household  wealth,  and  robust  consumer  confidence. As  such,  we  project  real  PCE  growth  to  be  2.4  percent  for this  year,  but  then  to  slow  to  around  2  percent  in  2018  and  2019  as  part  of  the  general  slowing  of  growth,  with  the personal  saving  rate  drifting  down  somewhat. In  the  housing  sector,  low  inventories  of  single-family  homes  and improvements  to  the  existing  housing  stock  should  support  residential  investment  over  the  coming  quarters.

Business  fixed  investment  grew  at  a  7  percent  annual  rate  over  2017H1,  a  significant  improvement  over  the preceding  two  years.  However,  much  of  that  strengthening  is  due  to  the  energy  sector,  which  should  fade  over  time given  our  flat  projected  path  for  oil  prices. We  have  raised  our  near-term  real  equipment  investment  projection

since  the  June  submission,  but  nonresidential  structures  investment  is  anticipated  to  be  weaker. On  balance,  we expect  relatively  modest  growth  of  fixed  investment  over  the  forecast  horizon,  as  has  been  a  feature  of  this  cycle.

Since  June  the  dollar  has  depreciated,  and  we  now  expect  the  trade-weighted  dollar  to  decline  6.1  percent  in 2017.  Combined  with  the  robust  growth  rates  for  the  global  economy,  we  project  stronger  export  growth  and  slower import growth for  2017  than  in  June;  consequently,  the  net export  contribution to real  GDP  growth is  now  expected to  be  +0.1  percentage  point.  However,  with  foreign  real  GDP  growth  projected  to  slow  and  the  dollar  anticipated to  appreciate  in  real  terms,  the  net  export  growth  contribution  is  projected  to  be  -0.2  and  -0.4  percentage  point  in 2018  and  2019,  respectively.

As  has  been  the  case  for  recent  submissions,  we  do  not  incorporate  for  now  a  fiscal  stimulus  into  our  forecast, as  we  believe  that  any  tax  reform/tax  cut  legislation  will  take  longer  to  emerge  than  many  reports  suggest. We therefore  anticipate  the  growth  contribution  from  the  government  sector  to  be  essentially  zero.

Through  sometime  in  2018H1,  we  expect  the  economy  to  grow  somewhat  above  its  potential  rate,  further reducing  labor  market  slack.  The  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  is  however  modest,  due  to  firming  productivity growthandaverygradualriseoflaborforceparticipation.  Wehaveloweredourprojectedpathoftheunemployment rate: That  rate  is  anticipated  to  average  4.2  percent  over  2018H1,  and  then  rise  to  4.3  percent  by  2018Q4  and  to 4.4  percent  by  2019Q4.  Average  monthly  gains  in  nonfarm  payroll  employment  should  slow  from  around  170,000 in  2017  to  120,000  in  2018  and  100,000  in  2019.

While  core  inflation  has  slowed  in  recent  months,  we  suspect  that  the  bulk  of  this  slowing  is  due  to  temporary factors.  The  CPI  data  for  August  were  consistent  with  this  hypothesis.  Nonetheless,  the  2017  increase  of  the  core PCE  price  index  is  projected  to  be  1.5  percent. In  light  of  the  lower  near-term  path,  we  have  reduced  slightly  our projection  for  2018  core  PCE  inflation  to  2.0  percent.  Core  inflation  then  is  projected  to  rise  to  2.2  percent  in  2019 and  remain  slightly  above  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective  in  2020.

Respondent 11: My forecast  calls  for  output  growth  of  about  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon.  I  continue  to expectthatsomefiscalstimulus maybeforthcoming overthenext twoyears, butbecause thetimingandmagnitude is  uncertain  it  is  not  yet  meaningfully  a ffecting  my  point  forecast.  However,  I  see  some  upside  risk  to  output  growth and  downside  risk  to  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  medium  term. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  remain below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  as  output  grows  at  about  its  trend  pace  and  the labor  force  participation  rate  declines. Headline  inflation  is  being  held  down  by  transitory  factors  and  as  these factors  wane  headline  inflation  moves  up  to  the  2  percent  target  in  2019.  With  gradually  rising  inflation,  near-trend output  growth,  and  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  monetary  policy  becomes  less accommodative  over  the  forecast  horizon. However,  accommodation  is  removed  at  a  gradual  pace  in  light  of  the economic  uncertainties  surrounding  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  and  trade  reform,  productivity  growth,  and  inflation dynamics.

Respondent 12: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy. In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them.  The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon.  Monetarypolicyisregime-dependentandcanbeviewedasoptimalgiventhecurrentregime.  Longerterm, the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast  the  we  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 13: My  outlook  consists  of  modestly  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  two  years,  supported  by a  moderate  pace  of  consumption  and  investment  spending.

ff does. I see  the  economic  impact  from  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  in  much  the  same  way  as  the  Board  sta Relative  to  my  baseline,  third  quarter  growth  is  likely  to  be  depressed  by  roughly  1/2  to  a  full  percentage  point, o ffset  by  a  similarly  sized  (perhaps  slightly  larger)  increase  in  the  fourth  quarter.  I  do  not  see  these  events  as  having a material  effect  on  my  medium-term  outlook. However,  the  impact  on  the  incoming  data  stream  adds  further noise  to  the  task  of  teasing  out  signals  on  the  underlying  pace  of  economic  growth.

As  for  inflation,  despite  the  recent  soft  readings,  I  see  inflation  converging  to  target  next  year. Over  the  next few  months,  the  impact  from  the  recent  hurricanes  will  be  felt  in  the  retail  price  statistics,  with  the  largest  boost to energy  prices  coming  in  September. The  latest  futures  markets  data  imply  that  gasoline  prices  will  return

to  their  early-August  levels  by  the  end  of  the  year. While  there  remains  considerable  uncertainty  regarding  any hurricane-effects  on  core  inflation,  I  have  yet  to  mark  that  into  my  baseline  outlook.

I view  the  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  as  balanced. I have  not  incorporated  any  changes  in  either  fiscal  policy or  other  government  policies  into  my  baseline  outlook.  If  there  are  eventual  changes  in  fiscal  policy,  they  are  likely to  be,  on  net,  expansionary  in  the  near-to-medium  term.  On  the  other  hand,  it  is  possible  that  the  negative  effects from  the  hurricanes  prove  to  be  more  persistent  than  what  I  expect.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  balanced.  While  recent  history  suggests  that  the  response  of  inflation to  resource  slack  is  somewhat  muted,  it  may  be  more  pronounced  at  high  rates  of  resource  utilization.  On  the  other hand,  after  a  number  of  years  with  below-target  inflation,  it  is  possible  that  inflation  expectations  are  becoming entrenched  at  a  level  lower  than  is  consistent  with  our  mandate.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  accommodative monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement in labor  markets,  and  relatively  low  oil  prices. Consumer  and  business  sentiment  remain  positive. Consistent with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding qualified  workers,  and  the  increasing  need  to  raise  wages  in  order  to  retain  workers  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and occupations.  The  global  outlook  has  improved  over  the  last  year. Inflation  rates  here  and  abroad  are  fluctuating around  a  general  upward  trajectory,  supported  by  accommodative  monetary  policy.

In  the  near  term,  I  expect  that  the  destruction  caused  by  the  recent  hurricanes  will  reduce  output  growth  in  the third  quarter,  while  rebuilding  efforts  will  boost  growth  somewhat  over  the  subsequent  couple  of  quarters. Some inflation  measures  will  be  elevated  in  the  near  term,  reflecting  higher  gasoline  prices  and  other  prices  related  to rebuilding  efforts. However,  I  expect  that  the  hurricanes  will  have  a  limited  impact  on  the  overall  economy  over the  medium  run.

IntheU.S.,therecouldbesomeformofexpansionaryfiscalpolicy,althoughthedetailsarestillunknown.  While I've  incorporated  fiscal  policy  assumptions  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook,  my  modal  forecast  is  not  dependent  on fiscal  policy;  I  expect  that  fiscal  stimulus  will  provide  only  a  modest  increase  to  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon.

The  U.S.  economy  has  been  growing  at  a  moderate  rate  and  labor  market  conditions  have  strengthened  over the  last  year. From  the  standpoint  of  the  cyclical  conditions  that  monetary  policy  can  address,  I  believe  we  are  at or  somewhat  beyond  maximum  employment.

While  some  recent  readings  on  inflation  have  been  soft,  transitory  factors  have  played  a  role. Measured  yearover-year,  inflation  is  notably  higher  than  it  was  in  2015  and  most  of  2016  and  is  not  far  from  our  2  percent  goal. I view  inflation  expectations  as  reasonably  well-anchored. This,  coupled  with  continued  strengthening  in  labor market  conditions  and  ongoing  economic  growth,  suggests  that  inflation  will  gradually  move  to  2  percent  on  a sustained  basis  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Although  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  fiscal  and  other  government  policies,  I  view  overall  uncertainty  as roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years.  As  described  above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 16: The  economy  is  expanding  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  the  slow  pace  of  growth  in  potential output,  which  has  pushed  the  unemployment  rate  lower.  Going  forward,  the  strength  in  labor  market  hiring,  faster wage  growth,  and  gains  in  household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  climate  for  future fixed  business  investment  appears  to  have  improved  given  the  continued  expectation  of  lighter  regulatory  burdens and  improving  prospects  abroad.  Given  the  diminishing  prospects  for  any  new  fiscal  stimulus,  our  modal  forecast assumes  no  measurable  net  impact  on  economic  growth  over  the  next  few  years  from  such  initiatives.  I  expect  the economic  disruptions  from  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  to  be  transitory. The  likely  hurricane  impacts  include  a contraction  in  economic  activity  on  the  order  of 3 / 4 percentage  point  in  the  third  quarter,  followed  by  a  rebound  in subsequent  quarters  that  will  add  to  real  GDP  growth  a  cumulative  1  to  1 1 / 4 percentage  points.  I  also  expect  the hurricanes  to  provide  a  small  temporary  boost  to  inflation.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  above  potential.  Output  and unemployment  gaps  were  closed  in  2016.  With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  place,  I  expect  these  gaps  to overshoot  for  the  next  few  years,  leading  to  a  gradual  pickup  in  inflation  over  the  next  few  years.  I  expect  inflation to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  2019,  and  to  overshoot  slightly  in  2020.  Normalization  of  monetary  policy  will  help bring  inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the  following  year  or  two.

September 19-20, 2017

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: I have  revised  up  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017  and  2018  modestly  since  June  in response  to  the  stronger  tone  of  recent  indicators  of  business  investment  and  net  exports,  somewhat  more  favorable financial  conditions  (mainly  the  dollar),  and  somewhat  stronger  foreign  activity.  Taking  into  account  a  somewhat stronger  outlook  for  GDP  growth,  as  well  as  the  recent  sideways  movement  of  the  unemployment  rate  despite continued  strong  employment  growth,  the  projected  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  a  touch  lower  than  before.

Although  the  hurricanes  will  cause  noticeable  quarter-to-quarter  movements  in  real  activity  and  inflation,  I don't  anticipate  that  they  will  have  much  of  an  effect  on  the  Q4/Q4  growth  rates  of  either  real  GDP  or  consumer prices  in  2017  and  beyond.  Similarly,  they  shouldn't  have  much  of  an  effect  on  Q4  unemployment  rates.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: My  forecast  is  largely  unchanged,  except  for  small  updates  that  reflect  incoming  data. I revised  down  my  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  slightly  in  the  medium  term  to  reflect  both  recent improvements  in  labor  market  data  and  a  lower  longer-run  unemployment  rate. The  downward  revision  in  the projected  unemployment  path  left  my  estimate  of  the  degree  of  resource  utilization  largely  unchanged  because  I also  revised  down  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate. Hence,  I  have  not  changed  my  view  of  the appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Near-term  core  inflation  has  continued  to  decline  since  the  previous  SEP  and  the  economy continues  to  add  jobs  without  a  notable  decrease  in  the  unemployment  rate  or  increasing  wage  pressures. This reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  continues  to  be  a  significant  amount  of  slack  in  the  economy. At  this  point  I am  concerned  that  the  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate  since  late  2015  may  be  slowing  the  economy  prematurely. As  a  result,  I  think  a  more  accommodative  policy  than  I  had  projected  in  June  is  necessary  and  appropriate.

I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 6: My  projections  assume  a  somewhat  shallower  path  for  r*  than  in  March,  based  partly  on  the belief  that  policies  which  significantly  enhance  productivity  and  labor-force  growth  are  unlikely  to  be  enacted  and partly  on  persistently  low  longer-term  market  yields.

In  response  to  incoming  data  I  have  upwardly  revised  my  near-term  GDP  growth  projection  and  downwardly revised  my  near-term  inflation  projections. I've  lowered  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  make  it  more consistent  with  projected  GDP  growth.

Respondent 7: The  strength  in  the  incoming  data  led  us  to  revise  up  our  growth  projection  for  2017  by  0.3 percentage  points. (Our  adjustments  for  the  hurricanes  essentially  cancel  out  in  the  Q4-to-Q4  growth  number.) In  June,  we  had  assumed  a  small  boost  to  growth  in  2017  from  an  increase  in  defense  spending. Given  legislative developments  since  then,  we  moved  those  outlays  into  2018  in  the  current  projection.

Our  regular  post-NIPA  revision  review  of  the  data  led  us  to  reduce  our  estimate  of  potential  output  slightly. This  change  was  o ffset  in  our  forecast  for  actual  growth,  however,  by  some  small  upside  factors. As  a result, the  projected  GDP  gap  throughout  the  forecast  period  is  slightly  more  positive  than  in  our  June  forecast. This configuration  also  led  to  a  small  downward  revision  to  our  unemployment  rate  forecast  in  2018  and  2019.

ff price  moveWe  think  that  some  of  the  recent  low  readings  on  core  inflation  were  due  to  idiosyncratic,  one-o ments.  However,  we  also  think  that  there  is  some  more  meaningful  signal  in  these  data  pointing  to  a  softer  underlying  inflationary  trend.  Accordingly,  we  brought  our  inflation  forecast  down  0.1  percentage  point  throughout  the projection  period.

In  addition,  as  noted  above,  we  reduced  the  estimated  long-run  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points to  2.75  percent  based.  In  accordance,  we  have  one  fewer  rate  increase  (in  2018)  in  our  path  for  appropriate  policy.

Respondent 8: The  forecast  has  not  changed  materially  since  June,  both  in  terms  of  activity  and  inflation.  As already  mentioned,  however,  the  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  slower  pace  of  tightening  of  monetary  policy,  which reflects  a  lower  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate  and  a  smaller  fiscal  stimulus.

Respondent 9: My  projections  have  changed  relatively  little  since  June  submission  when  I  anticipated  two more  rate  increases  in  2017. However,  I  am  not  shifting  down  my  funds  rate  path  but  shifting  it  out  in  time  effectively  by  3  months.

ff (as  of  September  13)  is  assuming  a  one  percentage  point  reduction  of  Q3  GDP  growth  due  to  the Respondent 10: Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  will  likely  depress  the  Q3  growth  rate  somewhat. We  have introduced  a 1 / 4 percentage  point  hit  to  the  Q3  growth  rate,  mainly  through  slower  PCE  growth  and  a  slower pace  of  inventory  investment  due  to  production  disruptions,  but  assume  that  it  is  made  up  in  Q4.  By  comparison, the  Board  sta hurricanes,  and  a  modestly  larger  rebound  in  Q4. Our  assessment  is  guided  by  how  quickly  economic  activity has  rebounded  following  even  very  severe  storms  such  as  Hurricane  Sandy. Indeed,  a  Tealbook  chart  indicates that  daily  electronic  retail  spending  in  Texas  returned  to  its  baseline  within  six  days  of  Hurricane  Harvey  making landfall,  similar  to  the  experience  around  Hurricane  Sandy.  Another  o ffsetting  effect  is  that  supplies  flow  into  the storm-a ffected  areas  from  non-a ffected  areas,  likely  resulting  in  a  boost  to  production  in  non-a ffected  areas.

BecauserealGDPgrowthinthefirsthalfwasalittlehigherinH1thanweexpectedinJuneandtherecentactivity data  suggest  stronger  growth  in  the  H2,  we  have  raised  our  near-term  real  GDP  growth  projection.  Nevertheless, we  still  expect  real  growth  to  slow  to  near  potential  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon.  With  somewhat  stronger near-term  growth,  we  now  see  a  slightly  lower  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  the  near  and  medium  term.

The  overall  and  core  inflation  forecasts  for  2017  are  lower  than  they  were  in  our  June  SEP  submission,  reflecting thesoftinflationdataoverthepastseveralmonthsuntiltheAugustCPI.Aswestilljudgethissoftnessastemporary, we  project  that  inflation  will  rise  in  the  medium  term  and  slightly  overshoot  the  FOMC's  longer-run  inflation objective  in  2019  -  20. This  overshoot  helps  to  ensure  that  inflation  expectations  do  not  begin  to  fall  below  the objective  and  thus  helps  to  achieve  the  Federal  Reserve's  mandated  objectives  over  the  longer  run.

Our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  unchanged,  with  a  mild  overshoot  of  the  longer-term  policy rate  meant  to  ensure  that  the  overshoot  of  inflation  and  undershoot  of  unemployment  are  temporary,  and  the longer-run  objectives  are  met  in  the  early  2020s.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  is  largely  unchanged  from  last  time.

Respondent 12: Recent  data  has  caused  us  to  change  our  inflation  projections  for  2017.

Respondent 13: I have  marked  up  output  growth  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  in  response  to  the  strength in the  recent  (pre-hurricanes)  economic  data. At  the  same  time,  I  have  lowered  my  2017  inflation  projections, reflecting  the  continued  string  of  soft  retail  price  reports.

ff projection,  although Respondent 14: Asnotedabove, I haverevised downmycentralforecastforfiscalstimulusinthe mediumrun. I  continue  to  put  some  weight  on  the  prospects  for  a  tax  cut,  of  a  size  similar  to  that  in  the  sta implemented  a  bit  later.  As  a  consequence  of  these  reduced  prospects  for  tax  cuts,  I  have  revised  down  my  path  for the  federal  funds  rate,  both  in  the  medium  and  in  the  longer  run.  My  forecast  for  GDP  and  the  unemployment  rate are  little  changed  from  June,  however,  because  foreign  growth  has  strengthened  and  led  to  some  easing  of  financial conditions  through  currency  depreciation.  Also,  stronger  incoming  data  suggest  more  momentum  in  the  economy, and  the  lower  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  provides  some  o ffset.

Respondent 15: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  has  changed  little  since  June.  Because  price  and  wage  inflation have  been  moderate,  I  edged  down  my  core  inflation  forecast  for  2018,  but  I  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  gradually firm  over  the  forecast  horizon.

As  in the Tealbook,  I  have  reduced  the  size  of  the  effect of expansionary  fiscal  policy  since  my  last  SEP submission,  but  fiscal  policy  has  not  been  an  important  component  of  my  SEPs,  having  only  a  minor  positive  effect on  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon.

In  the  near  term,  I  expect  that  the  destruction  caused  by  the  recent  hurricanes  will  reduce  output  growth  in  the third  quarter,  while  rebuilding  efforts  will  boost  growth  somewhat  over  the  subsequent  couple  of  quarters. Some

inflation  measures  will  be  elevated  in  the  near  term,  reflecting  higher  gasoline  prices  and  other  prices  related  to rebuilding  efforts. However,  I  expect  that  the  hurricanes  will  have  a  limited  impact  on  the  overall  economy  over the  medium  run.

I view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as  appropriate  given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to remain  below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  is  projected  to  gradually  move  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  next year  or  so. My  funds  rate  path  is  slightly  flatter  next  year  compared  to  my  June  projection,  reflecting  a  slightly weaker  path  for  inflation.

Respondent 16: Since  June  I  have  dropped  my  placeholder  assumption  that  there  will  be  any  meaningful fiscal stimulus  or  other  government  policy  initiatives  that  will  a ffect  the  economy. My  modal  projection  now assumes  that  fiscal  policy  will  not  have  a  meaningful  impact  on  growth. Even  without  additional  fiscal  stimulus, stronger  than  expected  equity and  labor markets  should  boost  consumption  and  investment  through the  remainder of  the  year. Additionally,  the  dollar  has  declined,  reducing  the  drag  from  net  exports. Therefore,  my  projection for  growth  in  this  year  is  higher  compared  to  June.

The  hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma  led  me  to  make  adjustments  to  my  near  term  forecast  of  economic  activity  and inflation. Combining  effects  from  disruptions  with  recovery  efforts  and  a  rebound  in  economic  activity,  I  expect no  effect  in  my  medium  term  projections.

My  inflation  projection  is  revised  down  a  bit  for  this  year  due  to  weaker  than  expected  data  in  the  second quarter  and  July. I expect  this  to  be  mostly  due  to  transitory  factors  with  only  a  small  impact  on  my  projections for  inflation  in  2018  and  2019.

September 19-20, 2017

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Relative  to  my  outlook,  the  Tealbook  implicitly  incorporates  a  much  higher  effective  level of the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  over  the  medium  term,  while  assuming  that  (very)  long-run  real  federal  funds rate  is  somewhat  lower.  The  Tealbook  also  incorporates  a  higher  natural  rate  of  unemployment  and  assumes  that long-run  inflation  expectations  are  at  a  lower  level  (that  is,  are  below  2  percent).

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Unlike  Tealbook,  my  forecast  does  not  incorporate  a  change  in  the  stance  of  fiscal  policy. Consistently,  my  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2018  is  lower  and  my  projected  path  for  the  unemployment rate  is  flatter  than  in  Tealbook.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: My  forecast  for  economic  activity  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook. However,  I  believe the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  keep  the  labor  force participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job  growth  on  the  unemployment  rate. I now  project  that  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually  than  in  the  Tealbook.  Even  with lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  return  to  target  later  than  in  the  Tealbook.

I have  not  assumed  any  changes  to  government  policies.

Respondent 6: I  am  projecting  somewhat  weaker  GDP  growth  this  year  and  next  than  does  the  Tealbook,  but somewhat  faster  growth  in  2019  and  2020.  The  net  result  is  that  the  unemployment  rate  falls  by  almost  as  much  as in  the  Tealbook  baseline.  Despite  a  similar  unemployment  path,  I  anticipate  a  slightly  faster  increase  in  inflation than  is  forecasted  by  Board  sta  . In  my  view,  the  longer-term  inflation  expectations  relevant  to  wage  and  price setting  remain  anchored  at  2  percent,  and  inflation  remains  fairly  responsive,  albeit  with  a  lag,  to  labor-market slack. Most  significantly,  I  have  a  substantially  shallower  policy  path  than  does  the  Tealbook. I think  that  the Tealbook  policy  path  would  almost  certainly  trigger  a  recession.

Respondent 7: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  next  three  years,  ending 2020  at  2.75  percent. Furthermore,  unlike  the  Tealbook,  we  do  not  overshoot  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds rate  during  the  projection  period.

With  regard  to  growth,  in  the  near  term,  we  currently  have  somewhat  smaller  effects  from  Hurricane  Harvey and  Irma  built  in  to  our  forecast.  Our  projections  for  Q4-to-Q4  growth  in  2017,  2018,  and  2019  are  very  close  to  the Tealbook's.  However,  given  our  slightly  higher  assumption  for  potential  output  growth,  our  output  gap  at  the  end of  2020  is  about 1 / 2 percentage  point  smaller  than  the  Tealbook's. In  terms  of  labor  market  slack,  our  projection for the  unemployment  rate  averages  about  0.2  percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook,  and  we  assume  the natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  about  0.3  percentage  point  lower. Accordingly,  our  3.9  percent  unemployment rate  projection  for  2020:Q4  undershoots  the  natural  rate  by  less  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Our  outlook  for  inflation  is  somewhat  more  pessimistic  than  the  Tealbook's,  as  we  feel  that  even  with  our  more accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy,  actual  inflation  will  not  return  to  target  until  2020.

Respondent 8: The  two  forecasts  are  qualitatively  similar.  The  Tealbook  forecast  features  a  somewhat  faster pace  of  growth  relative  to  potential,  which  brings  the  unemployment  rate  down  to  a  lower  level  than  in  our  forecast. The  conditioning  assumptions  for  monetary  policy,  fiscal  policy,  households'  net  worth  and  the  dollar  are  similar in  the  two  forecasts.

Respondent 9: The  Tealbook  forecast  is  for  relatively  stronger  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2017. I believe that  growth  is  currently  fluctuating  around  the  2.1  percent  average  we  have  observed  since  the  end  of  the  recession. In  addition,  in  my  projection,  some  of  the  rebound  from  the  third  quarter's  storm  effects  occurs  in  early  2018.

Respondent 10: As  in  the  June  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and our  projections  for  the  key  SEP  variables. In  part,  these  differences  reflect  divergences  in  some  of  the  underlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts. In  particular,  the  Tealbook  forecast  incorporates  a  fiscal  stimulus  in  the  form of a personal  income  tax  cut  that  commences  in  2018Q1. As  we  said  in  our  answer  to  4(a),  we  currently  do  not incorporate  changes  in  fiscal  policy  in  our  projection  as  there  still  is  not  enough  information  regarding  their  nature, magnitude  and  timing.

Over  the  near  term,  the  Tealbook  assumes  a  larger  disruption  to  Q3  activity  from  Hurricanes  Harvey  and  Irma than  is  assumed  in  our  projection. However,  both  projections  assume  a  sufficient  rebound  in  Q4  such  that  the disruptions  do  not  have  a  material  effect  on  2017  growth.

The  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2018  -  19  than  in  our  outlook. Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment of  potential  GDP  growth,  which  is  below  our  assumption  in  2017  -  20,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to  a notably  positive  output  gap  in  those  years. Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output  gap, our  assessment  is  that  it  is  at  most  modestly  positive  at  that  time.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  two  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption.  The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2018  -  19  than  in  our  projection;  this  is  a  long-standing  difference between  the  two  forecasts,  which  has  been  exacerbated  by  the  Tealbook's  fiscal  policy  assumption  that  helps  to boost  its  projection  of  consumption  growth  in  2018.  Another  effect  of  the  Tealbook's  fiscal  policy  assumption  is  a projected  saving  rate  that  is  above  our  projection  in  2018  -  19.

Another  notable  difference  between  the  projections  is  the  underlying  assumptions  on  the  longer-run  natural rateofunemployment,whichtheTealbookhasat4.8percentandwehaveat4.6percent.  Combinedwithourgrowth projections,  we  anticipate  that  unemployment will  modestly  undershoot its natural  rate over  the  projection period; in  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects  the  unemployment  to  undershoot  the  longer-run  natural  rate  significantly  in 2018  -  20.  This  pattern  is  a  counterpart  of  the  sizable  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.  The lower  unemployment  rate  path  also  contributes  to  higher  projected  payroll  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

ff has  raised  its  projected  path  of  the  participation  rate,  in  the  Tealbook  this  rate  still  declines  to  62.5  percent One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation. In  our projection,  the  participation  rate  rises  very  gradually  to  63.0  percent  in  2018  and  2019. Even  though  the  Board sta at  end-2019.  This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  differ  notably. We  see  inflation  rising  to  2  percent  in  2018  and  modestly  above that  level  in  2019  -  20  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade. In  contrast,  the  Tealbook  projects core  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  in  2019,  despite  a  sizable  undershooting  of  unemployment,  and  then  running persistently  above  that  level  in  the  early  2020s. The  considerable  persistence  of  inflation  and  the  flat  Phillips curve  within  the  Tealbook  framework  appear  to  require  a  prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  in  order  to induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. As  mentioned  previously,  the  overshoot  of  inflation in  our  projection  occurs  to  prevent  inflation  expectations  from  falling  below  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  both  projections  see  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels  and risks  broadly  balanced.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  below  the  Tealbook  path  for  2018  -  20.  In  addition,  our  assumption  for  the longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  now  25bps  above  that  of  the  Tealbook:  As  we  have  not  incorporated  a  fiscal  policy stimulus  in  our  forecast  to  this  point,  we  did  not  have  to  make  fiscal  policy  adjustment  to  r*  as  the  Tealbook  did. Both  policy  paths  have  an  overshooting  of  the  longer-run  FFR  in  2019  -  20,  although  the  Tealbook's  is  appreciably larger,  which  is  a  reflection  of  the  larger  projected  positive  output  gap  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 11: I  have  not  included  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  in  my  forecast  due  to  uncertainties  about  timing and  magnitude.  My  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  remains  more  accommodative  than  the  Tealbook  over the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 12: For  GDP  growth  and  inflation,  our  projections  are  quite  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook. Differences  arise  because  the  Tealbook  projections  incorporate  the  idea  of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the  economy  transitions  to  the  longer-run

steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. Our  regime  conception,  in  contrast,  views monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  those  regimes  are  quite  difficult  to  forecast. This suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook. The Tealbook  forecast  also  has  a  substantial  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  before  returning  to  its  longer-run value  of  4.8  percent.

Respondent 13: My  projection  for  cumulative  real  GDP  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon  is  similar  to  the Tealbook,  though  I  project  slower  growth  in  the  short-run  and  stronger  growth  in  2020. My  projection  has  a higher  long-run  growth  trend  owing  to  a  somewhat  stronger  productivity  assumption.  Unlike  the  Tealbook,  I  am not  forecasting  a  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  in  2018  due  to  my  somewhat  lower  projection  for  employment growth  next  year  and  my  somewhat  higher  projection  for  the  labor  force  participation  rate.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  labor  market conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  gradually  rise  to  our  2  percent  goal. The  inflation  and labor  market  dynamics  in  my  outlook  differ  from  those  in  Tealbook: our  inflation  paths  are  similar  but  I  do  not project  as  great  a  fall  in  the  unemployment  rate.  Thus,  compared  to  the  Tealbook,  I  see  inflation  somewhat  better anchored  at  target  and  see  somewhat  stronger  inflationary  pressures. On  balance,  my  funds  rate  path  over  the next  two  years  is  similar  to  that  in  the  Tealbook.  My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook, but  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around  those  assumptions.

Respondent 16: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  to  3.7  percent  at  the  end  of  2019,  and  with  inflation  returning  to  the  2 percent  target  only  very  gradually. In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and output  through  2019,  and  those  gaps  close  in  the  following  year  or  two. Despite  strong  financial  conditions,  I  am not  seeing  much  evidence  in  the  data  that  this  is  translating  into  higher  growth  in  consumer  or  business  spending. I see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  3.9  percent  by  the  third  quarter  of  next  year.

The  Tealbook  continues  to  factor  in  fiscal  stimulus  for  the  first  half  of  2018.  In  my  projections  I  do  not  expect fiscal  policy  to  lead  to  a  change  in  growth.

The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows growth  to  below  potential  in  2019. This  pushes  up  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.2  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. Finally,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  2019  and  results  in  a slight  overshooting  of  inflation  for  some  time  afterwards.  Tighter  monetary  policy  brings  inflation  back  to  target and  unemployment  close  to  its  long-run  sustainable  level  in  2020.
