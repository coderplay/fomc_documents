1. Projections of real GDP growth, PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are fourth-quarter-to-fourthquarter growth rates, i.e. percentage changes from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the indicated year. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures and the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, respectively. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook

Respondent 1:

The  drag  from  housing  and  from  slower  consumption  and  investment  growth  implies  very  slow  growth  in the first half. In particular, consumption  will be weak because of lower house and equity prices, slower growth  in  real incomes  (and  high  oil  prices), and  tighter  credit  conditions. Capital  spending  will  be  weak, responding  to  slower  growth,  higher  uncertainty,  and  in  some  cases  tighter  credit. Lower  interest  rates  and export  demand  will  provide  some  support. There  is  a  significant  possibility  that  the  economy  will  soon  enter (or  is in)  a technical  recession,  in  which  case  unemployment  will  rise  by  more  than  I  have  pro jected. A  fiscal package  could  raise  growth  temporarily  later  this  year  and  early  in  2009.

Credit  quality  is deteriorating,  by  the  most  in  mortgages  (including  HELOCs)  but  also  in  numerous  other categories. A  significant  slowdown  could  cause  serious  credit  problems,  retrenchment  in  lending,  and  intensification of financial  market  turmoil,  which  in  turn  would  affect  the  real  economy. Sharper  than  expected declines  in  house  prices  (which  might  be  more  likely  to  occur  if  growth  slows)  would  also  affect  credit  quality and thus the economy  (over and above wealth effects). Credit quality concerns are the most significant source  of  downside  risks  to  growth.

Stabilizing energy prices, not-to o-rapid increases in food prices, and a softer economy  and  labor market should  reduce  overall and  core inflation. Firms  may  be  able  to pass through  some  of  their elevated  input costs  but  this  passthrough  will  be  limited  by  weak  demand. A  recession,  either  mild  or  severe,  poses  downside  risks  to  inflation. A  stronger  than  expected  economy  or  new  increases  in  oil  and  commodity  prices  pose upside  risks.

Respondent 2:

Significant  uncertainty  for  2008  with  respect  to  impact  of  financial  institution  weakness  on  broader  economy (credit  channel)

Respondent 3:

Growth  in  the  first half of this year slows significantly to an average  pace  of one percent. Several factors contribute to this very muted  pro jected pace of economic  activity. Continued  substantial  declines in residential investment  are expected  to subtract at least one full percentage point from real GDP  growth  in the first two quarters of the year. This weakness  is coupled with a noticeable slowdown  in consumption expenditures. High  oil  prices  and  lower  initial  conditions  for  housing  and  equity  wealth  weigh  heavily  on  the consumer. In the second  half  of  the  year, growth  resumes  a  faster  pace  as  a  result  of  more  accommodative monetary  policy, less drag from  residential investment  and  an  improvement  in  consumption  expenditures. The  improvement  in  consumption  expenditures  arises  from  waning  effects  of  oil,  more  stimulative  monetary policy  and  the  recently  proposed  fiscal  stimulus. In 2009,  growth  accelerates  to  a  pace  above  potential. Low interest rates, improvements  in  equity  wealth  (but  not  in  housing  wealth), and  standard  multiplier  effects ensure  a  broad-based  acceleration  in  demand.

The  unemployment  rate  peaks  at 5.3 percent over the summer  of this year before declining gradually to 5.1 percent  by  the  end  of  2009. The  unemployment  rate  drops  an  additional  three  tenths  of  a  percent  over the  course  of  2010  on  the  heels  of  still  accommo dative  monetary  policy. Since  the  unemployment  rate  stays above  our  estimate  of  the  NAIRU  over  the  forecast  horizon,  inflation  moderates  to  a  pace  below  two  percent in 2009  and  2010.

Risks  to  economic  activity  continue  to  be  skewed  to  the  downside. While  there  have  been  improvements  in financial  markets,  conditions  have  yet  to  return  to  normal. Tighter  credit  markets,  coupled  with  the  contin-

ually  deteriorating  housing  market,  have  the  potential  to  exert  more  restraint  on  spending  than  is  currently embedded  in  our  baseline  forecast. The  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  are  broadly  balanced,  although  a  more severe contraction  could imply  a noticeable decline in core inflation. Emerging  slack  in the labor market should  yield downward  pressure  on  wages  and  prices. We  continue  to  view  the pass-through  from  oil  and the  dollar  as  limited.

Respondent 4:

Our  central  pro jection has the US  economy  growing  substantially  below  its  potential  rate  during  the  first half of 2008 as the housing  correction  continues  and  as the rate of growth  of spending  by  consumers  and businesses  slows. By  the  second  half  of  2008  growth  recovers,  aided  by  the  preemptive  path  of  monetary  policy  and  a  fiscal  stimulus  package  of  about  $150  billion,  and  remains  slightly  above  its  potential  rate  through 2009. Although  we  see  a  substantial  slowdown  as  most  likely  outcome,  the  chance  of  a  recession  is  high.

The downturn in housing production and sales has continued to surprise to the downside. Relative to sales,  inventories  of  unsold  new  homes  remain  quite  elevated. Absent  a  significant  rebound  in  sales,  housing starts and prices will remain under downward  pressure. However, with our lower assumed  path for the federal  funds  rate,  residential  investment  is  now  seen  as  recovering  modestly  in  2009.

We  pro ject a continued gradual moderation  in core inflation. Total inflation runs marginally above core in 2008  due  to  higher  food  and  energy  prices  but  then  moves  in  line  with  the  core  projection. This  path  for inflation  is  based  on  inflation  expectations  remaining  well-contained,  our  assessment  of  the  FOMC  objective, and  the  opening  of  an  output  gap  in  2008.

There are a number  of risks to our central projection. The first is that trend productivity growth will differ significantly from  our conditioning  assumption. Our  larger concern  is that productivity  growth  will remain  below  that  assumed  trend  for  a  considerable  period  of  time. The  second  is  a  steeper-than-assumed rise of the personal  saving  rate  resulting  from  negative  housing  and  stock  market  wealth  effects. The  third and  most  important  at  the  moment  is  that  the  recent  turmoil  in  financial  markets  has  produced  a  sustained tightening of financial conditions that will restrict the supply  of credit to U.S. consumers  and  producers. Aside  from  direct  impacts  on  current  economic  activity,  the  financial  turmoil  may  have  a  more  long-lasting downside  impact  by  amplifying  the  effects  of  the  first  two  risks  on  the  downside. The  upshot  is  that  we  see substantial  downside  risks  to  real  activity.

For inflation, we see the balance of risks to the downside as a consequence of the substantial downside risks to real activity. However,  potential  pass-through  of  higher  costs  stemming  from  higher  energy/import prices  and  a  possible  lower  tra jectory  for  productivity  raises  some  upside  concern.

The  combination  of  this  risk  profile  and  the  ongoing  volatility  in  financial  markets  produces  elevated  uncertainty  around  our  central  pro jection.

Respondent 5:

The  forecast  for  real  GDP  predicts  below-trend  growth  throughout  2008. The  forecast  incorp orates  further weakness  in  housing  markets  and  the  financial  sector  spreading  to  consumer  and  business  spending. Although the  supply  of  unsold  homes  is  expected  to  edge  lower  during  2008,  recovery  in  the  housing  sector  is  likely  to be slow  and  protracted. As  a consequence,  only  a  modest  recovery  in  real  output  growth  is  anticipated  for later  2008  and  into  2009. As  a consequence,  we  expect  some  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate.

We have considered the possibility that conditions in the financial system will further deteriorate, and as a consequence  hinder  flows  of funds from  savers to investors and  consumers. We  consider  this to be a serious  downside  risk  to  economic  growth.

For the inflation outlook, weaker real output growth should mitigate some of the upward  price pressure

arising from  energy  prices,  one  source  of  rising headline  inflation  numbers  in  recent  periods. On  the  other hand,  our  outlook  also  reflects  the  persistence  of  inflation  apparent  in  recent  years.

Respondent 6:

The  U.S. economy  is resiliant; it will adjust in 2008 to the financial turmoil that began  in August  2007, though  the  speed  of  adjustment  is  uncertain.

Respondent 7:

Financial  conditions  have  tightened  significantly  since  October  as  wealth  has  shrunk,  risk  spreads  have  risen, and  the  emerging  credit  crunch  has  intensified. Housing  activity  has  continued  to  fall  below  even  very  weak expectations,  and  recently  labor  market  conditions  have  deteriorated. We  have  seen  early  signs of a slowdown  in  consumer  spending;  given  falling  house  and  equity  prices,  slower  employment  growth,  high  energy prices, and  tightening  credit  conditions,  further  slowing  is  likely  in  coming  quarters. In summary,  I  see  the economy  as  perched  on  the  edge  of  recession,  with  substantial  downside  risks.

Inflation has gradually risen over the period. However, inflationary concerns are mitigated by a number of factors: inflation expectations  have  been  well anchored, energy prices have begun  to head  down  in response  to  growing  concerns  about  a  weakening  worldwide  economy,  and  weaker  growth  in  the  U.S.  economy should  generate  more  slack  in  product  and  labor  markets,  thereby  putting  some  downward  pressure  on  inflation.

I assume  that  the funds rate is reduced  somewhat  more  in  the  near  term  and  that  policy remains  highly accommodative  over the next year. In addition, I assume the adoption of a fiscal stimulus package by midyear  with  a  magnitude  similar  to  the  one  in  the  Greenbook. While  these  actions  are  too  late  to  prevent  a significant  economic  slowdown  in  the  first  half  of  this  year,  growth  gradually  begins  to  pick  up  in  the  second half,  rising  above  trend  in  2009. The  unemployment  rate  rises  gradually  through  early  2009  and  then  begins to drop  toward  the  NAIRU  of  4-3/4  percent. Core  PCE  inflation  declines  gradually  to  1-3/4  percent  in  2009 and  2010,  which  I  view  as  consistent  with  price  stability. The  funds  rate  reaches  a  trough  of  2-3/4  percent later  this year  before  rising  gradually  to  its  equilibrium  rate  of  4  percent  by  the  second  half  of  2010.

Respondent 8:

In the near term, we expect  the disappearance  of  important  financing  vehicles  to  further  restrain  housing demand. This, along with the build up of inventories, will likely lead to further significant reductions in home  construction. Tighter  financial  conditions  are  also  exerting  moderate  levels  of  restraint  in  other  sectors of the economy. In addition,  labor  market  conditions  are  uncertain  and  may  restrain  growth  in  household spending. Over  time,  financial  conditions  should  improve  and  monetary  and  fiscal  stimulus  should  support growth  at,  and  for  a  time  above,  potential. The  build  up  of  a  modest  level  of  resource  slack  should  help  to offset the  effects  on  inflation  of  higher  energy  and  commo dity  prices  and  the  weaker  dollar.

An  important  risk  is  that  financial  restraints  could  increase,  further  dampening  economic  activity. Weaker activity  could,  in  turn,  further  impair  capital  positions  and  decrease  lending  and  borrowing  capacities.

Respondent 9:

The  incoming  data  have  been  somewhat  weaker  than  expected  in  my  October  pro jection: tight  credit  market conditions  led  to  further  deterioration  in  the  housing  market,  and  spillovers  to  the  rest  of  the  economy  are somewhat  more  evident. I assume  trend  growth  of  2.7  percent  but  remain  uncertain  about  how  much  of  the recent  productivity  slowdown  is  transitory  and  how  much  is  more  persistent. I expect  the  economy  to  return to near-trend  real  GDP  growth  by  late  2008  as  the  housing  correction  runs  its  course  and  the  worsening  of financial market  conditions  abates. Monetary  policy  easing  may  lead  to  upward  pressure  on  core  inflation in 2009 and  2010. I assume  a long-run  neutral funds rate of about  4.5 percent. However,  a  period  of an above-neutral  funds  rate  may  be  necessary  to  restrain  expectations  and  keep  inflation  from  rising. Thus,  I do not rule out the possibility that an above  neutral  funds  rate  might  be  needed  early  in  2009  in  order  to

bring  inflationary  pressures  back  to  a  rate  consistent  with  my  long-run  goal.

Respondent 10:

Declines  in  housing  activity  continue  to  damp  output  growth  considerably  in  H1  08,  and  to  a  gradually  lesser extent  thereafter. Uncertainty  about  the  outlook,  along  with  reduced  availability  and  tighter  nonprice  terms of credit exert downward  pressure  on  demand  outside  of  housing  in  08; credit terms begin to ease in the second  half  of  08, but  the  relaxation  is  gradual  and  leaves  terms  and  conditions  in  09  much  tighter  than  in 06.

Respondent 11:

Although  liquidity  considerations  have  improved,  the  disruption  to  the  credit  market  is  still  severe  and  has the potential  to get much  worse. Recent  widening  of  credit  spreads  and  tightening  in  the  Senior  Loan  Officer Survey  is particularly  worrisome. As  a result the economy  will  be  slowing  substantially  in  H1  and  be near  recession  conditions. The  disruption  to  the  credit  markets  and  concerns  that  consumer  spending  could deteriorate  from  the  Greenbook  forecast  suggests  that  there  is  substantial  downside  risk  to  growth.

Although  recent  PCE  inflation  numbers  have  not  been  great,  there  is  going  to  be  some  slack  in  the  economy, while  long-run  inflation  expections,  a  key  determinant  of  inflation,  continue  to  be  solidly  grounded  around 2.0

Respondent 12:

My  outlook  for  '08  and  '09  resembles  the  'persistent  weakness'  scenario  presented  in  the  Greenbook,  largely because  of problems  in financial institutions and  markets, the likelihood of further deterioration in credit quality,  the  time  required  to  work  off  excess  inventories  in  the  housing  sector,  and  the  evident  lack  of  positive momentum  in  the  broad  economy  at  the  moment. However,  by  2010,  I  expect  that  many  of  these  conditions will  have  changed  for  the  better  and  that  the  economy  will  expand  at  a  pace  above  trend. A  key  part  of  this outlook  is  that  performance  in  the  next  two  years  will,  akin  to  the  'headwinds'  episode  following  the  90-91 recession,  be  constrained  by  the  high  cost  and/or  unavailabilty  of  credit  to  some  potential  borrowers.

Respondent 13:

Weak  business  investment  and  further  declines  in  residential  investment  will  depress  growth  this  year. As the  risk  of  recession  recedes  later  in  the  year,  the  Committee  will  need  to  withdraw  stimulus  in  order  to  meet its inflation  goals. Growth  is  therefore  below  trend  next  year.

Respondent 14:

The  potential  tail  risk  of  significant  economy-wide  impacts  of  the  financial  markets  turmoil  and  the  housing sector could  results in a substantial  slowing  of consumption  and  more  balance  sheet  pressure  for  financial institutions,  which  in  turn  has  a  dampening  impact  on  consumption  and  investment.

Respondent 15:

Persistent  strength  in  global  demand  generates  continuing  upward  pressure  on  food  and  energy  prices  and upside  headline-inflation  risk.

Increases  in  energy,  commo dity,  and  other  import  prices  spill  over  into  core  inflation  as  firms  pass  through higher  costs  from  past  increases  in  such  prices.

Policy is biased toward restrictiveness in order to limit the danger of an upward creep in inflation expectations.

The  possibility  that  the  economy  slips  over  into  a  recession  dynamic  contributes  to  elevated  real-side  uncertainty  and  creates  asymmetric  GDP  and  unemployment  risk.

Respondent 16:

The  decline  in  consumer  sentiment,  a  substantial  decline  in  equity  prices,  and  a  tightening  of  credit  terms leads to a substantive slowdown in consumer spending. Uncertainty about the extent of the decline in housing  prices  depresses  residential  construction  throughout  2008  and  to  a  lesser  extent  2009. Solid  growth abroad  continues  to  contribute  to  improving  net  exports. Deterioration  of  business  sentiment,  and  decreases in equity  prices  accompanied  by  more  restrictive  financial  conditions,  dampen  nonresidential  investment.

The  risks to my  outlook include a substantial further deterioration in financial conditions, higher energy prices,  a weakening  in  growth  abroad,  and  a  potential  upward  drift  in  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 17:

- (1) The  federal funds rate is reduced  by 50 basis points at this meeting  to 3.0 percent. However,  as the economy  begins  to  recover,  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  removing  this  additional  accomo dation  by  the  fourth quarter  of  this  year. I assume  the  federal  funds  rate  rises  to  4.5  percent  in  2009  and  then  is  reduced  to  4.25 percent  in  2010.
- (2) Growth  is below trend in 2008 and then rises back to trend by 2009. Weak  growth  is due to higher energy prices, a larger drag from housing, a lower level of stock prices, and tighter financial conditions. As  these conditions  dissipate, along  with  an  accommo dative  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  stimulus,  I  expect growth  will  pick  up  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  approach  trend  in  2009.
- (3) Residential  investment  continues  to  decline  through  the  first  3  quarters  of  2008,  before  flattening  out  in the  fourth  quarter. It then  makes  a  small  contribution  to  growth  in  2009  and  2010.
- (4) Greater weakness in consumption, housing, and commercial construction remain downside risks. In addition,  the  recent  global  turmoil  may  increase  the  risk  that  export  growth  may  be  weaker  than  pro jected.
- (5) Despite  below  trend  growth,  an  accommodative  monetary  policy,  higher  energy  and  commo dity  prices, and  greater  dollar  depreciation  pose  upside  risks  to  the  expected  moderation  in  core  and  overall  inflation.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  judgements  and  assumptions  affecting  your economic  projections  in  the  third  year.

Respondent 1:

The  inflation  projections  for  2010  reflect my  views  of the levels of inflation that combine  a  reasonable  approximation  to  price  stablity  (allowing  for  measurement  error)  with  some  buffer  against  zero-b ound  problems.

The growth estimate for 2010 is close to my  estimate for potential growth. The unemployment  rate  for 2010  is above  my  estimate  of  the  NAIRU,  which  will  not  be  reached  until  the  end  of  2011.

Respondent 2:

On  the path of returning to trend levels, but not yet at steady-state. Tax and trade policy uncertainty expected  to  impact  2010  economic  performance  negatively

Respondent 3:

Potential  GDP  growth  is  2  percent. The  NAIRU  is  4  percent. The  Federal  Funds  rate  is  brought  to  2  percent by  the  end  of  2008  and  kept  at  that  level  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 4:

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  well-contained  between  2-2.5

Respondent 5:

Our  third  year  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  reflects  our  current  estimate  of  long-run  potential  growth. On the  inflation  side,  we  are  assuming  that  inflation  expectations  remain  well-contained  and  policy  is  adjusted as needed  to  attain  a  rate  of  inflation  slightly  below  2  percent.

Respondent 6:

2010  real  growth  is  a  pro jection  that  reflects  a  judgment  about  potential  GDP  growth  and  that  the  economy will follow approximately  along  that  path. The  2010  inflation  rate  is a pro jection that reflects my  desired outcome  for  inflation  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 7:

In 2010, my  forecast  shows  inflation that is consistent  with  price stability. Real  GDP  growth,  the  rate  of unemployment,  and  the  real  funds  rate  are  all  near  their  long-run  sustainable  levels.

Respondent 8:

We  place  potential  output  growth  at  2.6

Respondent 9:

Real output  is growing  at about  a trend pace of 2.7 percent in 2010, the unemployment  rate  is  about  at its natural rate of 5 percent  and  inflation is running  slightly above  my  long-term  goal  of 1.5 percent. As mentioned  in 4(a), monetary  policy easing may  lead to upward  pressure on core inflation and raises the risk that  inflation  expectations  begin  to  drift  upward. If this happens,  in  contrast  to  my  baseline  forecast, monetary  policy would  have to tighten significantly in 2009 and possibly remain  above a neutral rate in 2010,  in  order  to  keep  inflation  from  rising,.

Respondent 10:

Inflation  of  2 or a little below  is  an  acceptable  medium-term  objective;  potential  GDP  grows  at  around  2.5 percent;  The  NAIRU  is  in  the  neighborhood  of  4-3/4  percent.

Respondent 11:

Long-run  inflation  objective  at  2.0

Respondent 12:

See  the  comment  about  2010  above;  also,  expect  the  economy  to  be  approaching  a  sustainable  path  by  then, given  appropriate  policy.

Respondent 13:

Real  growth  is  above  trend  as  the  output  gap  narrows. The  FOMC's  goal  for  overall  inflation  is  1.5  percent.

Respondent 14:

My  judgments  and  assumptions  are  largely  consistent  with  those  described  in  the  Greenbook,  with  the  exception  that  I  assume  that  after  considerable  easing  in  2008,  the  FOMC  would  bring  the  federal  funds  rate back  up  by  the  final  projection  year.

Respondent 15:

The  drag  from  housing  and  the  credit  crunch  fades  away. GDP  growth  is  strong  enough  to  put  some  downward  pressure  on  the  unemployment  rate. Inflation is contained,  but  some  gap  between  headline  and  core rates  persists.

Respondent 16:

I have defined appropriate  policy  over  this horizon  as one that is consistent with achieving  PCE  inflation slightly  less  than  2  percent  and  I  have  adopted  assumptions  for  labor  productivity  and  employment  growth that  are  consistent  with  potential  GDP  growth  of  2.6  percent.

Respondent 17:

The  economy  returns  to  potential  in  2009  and  2010. Demographic  changes  contribute  to  a  fall  in  potential growth  in  2009  and  2010. Potential  growth  is  estimated  to  fall  from  2.7  percent  currently,  to  2.6  percent  in 2009  and  2.5  percent  in  2010.

Core  PCE  inflation  declines  to  an  appropriate  level.

The  federal  funds  rate  is  close  to  neutral.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook

Respondent 1:

Slightly more  pessimistic  on  near-term  growth,  because  of  weight  placed  on  at  least a mild recession, but slightly more  optimistic  on  potential  growth,  due  to  higher  pro jection  for  multifactor  productivity  growth.

Respondent 2:

Expect  greater  labor  market  resiliency  in  2008

Respondent 3:

Conditional  on  the  same  Federal  Funds  rate  path,  the  Greenbook  and  our  forecasts  are  similar,  though  our forecast  implies  a  bit  more  underlying  strength. Since  we  are  factoring  in  more  easing  than  in  the  Greenbook, our  forecast  envisions  faster  GDP  growth  in  2009  and  2010.

Respondent 4:

We  project  a  higher  growth  rate  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline  in  the labor force participation  rate  will occur  later and  more  slowly  than  assumed  in  the  GB.  We  assume  lower inflation  persistence  than  does  the  GB.  Due  to  our  different  assumed  path  for  interest  rates  we  see  less  real depreciation  of  the  dollar. We  pro ject  a  quicker  recovery  in  residential  investment  than  the  GB.

Respondent 5:

Though  we  see  slightly  weaker  real  GDP  growth  in  the  near-term,  and  a  somewhat  slower  recovery  of  the economy  toward  its potential, our forecast for real economic  growth  does  not  appreciably  differ from the Greenbook. Our  inflation  outlook  is  somewhat  less  optimistic  than  the  Greenbook,  reflecting  our  judgment that  temporary  pressures  from  energy,  food,  and  import  prices  will  unwind  more  slowly  than  the  Board  staff forecast  suggests.

Respondent 6:

Marginally  more  optimistic  than  the  Greenbook  on  real  GDP  growth

Respondent 7:

My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  about  the  same  as  the  Greenbook  in  2008,  but  shows  a  more  pronounced pickup  in  2009. Part  of this is due  to the assumption  of  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  and  part  is due  to the assumption  that  the  effects  of  the  fiscal  package  will  be  longer  lasting. Faster  real  GDP  growth pushes  the  unemployment  rate  lower  than  the  Greenbook  in  2009. Finally, I see core PCE  inflation  falling to 1-3/4  percent  by  2009, slightly lower  than  in the Greenbook,  mainly  because  I  continue  to  believe  that inflation  is less persistent  than  it  was  a  decade  or  so  ago.

Respondent 8:

Our  modal  forecast  is  more  optimistic  about  the  timing  and  strength  of  the  cyclical  rebound  in  real  activity.

Respondent 9:

I assume  the  labor  force  grows  at  close  to  1  percent  per  year. Private  nonfarm  payroll  employment  growth averages  about  30  thousand  jobs  per  month  in  2008,  and  rebounds  to  around  130  thousand  jobs  per  month pace  in  2009. In 2009  and  2010,  the  economy  is  growing  at  about  trend.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

Very  little difference. I worry  about  a  little weaker  growth  in  2008  H1  because  I  worry  that  the financial factors  may  be  more  damaging  to  economic  growth. I have  a  little  stronger  growth  in  2009  and  2010  because I believe monetary  policy  can  get  the  output  gap  back  nearer  zero  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  period, with inflation  settling  in  at  my  long-run  inflation  objective.

Respondent 12:

Covered  in  4(a)  above.

Respondent 13:

Our  estimate  of  trend  real  GDP  growth  is  2.7  percent. We  believe  that  the  equity  premium  will  shrink  as earnings  forecasts  are  lowered,  and  we  are  not  forecasting  rapid  stock  price  appreciation. We  expect  further declines  in  housing  starts.

Respondent 14:

Broadly  similar.

Respondent 15:

I expect  higher  and  more  persistent  inflation.

Respondent 16:

I have  a slightly weaker  2008:H1  growth  outlook  than  the  Greenbook. Underlying  this  weakness  is  a  lower growth  path  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  that  is  only  partially  offset  by  stronger  nonresidential fixed  investment. Also,  I  have  a  weaker  consumer  reaction  to  the  proposed  fiscal  stimulus  in  the  second  half of 2008. Over  the  balance  of  the  forecast  horizon,  my  pro jection  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 17:

My  near-term  outlook  is less pessimistic than Greenbook's  outlook. In addition, with an accommo dative policy, growth  returns to trend in 2009. Finally, with policy returning to neutral more  quickly, inflation approaches  desired  levels  in  2009  and  2010,  rather  than  2012  as  in  Greenbook's  long-term  outlook.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the projections submitted ahead of the June FOMC meetings.

Respondent 1:

Data  indicate  a  sharper  slowdown  than  expected  in  housing,  consumption,  and  employment. Employment particularly  concerning,  as  solid  employment  conditions  have  supp orted  consumption  growth. Financial  turmoil  deeper  and  more  persistent,  with  greater  downside  risks  to  credit  quality,  than  anticipated  in  October.

Respondent 2:

Deeper  weakness  pro jected  for  credit  channel

Respondent 3:

Headline  GDP  pro jections  are  not  too  different,  but  are  conditioned  on  a  much  more  accommodative  path of monetary  policy. In addition,  the  composition  of  demand  has  changed  somewhat. We  now  expect  weaker residential  investment  this  year  and  stronger  net  exports. The  outlook  for  consumption  would  be  noticeably weaker  than  in  October  if it were  not for the added  monetary  and  fiscal  stimulus. Moreover,  the  starting point for the unemployment  rate  is  higher  than  what  was  expected  in  October. The  inflation  outlook  has not  changed  materially.

Respondent 4:

Although expenditure data for 2007Q4  and revisions to 2007Q3  were consistent with our pro jection for GDP  in  2007H2,  recent  forward-looking  indicators,  the  steep  increase  in  energy  prices  in  2007Q4,  and  the sustained  financial  market  turmoil  have  produced  a  significant  change  in  our  pro jection  for  GDP  in  2008-9. In October  we  expected  some  further  reduction  of  housing  production,  but  the  decline  in  housing  starts  and new  home  sales  has  turned  out  to  be  more  severe  than  expected. On  balance,  the  excess  supply  of  unsold  new homes  remains  higher  than  anticipated. Moreover,  the  ongoing  disruptions  in  the  supply  of  mortgage  credit have  led  us  to conclude  that  the  correction  in  both  housing  production  and  valuations  will  be  steeper  than previously assumed. In addition the employment  report  and  ISM  Manufacturing  survey  for  December  as well  as  the  Philly  Fed  survey  for  January  are  consistent  with  an  abrupt  decline  in  business  confidence. This interpretation  is  also  consistent  with  the  fall  in  stock  market  values  and  changes  in  the  Treasury  yield  curve. The  larger-than-expected  downturn  in  housing  and  ongoing  financial  turmoil  has  produced  large  increases in the  downside  risks  to  our  near-term  real  activity  forecast  since  October.

Incoming  data  since  October  have  led  us  to increase slightly our core inflation projection  for 2007Q4  and 2008H1. A  range  of  models  of  inflation  suggest  that  this  higher  inflation  is  unlikely  to  persist  partly  due  to well-contained  inflation  expectations  and  partly  due  to  the  projected  slowdown  in  the  US  economy.

The  largest  change  in  our  pro jections  since  October  has  been  in  our  assumption  for  the  appropriate  path  of policy in 2008. We  view  the  continued  financial  market  turmoil  and  asso ciated  effects  on  credit  as  having lowered  the  neutral  policy  rate  at  least  temporarily  by  around  75bp. Combining  this  with  the  change  in  our projection  for real activity, well-contained  inflation  expectations  and  the  need  to  act  preemptively  against the large  increase  in  downside  risk  to  growth  implies  an  appropriate  policy  path  with  a  substantially  lower real federal  funds  target  rate  path  in  2008  relative  to  that  of  October.

Respondent 5:

The  data  releases  for  October  and  November  were  mixed. However,  the  data  releases  and  anecdotal  reports for December  have  been  much  weaker  than  anticipated. The  spike in the unemployment  rate,  flatter  real personal  income  less  transfers,  and  the  consistently  disappointing  reports  from  housing-related  sectors  support  a forecast  that  suggests  negative  spillover  from  the  housing  market  to  consumer  and  business  activity.

In  addition,  the  incoming  data  has  caused  us  to  significantly  increase  our  2008  forecast  for  headline  inflation, with  a  smaller  increase  in  our  pro jection  for  core  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 6:

Information  received  since  October  suggests  a  somewhat  lower  near-term  outlook  for  growth  and  a  marginally higher  near-term  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 7:

I have  lowered  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  and  my  funds  rate  path  over  the  next  year  or  so  and  raised my  assessment  of  the  downside  risks  to  growth  because  of  recent  financial  developments,  as  well  as  weakerthan-expected  data  on  housing,  employment,  and  personal  consumption  expenditures.

Respondent 8:

Reports  on  housing  showed  greater  deterioration  than  expected. Declines  in  equity  prices  and  lower  expectations  for  housing  values  suggest  negative  wealth  effects  on  consumption. The  weak  December  employment report  also suggested  less  optimism  about  the  strength  of  consumption  growth. Finally, businesses  appear to have  increased  their  caution  about  hiring  and  capital  spending.

These negative developments  were  partially offset by expectations of greater monetary  policy easing and the  prospect  of  fiscal  stimulus.

Recent  data  on  inflation  have  been  somewhat  worse  than  expected  and  energy  and  other  commodity  prices have  risen,  leading  to  slightly  higher  forecasts  for  core  and  total  inflation.

Respondent 9:

The  incoming  data  have  generally  been  weaker  than  expected  at  the  time  of  my  October  forecast. Tighter lending  conditions  and  a  deeper-than-expected  housing  slump  have  led  me  to  revise  downward  my  real  GDP growth  forecast  for  2008. The  weaker  economy  led  to  a  downard  revision  of  my  near-term  funds  rate  path. However,  monetary  policy  easing  risks  unanchoring  inflation  expectations  so  the  funds  rate  needs  to  increase to 4.5 percent  by  early  2009.

Respondent 10:

The  effects of deeper housing  contraction  and  tighter credit conditions lasting longer are nearly offset by easier  monetary  policy. Inflation  pressures  are  a  little  more  intense  reflecting  increases  since  October  in  food and  energy  prices  and  in  the  nonmarket  comp onents  of  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 11:

The  worsening  problems  in  the  credit  market  and  substantially  weaker  residential  construction  have  led  to  a substantial  markdown  in  growth  and  a  rise  in  unemployment. Also  the  downside  risk  to  growth  and  upside risk to unemployment  have  increased  appreciably. My  inflation  forecast  is  slightly  higher  in  2008  and  2009 because  of  the  recent  higher  inflation  numbers,  but  my  2010  forecast  is  the  same  because  I  expect  inflation to settle in where  long-run  inflation  expections  are  grounded,  consistent  with  my  inflation  objective,  which has  not  changed.

Respondent 12:

The  principal  changes  are  to  GDP  growth  and  to  unemployment,  with  unemployment  increasing  to  higher levels  because  growth  is  appreciably  slower  than  pro jected  previously,  for  the  reasons  already  describ ed. The inflation  forecast  is  a  touch  higher  than  that  presented  previously  because  core  inflation  has  been  a  bit  more stubborn  than  expected  and  because  of  the  performance  of  energy  prices.

Respondent 13:

The data on real activity have been weaker than expected, especially data concerning the labor market. Inflation  has  been  higher  than  expected.

Respondent 14:

We  have had a variety of indicators, from the labor market to the housing market, come  in softer than anticipated  so  I have  marked  down  GDP  growth  and  marked  up  the  unemployment  rate. Near  term  inflation numbers,  both  core  and  headline, have been  a bit higher than  I had  anticipated  and  so I have those projections  up  accordingly.

Respondent 15:

Movements  in  oil  and  the  prices  of  other  internationally  traded  commodities  have  confirmed  earlier  concerns.

The  housing  bust has deepened, the credit crunch  has broadened, corporate bond  financing is more  constrained,  and  investors/lenders/spenders  are  more  risk  averse.

Respondent 16:

Tightening  of  credit  terms  (especially  for  households),  a  substantial  decline  in  equity  prices  since  October, worsening  of  the  housing  slump,  a  deterioration  in  household  and  business  sentiment,  and  a  higher  trajectory for oil prices  have  lead  me  to  mark  down  my  forecast  for  output  growth  in  2008  and  2009. More  persistent price  pressures  from  commo dities  and  food  resulted  in  higher  near-term  inflation.

Respondent 17:

Weaker  housing and labor market conditions, greater caution on the part of households and businesses, declines in the stock market, and tighter finanical market  conditions led to a reduction in my  near-term outlook  for  growth.
