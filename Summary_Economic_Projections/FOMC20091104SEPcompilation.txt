Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate that  the  convergence  process  will take  shorter or longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estimate  of  the duration of  the  convergence  process. You may  also include below  any  other explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

In light of the severity and  breadth  of  shocks  to the economy  and  the  continuing,  though  reduced,  risk  of more  to  come,  the  convergence process  may  well extend beyond  five  or six years  to something  closer  to  eight years.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

Convergence  process  likely  to  take  somewhat  longer.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

At a 5-6 year horizon, the economy  has yet to fully converge for output and unemployment. Given the substantial  weakness  in  my  near-term  projection,  the  convergence  process  will  likely  take  7-8  years.

Respondent 7:

I anticipate that the convergence  process  for real GDP  growth  and  inflation  will be substantially shorter than  5-6 years, perhaps  on  the  order  of  three years for  real  growth  (with a period  of overshoot  of  real  growth in the interim  during  recovery),  and  an  overshoot  in  the  interim  in  inflation  as  a  consequence  of  significant near term  growth  in  the monetary  base  supported  by  longer  term  asset  purchases  that  cannot  be  sold  off over a very short time  period. I anticipate  that the decline in the unemployment  rate  will  lag  behind  the recovery  of  real  growth.

Respondent 8:

I expect  that  the  economy  will  take  about  six  or  seven  years  to  converge  fully  because  of  the  magnitude  of the forecasted  degree  of  slack  and  the  limits  on  monetary  stimulus  resulting  from  the  zero  lower  bound  on interest  rates.

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

Unemployment  will  take  longer  than  five  or  six  years.

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12:

Convergence is likely  to be unusually slow given the  damage to the financial sector, the depth of the recession, and  the  difficult  domestic  and  global  adjustments  required.

Respondent 13:

By  2015-16 potential growth is 2.4%, down from  our current estimate of  2.5-2.7%,  as  the babyboomers  retire. A reasonable  estimate  for  the long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4.5%  to  5.5%. We  would  expect,  with appropriate  policy  and  no  further  adverse  shocks,  unemployment  to  be  in  this  range  and  the  output  gap  to be  around  zero  by  2015-16.

We  assume  long-term  inflation  expectations  to  be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's inflation  objective  to be  around  2% for  the  PCE deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Under  these  conditions,  with  the  output  gap  around  zero,  we  would  expect  PCE  inflation  of  around  2%.

Respondent 14:

Convergence  to  the  real  economy's  equilibrium  and  to  the  inflation  objective  within  five years  requires  lower long-term  interest  rates  in  the  near-term  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  baseline  outlook. Absent  such  a  reduction in long-term  rates,  it  is unlikely  that  the  dual  mandate's  objectives  will  be  achieved  within  a  five-year horizon.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

If appropriate policy is  followed, I  would expect convergence to occur  within five to six years. However, I  am concerned  that  delaying  the  removal  of  policy  accommodation  and  the  shrinkage  of  our  balance  sheet  could result in higher inflation  and  mean  more  time is required to  reach  a desired inflation  rate of 1.8 percent.

Respondent 17:

Growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  should  converge  over  the  next  5  years,  but  inflation  may  still  be  below my  preferred  long-run  rate.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economy  is  in  recovery. However,  the  impact  of fiscal stimulus  going  forward  has  raised  uncertainty  around  my  projected  path  for  real  output  growth. In addition,  the  effect  of  the  extraordinary  monetary policy  accommodation  in  place  and  the uncertainty  about the  timing of when we  will exit from that  accommodation have increased the  uncertainty  around my inflation forecast.

Respondent 8:

The  global  economic  downturn  and  uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  policy  and  unconventional  monetary policies increase  uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook for economic  activity.

Problems in commercial real estate, and more generally, the continued vulnerability of financial institutions, pose  downside  risks  to  financial  stability  and  the outlook  for  economic  activity. On  the  other  hand, more rapid healing of financial  markets and a rebound in  confidence may provide greater impetus to growth than expected.  Heightened risks to the outlook for economic  activity  and  employment, as well  as the elevated variability  of  commodity  prices,  raise  uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 9:

I believe that uncertainty regarding projections for GDP  and  unemployment  are now about average.  Inflation projections would be more firmly anchored  under an appropriate  monetary policy, and therefore uncertainty would  be  lower  than  the  trailing  20-year  average.

Respondent 10:

Volatility  was  unusually  low  during  the  past  twenty  years. I expect  that  the  future  will  be  more  volatile.

Respondent 11:

The severity of  the  recession  means the uncertainty  over cyclical dynamics is greater than it  has been over the past twenty years. The  unevenness of  the  improvement in  credit conditions-with  capital markets functioning much better but  bank  lending  still  appearing to be capacity  constrained-also  adds unusual  uncertainty. So

The  situation-of  recovery  from  severe  recession  and  financial  crisis along  with  the effects of extraordinary monetary  and fiscal stimulus-has  no precedent in post-war history  and  so uncertainty  about how agents and markets  will  respond  is  unavoidably  high.

Respondent 2:

Incoming  data  have  led  me  to  revise up slightly my  near-term  path  for  growth  and  raise  my  path  for  the unemployment  rate  compared  to  my  June  forecast. I view  the  risks to growth  and  the  unemployment  rate as roughly  balanced. Over  the  longer  term,  inflation  risk  is  tilted  to  the  upside  reflecting  uncertainty  about the  timing  of  the  Fed's  withdrawal  of  accommodation.

Going forward into  2010  as  the  economy  recovers  from  the  recent  recession  and  experiences  the  fiscal  stimulus program  as well as a substantial persistent increase  in the  monetary  base, I believe that the risks to real growth  will  become  weighted  to  the  upside. In  the  near  term  I  see  the  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 8:

Although  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  are  greater  than  usual,  they  are each  roughly  in  balance.

Quantitative judgment  based  on the difference  between projection and  expected value from FRBNY forecast distribution. For  inflation,  risks  are  to  the  downside  in  the  near  to  medium  term  and  slightly  to  the  upside in the  longer  term. Given  the  downward  revision  in  our  modal  inflation projection  since  June  we  now  assess the  overall  balance  to  the  downside

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

In the near term, the weakness of the economy  and  recent price trends pose  some  downside risks to  core  and overall inflation. However,  in  the  medium  to  long  term,  the  expansion  of  our  balance  sheet  and  increased public  nervousness about increases in  our balance sheet and federal borrowing present  upside risks to inflation.

Respondent 17:

risks to core inflation are weighted  to  the downside  by  the  possibility that inflation expectations  begin  to move  lower  as inflation continues  to come  in below  current  expectations  in  the  context  of persistent large output  gaps. The  effects of this risk on headline inflation are balanced  by the possibility that growth  in EMEs  puts  added  pressure  on  the  prices  of  petroleum  and  other  natural  resources.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  interest  rates  differ  materially from  the  interest  rate  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Greenbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: No

N/A

Respondent 2: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  federal  funds  rate  than  in  the  Greenbook  baseline. I view  the  appropriate  monetary  policy  as  one  that  raises  the  funds  rate  to  about  2.5  percent  by  the  end  of 2010 and 3.5 percent by  the end of  2011. By  the end of  2012, I  see the funds  rate at about 4.5 percent.

Respondent 3: No

N/A

Respondent 4: Yes

Expect  policy  to  normalize  materially  sooner  than  Greenbook  base  case.

Respondent 5: Yes

For  reasons  relating  to  'side  effects'  of  ultra-low  rates  (e.g.,  on  the  dollar,  inflation  expectations,  and  risktaking),  may  need  a  modest  move  toward  normalization  (e.g.,  100bp)  in  2010:H2.

Respondent 6: Yes

Due  to  a stronger  inflation  profile  in  my  outlook,  the  federal  funds  rate  begins  to  increase  gradually  in  the second  half  of  2010.

Respondent 7: Yes

While  the  pattern  of  recovery  from  the  recent  recession  is  uncertain,  I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary policy to maintain  price stability we will have to move  away  from  the current target range for the funds  rate  as  part of  the process of withdrawing  from quantitative easing  much  sooner  than  assumed in the Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 8: No

N/A

Respondent 9: Yes

I believe that  under  an appropriate  monetary policy the  committee  would  announce a numerical inflation objective. In order  to  achieve  that  objective,  the  funds  rate  will  begin  to  increase  next  year.

Respondent 10: Yes

I expect  that  the  Fed  Funds  rate  will  be  raised  above  its  current  low  level  sometime  in  2010.

Respondent 11: Yes

We  expect that the federal funds rate will follow a path near to slightly above that expected by futures markets.

Respondent 12: No

N/A

Respondent 13: Yes

Through  2009-10  identical. We  assume  the  normalization  of  interest  rates  starts  in 2011  and  continues  at a faster rate in 2012. Because of differences in our inflation forecast, the difference in real rates is less substantial. Our  views  on  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  are  close  to  the  Greenbook  assumption.

Respondent 14: Yes

The  forecast  is conditioned  on  roughly  the  same  short- and  long-term  interest  rates  assumptions  as  in  the Greenbook. But  this path  for the interest rates is not consistent  with  achieving  the  dual  mandate's  goals over  a five-year  horizon.

Respondent 15: No

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

I expect  that  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  raising  the  target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  2010,  in  contrast  to the Greenbook  assumption  that  the  current  target  range  is  maintained  through  2011. Holding  rates  down so low  so  long  would  invite  asset  imbalances  and  risk  repeating past  mistakes. In my judgment,  appropriate policy  will  also  involve  taking  steps  to  reduce  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  and  normalize  its  composition  in a timely  manner.

Respondent 17: Yes

I assume  that  the  policy  rate  begins  to  rise  around  the  middle  of  2011,  responding  to  my  slightly  stronger output  forecast  than  in  the  Greenbook.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook.

Respondent 1:

Key  factors include  widespread  expectations of slow employment  growth  and consequent drag  on consumption and  uneven  nature  of  housing  market  recovery. Key  uncertainty  is impact  of diminution  in  effects of stimulus  and  of  our  LSAP  program  in  first  half  of  2010.

Respondent 2:

The  recent  data  on  labor  markets  have  been  somewhat  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  June  forecast and  have  led me  to revise upward  slightly  my  path  for the unemployment  rate. As well, I revised up my near-term  path  for  growth  based  on  the  stronger-than-expected  data. In my  view,  the  economy  is  now  is  in recovery  and  I expect  an  above-trend  pace  of  3  percent  growth  in  2010  as  recovery  dynamics  take  hold. I expect  growth  above  trend  in  2011  and  2012. The  labor  market  recovery  is  gradual  -  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate edges down to about 6.5 percent by  the end of the forecast horizon, at  which  time it remains above the  natural rate of unemployment by  a bit over 1 percentage point. I anticipate that  inflation will  rise into 2011 then pull back in 2012 in response to tighter  monetary policy. In my view, the substantial liquidity that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  raises  the  risk  that  inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels and  that inflation expectations  will become  unanchored. To ward  off  these developments, the FOMC  will need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening  of  monetary  policy  that  begins  some  time  in  2010.

Respondent 3:

I have assumed  a very modest  boost to spending from fiscal stimulus that largely dissipates in the first half of 2010. Although  financial  market  function  is  notably  improved,  financial  firm  balance  sheets  are  still quite fragile and  some  financial  markets  remain  dysfunctional,  obstructing  somewhat  the  flow  of  credit  to households  and businesses. I also project a further  rise in  the personal  savings  rate  as  household  attempt to further improve  their  balance  sheets. Moreover,  the  extraordinarily  high  level  of  uncertainty  about  the outlook  is likely to also inhibit the recovery  process  relative  to historical experience. I have  assumed  that these types of  factors  will  combine to restrain potential growth in the economy  for some  time.

Respondent 4:

Expect  less medium  term benefit  from  fiscal  stimulus. Expect  higher  NAIRU, lower productivity,  and  somewhat  lower growth  rates throughout  forecast  period. Finding  new  equilibrium  will take somewhat  longer than  a  typical  recovery.

Respondent 5:

Moderate  growth  in  2010:H2 is  unfolding  as expected,  reflecting  the  inventory  cycle;  some  improvement  in housing and equipment  investment; support from fiscal policy, including one-off factors such as cash for clunkers  and  the  first-time  homebuyers'  credit;  continued  improvement  in  equity  and  credit  markets,  though less so in banks; some  stabilization  in household  spending;  and  stronger  global  growth,  especially  in  Asia. Slow  to  moderate  growth  (a  subpar  recovery)  is  likely  in  2010,  though  uncertainty  about  2010  is  high. An important potential drag  on  growth in  2010 is  the  likelihood of a jobless  recovery,  the product of employer caution  and  uncertainty;  the  ability  of  employers  to  wrest  productivity  gains;  and  tight  credit,  particularly relevant for smaller firms. Although  household spending  should be  supported by increased wealth,  somewhat better  credit  availability,  and  rising  income  and  sentiment,  the  weakness  in  the  labor  market  and  continuing concerns  about  household  leverage  should  restrain the increase in consumption  spending  in  2010. Global growth  will  help  manufacturing  and  increase  the  profits  of  US  firms,  but  the  effects  on  the  prices  of  oil  and other  commodities  will  be  a  negative. Also, net exports  will  not  contribute  significantly  to  overall  growth, and  the current  account  may  worsen  a  bit. Housing  may  slow  as  the  Fed  stops  buying  MBS,  foreclosures rise, and  tax  credits  expire. In all, growth  in  2010  will  be  insufficient  to  reduce  unemployment  significantly.

Beyond  2010  the  normal  recovery  pattern  should  assert  itself  more  strongly. Medium-term potential  growth rates may be slightly better, due to good productivity performance, but  there may be a downward level  shift in potential output  going  on now, reflecting lower investment,  labor  market  disruptions  (loss of skills, for example),  and  the  need  for  reallocation  among  industries. Imbalances,  including  those  related  to  bank  and household  balance  sheets,  fiscal  policy,  industry  mix,  and  the  current  account  will  complicate  the  return  to sustainable  growth.

Resource slack, including high vacancy rates in apartments, will keep core inflation moderate (probably declining  slowly). Rapid  (perhaps  too  rapid)  growth  in  emerging  markets,  plus  a  weaker  dollar,  could  put upward  pressure  on  commodity  prices,  leading  to  headline  inflation  rates  above  core  rates.

Respondent 6:

The consumer  will continue  to be under considerable  strain  well  into  2010  and possibly beyond, facing  an extremely  weak  labor market, low net worth, and tight credit conditions. Commercial  real  estate is also distressed-with  rising  vacancy  rates  and  tight  credit-and  is  likely  to  remain  so  for  some  time. Slower  inventory reductions  and  eventual  inventory  gains lead to positive contributions  to GDP  growth  over  the  next several  quarters. The  robust  resumption  of  foreign  growth,  notably  from  Asia,  supports  strong  export  growth in the  near-term.

My  forecast assumes that inflation expectations will be 'anchored' near current levels of roughly 2% throughout the forecast period. Considerable uncertainty  surrounds this assumption.  Incoming  data indicating  that either  a  substantive  deceleration  or  acceleration  in  core  prices  could  push  expectations  in  the  same  direction. Additionally, worries  of  an  impending inflationary  episode due  to  the Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet  actions could  move  expectations  higher.

Respondent 7:

The unfolding path of economic  activity in the first three quarters of 2009 is consistent with my  earlier expectation of a slowing contraction in the  first half of the year, with output bottoming  out in the middle of the  year  and  recovery  in  the  second  half. Hence  I  have  not  revised  my  previous  forecast  for  real  growth. In 2010  and  2011  I  anticipate  that  real  growth  will  occur  at  greater  than  steady-state  rates,  reflecting  normal cyclical patterns  reinforced  by a modest  impact  of  the  fiscal stimulus  package  and  the  impact  of  the substantial  monetary  stimulus  that  has  been  in  train  since  last  fall. I expect  that  subsequently  growth  will  slow and  approach  steady-state  rates. Core  PCE  inflation  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year  through  the  third quarter of  2009 is in the range of 1.5 percent at an annual  rate  - lower than I previously expected. I do  not see this  rate of inflation  abating  in  the near future. While  headline PCE inflation  from  the fourth quarter of last year through the third quarter of 2009 is slightly  less than one percent at annual rates,  recent  increases in energy prices lead me  to expect that the headline rate will approach  the core rate as 2009 progresses. Subsequently,  under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  inflation  should  approach  my  preferred  long-run  rate  of 1.5 percent, though I believe  that it will rise above that  rate in  an interim period. I do  not believe  that future energy  shocks  can  be  forecasted,  so  with  available  information  I  expect  that  core  and  headline  inflation  will be  roughly  equal  in  the  out  years  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 8:

Recent  economic  indicators-including  consumer  spending, housing starts, and industrial production-have turned positive, suggesting a moderate recovery is in train. Business inventory investment is poised to rebound  strongly. Foreign economies  also show signs of stabilizing. However, labor markets continue to deteriorate  and  business  spending  remains  weak.

Financial conditions have improved. I expect that the process of healing the banking and financial sec-

tors will proceed  slowly and impaired  financial intermediation  will interfere with the pace of recovery for some  time. In addition, households  are in  the  midst  of a  lengthy process  of  repairing  their balance  sheets that have  been  weakened  by  massive  stock  and  housing  market  losses  and  debt  accumulation. Fiscal and monetary  stimulus  provide  key  drivers  for  recovery  over  the  next  few  years.

Significant  slack in  labor  and goods  markets should keep inflation low, but well-anchored inflation  expectations  should  help  avoid  sustained  deflation.

Respondent 9:

I believe the recession ended  this  summer. The recovery is likely  to be less  robust  than  average, due to the continuing drag from  commercial construction  and a weak  recovery in housing  and  autos. I believe that  fiscal policy effects  will be  smaller  than generally projected,  and consequently my  outlook is not  heavily dependent on  the  amount  and  timing  of  additional  fiscal  policy  actions.

Respondent 10:

Financial  and  labor  markets  have  both  stabilized. However,  bank  lending  is  low  and  unemployment  is  high. At  the  same  time,  bank  holdings  of  excess  reserves  are  large.

Respondent 11:

There  is substantial  uncertainty  over  the degree  to which  losses  associated  with the deep recession  will  affect banks'  lending  capacity  and  thus  their  ability to meet  the  financing  needs  of small and  medium-sized businesses. The potential  needs  for  structural  reallocation  also impart  uncertainty both  for  actual  output and  the measurement  of  resource  gaps-although  the  gaps  will  be  very  large  for  some  time  under  plausible scenarios. Consumer  and  business  sentiment  could  prove  fragile-either  on  the  up  or  down  side-and  related potential  swings  in  confidence  impart  further  uncertainty  onto  the  forecast. Accordingly,  there  are  bimodal aspects to the outlook. In the downside  scenario, growth  is held back by continued  disruptions  to credit flows  and  the  negative  effect  on  sentiment  of  an  economy  that  does  not  bounceback  robustly  from  the  deep recession. In the upside case, accommodative policy and further improvement in credit flows support spending. Furthermore, continued gains in  output bolster  confidence enough to cause a  spurt in spending from plans that had been put on hold during  the  recession. Our forecast averages  these scenarios-but because we see both  as  very  plausible,  we  think  the  uncertainty  over  the  expected  outcome  is  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 12:

Despite  encouraging  developments,  we  are  very  far  from  being  out  of  the  woods. Wage  and  salary  incomes have  fallen sharply, putting intense  strain  on  household  finances. The  deteriorating performance  of consumer and  commercial  real  estate  loans could put new  pressure  on  the financial system  if the economy  does  not gain  meaningful  traction  soon. Fiscal  stimulus  and  a  slowing  rate  of  inventory  liquidation  will  carry  us  only so far. The  banking  outlook,  especially  for  global  banks  that  are  too  big  to  fail,  is  the  wild  card  impacting the transmission of  monetary policy. And the plethora of new economic and  regulatory initiatives is  creating uncertainty among  business  decision makers-uncertainty  that  might  retard commitments  to  expansion  of employment  and  CAPEX  in  the  U.S.

Respondent 13:

In our  central  projection,  the  recovery  of  the  US  economy  began  in  2009Q3  after  a  post  WWII  record  fourquarter  decline  of real GDP  of  nearly  4%. Indeed,  based  on  the  advance  estimate,  real  GDP  rose  at  3.5% rate  in  2009Q3,  and  growth  in  the  fourth  quarter  is  expected  to  be  comparable  to  that  of  the  third,  which  is stronger than we expected in June.  Real personal consumption expenditures  increased  3.4% in  2009Q3, due largely, but not entirely, to the boost to light-weight vehicle sales provided by  'cash for clunkers.' Similarly, single-family housing  starts have moved  up  more  than  anticipated  due  to the strong response  to the first time  home buyer  tax  credit as well  as the  success of the Fed's purchases of agency MBS in lowering  mortgage interest rates. Finally, led by the auto sector, the inventory cycle is turning  out to be  stronger than expected, likely contributing  2  to  2 1 2 percentage  points  to  the  second  half  growth  rate.

Despite the stronger-than-expected  second  half growth  of real GDP,  labor  market  conditions are turning out  to be only  modestly  better  than  expected  in  June. On  the  plus  side,  it now  looks  as  though  the  unemployment  rate  will  average  closer  to  10%  in  2009Q4  rather  than  the  10-1/2%  previously  expected. However, in 2009Q3  hours  worked  continued  to  decline  more  rapidly  than  employment  while  the  rate  of  increase  of wages and salaries continued to slow. For 2009Q3, aggregate wage and salary disbursements were 5.2% below  year-ago  levels, the steepest year-over  year decline of the post WWII  period. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have declined from  their peak but remain stubbornly high at around 530,000 per week.

In contrast, inflation has behaved  closer to our June projection. Total PCE  deflator inflation will likely increase  at  a  2%  annual  rate  in  the  second  half  of  2009  after  being  essentially  zero  over  the  first  half  of  the year, reflecting the large swings  in energy  prices. Core  inflation has been  stable, but numerous  indicators are consistent  with the  view  that the large  amount of  slack in the economy  is putting downward pressure on underlying  inflation.

For 2010 we continue to project growth of real GDP  around  2%, with the first half of the year notably weaker  than  the  second  half. If the swing  in the inventory  cycle  is very strong  in 2009Q4,  it  is quite possible that GDP  growth  could  be  could  be  considerably  higher  than  our projection for Q4  but then much weaker  in  the  first  half  of 2010. As  growth  in  2010  is  below  our  estimate  of  potential,  there  is  some  further upward  movement  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  around  10 1 4 %  by  midyear. This  is  very  sluggish  growth  for the first full year of recovery  and  is below  the  consensus  forecast. A key feature of this projection  is that the significant headwinds  confronting  the  household  sector  prevent  a  typical  cyclical  rebound  of  consumer spending. Payroll employment  is roughly five percent below its peak level and expected to recover very slowly. The  household  sector  has  made  only  minimal  progress in  reducing its substantial debt  overhang. The effects of the stimulus bill on taxes and transfers are largely behind  us, and energy  prices have increased from  recent  lows. While  the  stock  market  and  home  prices  have  risen, we estimate  that  as of 2009Q3  the ratio of household  net worth  over disposable income  remains  roughly  20%  below  its peak. Finally, while credit  conditions  appear  to  be  gradually  easing,  we  expect  them  to  remain  tight  relative  to  the  standards  of the  recent  past.

A second key feature of our forecast is that while it appears that the correction in housing production is over, it is unlikely  that  there  will be the surge  of residential  investment  because  tightened  mortgage  underwriting  standards  constrain  demand  and  high  volumes  of  foreclosed  homes  will  continue  to  come  onto  the market. Finally,  new  construction  of  multifamily  units  has  taken  a  distinct  movement  downward  reflecting excess  supply  of  condos  and  high  rental  vacancy  rates. With  consumption  and  residential  investment  recovering  on  a  gradual  path,  it  follows  that  any  recovery  of  business  investment  in  new  equipment  and  software and  new  structures  is  likely  to  be  delayed. This  is even  more  the  case  given  the  steepness  of  the  decline  of output  during  the  recession,  which  has  led  to  historically  low  capacity  utilization  rates,  rapidly  rising  retail and  office  vacancy  rates,  and  sharply  declining  prices  for  existing  commercial  real  estate. Also  contributing to the relatively tepid growth  expected  for 2010 is the ongoing  structural adjustment  taking  place in the state and  local government  sector  which  is  expected  to  result  in  significant  declines  in  employment  in  this sector for much  of  the  first half of the year. Finally, while  growth  prospects  for  our  trading  partners  have generally improved,  suggesting  a  rebound  of  exports, improving  final domestic demand  will be  associated with  rapidly  increasing imports. As a  result, net exports  are unlikely  to be a major contributor  to  growth over  the  forecast  horizon.

By the second half of 2010 and into 2011 we expect headwinds  to dissipate and the recovery to gather steam, with growth  of 4%  in 2011 and a further improvement  to  5%  in  2012. With  this above potential growth,  the  unemployment  rate  should  be  approaching  7%  by  the  end  of  2012. Underlying  this  projection  is the  expectation  that  financial  market  functioning  returns  to  more  normal  conditions  and  that  consumer  and business  confidence  and  the  general  appetite  for  risk  taking  have  been  restored. With  household  income  and

balance  sheets  improving  and  credit  flowing  more  normally,  the  substantial  pent-up  demand  for  consumer durables,  housing,  and  business  equipment  and  software  will  start  to  be  satisfied. Moreover,  the  structural adjustments of  state  and local governments  and of the  commercial  real  estate sector  will  likely have  run  their course  by  that  time.

Barring a significant decline in either or both the level of the economy's potential output or its potential growth  rate, this point forecast implies that a large output  gap  will persist over most  of the forecast horizon. Accordingly, we expect  core inflation to slow to  around 1% in  2010, with  a sizeable  risk  that it could be even  lower. But  by  late  2010  and  into  2011,  as  final  demand  firms  within  the  context  of  anchored  inflation expectations, we expect core inflation to  start a move back  towards our view of the FOMC inflation goal.

The risks to our central projection for real activity are still significant and remain skewed to the downside. In the near-term, the key risk remains  that financial market  conditions  and  consumer  and  business confidence  do  not  improve  as  assumed. This  in  turn  leads  to  lower  than  expected  asset  prices,  less  recovery in the supply  of  credit  and,  therefore,  an  even  weaker  path  for  final  demand. A  related  risk  is that,  even  if financial  markets and  asset prices behave as  assumed, the low path of household  net worth embedded in  our central projection  induces  a steeper-than-expected  increase  of  the personal  saving rate, keeping  consumer spending weaker for longer. The sharp decrease in the prime age employment  rate during the  current cycle, combined with the large share of Americans  nearing retirement age, make this risk particularly  acute.  Finally, an important  risk  over  the  medium  term  is  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our  assumption of the  economy's potential  growth  rate. There  is considerable  concern  that  with  the  weakness  of  business  investment  and  a necessary  reallocation  of  labor  and  capital,  the  economy's potential  growth  rate  has  slowed  significantly. On the other hand,  recent  productivity  numbers  have  been  surprisingly  strong. Another  source  of  risk to the forecast  is  on  the  fiscal policy  front. Under  current  law  many  of  the  tax  provisions  enacted  in  2001  and  2003 are scheduled to expire at the end of  2010. The  outcome of the  debate over these provisions could potentially have a significant impact  on  both  growth prospects  and inflation  expectations. Finally, relatively modest changes  in  variables  such  as productivity  growth,  the  participation  rate,  and  the  average  work  week  could end  up  having  a  significant  impact  on  the  ultimate  path  of  the  unemployment  rate.

The  risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  are  to  the  downside. Clearly,  the  still  significant  downside risk to the growth  projection combined  with  the possibility of no meaningful  decline in potential implies downside  risk  to  the  inflation  projection. In contrast,  with  the  aggressive  global  monetary  and  fiscal  policy response to the ongoing financial crisis could eventually raise inflationary pressures more than expected, leading  to  some  risk  of  higher  inflation  towards  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  recoveries  from  banking  and  financial  crisis  as  well  as  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  timing, magnitude,  and effectiveness  of policy  responses produces  relatively high uncertainty  around  our  central  projection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 14:

Recent  data  on  the pace of economic  activity  have  been, overall, positive. The  good  news  on  the  pace  of growth in the second half of  this year, however, has to be  placed in a  context in  which the level of economic activity  remains  very  low. The  unemployment  rate  is  now  at  a  level  very  similar  to  the  rate  hypothesized  in the stress test scenario  for  banks  conducted  earlier  this  year. There  is  still little improvement  at  this  point in privately-generated  sources of  income, with households'  disposable income being  significantly supported by the ongoing  fiscal  stimulus. Over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon,  the  economy  faces  the  challenge  of shifting  away  from  the  support  offered  by  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  to  income  generated  by  the  private  sector. In this regard,  incoming  data  are  not  very  comforting. Wage  growth  has  slowed  significantly  and  the  high level  of unemployment  suggests  continued  weakness  in  wages  over  most  of  the  forecast  horizon. In addition, credit availability  is likely to place  constraints  on  both  households'  and  firms'  spending  in  the  early  stages of the  recovery.

In all, we expect the ongoing recovery to make only a relatively small dent to the unemployment  rate gap  by the end  of 2011. Given  the  sizable slack in the labor market  over  the  forecast  horizon, the rate of core  inflation  hovers  around  zero  in  2011  and  2012.

The  risks  to  activity  have  become  somewhat  more  balanced,  but  the  downside  risks  at  this  point  are  much more costly than the potential upside, given that a faster-than-expected recovery is unlikely to generate meaningful  inflationary  pressures. The  risks  to inflation  continue  to  be  on  the  downside. Given  the  unemployment  rate  forecast,  several  accelerationist Phillips  curve  models would predict  outright  deflation starting in the  second  half  of  2010.

Respondent 16:

The  economy  has  now  begun  a  recovery  that,  over  the  next  year  or  so,  is  likely  to  be  sluggish  by  historical standards, due to some important  economic  and financial headwinds. The recovery is driven in part by highly stimulative  monetary  and  fiscal  policy. But  because  temporary  tax  incentives  pulled  forward  some auto  and  home  sales  and  the  stimulus  from  ARRA  will  turn  to  a  drag  in  the  second  half  of  2010,  the  pace of expansion is likely to be slower over the next year or so than in the third quarter of this year. The headwinds  include  some  lingering  impairment  of  financial  market  functioning,  the  problems  in  commercial real  estate  and  their  broader  implications  for  bank  lending  and  credit  availability,  the  likely  need  for  further de-leveraging  by consumers,  and  businesses'  uncertainty about  the  economic  environment. Over  the  medium term,  as uncertainty diminishes  and  consumer spending maintains a sustained rate, business spending should pick  up  and  contribute  significantly  to  economic  growth.

In light of the weakness of the economy and recent price trends, I expect core inflation to remain low through at  least the  next year. However, over  time, as the recovery continues,  inflation is likely  to move up, to a level more  in line with long-term  inflation expectations. Dollar depreciation  and  increases in energy prices  will  help  to  move  core  inflation  higher.

With  the  economy  and  financial  markets  still  in  highly  unusual  circumstances,  the  uncertainty  surrounding the  outlook for  growth  and inflation  remains high by historical  standards. However, I  think  the risks  are now broadly balanced. All of  the  headwinds  facing  the economy,  such  as  the problems in  commercial  real  estate, pose downside  risks to GDP  growth. But  on the positive side, the surprising strength of the economy  in the  third  quarter  could  maintain  momentum. Reflecting  the  overall  resiliency  of  the  economy  and  historical patterns, the sharp recession could be followed by a healthy recovery. In the case of core inflation, the weakness  of the economy  poses  a near-term  downside  risk, while the expansion  of our balance sheet and public  nervousness about  our  balance  sheet  and  federal borrowing pose longer-term upside risks.

Respondent 17:

the economy  recovers  as housing  declines, inventory  destocking, and other factors previously weighing  on demand  abate. But  the  growth  in  final  demand  continues  to  be  constrained  by  impairment  of  some  securitization  markets,  only  gradual  easing  in  credit  availability  from  banks,  past  declines  in  wealth,  and  business and  household  caution  following  the  severe  downturn  and  weak  recovery  in  labor  markets.

Forecast  Narratives (continued)

4(b). Please  indicate  the  extent  to  which  the  BEA's  redefinition  of  core  PCE inflation  has  led  you  to  adjust  your  current  projections  for  that  variable, relative  to the  projections that you  submitted  last  June. (For 2009  and beyond,  the  BEA's  redefinition  has  led  the  staff  to  raise  its  projections  for  core PCE  inflation by  about 0.1 percentage point per year.)

Respondent 1:

Same  as  staff

Respondent 2:

The  redefinition  has  had  an  insignificant  effect  on  my  forecast.

Respondent 3:

This  redefinition  had  no  influence  on  my  core  PCE  projections.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

Minimal. If number  is  needed,  say  0.0  to  0.1  per  year.

Respondent 6:

My  adjustment  is  quite  similar  to  that  of  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 7:

No  significant  change  from  the  redefinition.

Respondent 8:

I added 0.1 percentage point per year  to my  core  PCE price inflation  forecast relative to my  June 2009 projection.

Respondent 9:

This is a small item, and  it is not unusual  for a benchmark  revision  to  change  historical  values by larger magnitudes. Indeed,  despite  this  factor  the  overall benchmark  revision  for  PCE  inflation  in  Q1  was  down. Going  forward,  this change does  not  alter my  view of an appropriate  monetary policy,  nor does it change my view  of our ability to achieve  our  goals. Accordingly  I  have  not  changed  my  forecast  for  2010  and  beyond because  of  this definitional change. The  change  in  my  forecast  for  the second  half  of this year reflects the downward  revision  for  Q1  and  generally  low  inflation  readings  over  the  summer.

Respondent 10:

Not  applicable.

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12:

Because  our  inflation  forecasts  are  based  on  movements  in  trimmed-mean  PCE  inflation  and  because  'food away  from  home'  has  typically  been  included  in  trimmed-mean  inflation,  the  impact  of  the  BEA's  revisions on  our  view  of  the  inflation  outlook  has  been  negligible.

Respondent 13:

We  were  aware  of  the  redefinition  of core PCE  in  June  and  would  agree  with  the  Board  staff  that  all  else equal, it  'raises' core inflation by  around 0.1 pp. We should note that in terms of  our  short-term forecast the redefinition is  dominated by  our  uncertainty  over the effect of the extraordinary  amount of  slack  on inflation. Further,  since  we  assume  in  our  longer-run  projections  that  core  inflation  is  equal  to  total  inflation  and  this long-run  rate is pinned  down  by  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective, it would  have  no effect on our forecasts more  than  two  years  out.

Respondent 14:

BEA's  redefinition  of  core  PCE  inflation  does  not  materially  affect  the  contours  of  our  inflation  forecast.

In light of the  historical  differential,  I  have  adjusted  my  core  PCE  projections  upward  (relative  to  what  the projections  would  be  under  the  old  definition  of  core  inflation)  by  0.1  percentage  point  per  year.

Forecast  Narratives (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 1:

I continue  to be  moderately more pessimistic  on job  creation, with  concomitant  effects  on  some  other variables.

Respondent 2:

My  inflation forecast  is  less  influenced by  the degree  of  resource  utilization  in  the  economy  and so I project a higher  pace  of  inflation  over  2010-2012  than  does  the  Greenbook. Given  the  strength  of  economic  growth  in my  forecast  and  the  higher  inflation  path,  the  policy  path  is  less  accommodative  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 3:

My  baseline  trajectory  for  unemployment  and  inflation  conforms  reasonably  well  to  the  Greenbook  baseline. However, I do project a more  restrained pace of  real GDP growth and less potential output growth  over the forecast  horizon  than  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

Moderately  more pessimistic  about  2010,  due  to  concerns  about  the  labor  market  and bank  credit. A  jobless recovery  will  undercut  household  spending  growth. More  generally,  final  demand  has  not  clearly  stabilized yet. See  some  upside  risk  in  global  commodity  prices,  which  could  slow  US  growth  and  increase  US  inflation.

Respondent 6:

Following  the  relatively strong  third quarter, my  forecast includes two consecutive quarters of  declining  real GDP growth before returning to above  trend growth throughout the balance of the forecast period. Overall, output  growth  is  considerably  weaker  in  2010  and  moderately  so  in  2011.

Despite a moderately weaker growth profile, my outlook entails more core PCE  inflation in the second half of 2010  and  beyond,  primarily  due  to  an  assumption  that  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored  near current  levels  in  the  neighborhood  of  2%. Additionally,  the  recession  has  generated  a  substantial  amount  of worker dislocation, pushing up the  quantity of unemployment  that is considered  'natural'  thereby shrinking the unemployment  gap. Moreover,  my  forecast  is  likely  to imply  a smaller  reaction  of inflation to changes in the  gap.

Respondent 7:

Compared  to  the  70%  confidence  intervals indicated for the Greenbook  forecasts, the differences between the point estimates in the  Greenbook baseline  forecasts and  my  forecasts  are not different in any  meaningful statistical sense. However the time path of my projections does  differ from the Greenbook  baseline, in that I see stronger  near-term  growth  than  that  in  the  Greenbook  baseline  with  real  growth  subsequently  tapering off in 2011  and  2012. This  contrasts  with  the  increasing  real  growth  rates  that  the  Greenbook  shows  in  those years. While  my  near-term  inflation  outlook  is  essentially  the  same  as  that  in  the  Greenbook  forecast,  I  see inflation increasing  in an intermediate  period  before  returning  to  the  rate  that  I  believe is consistent  with appropriate  monetary  policy. In contrast,  the  Greenbook  forecast  sees  inflation  declining  and  persisting  at very  low  rates  for  'an  extended  period'.

Respondent 8:

My  forecast  is  very  similar  to  the  Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 9:

I believe that under  an appropriate  monetary  policy  the  public's  inflation expectations  would  be  well  anchored,  and  the  inflation  path  would  be  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook. In order  to  keep  inflation  on  target, I believe  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be  on  an  upward  trajectory  by  the  end  of  2010.

Respondent 10:

The  forecasts  are  roughly  congruent.

Respondent 11:

We  do  not  see  inflation  falling  as  low  as  the  Greenbook  does. One  reason  is  that  our  current  output  gap  is smaller  than  the  Greenbook's  because  we  did  not  change  our  view  of  historical  structural  productivity. In addition,  we  see  longer-run  inflation  expectations  as  being  consistent  with  a  higher  level  of  actual  inflation in the  out-years  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 12:

The  Greenbook  baseline  forecast  underestimates  the  continuing  drag  on  the  economy  from  damage  to  the financial sector, uncertainty created by new  economic  and  regulatory  initiatives, and the deterioration in household  cash flow. It does not take into account inducements deriving from  regulatory  and  taxation initiatives for corporations and financial investors to invest in  more  promising  markets abroad, at the expense of job creation  and  CAPEX  at  home. (Although  these  effects  are  not  quantifiable,  they  are  palpable.) It also assumes  a  too-rapid  response  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  reductions  in  the  output  gap  when  these  reductions finally do take  hold, and  underestimates  the  upward  pressure  on  commodity  prices  due  to  a  stronger world  economy.

Respondent 13:

We  assume  lower  inflation  persistence  than  does  the  GB.  Thus,  for  our  medium-term  inflation  outlook  we project  inflation  within  the  'mandate-consistent'  range  in  late  2011  under  the  assumption  of  well-anchored inflation  expectations.

Respondent 14:

The differences  to  the real  outlook  are very  minor. As concerns  inflation, we  expect core  inflation  to be  lower than  in  the  Greenbook,  as  a  result  of  a  more  meaningful  trade-off  between  inflation  and  unemployment.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

The  key differences in our forecasts are in the growth  outlook  for 2010 and the path of monetary  policy. I expect growth in 2010 to be modestly weaker than Greenbook  does, reflecting my concerns about the headwinds  facing  the  economy. I also believe that policy  will need  to be tightened  more  aggressively  than in Greenbook.  Holding  rates so low through  2011 will invite  asset imbalances and lead to a problematic  rise in inflation  expectations  and,  eventually,  inflation.

Respondent 17:

slightly  higher  growth in Q4  2009  and  2010, taking  more  of a  signal from recent positive  surprises.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

Short-term  forecast  affected  by  stronger  than  expected  activity  in  Q3.

Respondent 2:

The key  factors causing me to revise my  near-term projection  have been  the weaker-than-expected  labor market  data  and  stronger-than-expected  growth  data. However  the  basic  shape  of  my  forecast  and  the  story underlying  it  have  not  materially  changed.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

Financial  markets  continued  to  improve,  as  did  housing  and  global  activity, suggesting  a  better  near-term outlook. Consumer  spending  has  held  up  so  far. Medium-term  outlook  is  weakened  on  net  by  poor  labor market performance  and the increasing  likelihood of a jobless  recovery. Bank  credit has not  revived  even  as other  credit  markets  have  improved.

Respondent 6:

The  incoming  data  led  to  a  much  stronger  third  quarter  than  we  had  anticipated,  indicating  an  end  to  the recession. Nevertheless,  many  of  the  underlying  weaknesses  that  I  had  previously  identified  remain,  which should  produce  a  weaker  recovery  relative  to  historical  norms. In particular,  I  expect  a  deceleration  in  real output going into 2010 before we see near- or above-trend growth. I have also dampened  my  near-term inflation  outlook  since  the  June  submission  due  to  lower-than-expected  observed  price  increases.

Respondent 7:

Recent  measures  of  economic  activity  appear  to  be  evolving  as  I  had  expected  in  my  projections  from  last quarter,  hence  I  have  not  revised  my  projected  path  of  real  output. My  forecasts  for  the  unemployment  rate are unchanged  in  the  near  term, but I have  revised my  out-year  (2011)  forecast  down. I have  revised my forecast  for  headline  PCE  inflation  in  2009  upward  and  for  Core  PCE  inflation  in  2009  downward,  given  the available  data  through  the  first  three  quarters,  but  my  inflation  forecasts  (headline  and  Core  PCE)  for  2010 and  beyond  are  unchanged.

Respondent 8:

Since June, economic data have  come in  consistently  better  than I  anticipated, and financial conditions have improved  considerably. These  developments  have  caused  me  to  raise  my  forecast  for real GDP  growth  in 2009  and  2010  and  to  lower  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  correspondingly. Recent  core  inflation data have been a  touch lower than expected,  but this is balanced by  a lower  forecasted  rate of unemployment in  2010  and  thereafter. On  net, these influences  offset  and my forecast for  core  PCE  inflation is  little changed from my  June projection. The lower projected path for commodity prices has caused me to lower  somewhat my  forecast  for  overall  PCE  price  inflation.

Respondent 9:

We have raised  our  forecast for real growth in  response to positive news  on consumer  spending, housing starts  and  home  sales,  manufacturing  activity,  initial  unemployment  claims,  equity  prices,  foreign  economic activity, and corporate bond yields. The change in the inflation  forecast for the second half of this year

reflects  the downward  revision  for Q1  and generally low inflation  readings over  the  summer.

Respondent 10:

Not  applicable.

Respondent 11:

Our  revisions  have  mainly  been  to  2009:H2  and  2010:H1,  and  reflect  the  somewhat  better- than-anticipated incoming  data.

Respondent 12:

The  near-term  outlook  has  significantly  improved  due  to  the  stabilization  of  inventory  investment  and  consumer  demand, the effects of fiscal stimulus and tax incentives, and a strengthening of demand  for U.S. exports. These influences have  so  far more than  offset the deleterious effects of increased policy  uncertainty.

Respondent 13:

In June  we  judged  it  likely  that  the  US  economy  would  start  a  sluggish  recovery  in  the  second  half  of  2009 with unemployment peaking at 10.5%.  Incoming expenditure data and improved financial markets conditions has  been  led  us  to upgrade  our  near  term  GDP  forecast. While  there  are  some  tentative  signs  of  stabilization  in the  labor  market  and  overall  unemployment  has  increased  less  quickly  than  our  June  projection,  the employment  levels  of prime  age workers  continue  to drop. The  fall of close to 5 percentage  points  in the employment  to  population  ratio  of  prime  age  workers  (0.9  of  which  occurred  since  May)  is  unprecedented in the post-war  period. Given this weakness in a crucial area of the labor market, we assess that much of the improvement  in  our  near term forecast since June  is due to support  from  the extraordinary  set of government  policies used to prevent a deeper downturn  rather  than  underlying  strength. Thus, once the downward  revision  to  GDP  in  annual  NIPA  revisions  is  taken  into  account,  we  have  not  materially  increased our  forecast  for  the  level  of GDP  at  the  end  of  2011. House  prices  have  also  surprised  us  to  the  upside  but again we  attribute much of this to government policy  rather  than a significant improvement in the underlying fundamentals.

Core  inflation data (including revisions) has surprised to the downside  since June. Much  of this surprise was in non-market  priced services and thus we ignored it. On  the other hand, core goods inflation continues to surprise on the upside and core service inflation (excluding  the non-housing  non  market  prices) continues to surprise on the downside. The  differing persistence of the  core  service and core goods inflation has  led  us  to  reduce  our  inflation  projection  along  with  the  large  increase  in  slack  amongst  prime  age  workers.

The  downside  risks  to  our  central  scenario  projection  have  decreased  considerably  since  June. The  source of this risk mitigation  is continued  evidence  that  the  wide  range  of  government  policy  actions  have  gained traction  in reversing  the adverse  feedback  loop  of  the September  2008  to  March  2009  period. Further,  we have  increased  the  upside  risk  from  productivity  growth  remaining  above  our  assumption.

Since  long-term inflation expectations have  remained  stable  since June we have decreased  some of the upside risks to inflation in the near  term  from  an  unmooring  of  inflation  expectations. The  'slope  of  the Phillips curve' is difficult to measure precisely. Our modal projection is mainly based  on a  model that uses the prime age  male  unemployment  rate  to  measure  slack  and  currently  assumes  the  curve  is  very  flat. Hence  there  is an  increased  risk  that  if  the  curve  is  steeper,  inflation  will  be  well  below  our  forecast.

In June  the policy assumption  underlying  our  central  projection  was  a renormalization  of the policy rate starting  in  2011  along  with  no  substantive  changes  in  the  balance  sheet  or  LSAP.  We  have  made  no  changes to these  assumptions.

Respondent 14:

The pace of economic  activity  in the second  half of this year appears  to be somewhat faster  than previously thought. However, labor market conditions have deteriorated more than we were anticipating. Overall, changes  to  both  the  real  and  the  inflation  outlook  are  minor.

Respondent 16:

The  only  sizable  change  to  my  forecast  is  in  the  projection  of  GDP  growth  for  2009. This  change  is  entirely due to data for the second  half of 2009, especially the third quarter, coming  in stronger than  anticipated back  in  June.

Respondent 17:

incoming  data  have  been  stronger  than  expected  and  financial  conditions  have  improved  faster  than  I  expected  in  June,  so  my projection  of  output  going  forward  is  somewhat  higher,  but  the  basic  contours  haven't changed. Despite  the stronger output, my  projection  for the unemployment  rate  is  very  similar, inflation expectations  have been stable, and  unit labor  costs have been very  soft;  together  with a fairly flat Phillips curve,  these  factors  give  me  essentially  the  same  projection  for  subdued  inflation  that  I  had  in  June.
