Respondent  1:

In  light  of the  severity  and  breadth  of shocks  to  the  economy  and  the  consequent  significant  impacts  on government, firm, and household behavior, the convergence process may well extend beyond five or six years to something closer to eight years.

Respondent  2:

In my baseline projection,  the economy converges to the long-run trend by the end of 2015.

Respondent  3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

The convergence process may be slightly shorter than 5-6 years.

Respondent  5:

unemployment may be slower

Respondent  6:

I  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  be  substantially  shorter than 5-6 years, perhaps on the order of three years for real growth  (with a period of overshoot of real growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an overshoot  in the interim in inflation as  a consequence of significant past  growth in the monetary base supported by longer term asset purchases that cannot  be sold off over  a very short time period.  I  anticipate that the decline in the unemployment rate will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  7:

N/A

Respondent  8:

I  expect  the  convergence  process will be  similar to that  outlined in the long-run projection reported in the April Greenbook, with the output and unemployment gaps reaching zero in three or four years, and the PCE price inflation rate reaching its long-run value of 2 percent by 2016.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

By  2015-16  potential  growth  is  2.4%,  down  from  our  current  estimate  of  2.5-2.7%,  as  the  baby  boomers retire.  A  reasonable  estimate  for the long-run  unemployment  rate is 4.5%  to 5.5%.  We would expect,  with appropriate policy and no further adverse shocks,  unemployment to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-16.

We assume long-term inflation expectations to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI  basis  and the FOMC's inflation objective to be  around 2%  for the  PCE deflator and around  2.5%  for the  CPI.  Under these condi­ tions,  with the output gap around zero,  we would expect  PCE inflation of around 2%.

Respondent  11:

Given the depth of the recession, the damage inflicted on the financial sector,  and the difficult domestic and global adjustments that are needed,  convergence may well require the full five-to-six years.

Respondent  12:

In light of the severity of the recession and historical norms of recoveries following financial crises, the con­ vergence  process  for  unemployment  may  take  longer  than  five  to  six  years. In  addition,  I  am  concerned that  delaying the  removal  of policy accommodation  will  lead  to financial  imbalances  that  could  eventually destabilize the economy and further prolong the convergence process.  Finally, delay in the removal of policy accommodation and the shrinkage of our balance sheet could cause long-term inflation expectations to be­ come unanchored and affect the duration of the convergence process.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

Convergence to the real economy's equilibrium and to the inflation objective within five years requires lower long-term interest  rates  in  the  near-term than what  is  assumed  in the  baseline  outlook. As a result,  while the  economy is  anticipated  to revert  back to maximum employment within a five-year  horizon,  inflation is likely to remain below the target.

Respondent  3:

Recent growth in GDP suggests that the odds on very weak or very strong growth have diminished, leaving uncertainty close to historic experience.  However,  in light of recent history,  the uncertainties about produc­ tivity  and  the  relationship  of growth  to  employment  still  remain  unusually  high. Unusually high  inflation uncertainty reflects the possibility that  the  extraordinary gap  between  actual  and  expected inflation could close surprisingly fast.

Respondent 4:

Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economy is  in  recovery. However,  the  impact  of fiscal  stimulus  and its  unwinding has raised uncertainty around my projected path  for real  output  growth. In  addition,  the  effect  of the  extraordinary  monetary policy  accommodation  in  place  and  the  uncertainty about the timing of when we will exit  from that  accommodation have increased the uncertainty around my inflation forecast

Respondent  5:

volatility was low during the past twenty years,  and so my uncertainty is higher

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

The recovery has been evolving in line  with our expectations  for some time  now,  so we  have  become  more confident  in our  assessment  of the underlying conditions shaping the  forecast.  However,  we still  think that the uncertainty over the forecast is modestly higher than usual.

Respondent  8:

The  extraordinary financial  situation  and  unusual  fiscal  and  monetary policies  all  increase  uncertainty re­ garding  the  outlook  for  economic  growth  relative  to  the  past  20  years. In  addition,  the  unexpected jump in the unemployment rate last year raises questions  about the evolution of the labor market going forward. The heightened risks to the  outlook  for economic  activity,  as well  as  the  elevated variability of commodity prices,  raise uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation.

Respondent  9:

I believe that uncertainty regarding projections for GDP and unemployment are now about average.  Inflation projections would be more firmly anchored under an appropriate monetary policy, and therefore uncertainty would be lower than the trailing 20-year average.

Respondent  12:

While forecasts are always subject to considerable uncertainty,  the uncertainty surrounding my projections remains even higher  than normal.  I  generally agree  with  Greenbook' s  assessment  of the  sources  of uncer­ tainty,  but I would add fiscal policy to the list.  Various aspects of fiscal policy -  such as the expiration of the Bush tax cuts,  indexation of the AMT,  and the potential for a VAT -  create considerable uncertainty about the  outlook. Together,  the  many risks surrounding the  recovery and  inflation create  a  level  of uncertainty that exceeds the norm of the past  20 years.

The incoming data have led me to revise up slightly my near-term path for growth compared to my January forecast.  I  view the risks to growth and inflation as weighted to the upside.  Historical patterns in the data suggest the rebound might be stronger than my baseline forecast.  Over the longer term, inflation risk is tilted to the upside reflecting uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Fed's withdrawal of accommodation.

Respondent  5:

Inflationary expectations,  as embedded in TIPS bonds,  have been creeping upwards.

Respondent  6:

Going forward into 2010 as the economy recovers from the recent recession and experiences the fiscal stimulus program  as  well  as  a  substantial  persistent  increase  in  the  monetary base,  I  believe  that  the  risks  to  real growth and inflation will become weighted to the upside.

Respondent  7:

The incoming data-as summarized by aggregate statistics such as the CFNAI-are consistent with the near­ term projection for moderate growth.  Moving beyond the data in hand, we see both up and down-side risks. Notably,  pent-up  demand  from both households  and  businesses  could provide  a  more  pronounced  cyclical upturn. But  continued  weakness  in  labor  markets  could  prove  a  larger-than-expected  restraint  on  income growth  and  household  expenditures,  and  strained  budgets  point  to  a  downside  risk  to  spending  from  the state  and local government sector.

Regarding  unemployment,  I  believe  the  risks  are  broadly  balanced,  as  the potential  for  stronger  aggregate  demand  is  weighed  against  the  possibility that  labor  productivity  growth remains elevated.

Respondent  2: Yes

Due to a stronger inflation profile in my outlook,  the  federal funds rate begins to increase gradually in the first  quarter of 2011.

Respondent  3: Yes

the funds rate begins to rise  around mid 2011.

Respondent 4: Yes

My forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy than in  the  Greenbook  baseline.  I  view the appropriate monetary policy as one that raises the funds rate to about  1.5 percent  by the end of 2010  and 3.5 percent by the end of 2011.  By the end of 2012,  I see the  funds rate at  about 4.5 percent.

Respondent  5: No

N/A

Respondent  6: Yes

While the pattern of recovery from the recent recession is uncertain, I believe that under appropriate mone­ tary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate sooner than assumed in the Greenbook forecast.

Respondent  7: Yes

We assume the  funds rate to be close to the path currently embedded in futures markets  and a somewhat larger reduction than the Greenbook in the size of the Federal Reserve' s balance sheet.

Respondent  8: No

N/A

Respondent  9: Yes

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary policy the  committee  would  announce  a  numerical  inflation objective.  In order to achieve that objective, I believe that policy rates may well need to increase by the end of this year.

Respondent  10: Yes

For 2010 identical.  We assume the normalization of interest rates starts in March/April 2011  and continues at  a  faster  rate  in  2012. Because of differences  in  our inflation  forecasts,  the  difference  in real  rates  is less substantial.  Our views on the size of the balance sheet  are the same  as the Greenbook.

Respondent  11: No

First,  we  need  to  normalize  the  spread  between  the  discount  rate  and  the  base  policy rate  by restoring  it to  the  full  100  basis  points. I  anticipate  normalization some  time  this  year. As regards  the  base  rate,  the uncertainty attached to the economic outlook is such that we must be careful not  to lock ourselves in to a particular rate or rate path.

Respondent  12: Yes

I believe the appropriate path for monetary policy will require raising the target federal funds rate in 2010, in contrast to the  Greenbook assumption that the current target  rate is maintained until early 2012.  Keeping rates so extraordinarily low for so long would invite future financial imbalances and risk economic instability. I  also  believe  that  appropriate  policy will  involve  taking  steps  -   some  this  year  -   to  gradually  reduce  the size of our balance sheet  and normalize its composition.  The more passive approach assumed in Greenbook could eventually cause inflation expectations to come unanchored and would pose longer-term challenges to the independence of monetary policy.

Respondent  13: No

Respondent  14: Yes

In 2012,  the forecast is conditioned on a somewhat lower path for the Federal funds rate.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a).  P lease  d escrib e  th e   key  facto rs  sh ap in g   y o u r  c e n tra l  econom ic  o u tlo o k and  th e   u n c e r ta in ty   a ro u n d   t h a t   o u tlo o k .

Respondent  1:

Key factors include increasingly strong expectation that recovery has taken hold and solid increases in man­ ufacturing  output,  but  continuing  drag  from  commercial  real  estate  and  uneven  nature  of housing market recovery.  Key uncertainties are  (1)  whether upturn in personal consumption expenditures can be sustained without much faster net employment growth and (2) timing of turnaround in credit availability for consumers and small businesses.

Respondent  2:

The  unexpected  strength  in  first  quarter  consumption  expenditures  notwithstanding,  households  continue to be weighed down by a weak labor market  and tight credit conditions.  Uncertainty over the strength and viability of the nascent recovery also restrains consumer spending and makes businesses reluctant to hire and undertake  large-scale  investment  projects. Business  spending  on  structures  continues  to  contract  in  2010 hampered by high vacancy rates and ongoing credit problems in commercial real estate.

Currently  elevated  productivity  growth  will  not  be  sustained. My  forecast  assumes  lower-than-average productivity growth-due primarily to enormous worker dislocation in the labor market-which stabilizes unit labor costs.  It also assumes that inflation expectations will remain  'anchored'  near current levels of roughly 2%. Considerable  uncertainty surrounds  this  assumption. In  my view,  the  incoming  data  indicating  sub­ stantial and further core price deceleration  (though not deflation)  outweighs inflationary risks posed by the Federal Reserve's balance sheet  actions.

Respondent  3:

The growth rate of final demand strengthens gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy,  fur­ ther improvement in financial conditions  (including for bank credit),  and a rebound on spending on houses, consumer durables,  and business capital equipment  form unsustainably low levels.  Expansion is held back, especially in the next  few quarters,  by still-tight  credit  for some borrowers,  and by caution and uncertainty resulting  from  the  recent  events  and  the  still-uncertain  regulatory  response  to  the  crisis  and  the  broader governmental response to an unsustainable fiscal  path.  Upside risks include  a  faster rebound in household and  business  spending  on  durables  and  capital;  downside  risks  include  slower  recovery of credit  availabil­ ity,  especially  from  banks  partly  resulting  from  much  tighter  expected  and  actual  capital,  tax,  and  other requirements on them;  forced fiscal consolidation and deepening troubles in Europe are downside risks both to economic activity abroad and to the capital of globally active banks,

Respondent 4:

The recent data on the economy has been broadly in line with what I anticipated in my January forecast.  It is  a  forecast  that  combines the  'strong recovery'   and  'lower potential'   scenarios in the latest  Greenbook.

In  my  view,  the  economy  is  now  is  in  recovery  and  I  expect  an  above-trend  pace  of  3.6  percent  growth in  2010,  up  slightly  from  my previous  forecast.  In  2011,  I  expect  growth of about  3.4  percent  and  slightly above-trend growth in 2012.  The labor market recovery is gradual - I expect the unemployment rate edges down to about  6.5 percent  by the  end of the  forecast  horizon,  at  which  time  it  remains  above  the  natural rate of unemployment by about  1   percentage point.  I  anticipate that  inflation will rise  into  2011  then pull back in 2012 in response to tighter monetary policy than anticipated in the Greenbook.

In  my view,  the  substantial  liquidity that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  raises  the  risk  that  inflation  will rapidly accelerate to unacceptable levels  and that  inflation expectations may become unanchored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins

some time in 2010.

Respondent  5:

Financial  markets  have  normalized. However,  unemployment  remains  high. At  the  same,  at  least  as  of February  2010,  hiring  rates  and job  openings  remain  at  historical  lows. I  see  little  chance  for  significant job growth in 2010.  Large fiscal imbalances  and large holdings of excess reserves create  the possibility of a low-probability high inflation scenario.

Respondent  6:

The path of economic activity in 2009 was consistent with my earlier expectation of a slowing contraction in the first half of the year, with output bottoming out in the middle of the year and recovery in the second half. Hence I have not  revised my previous forecast  for  real  growth in  2010.  In  2010  and  2011  I  anticipate  that real  growth will occur  at greater than steady-state rates,  reflecting normal cyclical patterns reinforced by a modest impact of the fiscal stimulus package and the impact  of the substantial monetary stimulus that has been in train since late  2008.  I expect that  subsequently growth will slow and  approach steady-state rates. Headline  PCE  inflation  from  the  fourth  quarter  of 2008  through  the  fourth  quarter  of 2009  is  1.2  percent at  annual  rates  and  core  PCE  inflation  over  the  same  period  is  1.5  percent. I  expect  core  PCE  inflation over all of 2010 to be close to that of 2009,  but recent increases in energy prices lead me to expect that the headline rate will exceed the core rate as 2010 progresses.  Subsequently, under appropriate monetary policy, inflation should approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent,  though I  believe that  it  will rise  above that rate in an interim period.  I do not believe that future energy shocks can be forecasted, so with available information I expect that core and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  7:

The economic recovery currently in train reflects  the gradual  improvement of financial conditions  with  the support  of accommodative  monetary policy  and some continued,  albeit  diminishing,  fiscal  stimulus. Over time, the downside scenarios should become less probable, bolstering household and business confidence and adding momentum to the recovery.  Nonetheless,  relative to the depth of the recession,  the recovery will be moderate  by historical  standards,  reflecting  the  degree  of repair  still  needed  on  financial  and  nonfinancial balance sheets  and the persistent  effects on labor markets of depreciated worker skills.

Respondent  8:

Although labor markets remain very weak,  a moderate recovery in economic activity is in train.  Financial conditions have improved significantly; however,  financial intermediation remains impaired,  which will hold back  the  pace  of recovery. In  addition,  households  are  repairing  balance  sheets  that  have  been  weakened by equity and housing losses  and debt  accumulation.  Fiscal  and monetary stimulus provide key drivers  for recovery this  year. Significant  slack in  labor  and  goods  markets  will  keep  inflation  low,  but  well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid sustained deflation.

Respondent  9:

I believe that the pace of expansion will be reasonably robust, led by consumer spending and business equip­ ment  investment;  residential  construction  and  state  and  local  spending  are  likely  to  remain  very weak  for some time;  and nonresidential  construction  is  likely to decline  further  this  year. The stock of federal  debt will grow much more rapidly than GDP under current legislation,  leading to uncertainty on the nature  and timing of fiscal policy actions that will put the stock of debt on a more sustainable path.  That uncertainty could make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans.

Respondent  10:

Aided  by  aggressive  fiscal  and  monetary stimulus,  economic  growth  resumed  over  the  second  half of 2009

following a post WWII record decline of real GDP of nearly 4% over the preceding four quarters.  This growth was led by an unusually strong inventory cycle, which contributed 2.2 percentage points of the overall 3.9% (annualized) growth rate of 2009H2.  In contrast, final sales contributed a more modest 1.7 percentage points. Growth of real personal consumption expenditures contributed nearly all of that increase in final sales.  Along with the  automatic stabilizers,  the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act  of 2009,  enacted in February 2009,  significantly  lowered  tax  burdens  and  increased  transfer  payments. In  addition,  a  steep  decline  of energy prices over the first half of 2009 provided an additional boost to real disposable income.  Finally,  the 'cash  for  clunkers'   program led to  a significant  increase  in  light-weight  vehicle  sales in  2009Q3. Similarly, single-family housing starts rose by nearly 40%  from 2009Q1  to 2009Q3,  reflecting a larger-than-anticipated response to the first time-home buyer tax credit as well as the success of the Fed's purchases of agency MBS in lowering mortgage interest rates.  And despite a very low capacity utilization rate,  business investment in equipment and software rose a robust  19%  (annual rate)  in 2009Q4,  likely reflecting the pending expiration of the bonus depreciation provision included in the stimulus bill.  Exports grew rapidly over the second half of 2009  after plunging over the preceding  four quarters,  but  this growth contribution was more than  offset by an equally large rebound of imports.

Despite  the  stronger-than-expected  growth  of real  GDP,  labor  market  conditions  continued  to  deteriorate over the second half of 2009.  Nonfarm payroll employment fell 261,000 per month in 2009Q3 and 90,000 per month in 2009Q4.  The unemployment rate increased to an average of 10% in the fourth quarter from 9.3% in 2009Q2,  and would have increased further had not the labor force participation rate declined.  Offsetting this  weakness  in  labor  demand,  productivity growth  surged,  rising  at  a  7.4%  annual  rate  over  the  second half of the year.

The  PCE  deflator  increased  at  a  2.6%  annual  rate  in  the  second  half of  2009  after  being  essentially  un­ changed over the first  half of the year reflecting energy price fluctuations.  The core  PCE deflator rose  at  a 1.5%  annual  rate  in  the  second  half of 2009,  essentially the  same  as  the  first  half of the  year. Nonenergy services  price  inflation  slowed dramatically over  the  course  of 2009,  led  by the  two rent  components. This is  consistent  with  our  view  that  the  high  degree  to  which  resources  are  underutilized  has  put  downward pressure on core inflation.  However,  core goods price inflation increased over the second half of 2009 due in part to special factors such as the cash for clunkers program and increased taxes on tobacco.

In the  post  WWII  history of the US,  it  has been the  case  that  the  magnitude  of the loss of output  during a  recession  is  positively  related  to  the  gain  in  output  during  the  subsequent  first  year  of recovery. Given the steepness of the decline in output  from mid-2008 through mid-2009,  this relationship suggests that real GDP  should  grow  8%  to  10%  over  the  first  year  of recovery. However,  our  modal  forecast  for  2010  and 2011  has  been  based  on  the  assessment  that  the  current  cycle  is  qualitatively  different  from  the  typical post-WWII cycle such that we are unlikely to experience the robust growth that we otherwise might expect. Most  post  WWII  recessions  were  preceded  by high  rates  of resource  utilization  and  rising  trend  inflation, prompting a tightening of monetary policy which in turn dampened interest-sensitive spending, particularly on  housing  and  consumer  durable  goods. Then,  as  underlying  inflation  pressures  subsided,  monetary pol­ icy  was  eased  and  interest-sensitive  spending  rebounded,  often  quite  sharply. In  addition  to  its  severity, the  current  downturn  is  unique  in  that  it  was  preceded  by  a  global  financial  crisis  which  was  due  in  large part  to  excessive  leverage  and  excessive  investment  in  real  estate  assets,  both  of which  will  take  time  to unwind.  Therefore,  even though we have moved our point  forecast  for growth of real  GDP  in  2010 upward once  again,  to  3%  from  2  1/4%  in  January,  it  is  still  the  case  that  growth  in  2010  is  likely  to  be  only roughly equal to the economy's potential growth rate.  This implies that the unemployment rate is likely to remain stubbornly high and the excessive slack in overall resource utilization will be absorbed only gradually.

A  key  reason  for  expecting  a  relatively  muted  recovery  in  the  near  term  is  that  consumer  spending  still faces  substantial  headwinds. The household sector has suffered very large negative shocks to both income and wealth and has a substantial debt overhang.  The stimulus bill increased transfer payments and lowered

taxes in  an  attempt to offset these negative impulses,  but that stimulus is now waning.  Energy prices have increased from their recent lows,  sapping real disposable income growth.  While equity and home prices have recovered somewhat,  as  of 2009Q4  the  ratio of household  net  worth  to disposable  income  remained  nearly 25  percent  below its peak.  And even  though financial  conditions  appear to be gradually easing,  we  expect credit  availability to remain tight relative to the standards of the recent past.

In  addition  to  relatively  sluggish  growth  of consumer  spending,  a  second  key  feature  of our  modal  fore­ cast  is  that  while  it  appears  that  the  correction  in  housing  production  is  over,  it  is  unlikely  that  we  will experience  the  surge  of residential  investment  typical  of the  early stages  of post-WWII  recoveries.  By our estimates there are currently nearly 3 million excess vacant housing units,  with more coming onto the mar­ ket  over  the  forecast  horizon due to the unusually high volume of homes in the  foreclosure process.  At  the same time, mortgage underwriting standards have been significantly tightened, with even high credit quality borrowers being required to make substantial down payments.  Finally,  the housing sector has been given  a significant boost by the first-time home buyer tax credit combined with the large scale purchases of mortgage backed securities by the Federal Reserve.  Both of these effects are expected to wane over the next few months.

With the two main drivers of final demand-consumption  and  residential  investment-on a  relatively muted growth trajectory, recovery of business fixed investment is likely to be delayed.  This is particularly true given that  manufacturing  capacity utilization  rates  remain  low  while  retail  and  office  vacancy  rates  continue  to rise.  Also contributing to the relatively tepid growth expected during this recovery is the ongoing structural adjustment  taking  place  in  state  and  local  governments  which  is  expected  to  result  in  significant  declines in  employment  and  outlays  in  this  sector. Finally,  while  growth  prospects  for  our  trading  partners  have generally improved,  suggesting a continued rebound of exports,  the modest upgrade in final demand as the US  recovers  will  be  associated  with  rising  imports. Thus,  while  net  exports  will  not  be  a  major  drag  on growth, they are unlikely to be a major positive contributor to growth over the forecast horizon.

Going into  2011  we  expect  the  underlying  fundamentals of the  recovery to improve  such that  growth rises to  the  4%  to  4  2  %   range  with  the  unemployment  rate  steadily  declining. Further  forward  momentum is likely to be established in 2012,  with 5%  growth in GDP  and a fall in the unemployment rate to below 7%. Underlying  this  projection  is  the  expectation  that  financial  market  functioning  remains  normal  and  that consumer  and  business  confidence  and  the  general  appetite  for  risk  continue  to  recover. With  household income and balance sheets improving and credit flowing more normally, the substantial pent-up demand for consumer durables,  housing,  and business equipment  and software will start  to be satisfied.  Moreover,  the structural  adjustments  of state  and  local  governments  and  of the  commercial  real  estate  sector  will  likely have run their course by that time.

Barring  a  significant  decline  in  the  level  of the  economy' s  potential  output  or  its  potential  growth  rate, this  point  forecast  implies  that  a  large  output  gap  will  persist  over  most  of the  forecast  horizon. Accord­ ingly,  we  expect  core  inflation to slow  to  around  1%  (Q4/Q4)  in  2010.  But  by late  2011  and  into  2012,  as final  demand firms within the  context  of anchored  inflation  expectations,  we  expect  core  inflation  to move up to within the  'mandate consistent'  range.

The  risks  to  our  central  projection  for  real  activity  are  now  regarded  as  being  roughly  balanced  for  the first  time since the  SEP started in October  2007.  A key downside risk is that the loss of wealth suffered by the household sector induces a steeper-than-expected increase of the personal saving rate, keeping consumer spending weaker  for  longer. The  sharp  decrease  in  the  prime  age  employment  to  population  ratio  during the  current  cycle,  combined  with  the  large  share  of workers  nearing  retirement  age  and  the  possibility  of future fiscal consolidation makes this risk particularly acute.  That being said,  recent data on real consumer spending have been stronger than expected,  and there is an unusually large gap between employment gains as measured by the household survey versus the establishment survey.  Accurate measurement of economic activity is always difficult, but is especially so at turning points.  It is entirely possible that economic activity

is rebounding much faster than we expect.

An important  risk over  the  medium term is  the  uncertainty surrounding  our  assumption of the  economy's potential  growth  rate. On the one  hand,  given  the  weakness  of business  investment  and  the  necessary re­ allocation of labor  and capital,  the  economy' s potential  growth rate may have  slowed significantly.  On the other hand, current estimates of labor productivity continue to surprise to the upside.  Another source of risk to the  forecast  is  fiscal  policy.  Under  current  law many of the tax provisions enacted in  2001  and  2003  are scheduled to expire  at  the  end  of 2010.  The  outcome of the  debate  over  these provisions  could potentially have  a  significant  impact  on  both  growth  prospects  and  inflation  expectations. Finally,  relatively  modest changes in variables  such  as  productivity growth,  the  participation  rate,  and the  average  work week could have a significant impact on the path of the unemployment rate.

The  risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  are  also  relatively  balanced. Clearly,  the  remaining downside risks to the growth projection combined with the possibility of no meaningful decline in potential implies downside risks to the inflation projection.  In contrast, with the aggressive global monetary and fiscal policy response to the financial crisis and the possibility of a stronger-than-expected rebound, there is a risk of higher inflation.

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  the  shape  of  recoveries  from  periods  of  banking  and  finan­ cial crisis as well  as the uncertainty associated with the timing and synchronization of the removal of global policy accommodation result in greater uncertainty around our central projection compared to typical levels over the last twenty years.

We've seen breakdowns in both Okun's Law and the Beveridge Curve during this recession.  The pessimist's interpretation is that the natural rate of unemployment has increased and will remain high for some time as a result of an unusually large mismatch between the skills possessed by laid-off workers and the skills sought by firms with job vacancies.  The unemployment rate, under this interpretation,  overstates the amount of slack in  the  labor  market  and  the downward inflation pressure  we  are likely to see,  going  forward. (A variant  of this story is that the weak housing market is slowing labor flows across the country.  The recession, however, has been fairly uniform,  geographically,  in its effects on unemployment.)  The pessimist's story is consistent with anecdotal  reports that  firms  are laying off workers with no intention/expectation of hiring them back as the economy improves.

The  optimist's  interpretation  of the  breakdowns  in  Okun's  Law  and  the  Beveridge  Curve  is  that  restric­ tions  on  credit  forced  firms  to  slash  payrolls  to  an  unusual  degree  as  they  attempted  to  maintain  positive cash  flow. This  story  is  consistent  with  the  coincidence  between  the  intensification  of the  financial  crisis in  September  2008  and  the  breakdown  in  the  Beveridge  Curve. If true,  then  as  credit-market  conditions normalize we can expect to see unusually rapid employment gains, relative to output growth.  Also, the high unemployment rate is an accurate reflection of labor-market slack and downward inflation pressures.

My forecast splits the difference between these two interpretations.

Respondent  12:

Helped by considerable monetary and fiscal stimulus,  the economy is recovering at a solid pace.  In the early stages of the recovery,  GDP growth has been boosted by fiscal stimulus  and inventory adjustments.  Recent news indicate the transition to self-sustaining growth driven by consumer,  business spending,  and exports is underway.  Both consumer spending and business spending on equipment  and software have been stronger than expected.  Exports  remain  robust. The  most  recent  labor  market  indicators  also  point  to  a  recovery that is solidly underway and could even be poised to gather steam.  Nonresidential construction remains the

weakest sector of the economy.

With the economy recovering only gradually from a severe recession, I expect core inflation to remain at low levels,  but  eventually drift  higher. At  this  point,  the  disinflationary pressure  on consumer  prices  from  the weakness of the  economy is  mitigated by stable  long-term inflation  expectations. Over time,  inflation  will naturally gravitate toward long-term expectations, helped along by an improving economy, declining dollar, and rising commodity prices -  which reflect, to varying degrees,  current and past monetary accommodation.

Important risks include:  the pace of consumer spending, business spending on plant equipment,  and hiring; fiscal  policy; and  credit  availability. The  risks  are  perhaps  most  severe,  and  tilted  to  the  downside,  for commercial real estate.  The risks are  also considerable,  and more balanced,  for other sectors.  For example, pent-up demand and recent gains in financial wealth could cause consumer spending to grow strongly.  On the other hand,  forces such as ongoing concerns about the job market and the need to increase saving could cause  the  pace  of household spending to slow.  Finally,  decisions  on  many different  aspects  of fiscal  policy, such  as  the  expiration  of the  Bush  tax  cuts  and  indexation  of the  AMT,  could  cause  the  economy to  be stronger or weaker than expected.

As to inflation,  in the near term,  the weakness of the economy and recent  price trends pose some downside risks to core and overall inflation.  However, in the medium or long term,  the expansion of our balance sheet and  increased  public  nervousness  about  the  size  of our  balance  sheet  and  federal  borrowing  create  a  risk to  the  stability of long-term inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn,  inflation.  In  addition,  there  is  a  risk that monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, putting upward pressure on inflation.

Respondent  13:

The forces of recovery are in place and I expect a gradual strengthening in economic activity over the forecast horizon.  But I expect the pace of recovery to be relatively subdued.  Ongoing structural adjustments in the economy, and cautious business attitudes will tend to keep jobs growth modest and the rate of unemployment elevated. Persistent  unemployment,  limited  access  to  credit,  and  a  weakened household balance  sheet  will work against sustained robust growth in consumer spending.  Business investment has been positive and will likely continue to gain strength,  but uncertainty over the business environment is likely to act as a restraint on investment on new plant  and inventories.

Respondent  14:

Incoming data on real  activity continue to  be broadly in line  with  expectations. The recent  positive  news on payroll employment suggests that the labor market has bottomed out.  Nevertheless, the amount of slack in the economy remains very large.  Some of the recent good news on private spending should be placed in a context in which private sources of income growth have yet to show appreciable and sustained improvements. While banks have largely stopped tightening lending standards, standards remain substantially tighter than normal. As  a  result,  limited  credit  availability  for  households  and  some  businesses  is  likely  to  place  con­ straints  on spending over the  forecast  horizon.  Disposable  income last  year was supported importantly by the  fiscal  stimulus,  but  the  fiscal  support  is  now winding down.  In  addition,  the possibility that  taxes  will increase for some households in 2011  could dampen spending.  Taken together,  these factors should restrain the pace of the recovery over the earlier part of the forecast horizon.  As a result, the ongoing recovery should make only a small dent to the unemployment rate gap by the end of 2011.  Improvements in the unemploy­ ment rate could be slowed further if many of the people who have left the labor force during the downturn decide to look actively again for a job as economic conditions improve.  Given the projected sizable slack in labor markets over the forecast horizon, the rate of core inflation remains well below target in 2011 and 2012.

The risks to activity have become more balanced,  but the  downside  risks continue to be much more costly than the potential  upside,  given  that  monetary policy is constrained  by the  zero-lower bound  and  there is limited room for additional fiscal stimulus.  Moreover, a faster-than-expected recovery is unlikely to generate meaningful inflationary pressures.

The risks to inflation continue to be on the downside.  Core measures of inflation have remained roughly flat over the past five months,  and the possibility of uncomfortably low inflation over the  forecast horizon is,  at this point,  more than a tail event.

Respondent  16:

The critical question has been whether private final demand would take the baton from inventory effects in supporting continued  expansion.  The  evidence suggests that  it  is;  in  particular,  consumption  has  recently been  stronger  than  expected. It  seems  likely  that  the  increase  in  consumption  seen  recently  will  not  be sustained,  however,  given  a  range  of factors  including  the  slow  pace  of income  growth,  the  decline  in  the saving  rate,  the  weak  labor  market,  some  constraints  on  credit,  and  still-low  sentiment. However,  even if consumption  growth  slows,  a  moderate  recovery  in  economic  activity  seems  likely,  as  final  demand  will also be  supported by rising equipment  investment,  federal fiscal  policy,  and some  modest  improvements  in residential  investment.

Financial conditions have improved further and are close to normal outside of banking.  Banks are financially stronger  but  thus  far  economic  and  policy  uncertainties,  lack  of credit  demand,  and  a  desire  to  conserve capital in the face of losses still to come and uncertainty about future capital regulations, have limited bank lending. A  priori  reasoning  suggests  that  tight  bank  credit  would  particularly  hurt  small  businesses,  but there is only limited evidence suggesting that small business hiring and investment  are lagging behind that of larger firms.  I expect  further financial improvement,  including rises in bank credit  later this year.  As of now, I see no evidence of financial imbalances or asset price bubbles.

The labor market remains quite weak, notwithstanding modest hiring recently.  Uncertainty about the future path of unemployment is relatively high - besides the pace of recovery,  unemployment will  be affected by the  rate  of productivity  growth,  employer  decisions  about  the  margin  on  which  to  add  labor  hours,  and possible  hysteresis  or other effects  that  cause  at  least  a  temporary change  in  the  natural  rate.  Robust  job creation would greatly increase confidence in the sustainability of the recovery.

Slack,  falling  unit  labor  costs,  and  perhaps  (on  the  margin)  a  stronger  dollar  are  holding  down  core  in­ flation,  but  overall  inflation  is  unlikely  to  fall  too  far  given  the  stability  of inflation  expectations  and  the likelihood of rising commodity prices associated with growth in emerging markets.

Respondent  17:

Cyclical  recovery  likely  has  greater  force  than  Greenbook  forecasts. Financial  market  healing  is  impor­ tant  contributor; shocks could undermine recovery.  Medium-term forecasts dependent  on strength of labor markets and avoidance of non-linear shocks.

Respondent  1:

I  continue  to  be  somewhat  more  pessimistic  on job  creation,  with concomitant  effects  on some  other  vari­ ables,  and somewhat less confident in projected path of energy prices

Respondent  2:

My forecast  calls  for  slower  growth  in  the  second  half of 2010  and  beyond,  due  to  more  concern  over  the fundamental weaknesses that I have identified above:  spending restraint in the face of heightened uncertainty and extraordinary worker dislocation.  Despite weaker growth,  my outlook entails  more  core  PCE inflation in  2011  and  2012  stemming  from weaker labor  productivity growth.  My assumption of stable  inflation ex­ pectations (at  roughly 2%) accentuates the productivity effect  and helps draw the inflation rate upward as the economy recovers; core PCE inflation reaches  1.5%  by the end of 2012.

Respondent  3:

A little stronger growth in the near-term,  based on incoming data suggesting more pent-up demand;  a little less  in  the  out  years owing  to  assumed flat  dollar  and slower rise in stock prices.  About  the same inflation because the effects of that growth on utilization are offset by faster productivity growth.

Respondent 4:

My inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy and so I project a higher pace of inflation over 2010-2012 than does the Greenbook.  Given the strength of economic growth in my forecast  and the higher inflation path,  the policy path is less  accommodative over the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent  6:

Compared to  the  70%  confidence  intervals  indicated  for  the  Greenbook  forecasts,  the  differences  between the point estimates in the Greenbook baseline forecasts and my forecasts are not different in any meaningful statistical  sense.  However the time path of my projections does differ from the Greenbook baseline,  in that I  see  stronger  near-term growth  than that  in  the  Greenbook baseline  in  2010,  about  the  same  real  growth than  the  Greenbook  in  2011  and  real  growth  subsequently  tapering  off in  2012. I  see  inflation  higher  in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that  I  believe is consistent  with  appropriate monetary policy.  In  contrast,  the  Greenbook  forecast  sees  inflation declining  and persisting  at very low rates  for  'an extended period'.

Respondent  7:

Our inflation forecast is  a bit higher than the Greenbook as we are putting more weight on inflation expec­ tations  retarding  further  disinflation. Here,  we  have  been  somewhat  surprised  at  the  stability of inflation expectations in light of the slack-induced declines in actual inflation we have experienced.

Respondent  8:

My forecast is similar to the Greenbook forecast.

Respondent  9:

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy  the  public's  inflation  expectations  would  be  well  an-

chored,  and  the  inflation  path  would  be  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook. An  appropriate  monetary  policy might place policy rates on an upward trajectory by year-end.

Respondent  10:

We assume lower inflation  persistence  than  does the  GB.  Thus,  for  our  medium-term inflation  outlook  we project inflation within the  'mandate-consistent'  range in late 2011  under the assumption of well-anchored inflation expectations.

Respondent  11:

The Greenbook baseline forecast underestimates the drag on the labor market  arising from the uncertainty created by new economic and regulatory initiatives.  It does not take into account inducements deriving from regulatory and taxation initiatives for corporations and investors to invest in more promising markets abroad at  the  expense of job creation and CAPEX at home.  It may also underestimate future upward pressure on commodity prices and headline inflation due to a strengthening world economy.

Respondent  12:

The  key  difference  is  the  monetary  policy  path,  which  leads  to  some  differences  in  the  medium-term  out­ look.  In my view,  holding the federal funds target so low and so long as assumed in Greenbook risks future financial  imbalances  that  could  destabilize  the  economy. It  would  be  more  appropriate  to  modestly  raise the funds rate target considerably sooner than in Greenbook,  to reduce these longer-term risks.  My view of appropriate policy leads to slightly-to-modestly lower  GDP growth from 2010 through 2012.

My  outlook  for  inflation  is  also  somewhat  different  from  Greenbook' s. I  expect  core  inflation  to  move toward long-term expectations faster than it does in the  Greenbook projection,  reflecting differences in our views of the relative importance of inflation expectations and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

Respondent  13:

My forecast  for real  GDP  growth is below the  Greenbook baseline,  in part  because of a more modest  pace of business investment.

Respondent  14:

The forecast for real activity is very close to the Greenbook forecast.  Core inflation is projected to be lower than in the Greenbook,  as  a result of a more meaningful tradeoff between inflation and unemployment.

Respondent  1:

In light of stronger than expected personal consumption,  I have modestly adjusted my 2010 growth projec­ tion up and unemployment projection down

Respondent  2:

GDP growth in 2010 is stronger mainly in response to unanticipated strength in the incoming data on in­ dustrial  production,  retail  sales,  and employment.  The  unemployment  rate  is  correspondingly lower in the near term.  My inflation forecast  has been marked down in response to weaker-than-expected inflation data and a downward revision to growth in fourth-quarter 2009 unit labor costs.

Respondent  3:

forecast broadly similar.  Slightly faster growth and slightly lower inflation in reaction to incoming data.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

The March numbers make me more optimistic about unemployment.  Also,  the low inflation numbers from Q1  have lowered by near-term inflation outlook.

Respondent  6:

Recent  measures of economic  activity appear to be  evolving as  I  had expected in  my projections  from last quarter,  hence  I  have  not  revised  my projected  path  of real  output  for  2010  . My forecasts  for  the  unem­ ployment rate are unchanged,  as  are my inflation  forecasts  (headline  and Core  PCE)  for  2011  and beyond. I  have lowered  my inflation  forecasts  for  2010  somewhat  to reflect  the inflation  in  the first  months  of 2010 that is lower than my previous forecast.

Respondent  7:

The  incoming  data  have  caused  us  to  revise  down  our  unemployment  forecast  for  2010  and  to  lower  our inflation forecast throughout the projection period.

Respondent  8:

Since January, economic news and overall financial conditions have been somewhat better than I anticipated on  net,  causing  me  to  raise  my near-term  forecast  for  real GDP.  Recent  inflation data  have  come  in  a  lit­ tle  softer  than  I  expected  and  I  lowered  my  near-term inflation  forecast  accordingly. I  did  not  change  my medium-term forecasts for real GDP growth or inflation.  The unemployment rate came in lower than I had expected.  In response,  I  lowered my projection for the unemployment  rate over this year  and the next  two years by two tenths on average.

Respondent  9:

Real  growth  is  slightly  stronger  in  the  current  forecast,  reflecting  information  for  the  first  quarter  on  con­ sumer spending,  business investment,  manufacturing activity,  and employment.  Inflation this  year is  lower in the current  forecast,  reflecting data on inflation in the first quarter.

Respondent  10:

We have increased our forecast  for growth of real  GDP  in  2010  to  3%  (Q4/Q4)  from  2  1/4%  based  on  the recent  strength of consumer spending  and industrial production.  While we expect  the personal saving rate to rise over the forecast horizon,  the path is now lower due to somewhat stronger growth of real PCE and a

downward revision to labor compensation.

Core  inflation  has  surprised  to  the  downside  since  January,  with  total  inflation  coming  in  a  little  above our  January  projection. We  view  these  developments  as  transitory  so  our  full  year  projections  are  little changed.

The  major  change  in  our  outlook  is  the  reduction  in  downside  risks  to  real  activity  and  the  increased weight  we  are  placing  on  upside  risks. The  main  factors  driving  these  changes  are  the  recent  strength  of consumption and continued improvement in financial conditions.

Respondent  11:

Recent reports confirm growth in household incomes  and consumer purchases,  the stabilization of residen­ tial  investment,  the beginnings of an upturn in business equipment  and software investment,  and a reversal of negative  growth  contributions  from  inventory  investment. Job  cuts  and  the  tightening  of bank  lending standards have ended.  Consequently, the near-term outlook for real activity has improved.

Respondent  12:

My forecast  is  little  changed  from  January. Based on recent  data  that  have  been  better  than  expected,  I now  anticipate  a  slightly  stronger  pace  of recovery  in  2010,  evident  in  slightly  stronger  GDP  growth  and lower unemployment.  Similarly, based on recent inflation data that show a slower-than-anticipated trend in prices, I have modestly lowered my near-term forecasts of core inflation.

Respondent  13:

My projection for real GDP has been revised slightly higher over the forecast horizon in response to a stronger pace  of spending  in  the  first  quarter  than  I  expected. I  made  no  substantive  revisions  to  my estimate  of unemployment or inflation.

Respondent  14:

Changes to both the real and the inflation outlook were small.
