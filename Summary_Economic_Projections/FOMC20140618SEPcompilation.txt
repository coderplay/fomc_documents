Note: Projections  of  change  in  real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  from  the  fourth  quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE  inflation and core PCE  inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index  for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  and the price index  for PCE excluding food  and energy. Projections  for the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  March projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  18-19,  2014.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In March 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 1, 13, and 2. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 4 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4: The  convergence  process  may  be  somewhat  shorter  than  5-6  years

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: Convergence  to  the  longer-run  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  occur in the first half of  2017. Inflation is projected to reach the 2 percent objective in  2019.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: It will be shorter under appropriate monetary policy  - in part because inflation expectations stay  well-anchored at 2% under appropriate  monetary policy.

Respondent 10: No  comment

Respondent 11: I anticipate  a  quicker  convergence  than  5-6  years. Real  GDP  will  converge  to  its long-run  value  in 2017, the unemployment  rate  in  2017,  and  PCE  inflation  in  2016. As  part of this covergence process, I  anticipate that inflation  will temporarily overshoot the FOMC's 2 percent target and  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  levels  below  its  natrual  rate.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: I anticipate  that  convergence  will  take  less  than  5  years. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to equal its longer run level by the end  of 2016  and  inflation to be 2 percent  by  the end of 2015. Given  my  view  of  appropriate  policy,  I  would  expect  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be  near  its longer  run  value  by  the  second  half  of  2017.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Our  assessment  of  the  economy's potential  growth  rate  remains  within  the  2%  to 2 1 2 / %  range,  with  a  point  estimate  of  about  2 1 4 / %  (rounded  to  2.3%  above). Our  interpretation  of the recent literature and  some  additional  in-house  analysis  indicates  that  a  reasonable  range  for an estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4 1 2 / % to 6%,  with a point estimate of about 5 1 4 / % (rounded  to 5.3%  above). We  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  reach  its longer-run level and the output  gap  to  be  fairly small  in late 2015. However,  our  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  suggests there  is a significant  probability  that  the  unemployment  rate  could  fall  modestly  below  5 1 4 / %  for a period  within  the  5-6  year  timeframe.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about  2.5%  for  the  CPI  based  on  the  longer-term  average  of  the  difference  between  CPI  and  PCE inflation). Under  these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to shrink over the coming years,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2016.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  2016.

Respondent 16: I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  as  early as  2015, and  to  fall past that level in  2016. Inflation  will reach its  mandate-consistent level by the end of 2016,  and  rise above that  level in  2017. It will  take skilled policymaking  and  a  considerable  measure of good  luck  to  nudge  the  unemployment  rate  back  up  and  inflation  back  down  without  triggering  a recession. Full  convergence  could  well  take  five  or  six  years.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Uncertainty about  my projection for  economic  activity is similar to its average level over the past 20 years. Of  course, that period  was characterized by  considerable turmoil, including the Great  Recession,  the  European  (and  earlier,  Asian)  financial  crises,  the  Iraq  war,  9/11,  the  dot.com boom  and  bust,  and  so  on.

Inflation remains  anchored by quite stable inflation  longer-run  expectations. Inflation  expectations have now been well anchored for about 20 years, so I  see the  magnitude of the uncertainty  around the inflation  outlook  as  consistent  with  that  over  the  past  20  years.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: It remains  the  case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 5: Given the greater length of recession associated also  with financial crises, I'm  more unsure  about  the  underlying  growth  rate  than  i  would  normally  be.

Respondent 6: Inflation expectations have probably become  more  firmly  anchored  as a result  of the  FOMC's  concensus  statements,  and  uncertainly  is  accordingly  lower  than  before  January  2012.

Respondent 11:

Respondent 12: We think the uncertainty  surrounding the growth  and inflation projections have diminished  somewhat  since  the  March  SEP;  nonetheless,  on  balance, we still judge the uncertainty over  the  rate  forecasts  as  broadly  similar  to  the  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years.

Respondent 15: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. These intervals have narrowed  somewhat  from  those at the time of the March  SEP,  reflecting the fact that the data since March  generally have been consistent with our anticipation that the weakness in Q1 would prove to be transitory. The probability intervals for the forecasts of these variables  are still relatively wide  in part because  of  the still-extraordinary economic  and  financial  environment,  including  the  policy  rate  remaining  constrained  by  its  effective lower  bound.

Respondent 16: N/A

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Risks to economic  activity appear balanced. The  economy  has  rebounded  from its transitory first-quarter contraction, and  headwinds  continue  to  abate. Indeed, with diminishing headwinds, upside scenarios involving  a virtuous cycle of  economic  activity  become  more plausible.

The  zero lower bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no longer appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light of the apparent effectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

Respondent 3: RIsks to the  U.S.  economy  taken in isoliation appear  still to be broadly balanced, maybe  slightly  weighted  to  the  upside. However,  external  economic  and  geopolitical  risks  still  seem decidedly weighted to the downside - on the  economic side,  continued uncertainty  as to China's growth pattern in the next year. On the  geopolitcal side, the risk of a broad  military  conflict in Ukraine seems to have receded somewhat, though  tensions and potentail repercusssions obviosuly remain a risk.  But the  situation  in  Iraq  now  poses  a  new  risk.

Respondent 4: I view  the  risks  to  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside  over  the  medium  and  longer run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's  withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 5: I assume  we're  talking  about  risks  over  the  next  6  years.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8: I see the weakness in 2014Q1  as largely due to the severe winter weather, but it is possible that some of the weakness  reflects more fundamentals  factors, which would point to weaker  growth  going  forward  than  I  anticipate. On  the  other  hand,  the  improvement  in  labor  market conditions could point to faster income  growth, supporting  stronger consumer  spending  than  I anticipate.

Given  uncertainties  surrounding  the  withdrawal  of  policy  accommodation,  there  are  some  upside risks to my inflation  forecast  over the  medium and longer run. The recent  rise in  oil prices, if sustained, is also  an  upside  risk  to  inflation. In the  nearer  term,  the  continued  low  readings  on  inflation  suggest some  downside  risk  to  inflation.

Respondent 9: It is hard for the FOMC  to  respond  effectively  to  low inflation outcomes,  which means  that  they  are  more  likely  to  occur.

Respondent 10: No  comments.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: We  think the risks to the forecast for growth are roughly in balance. On  the downside, the degree to which higher interest  rates  and  still-restrictive  credit have weighed  on housing markets highlights the risk of a  more subdued rebound in residential investment than we are projecting. We  still think  the  risks  from  the  international  sector  are  negative,  on  net. On  the  up  side,  improved household sector  fundamentals (notably,  gains  in wealth  and  the better  job  market)  and  the steady improvement  in  the  sentiment  of  our  business  contacts  suggest  that  we  could  see  a  more  pronounced 'virtuous cyclical' dynamic than we  are projecting.

Even  though  our growth  forecast is roughly balanced, we think the risks to the unemployment rate  are  tilted slightly  to the  upside. The  labor  force  participation  rate  has  fallen  even  further  below our estimate of its trend in recent  months, and we  could see a slower-than-projected decline in the unemployment  rate  if  discouraged  workers  re-enter  the  labor  force  faster  than  in  our  forecast.

We  continue to see downside risks to the inflation outlook predominating over the projection period. The  recent  uptick  in  inflation  does  not  change  the  fact  that  neither  the  data  nor  our  business  reports point to any meaningful cost pressures, pricing power, or inflationary impetus from abroad. Our forecast of inflation picking  up  to  1-3/4 percent by the end of the projection period depends heavily on  an upward pull  on prices from inflation  expectations  and  credible FOMC  communications about  its commitment to a symmetric 2 percent inflation  target. For some  time we have noted the risk that this upward  force  may  not  be  as  strong  as  we  have  assumed. Indeed,  our  econometric  models  that  include private-sector  measures  of  inflation  expectations  or  extract  expectations  from  the  treasury yield  curve are projecting  inflation  noticeably below 2 percent through  2016.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Although I see the distribution of shocks to aggregate demand  as reasonably balanced,  I  still  view  the  balance  of  risks  to  GDP  growth  as  somewhat  weighted  to  the  downside  due to the  constraints that  limit the ability  of  monetary policy to offset negative shocks to demand  at the zero  lower  bound. I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  balanced,  with  the  risk  of  higher  unemployment due to the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound  offset by the risk that productivity may continue to grow  more slowly than anticipated, as it has done over the past few years. For some  time now inflation has been running  below the level I had anticipated. While some of the  factors that have held inflation down appear to be transitory, low inflation may prove  more persistent, creating  risks to inflation  I consider  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 15: Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between the  central projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced, as has been the case in recent SEPs. As was the case in March, the risks to the real activity outlook are roughly balanced over medium-term horizons, as indicated in the summary  of  our judgment; however, at the longer horizons, the risks are still modestly  skewed  to the downside. The  broad balance over the medium  term  reflects two opposing  forces. One  is  the  possibility  that  the  sluggish  growth  during  this  expansion  has  come  from more persistent structural  factors rather  than  the  impact  from various headwinds  that  are  expected to abate  in  our  central  forecast. The  other  is  the  possibility  that  the  economy  has  greater  underlying strength than anticipated in our projection. Beyond  these forces, geopolitical risks, such as those recently emanating  from  Iraq, could have significant adverse effects on energy supplies and prices, posing  risks  to  the  U.S.  economy. Other  concerns  include  the  low  inflation  data  in  many  parts  of  the world, which  could  leave  the U.S. and  world  economy  more  susceptible  to  negative  shocks,  and  the constraints  that  monetary  policy  faces  under  the  effective  lower  bound.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for 2016,  the  unemployment  rate  is  close  to  or  below  your  projection  for  its longer-run  normal  level  and  inflation  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and your  assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  here  as  well.

Respondent 1: Factors explaining lower FF  rate at year end 2016: Lower  real rate; continuing headwinds  from  crisis,  including  risk  aversion  on  the  part  of  businesses  and  households,  lower  credit availability,  and  lower potential  growth post  crisis due  to  low  investment.

Factors  explaining  lower  long  term  rate  of  FF:  Lower  potential  growth; lower  real interest rates; lower  investment  and  perhaps  higher  saving  as  well.

Respondent 2: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  have  declined  but  are  still  sizeable. Moreover,  my outlook  for inflation over the next  three years  is below  our 2 percent  objective. This situation  calls for very accommodative  monetary  policy. Appropriate  policy  calls  for delaying  liftoff from  the zero lower  bound  until  the  middle  of  2015. My  judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by looking  at simple  rules that adjust  for the zero lower bound,  as  well as by my  expectations  of, and uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following  liftoff, my  fed funds path through  2016  remains  flatter than some  simple  rules would suggest. In my projection, the reasons include the  following:

- · Although  the unemployment  rate  by  the  end of 2016 is at its long-run natural rate, broader measures  of  slack  (as  measured  in,  say,  U-6)  take  a  bit  longer  to  return  to  normal,  reflecting  the dynamics  of  the  labor  market;
- · Some  headwinds  have  not  fully  abated  by  2016,  such  as  credit  availability  for  small  businesses. These continue to modestly reduce the equilibrium real interest rate relative to its long-run value;
- · In an environment in which  short-term rates have been  near  zero  for  almost seven years, there are potentially  some  modest benefits  to having  an  earlier  liftoff but then a more  gradual  rate path than might normally be called for. These benefits include managing  expectations and minimizing  the  potential  for  disruptions  to  global  financial  markets.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: My  assumed  appropriate  path  of  monetary  policy  has  the  asset  purchase  program ending in  2014Q4  and  the  Committee  needing  to  start  raising the  funds  rate  in  2014Q4  as  the  economy continues to strengthen.  The  economy is modestly above steady  state by the end of 2015, with inflation returning  to  2  percent,  growth  at  3  percent,  and  the  unemployment  rate  at  5.6  percent. My  path  for the  funds  rate  is within  the  range  of  prescriptions  given  by  the  monetary  policy  rules  enumerated  in

the Tealbook  and  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  reach  its  long-run level of 4 percent  by  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: I believe that in March  2015  labor  markets  will have improved  significantly and inflation will be above  1.6  percent  and  increasing. Accordingly,  I  believe  that  we  will  want  to  begin raising  the  policy  rate(s)  to  keep  inflation  from  rising  too  rapidly.

Respondent 7: Liftoff of the federal funds rate from the zero-lower-bound  occurs  early in 2016. This is when  the  economy  is  expected  to be  within  one year  from  reaching  full  employment. With inflation well below target and  only a modest  acceleration in the pace of  economic  activity, the removal of policy  accomodation  occurs  very  gradually.

Respondent 8: I expect  the  steady  progress  the  labor  market  has  made  toward  the  Committee's longer-run goal of  maximum employment to  continue. I project inflation  will gradually increase over the forecast horizon, with inflation between one and two years ahead reaching the Committee's  2 percent longer-run goal in 2015Q1, at which point it will be appropriate for the FOMC  to  begin raising  interest rates. Consistent  with the  Committee's  forward guidance, I project the  fed funds rate will rise gradually over the rest of  2015, similar to a path suggested by  a Taylor  1999 rule  with inertia. As  the  expansion  strengthens  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  to  raise  interest  rates  at  a  slightly  more rapid pace, described by  a somewhat  less inertial Taylor  1999 rule. As a result of delaying  liftoff until early 2015  and  the  inertia  in  my  monetary  policy  rule,  the  federal  funds  rate  target  would  be  below its longer-run  normal  level  at  the  end  of  2016,  despite  the  fact  that  unemployment  and  inflation  are both  near  their  longer-run  levels.

Respondent 9: The data suggests that there has been a sharp fall in the neutral real rate of interest  since  2007. We  remain  below  maximum  employment  and  below  target  inflation,  even  though the market  real  rate  of  interest  (over  any  horizon)  is  much  lower  than  in  2007. This  means  that  the neutral  real  rate  of interest  consistent  with  target  inflation  and  maximum  employment  - has  fallen by  even  more.

There  are  many  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest  - but  the  main  point  is the change is likely to unwind  over  time  - but only slowly and  only partially. This judgement is borne out  by  the real yield curve,  which  is  upward  sloping  (negative  over  the  next  five  years,  and  rising  to just over 1%  from  2024  to  2034). Note  that  this  real yield curve  is roughly  consistent  with  inflation break-evens  of  around  2%,  which  suggests  that  these  market  interest  rates  are  reflective  too  of  what's happening  with  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest.

Put  another  way: I see the  intercept  term  in  the  Taylor  Rule  as  being  a  stochastic  process  with  a lot of persistence. That  intercept  term  is  very  low, and  is likely to return  to its long-run  value  only slowly.

Respondent 10: My  outlook  has  liftoff for the federal funds  rate in December  2015  and  25  basis point  increases  at  each  meeting  in  2016.

My projection for the federal funds rate is informed by an inertial policy rule and despite a convergence  by  the  unemployment  rate  to  its  longer-run  level,  I  expect  that  residual  slack  in  the  labor market  will  still be evident. As such, I do not expect  the  funds  rate to be at its longer-run  normal value  in  2016.

Respondent 11: The path  for the  federal funds rate is unchanged from my  last projection. By the end of  2014, the unemployment  and inflation rates  will be very close to their long-run values. Identical to my  last projection,  lift-off  should occur in Q1/2015.

Respondent 12: The  factors that shaped  our  views  about  appropriate  policy  in the March  SEP continue to be operative in the current submission. These  still call for an early 2016 liftoff in the policy  rate.

Our  forecast  assumes  a  steady  reduction  in  the  pace  of  asset  purchases,  with  the  program  being completed  this  fall. With  regard  to  forward  guidance,  we  continue  to  believe  it  is  appropriate  that  the Committee  strongly  communicate  its  commitment  to  highly  accommodative  policy  and  a  symmetric 2 percent  inflation  target. Our  preferred  way  of  doing  so  is  for  the  FOMC  statement  to  be  clear  that as long as the one- to  two-year-ahead  inflation  outlook  is  below  2  percent,  we  will  delay  liftoff  until labor  markets  have  regained  their  full  health  as  measured  by  a  broad  array  of  indicators. Under  our baseline  forecast, we do not think  we  will have  enough  confidence in a 2 percent  medium  term inflation outlook  to  commence  increasing  rates  until  sometime  in  early  2016. At  that  time,  the  unemployment rate is projected to be only a few  tenths above our 5.2 percent estimate for the natural rate.

Respondent 13: Key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy are achieving  an inflation objective of 2.0 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that reduces unemployment. Once we begin to raise the funds rate, I believe we  can be gradual-raising the  funds  rate  by  25  bps  per  meeting. I also  believe  we  should  continue  reducing  our  asset  purchases by  $10  billion  per  meeting.

I have  not  changed  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

My projections for unemployment and inflation equal their longer run values by the end of  2016, but  my  assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  about  1 1 4 / percentage  points less than  my  estimate  of  its  longer  run  value. There  are  several  interrelated  reasons  for  this. Based on the Committee's  forward  guidance,  lift-off does not begin until mid-2015. Once  liftoff begins, a gradual increase in the federal funds rate (25 basis points per  meeting) will be important  and promote financial stability  since steady  moves are  more predictable and  reduce the chance of unexpected shifts in  longer-term interest  rates. Finally, since my longer-run normal value of the funds rate is  4.3 percent, the  time  from  lift-off  to  a  normal  funds  rate  is  2  years.

I would note that my 'gradual rise' in the  federal funds rate (2 percentage points per year)  is  less gradual  than  many participants  according  to  the March SEP. Specifically,  only 3 participants  assumed the  funds  rate  would  rise  by  2  percentage  points  in  2016  while  4  participants  that  assumed  the  funds rate would rise by  1 percentage point in  2016. I think  communicating  an increase in the funds rate at every  other  meeting  would  be  challenging.

I am  concerned  that  postponing  lift-off  to  mid-2015  and  raising  the  funds  rate  at  the  slower  pace envisioned  in  the  March  SEP  risks  incentivizing  investors  to  reach  for  yield  in  an  economy  operating at full capacity,  posing  risks  to  achieving  sustainable  growth  over  the  longer  run.

Respondent 14: My  path  for the federal funds rate, both before and after liftoff from the zero bound, is shaped by  my  expectation that the headwinds that have been  holding back  recovery  since the  financial  crisis  will  continue  to  exert  a  restraining,  albeit  abating,  influence  on  aggregate  demand for several years to  come. In addition, inflation is running  well below our 2% longer-run objective. To promote  the  attainment  of  our  maximum  employment  and price  stability  objectives  over  the  medium term  I  see  it as necessary  to  pursue  a  highly  accommodative  policy  throughout  the  forecast  period. I would assess the equilibrium real funds rate at present and  over the  forecast to be substantially below my  estimate  of  its longer  run  normal  level  of around  1.5%. This  reflects factors such  as (i) ongoing balance sheet repair by households  and  limited  access  to  credit,  which prevent households  from  taking advantage  of very low interest rates to the same  extent  they would  if their balance  sheets had not

been  impaired;  (ii)  a  continuing,  albeit  diminishing,  high  supply  of  savings,  especially  from  emerging economies;  (iii)  fiscal  policy  that  for  several  more  years  makes  a  smaller  contribution  to  growth  than its historical norm; and (iv) a temporarily depressed  growth  rate  of potential GDP  and  associated weak growth of household incomes  and income  expectations. My  estimate of the  longer-run normal level  of  the  nominal  (and  real)  federal  funds  rate  of  3.5%  (and  1.5%)  are  consistent  with  estimates  from the staff's three factor model. This  estimate  likely reflects some  pessimism  about  the prospects  for longer-run  growth,  consistent,  for  example,  with  current  Laubach-Williams  estimates  of  trend  GDP growth.

Respondent 15: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communciate clearly to the public  that  these  factors  will dictate  the  path  of the policy  stance. Despite  the  fall in GDP  in  2014Q1,  the  changes  along  these  dimensions  were  not  sufficient  to  change  our  assessment  of the  appropriate  path  for  the  FFR.

Based  on  our  modal  outlook  and  assuming  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored, we thus still anticipate that the target FFR  will remain near zero until mid-2015. The pace of renormalization of the target FFR  following the period of near zero policy rates will then depend upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions  and  the  outlook,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and the response of overall financial  conditions to policy tightening. Our current  assessment of these  factors is that the pace of tightening  will probably be relatively slow as a  means to provide insurance against the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced  by  the  U.S.  economy,  especially  in  the  housing  market,  which in turn  will help achieve the FOMC's objectives over the longer run. For these reasons, we  continue to anticipate it will be appropriate  to maintain  the FFR  below  our  estimate  of its longer-run  level through  the  end  of  2016.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. We  assume  that  in  normal  times  this  rate  is in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0  - 5.0%. Given the behavior of nominal and  real Treasury yields and productivity growth  since  the  end  of  the  recession,  we  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to  be  in  the lower half  of  the  indicated range,  which  results  in  the point  estimate  given  in  the response  to question 3(a).

Although  we  do  not  expect  the  need  to  deploy  additional  tools  to  provide  accommodation  in  our modal  outlook, we believe it is still important  for the FOMC  to be prepared to employ  all of  its tools to offset any  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  that  may  be  realized.

Respondent 16: In past projections  exercises, my policy-rate path has  come  from the  1999 Taylor rule with  inertia, on the pragmatic  grounds  that  this  rule  seems  to  perform  well  in  simulation  exercises, approximating  the  optimal-control  policy-rate  path. The  rule  assumes  that  the  real  policy  rate converges to  4.0 percent in the  long-run, but  gets there slowly. Upon reflection, I think that there are grounds  to  question  both  the  equilibrium-policy-rate  assumption  and  mechanistic  gradualism  of  this rule.

As regards the longer-run equilibrium interest  rate, long-forward  TIPs rates have moved downward by  about  a  percentage  point  since  the  2007:Q4  business-cycle  peak. Also,  estimates  of  the  economy's growth potential have  shifted downward by  nearly  a percentage point  over  the past  ten years, and theory  suggests that changes in growth prospects  translate into changes in the equilibrium real interest rate in the same direction. However,  it's  likely that some of the reduction in  long-forward  TIPs rates is due to an unusually low  term premium.  And it may  well be that analysts are being  unduly pessimistic about  future  growth  prospects. Nevertheless,  I've  penciled  in a 3.75 percent  longer-run  policy  rate, down  from  the  4.0  percent  rate  I  submitted  last  time.

How quickly do we  get  there? In my  economic projections, we  are  close  to  full  employment  and price stability at the end of 2015. So, any rule basing its prescriptions solely on current slack and recent or near-term-projected inflation  would  call for  a near-3.75-percent policy  rate at the  close of 2015. However,  the  rapid  rate  increases  required  to  reach  3.75  percent  by  the  end  of  next  year  would be inconsistent  with  past  Fed  behavior,  would  suggest  policymakers  are  panicking,  and  would  spook investors. More  reasonable  is a series of 1/4-point  rate hikes beginning  in March  or April of 2015. That plan would bring  the policy rate up  to  1.75 percent  at  the  end  of  the year. Eight  straight  further 1/4-point hikes would get the policy rate up to its longer-run neutral level of 3.75 percent by the end  of 2016. At that point, the unemployment  rate  is  likely  to  be  below  the  natural  rate, but only modestly  so. Inflation would push above 2.0 percent, but some  expected overshoot is appropriate given the likelihood of inflation shortfalls this year and  next. In my  view, a hallmark  of successful monetary policy is a stable, 2-percent  expected 5-year inflation rate. (Another hallmark is a negative correlation  between  output  and  inflation  surprises.)

An increase in the policy rate  any  slower than that  outlined above would  likely produce too much overshoot  on both sides of our dual mandate. Our  track record on achieving a 'soft landing'  once overshoot  is  significant  is  not  encouraging.

In summary,  I'm  showing  a  more  rapid  policy-rate  increase  than  last  time,  but  a  path  that  eventually ends up at a slightly lower level. The  more-rapid  increase is meant  to limit the amount  by which  the economy  overshoots  its  long-run  equilibrium. The  lower  long-run  level of the policy rate acknowledges  a  somewhat  weaker  long-run  growth  outlook. Although  the  policy-rate  path  is  steeper than  before,  it  incorporates  a  realistic  amount  of  gradualism,  with  rate  hikes  limited  to  1/4-point  increments. We  can  afford this  amount of gradualism  only because prospective demand pressures from the public sector  and  overseas  are  limited, and because inflation promises to run below  target in the near  term.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

I anticipate  following  the  Committee's June  2011  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path  is steeper  than  in  the  Tealbook,  I  anticipate  that  we  would  reduce  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet more  quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 5: No

I have no basis for knowing  how  the  balance  sheet  will have to change  to produce  the appropriate interest  rate  path.

I favor immediate  cessation of long-term asset purchases and reinvestment of maturing mortgagebacked  securities.

Respondent 9: Yes

The staff is assuming that all re-investments, including those of MBS paydowns,  will  cease at the  time of liftoff. It's worth  noting that this policy will lead the size of the balance sheet to be correlated with  the evolution  of mortgage  rates. In particular,  a rapid  decline  in mortgage  rates  will  lead  to a rapid run-down  in  the  size of the balance  sheet. This  correlation  is  'anti-stabilization'  declines in mortgage rates  are likely to be associated  with declines in future growth prospects.

The Committee  should  consider a policy of always re-investing MBS  paydowns  (although  that re-investment  could  be  in  Treasuries).

N/A

Respondent 15: Yes

As in the Tealbook,  we  expect  the  pace of purchases  to be reduced  in measured  steps, and  for the purchase program  to  conclude before  the  end  of  the year,  with  cumulative purchases  totaling  about $1.5  trillion.

However, our assumption  concerning reinvestment differs from that of the Tealbook. Whereas the Tealbook  assumes  reinvestment  halts  at the time of FFR  lift-off, we assume  that reinvestment continues until economic  and  financial conditions indicate that the exit from the zero lower bound appears to be sustainable and the risks of a reversion are deemed to be negligible. Based on our modal outlook, we expect that  time to be near the end of  2015. While, as noted in the reinvestment  memo to the  FOMC,  the  difference  between  the  balance  sheet  paths  using  the  Tealbook  assumption  or  ours  is fairly small, we believe there is a significant  signaling effect such that adopting  a strategy of waiting  to halt  reinvestment  will  reduce  appreciably  the  risk  of  an  unwarranted  pulling  forward  of  the  expected lift-off date  and  tightening  in  financial  conditions  that  would  ultimately  jeopardize  a  smooth  take-off of interest  rates.

More  generally, in our view the balance  sheet  remains  a significant part of the overall stance of policy, and  consequently  also  requires  continued  guidance  about  its  evolution. Even  though  the  bar should be set rather high  to promote  an  active role  for balance sheet policy  as normalization proceeds, its ability to affect term premia  and  financial  conditions  to support  achieving  the FOMC  objectives should  not  be  overlooked  or  dismissed  a  priori.

Respondent 16: No

I am  content to see asset purchases wind down at the current pace, wrapping  up  in October, provided longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and  signs of financial excess do not  markedly increase.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes  are  associated  with  sustained weakness in  aggregate demand through a variety of channels, which policy has  only partially offset. Many of the  associated headwinds are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing appears poised to  continue  its recovery despite the pickup in  mortgage  rates  since the middle  of  last  year  and  some  uneven  recent  data;
- · Consumer  balance  sheets  as  well  as  banking  and  credit  conditions  are  improving;
- · The  drag  from  contractionary  fiscal  policy  is  steadily  diminishing;
- · The  global  economy is  slowly  improving,  and  a  severe  crisis  in  Europe  or  emerging  markets  looks less likely over  time. Still, the durability of the European recovery is uncertain, and deflationary risks  are  substantial. Potential  financial  disruptions  in  emerging  markets  also  remain  a  concern;
- · Policy  uncertainty  is  back  to  fairly  normal  levels.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow  us  to  continue  to  make progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps  over  the  next  couple of years. Even with substantial monetary  stimulus, it will take a sustained period of above-trend growth  to  return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of  inflation,  significant  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets  and  mostly  subdued  commodity and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's 2 percent inflation  target  for the next  few years. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and diminishing  slack  eventually pull inflation back  to  our objective.

Respondent 3: My expectation is for a pattern of continued moderate recovery as household deleveraging continues  (slowly)  and  as  fiscal  contraction  loosens. Notwithstanding the  apparent  significant decline in Q1  2014 GDP, I  continue to look for an uptick in growth  later this year and into next as consumer  spending becomes  more  supported by  cumulative  increases  in  income  owing  to  steady job creation and, eventually, some  more  widespread  increases in compensation. The labor market continues  to improve  and  consumer  and  business  sentiment  support  continued  recovery. I now  look at the  continued  relative  weakness  of  residential  construction  as  more  a  factor  limiting  higher  growth than as a downside risk. However, until we have a better sense of what  accounts for those Q1  numbers (whether  they  reflect  aberrations,  statistical  mistakes  that  will  later  be  corrected,  or  something  more meaningful  for  future  economic  performance),  some  uneasiness  around  these  projections  will  linger.

Respondent 4: I expect output growth  to accelerate to 3 percent in the second half of 2014 as the headwinds  that have been  holding down growth recede  The pace  of growth  then runs somewhat above  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  trend  rate  of  2.4  percent  over  2015  and  2016  . With  a  moderate pace  of growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment  rate to move down to about 5.6 percent by the end of  2015, at which  time it reaches my estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will  rise  gradually to 1.8 percent  in  2014  and  2  percent  in  2015  and  2016. Inflation  stays  anchored  around  my  target  of 2 percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary policy by  ending  asset purchases in  2014Q3  and then beginning  to raise rates in  2014Q4.

Respondent 5: Key  factor is one mentioned  in  TB-the  enormous  uncertainty  about  the  futurewhich  is a permanent  feature  of  the  economy. In this case it leads me  to put a bit more  weight  on past 'normal' behavior  than  on  the  impact  of  the Gt. Recession.

Respondent 6: Population  growth  in  the  16-64  age  group will be below  0.5 percent  each year. Real GDP  per  employee  has  risen slightly less than 1 percent over the last 3 years and is not likely to change  dramatically  over  the forecast period. Therefore  my  estimate  of the medium-term  trend  in real GDP is  less than 2 percent, well below what we have experienced in the past. My  forecast is that growth  will be  modestly  above  trend,  which  will push  the unemployment rate below  its  long-run value by  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 7: The pace of economic activity in the first half of this year is noticeably slower than what was anticipated in the past two rounds of projections.  While temporary  factors have likely played a role in the disappointing pace of growth so far, the acceleration in demand, rather than being manifested in the incoming data, is once again a feature of the outlook only. Nevertheless, there  are  signs  that  point  to  some  improvement  in  demand  going  forward. Consumers'  assessment  of economic  conditions remains relatively upbeat  and household spending is holding  up  well despite some income  loss  associated  with  the  expiration  of  the  EUC benefits  at  the beginning  of  the year. Private consumption  expenditures  are  being  supported  by  continued  gains  in  payrolls  and  in  household's  net worth. Moreover,  in  the  most  recent  months,  the  waning  effect  of  last  year's  fiscal  tightening  has  led to an  improvement  in  the  pace  of  growth  of  real  disposable  income.

Ultimately,  the  ongoing  acceleration  in  private  consumption  expenditures  should  translate  into  a more  broad-based  recovery. However,  we  expect  the  investment  components  of  demand  to  respond with  more delay than usual to signs of improvement in the  economy.  This is because the disappointing pace  of  activity  so  far  is  likely  to  have  generated  uncertainty  about  the  sustainability  of  a  more  robust recovery. As a result, the projected  acceleration  in economic  activity  remains  modest by historical standards  and  requires  continued  support  from  monetary  policy. The  outlook  is  conditioned  on  the current  asset  purchase  program  to  total  $1.5  trillion. Liftoff of the federal  funds  rate  from  the  zerolower-bound is expected to occur  early in  2016,  once the  economy is projected to be about one year away  from  reaching  full  employment. We  judge  that  the  most  recent  readings  of  the  unemployment rate  are  understating  the  extent  of  labor  market  slack. As  a result,  even  with  the  economy  poised  to accelerate some, we expect only a gradual decline in the unemployment  rate, as the cyclical  component of labor force participation  returns  to a level that is more  in line with historical norms. In all, the projected pace  of  economic  activity  should bring the unemployment rate at  its equilibrium  level by early  2017. By then, core PCE inflation is expected to be still below target at 1.7 percent.

We  view the risks to the real outlook as roughly balanced. With an improving economy, the assessment  of  slack  becomes  more  crucial. We  continue  to  estimate  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  is roughly  5.2  percent. While  the  equilibrium  rate  of  unemployment  could  have  increased because  of some  impairment  in  labor  market  efficiency,  there  are  offsetting  factors  from  the  current composition  of  the  labor  force. Relative  to  2007,  an  older  and  more  educated  workforce  tends  to  lower the equilibrium  rate  of  unemployment,  other  things  equal. Risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  are  skewed to the downside,  as  the  extent  to  which  long-run  inflation  expectations  can  anchor  inflation  remains uncertain.

Respondent 8: Adverse  weather  and  inventory  behavior  hampered  economic  growth  in  the  first quarter, but incoming  data  point  to stronger growth  in the second  quarter. Key  drivers of growth going  forward  include: highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  improving  household  balance  sheets, strengthening  labor markets  that support  consumer  spending, easing fiscal headwinds, and further relaxation  of  tight  credit  conditions. These  forces  are  expected  to  support  growth  slightly  above  trend over  the  forecast  horizon,  with  the  economy  reaching  steady  state  in  2017.

While  inflation is below our 2 percent goal, recent inflation readings are starting to firm. The firming appears to be reasonably broad-based,  although part of it reflects the direct effects or indirect pass-through from recent increases in agricultural and other commodity  prices which may abate. Nevertheless,  stable  inflation  expectations  and  an  improving  economy  suggest  that  wage  growth  will strengthen  and  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to  the 2 percent  longer-run  objective by  the end  of  2016.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. Risks  to my  outlook  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 9: The  Lindner  memo  suggests  that  an  econometrician, who  is forming  his/her expectation  for  inflation  over the medium  and  even  long-term  using  available  past  data,  would  expect inflation  to  converge  to  1  3/4  percent. This  is well  below  our  target.

Fortunately, the public does not  form their expectations in this way, and they seem to believe that the  Committee will deliver on its promise to return inflation to 2% soon. But how long  can this happy situation continue? Put  another  way, how  long can we continue  to undershoot  our  inflation target before  we  start  to  see  the  effects  of  that  under-running  on  expectations?

This  is a major  risk  facing  the  Committee  at  this  time.

Respondent 10: I view  much  of  the  weakness  in  the  first  quarter  as  reflecting  severe  weather  and other transitory factors. As such, I  am sticking with my previous forecast which  calls for a resumption of a 3 percent run-rate in output  growth  the remainder  of 2014. Amid  dissipating  headwinds  and ongoing  policy  accommodation,  GDP  growth  rises  modestly  above  potential  over  the  medium  term, gradually  closing  the  'gap'  and  aiding  a  further  firming-up  of  labor  markets.

My  outlook hinges  on  continued strength in  consumer spending, a firming  in the pace of  manufacturing growth, and  stronger capital expansion. In my  outlook, strength in  consumption is bolstered by a more robust pace of disposable income  growth and improving  household wealth;  and  manufacturing production  is  aided  by  a  resumption  of  export  growth.

The risks to my growth  outlook remain balanced.  Given relatively weak pace of real GDP growth during the recovery  to date, and  negative growth in the first quarter of this year, I  cannot dismiss the possibility  that  I  am  overestimating  the  economy's  underlying  run-rate. At  the  same  time,  I  also  see the possibility that latent economic  strength  has  been  masked  by  significant  headwinds  (e.g., fiscal drag  and  policy  uncertainty)  and  idiosyncratic  shocks  (e.g.,  severe  weather).

I judge  the  risks  around  my  inflation  outlook  as  balanced. Inflation  appears  to  have  moved  higher in recent months,  consistent  with  my projection  for  inflation to gradually  converge  to the FOMC's explicit numerical  target by 2016. The  uncertainty regarding the amount  of slack in the economy suggests risks on either side of my baseline inflation projection. On the one hand, wage growth remains  modest  and  alternative  measures  of  labor  market  slack  are  still  stubbornly  above  their  prerecession  levels. On  the  other  hand, slow labor productivity  growth  is  suggestive  of  lower potential output  and  less  economic  slack.

Respondent 11: I view the weak  economic  performance  in  the  first quarter as temporary. I see sufficient  momentum and  monetary  accommodation to project that the unemployment and inflation rates  will  be  very  close  to  their  long-run  values  by  the  close  of  2014.

Respondent 12: The key  factors shaping  our forecast are the same  as they have been  for some time. Accommodative  monetary  policy,  continued  improvement  in  household  and  business  balance sheets,  and  the  diminution  of  fiscal  restraint  should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we move  through  the  projection  period. Furthermore,  over  time,  fewer  households  and  small  businesses will find themselves  with limited access to traditional credit markets. Pent-up  demand  for  capital goods and consumer  durables should provide further impetus to growth. Demand  from  abroad  is

projected  to  firm  as  the  recovery  in  Europe  gains  traction  and  emerging  market  economies  return  to a more  solid  growth  path. Our  forecast  also assumes  that  there  will  not be any  unusual  changes  in financial  conditions  beyond  those  warranted  by  an  improved  economic  outlook  and  further  relaxation of constraints  on  household  and  small  business  credit.

These  fundamental  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above potential  in 2014:H2,  2015  and  2016. (The  weak  growth  in  2014:Q1  is  assumed  to  be  entirely  transitory.) Our path  for GDP  closes resource  gaps by  the  end  of  2016. Resource slack  thus  is  expected to exert a diminishing  downward  influence  on inflation as we move  through  the projection period; furthermore,  we  assume  inflation  will  be  pulled  up  by  inflation  expectations. In order  to  achieve  our inflation target, we assume  the FOMC  will  not begin to remove  accommodation  until  the one- to two-year-ahead outlook  clearly has inflation headed back  towards 2 percent. Given the normal inertia in the inflation process, such  a path  could well be  consistent  with some modest overshooting  of  target beyond  the  projection  horizon.

The  main  sources  of  uncertainty  and  risks  to  our  forecast  are  described  in  2(b)  above.

Respondent 13: My  outlook  for  real  growth  is  little  changed  compared  to  March. I expect  a  sharp rebound  in  the  second  quarter  from  the  decline  we  saw  in  the  first quarter. I have  also lowered  the path  of  the  unemployment  rate  through  the  end  of  2015.

Looking  ahead,  I  continue  to  expect  above  trend  growth  around  3%  through  2016. The  fundamentals are the same: fiscal drag  ends, labor markets  improve,  household  wealth  continues  to  rise, and financing  conditions  are  supportive.

I expect  the  improvement  in  labor  markets  to  continue. Labor  market  conditions  indicators  constructed  by  my  staff  show  continued  improvement  in  labor  market  activity  and  labor  market  momentum  at  its highest  level. Robust  growth  in  aggregate  weekly  hours  and  the  University  of  Michigan's measure  of  job  availability  are  key  factors  behind  the  high  level  of  momentum.

Finally,  turning  to  inflation,  recent  data  releases  show  that  the  deceleration  we  saw  last  year  has ended  and  we  have  seen  a  broad-based  increase  in  inflation  over  the  last  couple  months. This  gives me greater  confidence in my  outlook  for a gradual increase in inflation, reaching  2 percent by  the  end of 2015.

Respondent 14: My  forecast  envisions  that  the  decline  in  GDP  in  the  previous  quarter  proves  to be due to transitory  factors, and that growth picks up  notably over the remainder of this and the next several years, that the unemployment  rate  continues to decline and inflation moves slowly back  toward the Committee's  2 percent  longer-run  objective. An  accommodative  monetary policy,  some  further easing of credit constraints, and  diminishing  fiscal drag will serve as important  factors  propelling  a more rapid  expansion. After  accounting  for the effects of severe  winter weather, private final demand seems  to  be  strengthening,  although  at  a  slightly  less  robust  pace  than  previously  estimated. Going forward, I expect PCE  to accelerate further. Factors propelling this pickup in PCE  include the waning  impact  of  tax increases last year, a strengthening  of  household  balance  sheets  due  to  rising house  and  equity prices, improving  prospects  for the labor market  and  robust  auto  sales driven by low interest rates, readily available credit, and an aging fleet generating substantial replacement demand. Residential investment  has slowed significantly since last fall, likely due to the effects of rising mortgage rates and also reflecting severe winter weather, but I expect a pickup in housing starts  and  considerable  growth  in  residential  investment  later  this year. Investment  in  equipment  and intangibles has also advanced  at a slow pace, on balance, in recent quarters, but recent indicators point  to  stronger  growth  in  this  category  in  the  near-term. With  respect  to  the  labor  market,  I  have been surprised that payroll employment has been rising  at a pace of  200,000 jobs per  month over the past year despite only moderate GDP growth-a pattern that  leads me to project  continued moderate productivity growth over the next few years. Unemployment  has  also declined by more than I'd anticipated  due  in part to a decline in labor force participation, which  I view  as partly cyclical. In

part  for  this  reason,  I  see  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  as  understating  the  extent  of  slack  in the labor  market. I anticipate some rebound, or at  least a flattening  out of the participation rate, and a slower decline  in unemployment  going  forward. Inflation has been  running below  the  Committee's 2% objective in spite of the  fact that inflation  expectations  are well-anchored. In part, I believe this reflects significant remaining  slack  in  labor  and  product  markets. My  forecast  envisions  a  return  to 2%  inflation  beyond  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 15: Other  conditioning  assumptions: We  expect  the  lower  degree  of  inflation  persistence evident since the early 1990s to continue. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. We project foreign real GDP growth (GDP weighted)  at 2.9% (up from  2.8% in March) in  2014, and  3.1% (up  from  3.0%  in  March)  in  2015. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  dollar  exchange  rate  are similar  to those  in the Tealbook. Reflecting  futures  quotes,  our  assumed  path  of  WTI  oil  prices  has moved  up  to $99.50 (from  $96.00 in March)  for 2014Q4,  and  to  $91.00 (from  $87.50 in March)  for 2015Q4.  Our  federal  fiscal  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook. We  adopt  the  Tealbook assumptions  regarding  equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: Based  on the data we have received so far for the second quarter, we are reasonably confident that the decline of real GDP  in  the first quarter was due to temporary  factors and that growth will rebound in 2014Q2. The order of magnitude of the second quarter rebound remains uncertain, although  we currently anticipate real GDP  growth  will  be around  3 1 2 / %  (annual  rate), which  is  somewhat  lower  than  our  expectations  of  a  few  weeks  ago.

From  a  first  half  growth  rate  of  about  1 1 4 / %,  we  anticipate  that  growth  will  move  up  to  around  3 1 4 / % in the second half of  2014 and then to 3 1 2 / % in  2015. The basis  for the  more rapid growth is that the  headwinds  subside  while  the  improved  underlying  fundamentals  exert  themselves  more  forcefully. These  fundamentals  include  the  effective  repair  of  households'  balance  sheets,  the  working-off  of  the excess supply of housing, and the  continued rise of home prices. In addition, as demonstrated by  asset price  movements  and  the  surge  of  M&amp;amp;A  activity  this  year,  risk  aversion  is  beginning  to  subside, which  is  contributing  to  more  supportive  financial  conditions. Fiscal  consolidation  at  both  the  federal and the state and local levels is largely over. And growth prospects  among  many of our major trading partners  have  improved.

These  improved  fundamentals  result  in  a  marked  improvement  in  the  growth  of  fixed  investment over the forecast horizon, providing  a boost to income  growth, which  allows consumer  spending  to improve somewhat further.  Real  export growth picks up  somewhat, but the improvement of domestic demand produces  a  significant  increase  in  the  rate  of  growth  of  real  imports,  such  that  the  net  export growth  contribution is,  on average,  modestly negative. Growth of inventories keeps pace  with growth of final sales, such  that  inventory-sales  ratios  remain  relatively  stable.

All else equal,  the  stronger  output  growth  should  translate  into  more  robust  employment  growth; as a result, we  anticipate  that  the  unemployment  rate  declines  to  about  6%  by  the  end  of  2014  and to around  5 1 4 / %  (near  our point estimate  of the natural  rate) by the end of 2015. However,  there is considerable uncertainty around this projection due to uncertainty over the future path of the participation rate. The participation rate averaged 62.8% in April and May, down  from 63.1% in 2014Q1.  We  expect  it  to  begin  trending  upward  in  the  near  future,  reaching  63.4%  by  2015Q4,  but  if the participation rate does not begin to rise soon, it  will be difficult for it to reach that level by  then.

With  the unemployment  rate  near  the  longer-run  natural  rate by the end of 2015, we see little slack by then. We  thus  expect  real GDP  growth  to  slow  in 2016 to near our estimate  of potential GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  stay  close  to  its  natural  rate.

We  expect  inflation to rise gradually over the next couple of years, and to be near the FOMC objective by  the end of  2015, at which  time we expect inflation to stabilize. This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in resource utilization, a firming in  global demand,  and the upward pull exercised by  stable inflation  expectations. Underpinning the  latter  assumption is the broad stability of long-term inflation expectations  across different financial and  survey  measures,  combined  with ongoing

moderate  growth  of  wages  and  unit  labor  costs.

Respondent 16: As labor-market slack diminishes, the urgency of our  monetary policy deliberations intensifies. If we delay action for very long, the opportunity for a gradual withdrawal of  accommodation will slip away.

The  forces  supporting  growth  in  the  U.S.  economy  remain  in  place. Looking  ahead,  the  balance of risks if anything  favors  an  acceleration  in GDP.  That's  important because however disappointing and  uneven  output  growth  may  have  been  over  the  course  of  the  recovery,  the  unemployment  rate  has so far declined  with  remarkable  consistency,  falling  by  just  shy  of  1  percentage  point  per  year. With real-growth prospects  improving,  the probability  is high  that  one year  from now  the unemployment rate  will be  within  the  range  of  SEP  natural-rate  estimates.

On  the  inflation  front,  research  which  suggests  that  the  unemployment  rate  has  lost  its  usefulness as an indicator of near-term  wage  and  price  pressures  is not compelling. The  modest  increase  that we've  seen  in  wage  inflation  so  far  in  this  recovery  is  completely  consistent  with  past  experience. We can  expect  significantly  faster  wage  increases  as  the  unemployment  rate  moves  down. Trimmed-mean PCE  inflation-which  captures  medium-term headline  inflation  trends better  than  conventional  core PCE  inflation-responds  to  changes  in  the  unemployment  rate  as  well  as  to  the  level  of  unemployment. Thanks  partly  to  this  effect, my  inflation  projection  rises  to 2 percent  in 2016, and  above  2  percent thereafter.

To  limit  the  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  inflation  to  manageable  levels,  it  is  necessary  that we  achieve  a  neutral  policy  stance  by  the  end  of  2016. The  only  way  to  do  this  without  one  or  more 50-basis-point  hikes  is  to start raising  the policy  rate either late in the first quarter  of 2015  or early in the  second  quarter.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Since March, I have made only modest changes to the broad  contours of my forecast. The  data  remain  consistent  with  a  recovery  that  gains  traction  over  the  final  three  quarters  of  2014 and into 2015. Weather, inventory adjustments, and net exports were a bigger transitory drag on growth in the first quarter of 2014 than  I expected. However, the  economy has  rebounded in the second quarter  and  is poised  to  continue  steady  growth  over  the  remainder  of  the year. Consequently, on net my  GDP  forecast for 2014 is only slightly weaker than in March. The overall pace of the recovery  remains  strong  enough  to  continue  bringing  the  unemployment  rate  down.

In fact, the unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  what  I  expected  in  March,  leading  me  to  lower  its projected path. I currently expect the unemployment rate to reach 6 percent before the end of  2014. Finally, recent data on core and overall inflation have come in a bit higher than I expected. However,  much  of  this  positive  surprise  was  in  a  few  volatile  components  and  has  led  to  only  a  slight increase  in  my  inflation  outlook  for  2014  as  a  whole.

Respondent 3: I have  significantly  lowered  my  estimate  of  GDP  growth  in  2014,  based  entirely  on the dramatic,  and apparently  continuing, downgrade in  estaimted growth  for Q1. It is somwthing  of a leap of faith not to have altered my  projection for 2014 H2, but for now  I join in the consensus that whatever  was going on in Q1 was  highly idiosyncratic, and only pushed  off the trajectory of stronger growth, rather than  alterned  it. I have  also reduced by  a  few  tenths of a percentage point my projections  for  unemployment  in  each  of  the  three  outlook  years. This  change  essentially  incrporates the greater-than-expected  decline  in  unemployment  over  the  early  part  of  this  year,  and  reflects  the staff reduction in projected  labor  force participation  rates, but does not reflect  any  materital change in my  outlook  for  the  strength  of  the  labor  market.

Respondent 4: Recent  data  point to a weaker  economy  in  2014Q1  than  I  anticipated  in March, leading  me to revise down my forecast for real GDP growth in  2014. As well, the incoming data on the labor  market  led  me  to revise down my projected path  for  the unemployment rate  over  the  forecast horizon.

Respondent 5: Not  relevant.

Respondent 6: New  data  have  led  me  to  lower my  projection  for  GDP  growth,  lower  the  unemployment rate,  and  raise my projection  for inflation in the first half of  2014.

Respondent 7: The projected pace of growth over the  forecast horizon is now slower relative to the March  projection. This  reflects the disappointing  nature  of  incoming  data  and  a  downward  revision to potential  GDP  growth  over  the  period  2014-16. The  expected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is also somewhat  less  favorable  in the medium  term. Given  the weaker-than-expected  incoming  data, the  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  later  liftoff  date  for  the  federal  funds  rate  from  the  zero-lowerbound. There have been  no  material changes to the inflation  outlook.

Respondent 8: The  near-term  forecast  has  been  influenced  by  the  weak  2014Q1  growth  data  and the  firming  in  recent  inflation  readings.

Respondent 9: There  has  been  little  change  in  my  forecast,  except  that  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  has  led  me  to,  once  again,  lower  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment.

Respondent 10: My  forecast today is broadly similar to where it was in March, except for an arithmetic adjustment to my  2014 growth projection in response to first quarter weakness and  a lower 'jumping-off' point  for my  unemployment rate projection. I have not adjusted my inflation  forecast, as recent readings  on inflation  are  consistent  with my previous projection.

Respondent 11: Real GDP  growth  for  the first half of 2014, as well as for the entire year, was marked  down  based  on  additional  data  since  the  previous  SEP.  Adverse  weather  and  inventory  adjustments were major  factors  contributing  to the weak performance.  I view these  factors as temporary. Additional  data  also  contributed  to  a  reduction  in  unemployment  for  2014  and  for  increases  in  both measures  of  inflation  for  the  first  half  and  for  all  of  2014.

Respondent 12: Our outlook for growth in  2014 has been revised down 1/2 percentage point. This entirely reflects a weaker-than-expected first quarter, as we  continue to expect growth to bounce back sharply in  2014:Q2  and then return to a run-rate of a bit over 3 percent for the remainder of the year. Furthermore,  since  March  labor  markets  have  improved  more  than  we  anticipated  and  our  business contacts become increasingly optimistic.  Accordingly, we  feel that the downside risks to the projection for growth  have  diminished  since  the  March  SEP.

Further reevaluation of labor market trends (including, like the Tealbook, labor quality) and changes  to our projection  for capital deepening  resulted  in downward  revisions  to  our assumptions for potential output  growth  of about 1 4 / percentage  point per year over the 2014-2016  period. We have marked  down our forecasts for actual GDP  growth  in 2015 and 2016 commensurately. Our reassessment of potential also has led us to reduce our assumptions for long-run growth to 2-1/4 percent  and  for  the  long-run  federal  funds  rate  to  3-3/4  percent.

Our  forecast  assumes  a  pronounced  declined  in  structural  labor  force  participation; nonetheless, the  magnitude  of  the  decline  in  participation  since  March  was  larger  than  we  expected,  and  we  think there is an even  larger cyclical participation  gap  to close than  we  did before. Accordingly,  we  have built in a somewhat  slower  decline in the unemployment  rate  than  what  would be indicated by a straight  reading  of  Okun's  Law.

The  incoming  inflation  data  since  the  March  SEP  have  been  somewhat  higher  than  we  expected. The  new  data  did  not  cause  us  to  revise  our  inflation  forecast,  but  we  feel  the  downside  risks  are  not quite  as  large  as  they  were  in  March.

Respondent 13: My  forecast  has  not  significantly  changed  since  the  last  SEP.  I  have  reduced  my real GDP  growth  and  unemployment  rate  forecasts  in  2014  compared  to  the  March  SEP  reflecting data we have received this year. The reduction in my 2014 unemployment  rate  forecast  carries through to a slightly  smaller  reduction  in  2015.

Respondent 14: My  forecast has  changed  only  marginally  since March. My projected paths  for growth  and  for the unemployment  rate  are  slightly  lower, on balance, over the forecast horizon, in light of incoming  data suggesting  continued slow productivity growth,  and  my projection  for inflation is little changed.

Respondent 15: At the time of the March  SEP,  we  did not anticipate the decline in real GDP in 2014Q1. While  a  sizable  rebound  in  2014Q2  appears  to  be  in  the  cards,  real  GDP  growth  in  the first half of the year probably  will be substantially below  our projection in March. However, the data appear  to  be  consistent  with  the  first  quarter  weakness  coming  from  transitory  factors;  consequently, the  changes  to  the  real  growth  forecast  in  the  second  half  of  2014  and  beyond  have  been  small.

The decline in the unemployment  rate since the March SEP was greater than we  expected.  Taking the recent data on board, we have lowered the projected path of unemployment  with the result that we now  anticipate  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  its  longer-run  natural  rate  in  late  2015  rather than in the first half of  2016  as we had projected in March.

The recent  inflation data have been  modestly  above  our  expectations  from March,  leading  us  to raise our near-term inflation projection. As in the case of the Tealbook, we see  the recent rise  as reflecting primarily transitory  factors, and thus have made  little  change to the medium-term forecast.

Respondent 16: It is now  fairly  clear  that  GDP  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2014  will  be  even  weaker than I had anticipated. Otherwise, my growth projections are  largely unchanged.  Adjustments to the projected paths  of  the unemployment rate  and  inflation  are  minor. I show a steeper  increase  in  the policy  rate  in  2016  than  previously,  for  reasons  explained  in  my  policy  commentary.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Slightly  slower  growth  in  2015  and  2016.

Respondent 2: My  forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4: My  forecast  calls  for  higher  inflation  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: There  are  no  large  differences.

Respondent 6: The Tealbook projects a surge in  consumer spending  that I  view  as unlikely.

Respondent 7: Our  outlook  for real economic  activity  is somewhat  weaker  than  the  Tealbook's. The  two  forecasts  share  the  same  contours,  but  we  expect  the  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  activity  to be more  subdued. Our  trajectory for the unemployment  rate  is  also affected by the view that the cyclical improvement in labor force participation  will be greater than what the Tealbook is assuming. The  inflation  outlook  is  similar  in  the  two  forecasts.

Respondent 8: My  forecasted  outcomes  are  broadly  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook,  as  I  expect GDP  growth  will  pick  up  from  its dismal  first-quarter reading  and  proceed  at an above-trend  pace from  2014H2  through  2016  and  the unemployment  rate  will  continue  to decline. However, my  forecast calls for somewhat  more  inflationary  pressure  than  the  Tealbook  forecast, which  suggests  a steeper path for the funds rate, as inflation  returns to our 2 percent long-term objective by  the end of  2016.

Respondent 9: Under  appropriate  monetary policy, inflation expectations stay well-anchored  at 2%. The Tealbook is  currently  modelling  expectations  as having  slipped below 2%  for some period of time. So,  my  forecast  requires  no  undershooting  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment.

This exercise of formulating  my projections under appropriate  monetary policy makes less and less sense  to  me!

Respondent 10: My growth and  unemployment projections are not  materially different from those in the Tealbook  for  all  forecast horizons. On inflation, I do not share the  Board  staff's  assessment that inflation  expectations  are  misaligned  with the FOMC's  explicit inflation objective. As such, inflation reaches  2.0  percent  in  my  outlook  by  2016.

Respondent 11: Important differences in real GDP growth occur in  2016 and in the long  run. I see less growth than the Tealbook in  2016  and I  see somewhat higher growth in the  long  run. With respect to the unemployment rate projection,  an important difference is that my  natural rate projection is 6 percent  rather  than  5.2  percent. Noteworthy  differences  in  the  inflation  projections  are  due  to  my view that overshooting  of the 2 percent  target is  likely, while the Tealbook projections do not include such an overshooting. In addition, I see core and  headline  inflation at 2 percent  in 2016, while the Tealbook projections remain below 2 percent through  2016.

Respondent 12: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  early  in  2016,  three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of  increase  after  liftoff  is similar. Accordingly,  at  the  end of the projection period  our  assumed  level of the funds rate  only reaches  1.25 percent.

We  are projecting  a  touch  less robust growth in  2014:Q2-Q4 than the Tealbook. Our projection for growth  in 2015-2016  is close to the Tealbook. However, we assume  a somewhat  faster pace of potential output  growth, and so our projection just closes output  gaps by the end of 2016 instead having  the overshooting  of potential  found in the Tealbook. Our inflation  forecasts  are similar.

Respondent 13: I see growth  in real GDP  about 1 4 / percentage  points slower in 2014 and 2016 than  does  Tealbook  and  growth  in  2015  the  same. Partly  as  a  result,  I  expect  the  unemployment  rate to be  higher  over  the  forecast  horizon,  including  in  the  longer  run. I also  expect  inflation  to  rise  more quickly than Tealbook and will average 2 percent in 2015 and  2016. Finally, I  expect the federal funds rate  will be  3 percent  at  the  end  of  2016  compared  to  2.3  percent  in  Tealbook.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Our  forecast  for real GDP growth in  2015 is somewhat above that of the Tealbook, largely reflecting differences in business fixed investment. The Tealbook projects  slower  growth in business fixed investment in  2015 than in  our  forecast; the reason  for this difference in part appears to be  related  to  the  Tealbook  changes  in  potential  GDP  over  the  near  term  and  the  the  reduction  in its longer-run  GDP  growth  assumption  (discussed  further  below). With  less  slack  over  the  near  term as well  as lower  expected  future  growth,  firms  under  the  Tealbook  assumptions  have  less  incentive  to invest.

For  2016, real GDP growth in  our projections is  almost  one percentage point below the Tealbook forecast. This  difference  reflects  two  factors. First, in our  forecast,  unemployment  is  near  its  longerrun natural rate at the end of 2015 whereas  the Tealbook  still has a small gap. Second  and  more importantly,  under  the  Tealbook's  revised  assumption  for  the  medium-term  underlying  inflation  rate, real GDP  has  to  continue  to  grow  above  potential,  pushing  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  longerrun  natural  rate,  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  eventually  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal  (which  lies above the underlying inflation rate). In our framework,  with anchored inflation expectations and  little slack  in 2016,  we  anticipate  inflation  to  be  near  the  longer-run  goal.

Looking  over the general  contour of the forecasts, there is a fundamental difference between us and the  Tealbook  concerning  the  assumed  potential  growth  rate  over  both  the  short  term  and  the  longer run. The  Tealbook  has  reduced  the  level of potential GDP  and  its growth  rate over recent cycles. These changes reflect the reduction in unemployment at a  time when real GDP growth has been weak: to resolve the apparent inconsistency  with Okun's Law, the Tealbook has made changes to its potential GDP  assumption  (as  well  as  its  shorter-run  assumption  for  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment). Based on our analysis of unemployment  dynamics  during  the  middle of long expansions (at 5 years, the current  expansion  qualifies  as  long),  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  in  this  expansion  relative to Okun's Law implications has not been particularly unusual,  and thus we have not seen the need to adjust  our  potential  growth  assumptions.

In addition, the Tealbook has  lowered  its assumption  for the longer-run potential GDP  growth rate,  arguing  that  labor quality  will not  improve  to  the  extent previously  anticipated,  leading  to  lower trend productivity growth. While  it is not unreasonable  to posit that longer-run growth  could be lower than  previously  assumed,  we  believe  it  is premature  to  make  that  change,  and  will  wait  until the  annual  revisions  to  GDP  and  productivity  are  released  this  summer  to  revisit  our  assumptions  in time for the September SEP. So  for  now,  we have  maintained  our  estimate  of  the potential  growth rate,  which  is  above  the  revised  Tealbook  assumption.

In terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  some  differences  between  the  two  projections. On the real side,  although we see uncertainty  around the real GDP  and  unemployment  forecasts

as somewhat  less  than  in  March,  we  continue  to  see  it  as  higher  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty at near normal levels. This assessment reflects our view that the unusual nature of the current expansion  as well as a policy environment  that  is constrained  by the effective lower bound  leaves uncertainty about real  activity above  even the  more  elevated SEP standard  associated with  the  20-year  window  of  forecast  errors. Over  the  medium  term,  we  see  the  risks  to  real  activity as balanced  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  them  skewed  a  little  to  the  downside: the  difference  seems  to reflect that we  place  somewhat  more  probability  on  headwinds  receding  faster  than  anticipated. As for  inflation,  our  views  on  the  risk  assessment  is  similar  to  that  in  the  Tealbook,  but  we  ascribe  a  little more  uncertainty  around  our  projection.

Respondent 16: I believe  longer-term  inflation  expectations  are  currently  well  anchored  at  a  rate consistent with the Committee's  inflation objective. I'm convinced  that in the near term inflation responds to changes in slack as well as the level of slack. For these reasons, I see inflation rising farther  and  more  quickly  than  does  the  Tealbook.

At the same  time, I believe that increases in the unemployment rate are difficult to  contain  once they begin: It's proven nearly impossible for policymakers to 'nudge' the unemployment rate upward to restrain inflation. An  implication  is that the risks to mis-estimating  slack  are asymmetric: It is substantially more  dangerous  to overestimate  slack than to underestimate  it. The  models  used  by Board  staff appear  not to recognize the non-linearity  in the  economy's dynamics.

These differences  in perspective  mean  that I  see substantially  less benefit  from overshooting  full employment  than  does  the  Tealbook,  and  substantially  greater  risk. In consequence,  I believe it is appropriate  for  monetary  policy  to  move  more  rapidly  to  a  neutral  policy  stance.
