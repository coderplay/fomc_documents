Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes from the fourth  quarter  of  the previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates of change  in, respectively, the price index for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the rate  to which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  December  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  16-17,  2014.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In December 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 15, and 2. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  its  longer  run  growth  and  inflation targets  by  the  end  of  2017.

Respondent 5: All  measures  converge  in  2018,  somewhat  shorter  than  5-6  years. Prior  to  reaching their  long-run  values,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  fall  below  its  long-run  value  of  2%  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  further  below  its  long-run  value  of  5.8%. I also  expect  the  inflation  measures to overshoot  2%.

Respondent 6: Convergence  to  the  mandated  goals  is  expected  to  occur  over  the  2017-18  period.

Respondent 7: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 8: It will be shorter  under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  in  part  because  the  FOMC will take appropriate  steps  to help return  the underlying  rate  of inflation to 2%. My  assessment  of appropriate  monetary  policy  puts  little  weight  on  interest  rate  smoothing.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: No  comment.

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12: Very  hard  to  know,  given  that  we  will  converge  -if  at  all-  to  a  stochastic  steady state.

Respondent 13: I anticipate  that  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  take  less  than 5 years. Specifically,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  slow  to  its  longer-run  rate  by  2017  and  inflation  to rise  to  close  to  2  percent  in  2016. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  will  hit  its  longer-run  level  in  2016, fall below  it  by  the  end  of  2016  and  in  2017,  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 14: We  continue  to  assume  that  the  economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  within  a  range around  2%  and  maintain  a point estimate of 2%. We  currently assess that a reasonable range for the longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%,  and  we  have  maintained  our  point  estimate  of  5%. We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  level  in  2016Q1,  and  for  it  to  fall  slightly below  that  level  later  in  2016,  which  would  be  consistent  with  the  implications  of  some  of  our  scenario analysis  of  labor  flows  as  well  as  our  analysis  of  unemployment  behavior  in  recent  long  expansions.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  (2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI,  based  on the  longer-term  average  of  the  diff erence  between  CPI  and  PCE  inflation). Under  these  conditions  and with  the  resource  gap  anticipated  to  dissipate  over  the  forecast  horizon  (the  unemployment  gap  may not  provide  an  accurate  measure  of  the  resource  gap  at  this  time),  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2017  and  thereafter.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  in  2017.

Respondent 15: We  revised  down  our  estimates  of  the natural  rate of unemployment  in  light  of new  analysis highlighting changes  in the composition  of the labor force towards  groups  with lower average  unemployment  rates. We  also  reduced  our  long-run  equilibrium  funds  rate  estimate  to  better reflect  increased  global  savings  tendencies.

Respondent 16: I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  during the first half of 2015,  and  then  to  fall past  that level. Smooth  convergence  to  the  natural  rate  from below  will  require  deft  maneuvering  and  a  good  deal  of  luck,  and  is  unlikely  to  be  achieved  until  2018. I expect  core  inflation  to  reach  2 percent  in  2016, to overshoot  somewhat  in  2017,  and  not  converge back  to  target  until  2019.

Respondent 17: I formerly  submitted  5.5  percent  as  my  projection  for  the  longer-run  unemployment rate, thinking of that concept as corresponding  to a longer-run average unemployment  rate. On  further  reflection, I think  it makes  more  sense  to  think  that  in  the  absence  of  shocks  and  under appropriate  monetary  policy,  the  unemployment  rate  would  converge  to  a  rate  corresponding  to  rates typically seen in the late stages of business  cycle expansions. This  reflects a sense that shocks  that tend  to  necessitate  sectoral  reallocation  and  thus  temporarily  raise  the  unemployment  rate  are  more frequent  than  shocks  that  reduce  the  unemployment  rate.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 3: The recent volatility in oil prices and the uncertainty about the reponse of oil demand  and  oil  supply  to  the  recent  drop  in  oil  prices  going  forward  imply  a  higher-than-usual  amount of uncertainty  around  energy  prices  and  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 4: It remains  the  case  that  the  extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place  and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 10: Oil  price  futures  appear  to  be  particularly  volatile  at  the  moment,  increasing  the uncertainty  around  my  headline  PCE  projections. I also judge  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  core PCE  inflation  projection  as  'higher.'  This  is  largely  due  to  recent  movements  in  measures  of  inflation compensation  and  uncertainty  regarding  how  inflation  expectations  are  reacting  to  a  prolonged  period of below-target  core  inflation  readings.

Respondent 11: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is similar to its average level over the past 20 years, which, of course, is a period that was characterized by considerable turmoil. Inflation  remains  anchored  by  quite  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal of 2 percent. Inflation expectations  have  now  been  well  anchored  for  about  20  years,  so I see the magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  outlook  as  consistent  with  that  over  the past  20  years.

Respondent 14: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. The  width  of these intervals have  narrowed  some  since  the  December SEP,  as  the  recent  developments  generally  have  been  consistent  with  the  central  forecast. Nevertheless, the probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  are  still  wider  than  the  SEP  standard,  in  part because of the still-extraordinary economic  and  financial environment, including the policy rate in the U.S.  remaining  constrained  by  its  eff ective  lower  bound  and  the  negative  rates  seen  in  a  number of areas in Europe. The  possible net impact  on  real activity of the recent decline in oil prices and of continuing  dollar appreciation  is not yet clear, contributing  to the uncertainty. In contrast, the forecast intervals for core PCE  inflation appear broadly consistent with the SEP  standard, taking rough  account  for  the  diff erences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Respondent 3: Recent  oil and  commodity  price  declines,  a  higher  dollar,  limited  wage  pressures, and  weak  foreign  aggregate  demand  have  reduced  inflation  to  low  levels  recently. Over  the  medium term,  I expect  the  eff ects of dollar appreciation  to  wane,  and  wage  pressures  to  increase  as  resource utilization  rise. But  there  are  risks  that  these  factors  continue  to  weigh  on  prices  longer  than  I  expect, and  that  the  dollar  strengthens  further. In this  low  inflation  environment,  inflation  expectations  may start  to decline.

Respondent 4: I view  the  risks to inflation as weighted  to  the  upside  over  the  medium  term  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: The  risks  to  my  projections  are  broadly  balanced. Weakness  abroad  is  a  downside risk to my  forecast. Further  weakening  in  the  economies  of  key  trading  partners  may  have  a  larger eff ect on  U.S.  export  growth  than  I  am  forecasting. But  central  banks  in  foreign  economies  have  been adding  accommodation,  which  should  help  stimulate  global  demand.

Oil  prices  are  low,  which  should  be  a  net  positive  for  spending. The  U.S.  labor  market  is  showing solid  gains,  which  will  support  household  spending. The  combination  of  these  factors  alongside  highly accommodative  monetary  policy  raises  the  possibility  that  the  U.S.  economy  may  be  poised  for  faster growth  than  I  am  currently  projecting.

Inflation  risks are balanced. The  weakness  in  first-quarter  inflation  readings  reflects  the  oil-price shock  and  some  limited  pass-through  to  core  inflation,  which  I  expect  to  be  transitory. Oil  prices  have begun  to  stabilize.

Survey-based measures of inflation expectations have been relatively stable. I take less signal for inflation  expectations  from  the  measures  of  inflation  compensation  based  on  asset  prices  because changes  in  the  latter  may  be  reflecting  liquidity  eff ects  rather  than  changes  in  inflation  expectations. If a broader-based  downward  drift  in  inflation  expectations  were  to  materialize,  it  would  be  a  downward  risk to my  inflation  projection. On  the  other  hand,  too  slow  a withdrawal  of  monetary  policy accommodation  has  the  potential  to  create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium  run.

Respondent 8: Because of the zero lower bound, and the perceived costs associated with asset purchases,  It  is  hard  for  the  FOMC  to  respond  eff ectively  to  low  inflation  and  low  growth  outcomes. This  means  that  these  outcomes  are  more  likely  to  occur.

Respondent 9: Although  I  see  the  distribution  of  shocks  to  aggregate  demand  as  reasonably  balanced,  I  still view  the  balance  of  risks  to  GDP  growth  as  somewhat  weighted  to  the  downside  due  to the  constraints  that  limit  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  off set  negative  shocks  to  demand  at  the  zero lower  bound. I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  balanced,  with  the  risk  of  higher  unemployment  due to the  constraints  imposed  by  the  zero  lower  bound  off set  by  the  risk  that  productivity  may  continue to  grow  more  slowly  than  anticipated,  as  it  has  done  over  the  past  few  years. For  some  time  now  both wage  and  price  inflation  have  been  running  below  the  levels  I  had  anticipated,  and  reductions  in  energy  prices  and  increases  in  the  dollar  are  likely  to  put  further  downward  pressure  on  consumer  prices in coming  months. In addition,  market-based  measures  of  expected  inflation  remain  at  an  unusually low  level,  although  I  attribute  much  of  the  decline  since  last  summer  to  special  factors. While  I  view these developments  as  largely  transitory, they do suggest  that low inflation could  prove  to be more persistent  than  I  expect,  creating  risks  to  inflation  I  consider  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 10: No  comments.

Respondent 11: Risks to economic  activity  appear  balanced. Recent  data  point  to slower GDP growth this quarter and last, but some  of that softness likely is due to temporary  factors such as adverse  weather. Overall,  most  indicators  suggest  steady  improvements  in  economic  conditions  going forward. Most  of the remaining  headwinds  continue  to  abate. Indeed,  with  diminishing  headwinds, upside  scenarios  involving  a  virtuous  cycle  of  economic  activity  become  more  plausible.

The  zero  lower  bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no  longer  appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light  of  the apparent  eff ectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs. Moreover,  normalization  of  monetary  policy  means  that  the zero  lower  bound  will  be  less  relevant  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced. The  recent  low  readings  on  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  raise the  possibility  that  inflation  could  remain  below  target  for  some  time. On  the  other  side,  the  steady diminution  of labor market  slack increases the odds of building wage pressures feeding through  to more  inflation  in  the  near-term.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: The  risks  to the outlook  for PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  weighted to the  downside  as  a  result  of  the  recent  shifts  in  energy  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates.

Respondent 14: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  diff erence  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks  to the  inflation  outlook  are  roughly  balanced,  as  has  been  the  case  in  recent  SEPs: even  though the decline in market-based  inflation compensation  and  declines in a number  of commodity  prices indicate notable  downside  risks, these risks are off set by the possibility of a faster-than-anticipated depletion  of  resource  slack  as  well  as  the  possibility  of  greater  supply-side  constraints. The  risks  to  the real activity  outlook  also  are  roughly  balanced  over  our  forecast  horizon. The  broad  balance  reflects two opposing forces evident in the contrasting tone of recent data-relatively strong labor market data and relatively weak expenditure data. One force is the possibility that the sluggish growth through  much  of  this expansion  has  come  from  more  persistent  structural  factors  rather  than  from various  headwinds  that  are  expected  to  abate  in  our  central  forecast-a  possibility  consistent  with  the weaker  expenditure  data. The  other  force  is  the  possibility  that  the  economy  has  greater  underlying strength than anticipated in our projection-a  possibility consistent with the stronger labor market data. Beyond  those  forces,  other  risks  include  the  impacts  of  the  recent  oil  price  decline  and  continuing dollar appreciation  on  U.S.  activity  and inflation; the low inflation data  and  continued  weakness  in many  parts  of  the  world,  which  could  leave  the  U.S.  and  world  economies  more  susceptible  to  negative

shocks;  and  the  constraints  that  monetary  policy  faces  under  the  eff ective  lower  bound  in  a  number of major  economies.

Respondent 15: We  think  the  risks  to  the  growth  and  unemployment  forecasts  are  roughly  in  balance. On  the  downside,  the  international  growth  outlook  could  deteriorate  or  the  dollar  appreciation could  have  greater  impact  on  net  exports. Moreover,  restrictive  credit  conditions  could  place  greater than  expected  constraints  on  the  recovery  in  residential  investment. On  the  up  side,  improved  household sector fundamentals  (notably,  gains  in  wealth,  the  better  job  market, and  lower  energy  prices) and  business  sentiment  suggest  that  we  could  see  a  more  pronounced  'virtuous  circle'  dynamic.

The  factors  that  could  place  greater  downward  pressure  on  our  inflation  forecast  continue  to  outnumber  those  that  might  push  it  up  more  than  expected. First,  international  developments  including the rise in the value of the dollar could put greater downward  pressure  on import prices than we expect. Moreover,  our  forecast  of  inflation  picking  up  to  just  under  2  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period  depends  heavily  on  an  upward  pull  from  inflation  expectations  supported  by  the  FOMC's credible  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target. For  some  time  we  have  noted  the  risk that  this  upward  force  may  not  be  as  strong  as  we  have  assumed,  a  risk  highlighted  by  the  downward drift  in TIPS  breakevens. Finally,  even  with  a  downward  adjustment  this  time,  it  is  possible  that  the natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  lower  than  we've  assumed,  implying  an  extra  margin  of  slack.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Compared  to  my  December  projection,  I  moved  back  one  quarter  my  anticipated liftoff date. My  background  reasoning  remains  the  same  -  that  inflation  will  not  be  at,  or  moving  any more  than  gradually  toward,  2  percent,  but  that  financial  stability  considerations  -  in  the  context  of steady  growth  and  improvement  in  the  labor  market  -  will  warrant  a  rate  increase. The  move  back from  September  to  December  is  motivated  by  a  combination  of  the  more  tepid  nature  of  recent  data, a stronger  dollar,  and  concern  with  the  disinflationary  forces  at  work  throughout  much  of  the  world. These  factors  together  carry  some  risk  of  further  downward  pressure  on  inflation,  which  remains  well below  the  FOMC's  stated  target,  or  of  a  negative  impact  on  growth.

Respondent 2: In my  forecast, the unemployment  rate  will  be  at or below  my  5.0%  estimate  of the  natural  rate  by  about  the  end  of  2015  and  through  2017. In my  view,  that  is  appropriate  because inflation  remains  well  below  target  and  because  of  uncertainty  about  the  natural  rate.

I reduced  my  estimate  of  the  equilibrium  real  rate  from  1.75%  to  1.5%,  and  therefore  reduced  my estimate  of the long run nominal  federal funds rate from  3.75%  to 3.5%. There  are many  reasons, including  the  longer  term  trend  to  ever  lower  rates,  higher  global  saving,  greater  risk  aversion,  slower growth  and  lower  investment.

Respondent 3: Although  we  have  seen  continued  improvement  in  aggregate  unemployment,  and  the fall  in  oil  prices  has  helped  to  boost  the  U.S.  consumer,  the  aftereff ects  of  the  crisis  continue  to  restrain housing, and domestic  investment  remains  subdued. Going  forward, the significant appreciation  of the  currency  is  likely  to  act  as  a  considerable  restraint  both  on  real  activity  through  net  exports  and on  core  inflation  through  core  import  prices. These  eff ects  are  likely  to  fade  only  slowly. As  a result, monetary  policy  may  need  to  remain  accommodative  for  longer  to  move  employment  and  inflation  in particular  back  to  target  levels.

Respondent 4: My  appropriate  path  for  policy  has  the  Committee  starting  to  raise  the  funds  rate in 2015Q2  as  the  economy  continues  to  strengthen  and  inflation  moves  toward  target. My  path  for the funds  rate  is within  the  range  of  prescriptions  given  by  the  monetary  policy  rules  enumerated  in the Tealbook  and  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  reach  its  long-run level of 3.75  percent  in  early  2018.

Respondent 5: I reduced  my  long-run  federal  funds  rate  to  4.0%  from  4.25%. This  change  reflects a reduction  in  my  estimate  of  long-run  real  GDP  growth  to  2.0%  from  2.3%.

Respondent 6: The  longer-run  neutral  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  been  reduced  from  3.75 percent  to  3.5  percent,  to  reflect  in  part  a  downward  revision  to  the  longer-run  estimate  of  the  growth of potential  GDP.  At  the  time  of  liftoff ,  the  unemployment  rate  is  two-tenths  of  one  percentage  point above  its  longer-run  normal  level,  and  inflation  is  running  well  below  target. After  liftoff , the  removal of policy  accommodation  is  gradual. The  gradual  removal  of  accommodation  allows  monetary  policy to  probe  for  the  possibility  of  lower  equilibrium  levels  of  the  unemployment  rate  and/or  the  equilibrium real rate  of interest.

Respondent 7: I continue  to see underlying  strength  in the economy  and  labor  markets. While some of the data that inform near-term GDP  have  started the year on a soft note, I believe this softness will prove  to be due  to temporary  factors  such  as  the  severe  weather  and  port  disruptions. The  labor  market  has  made  considerable,  sustained  progress  toward  our  goal  of  full  employment,  and I expect  further  gains  to  be  made. The  actual  unemployment  rate  in  February  was  already  at  or  near many  estimates  of  its  longer-run  level  and  underemployment  has  been  steadily  declining. The  recent decline  in  oil prices  will  hold  headline  inflation  down  in  the  near  term. But  as  oil prices  stabilize  and the economy  continues  to  expand,  I  anticipate  that  inflation  will  move  higher. I continue  to  project a gradual  rise  in inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  the  Committee's  2  percent  longer-run  goal  by late 2016  or  early  2017.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should  reflect both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. I project  that the economy  will  be  at  full  employment  this  year  and  that  in  2015Q2  projected  inflation  between  one  and two  years  ahead  will  reach  the  Committee's  goal  of  2  percent. Thus,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  for the  FOMC  to  begin  raising  the  fed  funds  rate  in  2015Q2. Note  that  a  change  in  statement  language at the  March  meeting  would  make  this  liftoff  date  consistent  with  our  forward  guidance.

After  liftoff , I project  the  fed  funds  rate  will  rise  gradually  over  the  rest  of  2015,  similar  to  a  path suggested  by  a  Taylor  1999  rule  with  inertia. As  the  expansion  strengthens,  I  believe  it  will  likely  be appropriate  to  raise  interest  rates  at  a  slightly  more  rapid  pace,  described  by  a  somewhat  less  inertial Taylor  1999  rule.

As  a result  of delaying  liftoff  until  mid-2015  and  the  inertia  in  my  monetary  policy  rule,  I  project that  the  federal  funds  rate  target  will  be  slightly  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  at  the  end  of  2016, despite  the  fact  that  unemployment  and  inflation  are  both  near  their  longer-run  levels.

Consistent  with  recent  Committee  discussions,  I  believe  it  will be appropriate  to  initially target a 25 basis point  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate, with  IOER  at  the  top  of  the  range  and  other  tools -including  ON  RRPs  -  preventing  the  funds  rate  from  trading  below  the  bottom  end  of  the  range. Depending  on  our  experiences  with  these  tools  and  our  ability  to  control  the  federal  funds  rate,  this target  range  may  persist  for  some  time.

Respondent 8: The  data  suggest  that  there  has  been  a  sharp  fall  in  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest since 2007. We  remain below maximum  employment  and  below  target  inflation, even though the market real rate of interest (over any horizon) is much  lower than in 2007. This means  that the neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  consistent  with  target  inflation  and  maximum  employment  -  has  fallen by  even  more.

There  are  many  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  neutral  real  rate  of  nterest  -  but  the  main  point  is that  the  change  is  likely  to unwind  over  time  -  but  only  slowly  and  only  partially. This  judgment  is borne  out  by  the  real  yield  curve,  which  is  upward  sloping  (roughly  20  basis  points  over  the  next  five years,  and  rising  to  somewhat  over  1%  from  2025  to  2035). Note  that  this  real  yield  curve  is  roughly

consistent  with  inflation break-evens  of  around  2%, which  suggests  that  these  market  interest  rates are  reflective  too  of  what's  happening  with  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest.

Put  another  way: I see the  intercept  term  in  the  Taylor  Rule  as  being  a  stochastic  process  with  a lot of persistence. That  intercept  term  is  very  low, and  is likely to return  to its long-run  value  only slowly.

I have  also  taken  on  board  the  staff 's  downward  revision  of  the  underlying  rate  of  inflation,  as  well as the  staff 's view  that  overshooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  natural  rate  will  be  helpful to bring  inflation  back  to  2  percent. Given  the  low  inflation  outlook,  I  believe  it  would  be  appropriate to reinstate  some  kind  of  asset  purchase  program.

I have reduced my estimate of the longer-run normal value of the federal funds rate since the previous  SEP  because  longer-term  nominal  market  interest  rates  have  fallen  even  further  in  the  last six months.

Respondent 9: My  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  both  before  and  after  liftoff  from  the  zero  bound, is shaped  by  my  expectation  that  the  headwinds  that  have  been  holding  back  the  recovery  since  the financial  crisis  will continue  to  exert  a  restraining,  albeit  abating,  influence  on  aggregate  demand  for several  years  to  come. In  addition,  inflation  has  been  running  well  below  our  2%  longer-run  objective, and I expect it to move  only gradually back to 2%. To promote  the attainment  of our maximum employment  and  price  stability  objectives  over  the  medium  term  I  see  it as necessary  to pursue  an accommodative  policy  throughout  the  forecast  period. In part, my  assessment  that  the  appropriate pace  of policy  normalization  should  be  gradual  is  based  on  my  assessment  that  we  initially  will  need to  proceed  cautiously  until  we  are  confident  that  inflation  is  really  moving  back  to  target. In  addition, I would  assess  the  equilibrium  real  funds  rate  at  present  to  be  substantially  below  my  estimate  of  its longer  run  normal  level  of  around  1.5%,  and  to  move  only  some  way  back  toward  this  level  over  the forecast period. I do not expect  it to fully return  to its longer-run  normal  level  even  by  the  end of 2017. This  reflects  factors  such  as  (i) ongoing  balance  sheet  repair  by  households  and  limited  access to mortgage  credit,  which  prevent  households  from  taking  advantage  of  very  low  interest  rates  to  the same  extent they would if their balance sheets had not been impaired; and (ii) weak  real activity abroad  (both  actual  and  feared)  that  has  put  upward  pressure  on  the  dollar  and  is  likely  to  continue to  restrict  U.S.  next  exports  for  some  time. My  estimates  of  the  longer-run  normal  level  of  the  nominal and  real federal funds rate are unchanged  at  3.5%  and  1.5%, respectively, and  are the same  as the staff 's  newly  revised  estimates. In  201  7,  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  falls  two-tenths  below my  estimate  of  its long-run  natural  rate, with  inflation at 1.9 percent  just below  our  target. I view this modest  undershoot  as  helpful in return inflation more  quickly to our 2 percent objective, and therefore  appropriate.

Respondent 10: My  outlook  has  liftoff for the federal funds  rate in September  2015  (to  a  range of 25-50 basis points), followed by 25 basis point increases at every other meeting through 2016. The  trajectory  steepens  to  25  basis  point  increases  at  every  meeting  in  2017,  nearing  its  appropriate long-run  value  by  the  end  of  the  year.

Respondent 11: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  continue  to  decline. I expect  these  gaps  to  close by  the  end  of  this  year  or  early  next  year. In  addition,  my  outlook  for  inflation  through  the  end  of  2016 is below  our  2 percent  objective. This  situation  continues  to  call for very  accommodative  monetary policy. Appropriate  policy  in  this  case  is  to delay  liftoff from  the  zero  lower  bound  until  the  middle of 2015. My  judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is generally informed  by looking at simple rules that adjust  for the zero lower  bound,  as  well  as by my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following  liftoff ,  my  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules would  suggest. In my  projection,  the  reasons  include  the  following:

- · Although  the  unemployment  rate  by  the  middle  of  2015  is  essentially  at  its  long-run  natural  rate, broader  measures  of  slack  (including  the  share  of  long-term  unemployment)  take  a  bit  longer  to return  to  normal,  reflecting  the  dynamics  of  the  labor  market.
- · Some  headwinds  remain  in  2016,  such  as  constraints  on  credit  availability  for  small  businesses and  foreign  economic  activity. These  continue  to  reduce  the  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  relative to its long-run  value.
- · In an environment  in  which  short-term  rates  have  been  near  zero  for  almost  seven  years,  there are potentially some  modest  benefits  to  having  an  earlier liftoff but then a more  gradual  rate path than might normally be called for. These benefits include managing  expectations and minimizing  the  potential  for  disruptions  to  global  financial  markets.

Respondent 12: (i) Recent  growth  data  and  forecasts  have  caused  me  to  reduce  my  estimate  of future  growth.

- (ii) I've become  more  convinced  to  go  early  and  gradual.

Respondent 13: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on promoting sustainable long-run economic growth and price stability. My  forecast calls for the unemployment  rate  to  be  near  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  close  to  2  percent  in  early  2016. Given uncertainty  about  how  the  economy  will  respond  to  the  removal  of  accommodation  after  a  prolonged period  of  near-zero  rates,  I  view  increases  in  the  funds  rate  should  be  gradual  to  see  how  the  economy responds. Adjustments  should  be  data  dependent,  but  the  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  policy results  in  a funds  rate  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2016  and  2017.

Respondent 14: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communciate clearly  to the public  that  these  factors  will  dictate  the  path  of  the  policy  stance. The  changes  along these  dimensions  were  sufficient  to  lead  to  some  changes  in  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for the  FFR.

Based  on  our  modal  outlook  and  assuming  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored, we anticipate that the target range for the FFR  will remain at its current level until September 2015,  one  quarter  later  than  in  the  December  SEP.  This  change  was  a  close  call  as  lifting  off  in  June or September  would  have  only  a  small  impact  on  the appropriate  path  for policy under  our modal outlook. Given  that  inflation  likely  will  be  well  below  the  FOMC's  objective  at  both  dates,  we  believe that  the  later  date  for  liftoff  would  provide  a  greater  benefit  in  securing  greater  confidence  at  the  time of liftoff that inflation over the medium  term  will  be  moving  toward  2%  and  reducing  the  risk  of  a return  to  the  zero  lower  bound. Nevertheless,  it  is  important  to  communicate  to  the  public  that  the decision  about  the  timing  of  liftoff will be dependent  upon  the  data  and  the  FOMC's  assessment  of the  outlook  and  risks  rather  than  a  particular  calendar  date.

However,  a  more  important  factor  in  determining  the  stance  of  policy  as  we  approach  normalization will be the pace  of rate increases  following  liftoff . In general,  this pace  will depend  upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions  and  the  outlook,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and  the  response  of overall  financial  conditions  to  policy  tightening. Currently,  the  low  levels  of  inflation  and  longer-term inflation  compensation,  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  outlook  of  inflation  moving  toward  2%,  and the uncertainty  about  the  level of the equilibrium  real FFR  [discussed  further  below]  all point to a more  gradual  pace  during  the  early  stages  of  normalization  than  we  anticipated  in  the  December  SEP. Therefore, we have moved  down  our  assessment  of  the appropriate  path  such that the target FFR ranges  at  the  end  of  2015  and  the  end  of  2016  will  be 1 2 / -3 4 / %  and  1 3 4 / - 2%  respectively. We  thus  do not  expect  that  the  FFR  will  reach  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  until  2018. We  believe that  this  gradual  path  is  necessary  to  provide  insurance  against  the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced

by the U.S. economy  (including  those  stemming  from  global  economic  and  financial  developments) and  to address  the uncertainty  about  the  equilibrium  real FFR,  which  in  turn  will help ensure  the achievement  of  the  FOMC's  objectives  over  the  longer  run. Moreover,  in  current  circumstances-very low inflation and unemployment  near  our  estimate  of its longer-run normal  level-unemployment  is most  likely to fall below  its longer-run normal  level under  appropriate  policy, thus providing more insurance  against  the  risk  of  being  caught  in  a  low  inflation  trap. In fact, our  modal  forecast  has  the unemployment  rate  falling  below  our  5%  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real short-term  interest rate. We  have  previously  assumed  that  in  normal  times this rate is in the range  of 1%  - 3%;  however,  the  protracted  period  of  low  global  interest  rates  and uncertainty  about  the  equilibrium  real  rate  have  led  us  to  widen  the  range  to 1 2 / -3%. Adding  the objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2.5  - 5.0%. We  continue  to  assess that the equilibrium  rate  is more  likely to be in the lower half of that range because  of  the  behavior  of  nominal  and  real  Treasury  yields  and  productivity  growth  since  the  end  of the recession;  therefore,  we  have  maintained  our  point  estimate  of  3 1 2 / %,  as  seen  in the response  to question  3(a).

We would also note that we assume that reinvestment continues until economic and financial conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the  zero  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of a reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to occur  sometime  in  the  first  half  of  2016.

Respondent 15: We  continue  to  believe  it  is  appropriate  that  the  Committee  strongly  demonstrate its commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation target with highly accommodative  policy. Our preferred  way  of doing  this is for the FOMC  to  be  clear  that  it will delay liftoff until labor market recovery  is  closer  to  completion  (as  measured  by  a  broad  array  of  indicators)  and  we  can  be  confident that the medium-term  outlook  for  inflation is at least at 2 percent. We  assume  that  the first rate increase  will occur  in March  of  2016;  at  that  time, our outlook  has  inflation  one  to  two  years  ahead running  just  a  little below  2  percent. We  expect  by  then  that  the  downward  eff ects  of  energy  prices will have  dissipated  and  core  inflation  will  have  clearly  moved  higher. After  liftoff , we  believe  it will be  appropriate  for  the  path  of  rate  increases  to  be  quite  shallow,  at  least  initially. This  would  give  the Committee  time  to  assess  the  economy's  performance  under  less  accommodative  financial  conditions and  to  observe  whether  inflation  is  continuing  to  move  up  to  target. We  feel  that  a  2016  lift off date and  a shallow  path  for rate increases is appropriate  policy  from  a risk management  perspective,  as we  view  the costs of a retreat back  to the zero lower  bound  as  much  greater  than  those  of  inflation running  modestly  above  2  percent  for  a  couple  of  years  if  demand  is  unexpectedly  strong. This  policy path  results  in  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  2017  still  being  nearly  a  percentage  point  below  our assumption  for  the  long-run  neutral  rate  even  though  our  forecasts  for  unemployment  and  inflation are  near  their  long-run  policy  goals.

Respondent 16: History  teaches that the best way  to prolong  an economic  expansion  is  to ease off the accelerator while the unemployment  rate  is still above its sustainable level. This approach was  successful  in  the  1960s,  the  1980s  and,  again,  in  the  1990s. Unfortunately,  it's  too  late  to  apply the same  approach  in  the  current  expansion. The  earliest  feasible  liftoff date  is now  June,  by  which time  the  economy  will  already  have  reached  my  estimate  of  full  employment. With  slack  eliminated, inflation will rebound  quickly as soon as oil prices and the dollar stabilize, and I expect to see 2 percent  inflation  in  2016. To  limit  the  overshoot  in  unemployment  and  inflation,  it  will  be  necessary to remove  accommodation  more  quickly  than  I  would  have  preferred. I assume  that  the  Committee moves  to  a  neutral  policy  stance  by  the  end  of  next  year,  and  a  bit  beyond  a  neutral  stance  in  2017. It is not  the  case  in  my  projection  that  the  funds  rate  is  below  my  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal level at the  point  where  inflation  reaches  2  percent  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  'close  to  or  below'

my  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level.

Respondent 17: I still believe  that  data  in  April  will  warrant  raising  interest  rates. Trend  growth in  consumer  spending  has  increased,  labor  market  conditions  have  improved  significantly,  and  a  variety of policy  rate  benchmarks  indicate  higher  real  interest  rates. I would  favor  waiting  until  June  to  raise rates,  however,  in  order  to  avoid  undermining  the  credibility  of  our  January  statement  and  our  Chair's characterization  of  the  meaning  of  the  word  'patient.'

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: My  expectation  is  for  a  continued  path  of  moderate  recover  as  labor  markets  continue  to  improve  and  fiscal  headwinds  disappear. Recent  weakness  in  PCE  and  industrial  production numbers  suggest,  as  reflected  in  the  change  in  Tealbook  projections,  some  modest  weakening  of  nearterm  prospects. Difficult as it is to pin down  the  amont  of  slack in labor markets  -  what  with  the somewhat  conflicting  trends  of  strong  job  growth  and  weak  wage  growth  -  it  seems  to  me  on  balance that  some  slack  remains  and,  in  any  case,  that  wages  are  unlikely  to  move  up  more  than  moderately in the  next  several  quarters. Global  developments  are  again  worrisome.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: The  gradual  fading  of  the  aftereff ects  of  the  global  financial  crisis  in  the  U.S.,  developments  abroad,  levels  of  resource  utilization,  and  inflation  expectations  are  the  key  factors  shaping my  central  economic  outlook. In  addition  to  the  aftereff ects  of  the  financial  crisis  on  domestic  activity, the  depressing  eff ect  of  the  elevated  dollar  on  next  exports  and  core  inflation  will  exert  restraint  on  the progression  of  employment  and  inflation  to  target  levels. In this environment,  accommodative  monetary  policy  remains  necessary  to  move  to  maximum  employment  consistent  with  price  stability  and  2 percent  inflation,  assuming  inflation  expectations  remain  well  anchored. The  main  risks  to  this  central economic  outlook  stem  from  developments  abroad,  in  particular  the  tightening  of  financial  conditions and  restraint  on  aggregate  demand  associated  with  a  considerable  and  persistent  strengthening  of  the dollar.

Respondent 4: I expect  the  pace  of  output  growth  over  the  medium  term  to  be  somewhat  above  my longer  term  trend  of  2.4  percent  as  the  headwinds  that  have  been  holding  down  growth  recede  further. With  fairly modest  headline  growth  over  the  next  three years, I anticipate that the unemployment rate will fall to 5 percent  in 2017, which  is slightly below  my  longer  term  trend. With  appropriate monetary  policy  firming,  I  do  not  anticipate  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  move  much  below  the natural  rate  in  2017. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will  be  held  down  some  in  early  2015  by  the recent  fall  in oil prices. By  2017,  headline  and  core  inflation  are  near  target. Inflation  stays  anchored around  my  target  of 2 percent in response  to tighter monetary  policy  than  that anticipated in the Tealbook.

Respondent 5: My  view  is  that  our  lift-off ,  when  it  occurs,  will  be  tardy. This  tardiness  is  shaping my  forecasts  of  the  overshooting  of  inflation  and  the  undershooting  of  unemployment.

Respondent 6: Incoming  data  on  real  economic  activity  has  been  below  expectations. The  rapid dollar  appreciation  has  led  to  a  larger  drag  from  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  than  previously  thought. Adverse  weather  may  also  have  been  playing  a  transitory  role. Labor  market  improvements,  however, have continued at a solid pace. The disconnect between the spending and the labor market data is being partly reconciled in the current outlook by assuming  a somewhat  slower  pace  of potential GDP  growth.  This  revision  is  accompanied  by  a  downward  revision  to  the  short-run  equilibrium  real rate of interest, which  is now  estimated  at 1.5 percent. On  the price side, core PCE  inflation has continued  to  be  running  below  expectations. Given  the  current  level of the unemployment  rate,  we have  taken  signal  from  the  lack  of  inflationary  pressures  by  lowering  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium rate of unemployment  from  5.2  to  5.0  percent. Such  a  revision  is  also consistent  with  changes  in  the age  and  education  distributions  of  the  labor  force.

The broad contours of the outlook have not changed materially. Steady improvements  in the labor market are restoring consumer confidence and should lead to continued gains in consumer spending. This  in  turn  should  raise  businesses'  confidence  about  the  sustainability  of  the  recovery  and generate  more  capital  expenditures. We  expect  that  the  labor  market  improvements  will  ultimately translate  into  a  faster  pace  of  household  formation  and  residential  investment  growth. Still,  residential investment  has  been  disappointing  so  far  and  more  robust  gains  in  housing  remain  a  forecast  at  this point. Overall,  the  projected  pace  of  growth  over  the  course  of  2015-17  is  modestly  above  potential, with activity restrained by the dollar appreciation. As the economy  approaches  full employment, we expect  a more  pronounced  cyclical  rebound  in  labor  force  participation, which  should  bring  the relationship between  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  more  in  line with historical norms. As a result, we project a gradual decline in the unemployment  rate, with the unemployment  rate reaching  the  5  percent  equilibrium  level  by  2017. At  that  time,  core  PCE  inflation  is  still  expected  to run  somewhat  below  target. In a context  of growth  modestly  above  potential  and  little  inflationary pressures, monetary  policy can aff ord to be patient when  removing  accommodation. The gradual removal  of  accommodation  in  our  baseline  outlook  gives  monetary  policy  the  opportunity  to  probe  for lower equilibrium  levels of the unemployment  rate  and/or  the  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest  than we  are  currently  assuming. It also  provides  room  for  a  faster  but  disciplined  pace  of  tightening  should inflationary  pressures  materialize  more  rapidly  than  expected.

The  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  are  becoming  more  balanced,  even  if  it  is  still  the  case  that  policy may  not  provide  an  adequate  off set  in  the  case of an adverse  scenario. The  unemployment  rate  has declined  so  far  more  than  we  had  expected,  and  there  is  a  risk  that  this  pattern  will  persist  over  the forecast  horizon. We  continue  to  view  the  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  as  skewed  to  the  downside,  as we  factor  in  the  possibility  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  5  percent  and  that long-run  inflation  expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  a  level  below  target.

Respondent 7: Fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative monetary policy, improving household balance sheets, strengthening labor markets and lower oil prices that support  consumer  spending,  easing  fiscal headwinds,  and  further  relaxation  of tight credit conditions. I anticipate  that recent softness in some  of the incoming  monthly  data  will prove to be transitory. Foreign central banks are adding accommodation, which should promote stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad. My  business  contacts  are  optimistic, and  a near majority  reported  recently  expanding  staffing  levels. Overall,  I  see  these  forces  contributing  to  abovetrend  growth  and  some  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. By  the  end  of  2017,  I  project  that  the economy  will  essentially  be  at  its  steady  state.

The  year-over-year  headline  PCE  inflation  rate  is  likely  to  remain  low  in  the  near  term  due  to  the impact  of the oil price shock, but I anticipate very low inflation readings  to prove transitory as oil prices stabilize. Core  inflation has edged  down  due  in  part  to  some  pass-through  of  lower  oil  prices and import  prices but I expect it to stabilize and rise over the forecast horizon. In my  judgment, inflation expectations remain anchored. The survey-based measures  of inflation expectations have been  relatively  stable;  I  take  less  signal  from  measures  of  inflation  compensation  based  on  asset  prices as these are likely reflecting changes in risk or liquidity premia rather than inflation expectations. Anchored  inflation  expectations  along  with  an  improving  economy  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving back  to  the  2 percent  longer-run  objective  by  late  2016  or  early  2017. As  inflation  increases  and  the expansion  continues,  I  expect  wage  growth  to  rise  as  well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 8: There  is a risk of a premature  tightening  of  monetary  policy  that  would  degrade our  performance  on  inflation.

Respondent 9: After a bit of near-term  weakness, I expect GDP  growth  to  settle in at roughly 2 1 2 / percent through 2016, before slowing toward its longer-run normal value. In my  projection, the unemployment  rate  continues  to  decline,  reaching  its  longer-run  normal  value  by  late  2016,  and inflation moves slowly back toward the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. Key factors propelling  this  continued  expansion  are: monetary  policy  that  remains  quite  accommodative  for  some time; a further easing of credit constraints and the continued repair of household balance sheets; lower  energy  prices  and  the  resulting  boost  to  real income;  and  even  a  modest  impetus  from  mildly expansionary  fiscal policy. In addition, aggregate  activity should be supported  by  a favorable selfreinforcing dynamic  in which  increased confidence that the economy  is at last returning to normal makes  firms  more  willing  to  hire  and  invest  and  households  more  willing  to  consume  and  buy  houses. I view  the  acceleration  in  monthly  payroll  gains  over  the  past  year  as  a  sign  that  this  favorable  dynamic is probably  already  underway. These  favorable  forces  are, however,  off set to a degree  by the recent appreciation of the dollar and concerns about the foreign economic  outlook, which are restraining net exports  and the broader  economy  through  spillover  eff ects. Largely  as a result, I have lowered my  estimate  of real GDP  growth  in  2015  through  2017  a  bit. I have made  no  material  changes  to my  assessment  of  supply-side  conditions  since  December. With  real GDP  growing  somewhat  faster than its potential rate, I expect  the unemployment  rate  will  fall gradually  over time and modestly undershoot  its  long-run  rate  in  2017. As  slack is taken  up, I anticipate  that  inflation will gradually move  up  to  2  percent  (although  not  quite  by  2017). In making  this  forecast,  I  assume  that  inflation expectations  remain  well-anchored  despite  the  recent  declines  in  market-based  measures  of  inflation compensation,  which  I  think have been temporarily  depressed  in part by declines in oil prices and technical  factors.

Respondent 10: My  outlook consists of above-trend growth over the next few years, a further reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  gradually  converges  to  target.

Growth  over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  stronger  consumption  growth,  supported  by ongoing  improvements  in  the  labor  market  and  a  robust  pace  of disposable  income  growth,  further improvement  in  consumer  sentiment,  and  lower  energy  prices. While  lower  oil prices negatively  impact  energy-related  investment,  conditions  remain  supportive  for  capital  investment  in  other  sectors. Sluggish  global  growth  and  a  strong  dollar  emerge  as  modest  headwinds  in  my  outlook,  slowing  export growth  and  providing  some  restraint  to  domestic  industrial  activity.

The risks to my growth outlook have tilted to the downside. Further dollar appreciation and weaker  foreign GDP  growth  could  restrain  export  growth  and  slow  the  pace of domestic  industrial activity more  than  I assume  in  my  baseline  outlook. I am  also growing  increasingly  concerned  that the  recent  weak  growth  readings  are  not  as  transitory  as  I've  assumed  in  my  baseline.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  have  also  tilted  to  the  downside. Measures  of  underlying  inflation are markedly  softer  than  I  had  expected  in  December. Underlying  inflation  appears  to  be  well  below 1.5 percent. Measures  of inflation compensation,  which  have  rebounded  some,  are  still  below  their longer run averages and some  professional forecasters in the SPF  panel have lowered their longerrun inflation expectations. Amid  slack  labor  market  conditions,  it  is possible  that inflation will fail to return to target over the medium  term. Sharply  lower energy prices and a stronger dollar may pass-through  to  core  inflation measure  to  a much  greater  degree  than  I've  marked  into  my  baseline forecast.

Respondent 11: The economy  is still recovering from the severe housing collapse and financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand  through  a  variety  of  channels,  which  policy  has  only  partially  off set. Many  of  the  associated remaining  headwinds  are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  has  been  and  continues  to  be  a  headwind. However,  with  household  balance  sheets  as well  as consumer  credit  conditions  improving,  I  expect  this  to  abate;

- · Policy  uncertainty  is  back  to  fairly  normal  levels.

The  one  headwind  that  is  not  abating  is  global  economic  weakness. The  relatively  strong  performance  of  the U.S. economy  compared  with  that  of  the  rest  of the world, and  subsequent  monetary easing  in Europe  and  elsewhere,  has  resulted  in  an  appreciation  of  the  dollar. I expect  this  appreciation to be a drag  on net exports  and  GDP  growth. Together  with  continued  geopolitical  tensions, deteriorating  global  growth  remains  a  downside  risk  to  my  forecast.

In this environment, I expect the economic recovery will proceed at a solid pace. And with substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in  play  I  expect  output  and  unemployment  gaps  to  close  over  the next  year. In terms  of  inflation,  continued  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2  percent  inflation target for the next couple  of years. Well-anchored  inflation  expectations  and  diminishing  slack  eventually  pull  inflation back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 12: (i)  The  relatively  low  rate  of  unemployment;  (ii)  the  need  to  look  through  the  temporarily  very  low  rate  of  inflation;  (iii)  the  belief  that  operating  at  the  lower  bound,  while  comfortable, is not  optimal.

Respondent 13: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  of  2-1/2 percent  in 2015  and  2-3/4  percent  in  2016. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from rising  employment  and  wages,  rising  household  wealth,  accommodative  financing  conditions,  and  the ending of fiscal drag. Real GDP  growth  is likely to slow in 2017 as the economy  operates at full capacity. As the remaining economic  slack declines, I expect the unemployment  gap  to be closed in 2016. My  inflation outlook projects a near-term  decline, followed by a gradual rise in inflation coinciding  with  the  removal  of  slack  from  the  economy  and  the  transitory  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation and  falling  energy  prices  dissipating.

Respondent 14: Since  the  December  SEP,  we  have  seen  a  dichotomy  in  the  economic  data  releases: labor  market  indicators  generally  have  been  relatively  robust,  but  the  expenditures  indicators  generally have  been  on  the soft side and  inflation has run further below  the  FOMC's  objectives. Overall, we have responded  to these developments  by making  relatively little change to our real GDP  growth forecast, lowering  the  projected  path  for  unemployment,  and  reducing  the  overall  and  core  inflation forecasts.

We project growth of real GDP  in 2015 and 2016 to be moderately above its potential rate. Supported  by a stronger labor market, low energy prices, and higher net worth, we see real PCE growth  remaining  solid over the forecast horizon, although  at a somewhat  slower  pace  than  in the consensus  of  private  forecasts. The  relative  strength  of  consumption  is  expected  to  support  stronger business investment  growth  than  occurred  in 2014Q4,  despite weaker  investment  in oil exploration and  drilling  stemming  from  lower  oil  prices. However,  these  positive  developments  are  expected  to  be off set by weaker  net  exports,  as  a  stronger  dollar  leads  to  stronger  import  growth  and  slower  export growth. In 2017,  most  of  the  resource  slack  is  expected  to  be  dissipated,  and  thus  we  expect  growth to be  near  its potential  rate.

With above-potential growth and a flat participation rate, we expect the unemployment  rate to continue to fall to 5.1% by 2015Q4  and  then  to 4.8% by 2016Q4, which is modestly  below  our estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  unemployment  rate  (5%). The  small  undershoot  of  unemployment occurs  under  our  assumption  of  appropriate  policy  because  with  inflation  currently  substantially  below the FOMC's  objective and unemployment  relatively close to its longer-run rate, that undershoot contributes to a faster return of inflation to objective, consistent with the balanced approach. In addition,  our  analysis  indicates  that  current  resource  slack  probably  is  larger  than  that  indicated  by the unemployment  gap. With  growth  at  potential and the policy rate below  its longer-run  normal value, we anticipate that the unemployment  rate  will  remain  below  5%  in  2017  before  it  rises back

to 5%  in subsequent  years. Even  though  we  project  a  lower unemployment  rate  path,  there  is  still notable  probability  that  it  could  decline  somewhat  more  than  anticipated  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Based  on  oil  futures  markets,  we  anticipate  that  oil  prices  have  bottomed  out  and  will  gradually rise over  the  forecast  horizon. Thus,  while  the  total  PCE  inflation  is  likely  to  be  -2%  (annual  rate)  in 2015Q1,  we  expect  it  to  rise  over  the  next  two  years  such  that  it  is  1 1 2 / - 1 3 4 / %  in  2016,  due  to  declining slack, accommodative  policy,  and  the  gravitational  pull  of  well-anchored  inflation  expectations. The core  PCE  deflator  is  expected  to  rise  at  about  a  1 1 4 / %  annual  rate  over  2015  and  about  1 1 2 / %  over 2016 as declining prices for nonpetroleum  imports  depress goods prices. In 2017, we expect both overall  and  core  PCE  inflation  to  be  2%,  reflecting  the  dissipation  of  slack,  continued  accommodative policy,  some  rises  in  marginal  costs  of  production,  and  well-anchored  long-term  inflation  expectations that  act  as  a gravitational  force  pulling  inflation  toward  the  FOMC's  long-term  objective.

The near-term risks to the forecast for growth appear to be reasonably well balanced. With an improving  labor  market  and  better  sentiment,  we  could  see  a  stronger  growth  of  both  consumer spending and housing in 2015 and 2016 than we now expect. If so, that would likely provide an additional  boost  to  business  investment  spending. However,  the  U.S.  economy  may  be  more  negatively aff ected by  dollar  appreciation  than  assumed  in  our  central  forecast  and  we  may  be  underestimating the  downside  eff ects  of  reduced  energy  exploration  and  production. The  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast also  appear  to  be  roughly  balanced. The  disinflationary  eff ect  of  dollar  appreciation  may  be  stronger than  we  have  anticipated. However,  it  is possible  the  slack may  be  reduced  more  quickly  and  begin to have  a  stronger  impact  on  inflation  than  we  have  anticipated.

Respondent 15: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  continued  improvement  in  household  and  business balance  sheets and access to credit, the diminution  of fiscal restraint, and lower energy  prices should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period. Pent-up demand  for capital goods and consumer  durables should provide further impetus to growth. The sizable  appreciation  of  the  dollar  will  likely  constrain  growth  in  net  exports.

These  fundamental  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above potential  over  the  next  2  years. As  monetary  policy  normalizes  and  cyclical  dynamics  run  their  course, growth  moderates  back  towards  potential  in  2017. Our  path  for  GDP  closes  resource  gaps  by  the  end of 2016. Resource  slack  thus  is  expected  to  exert  a  diminishing  downward  influence  on  inflation  as  we move  through  the  projection  period;  furthermore,  we  assume  inflation  will  be  pulled  up  by  inflation expectations. In order  to  achieve  our  inflation  target,  we  assume  policy  normalization  does  not  begin until  the  one- to  two-year-ahead  inflation  outlook  is  clearly  headed  back  towards  2  percent,  and  that, at least  initially, the  path  for  rate  increases  will  be  shallow. Given  the  normal  inertia  in  the  inflation process,  we  could  well  see  some  modest  overshooting  of  target  beyond  the  projection  horizon.

See the description  of  uncertainties  and  risks  in  section  2(b)  above. In addition  to  those  factors, there  is  a good  deal  of  uncertainty  over  how  resilient  the  economy  will  be  to  the  removal  of  monetary accommodative  and  over  the  potential  for  inflation  to  rise  more  rapidly  as  growth  gains  momentum. However,  as  noted  in  3(c)  above,  we  see  the  costs  of  premature  rate  increases  substantially  weighing on  activity  and  inflation  and  potentially  pushing  us  back  to  the  zero  lower  bound  as  being  much  higher than  those  of inflation moving  up  more  quickly  than  anticipated. We  have  set  our monetary  policy assumptions  accordingly,  with  a  2016  liftoff  and  shallow  path  for  rate  increases,  to  better  balance  the probability  weighted  costs.

Respondent 16: Highly accommodative  monetary  policy, improved  household  finances, reduced fiscal drag, and tame commodity prices have given us a rapidly improving labor market. Wage growth  has  gradually  increased,  and  is  likely  to  rise at an increasing  rate  with  further  reductions  in the unemployment  rate. Faster wage gains, rapid job growth and continued low consumer  energy prices will boost  real household  income  and  spending,  contributing  to  a  cycle  of  rising  demand  and employment.

Progress toward price stability is best measured  by the recent history and near-term expected trajectory  of a core inflation measure,  such  as  the  Dallas  Fed's  trimmed-mean  PCE  inflation  gauge. Fluctuations  in  headline  inflation  in  response  to  supply-side  shocks  are  inevitable  and,  indeed,  desirable. They  should  not be a concern  as long as nominal  demand  is  projected  to remain  on a track consistent,  over  the  longer  term,  with  our  2  percent  inflation  objective.

Downside  risks  center  on  a  rapidly  cooling  Chinese  property  market,  conflict  and  tensions  in  the Middle  East  and  Ukraine,  and  the  fraying  of  public  confidence  in  Euro-area  institutions  and  policies. Recent  government  and  central-bank  policy  actions  raise  hopes  that  these  hazards  will  be  avoided.

Respondent 17: Population  growth  in  prime  working  ages  will  be  below  0.5  percent  each  year. Real GDP  per  employee  has  risen  by  less  than  1  percent  annually  over  the  last  3  years  and  is  not  likely  to accelerate  dramatically  over  the  forecast  horizon. My  estimate  of  the  medium-term  trend  in  real  GDP is accordingly  1  3/4  percent,  well  below  what  we  have  experienced  in  the  past. My  projection  for  the next  3  years  is  that  consumer  spending  will  be  robust,  leading  to  GDP  growth  that  is  modestly  above trend  and  to  improving  labor  market  conditions.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: As  noted  above,  somewhat  weaker  data  and  some  deterioration  in  global  economic environment.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: In the  near  term,  stronger-than-expected  momentum  in  the  labor  market  and  still subdued  wage  and  price  inflation  raise  the  possibility  that  the  natural  rate  is lower  than  previously thought,  which  led  a  downward  revision  of  the  unemployment  rate. The  appreciation  of  the  dollar  led me  to  revise  down  GDP  growth  and  inflation  over  the  medium  term.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: The  decline  in  oil  prices  and  their  likely  reversal  have  aff ected  my  near-term  inflation forecasts. My forecasts of unemployment  for this year and next year have been aff ected by the continued  improvements  in  labor  market  indicators.

Respondent 6: The GDP  growth  forecast is somewhat  slower  than in the previous projections, mainly  as  a result of a larger dollar appreciation. The  downward  revision  to  potential  GDP  growth is also playing  some  role. Still, the projected  level of the unemployment  rate  by  the  end  of  2017  is only marginally  higher  in the present  forecast. Similarly, revisions to the medium-term  outlook  for inflation  have  been  minor.

Respondent 7: The contours of my forecast are little changed from the previous SEP. I have reduced  my  near-term  inflation  forecast  in  light  of  recent  inflation  readings  that  reflect  the large oil price decline. I expect the eff ects of the oil price decline on inflation to be transitory as oil prices stabilize. I continue  to  anticipate  that  inflation  will  gradually  return  to  our  target,  given  the  underlying strength  in  the  real  economy. The  unemployment  rate  has  moved  down  slightly  more  than  expected, causing  me  to  slightly  lower  the  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  this  year  and  next. My  GDP  growth projection  is  generally  little  changed.

Respondent 8: Inflation  has  run  even  lower  than  I  had  anticipated,  and  I  have  taken  on  board  the staff 's pessimism  regarding  the  influence  of  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar  on  economic  outcomes.

Respondent 9: My  forecasts  for unemployment,  inflation,  and  the  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate have  changed  only  a  little  since  December,  although  I  have  reduced  for  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth on  average  in  response  to  the  weaker  tone  of  incoming  spending  and  production  data  and  the  apparent drag  on  real  activity  from  the  dollar.

Respondent 10: I have  marked  down  my  growth  forecast  in  2015  modestly  in  response  to  softer than  expected  spending  data  for  the  first quarter  and  a further appreciation  of the dollar since the December  FOMC  meeting.  The  dollar  has  appreciated  by  roughly  5  percent  since  December  and  net exports  were  more  of  a  drag  on  fourth  quarter  growth  than  I  was  anticipating. I now  expect  sluggish global conditions and the stronger dollar to act as modest  headwinds, tamping  down  the outlook for export growth  and  industrial activity through  2016. I continue to expect the current low level

of energy  prices to persist throughout  the  forecast horizon which  will provide a boost to consumer spending  over  the  medium  term. Partly  off setting  that  boost  is  weakness  in  energy-related  investment, which,  based  on  oil  drilling  activity,  fell  sharply  in  the  first  quarter. I have  lowered  my  2015  inflation projections  significantly  in  response  to  the  decline  in  energy  prices  and  softer  readings  on  underlying inflation  than  I  had  expected  as  of  the  December  meeting.

Although  the  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  close  to  my  previous  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level, this has not been accompanied  by  clear signals of increasing price or wage  pressures. Therefore, I have  lowered  my  estimate  for  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  to  5.0  percent. This  adjustment  more closely  aligns  my  judgment  of  the  amount  of  labor  market  slack  with  my  estimate  of  the  output  gap.

Respondent 11: Since  December,  I  have  made  only  modest  changes  to  the  broad  contours  of  my forecast. My  forecast  for GDP  growth  in  2015  (Q4/Q4)  is  slightly  lower, partly in response  to the recent  severe  weather  in  much  of  the  country. I have  revised  down  my  GDP  growth  forecast  slightly for 2016 in response to the further appreciation of the dollar since the previous SEP.  Also, I have revised  down  slightly  my  forecast  of  the  unemployment  rate  for  2015  and  2016  in  light  of  the  stronger employment  data.  With  very  accommodative  policy  I  expect  unemployment  to  undershoot  the  NAIRU for a period.

In  addition,  recent  declines  in  commodity,  energy,  and  import  prices  will  put  substantial  downward pressure  on  headline  inflation. Because  of  this,  I now  expect  headline  inflation  to  run  more  substantially  below  our  2  percent  target  over  the  next  two  years  than  in  December. I expect  these  commodity, energy,  and  import  price  movements  to  have  a  much  smaller  eff ect  on  core  inflation  and  to  be  largely off set by a somewhat  greater  degree  of  firming  in  wage  inflation. Thus,  I have  made  little  change  to my  medium-term  outlook  for  core  inflation.

Respondent 12: See  3(i) and  3(ii)  above.

Respondent 13: The  information  received  since  December  has  led  me  to  revise  down  my  forecasts for  real  GDP  growth,  PCE  inflation,  core  PCE  inflation,  and  the  unemployment  rate. Specifically,  the downward  revisions  in  2015  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  reflect  the  transitory  eff ects  of  the recent  shifts  in energy  prices  and  foreign  exchange  rates. In addition,  I  have  reduced  my  estimate  of the  longer-run  level  of  the  unemployment  from  5.5  percent  to  5.2  percent,  which  reduces  the  upward pressure  on  the  inflation  rate  in  2016  and  2017.

Respondent 14: For real GDP  growth,  the  further  appreciation  of  the  dollar  has led to a larger and  more  persistent  negative  contribution  from  net  exports  in  our  projection. Some  of  those  negative eff ects  are  off set  by  the  positive  eff ects  of  lower  oil  prices  and  higher  net  worth  on  personal  consumption expenditures. At the same time, much of the consumption and expenditure data received since December  have  been  soft, leading to a somewhat  lower  projected  path  of  final demand  in  the  near term. Overall, these changes have led to modestly lower real GDP  growth  in 2015, but little net change  in  2016.

The labor market was again stronger than we expected in December, with the unemployment rate declining somewhat  more than we had projected. Consequently, our projected path for the unemployment  rate  is  below  that  of the December  SEP,  with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below our point  estimate  of the longer-run  natural  rate. With  the  change  in  the  unemployment  path,  our projected  path  for  the participation  rate  now  is quite flat, which  is more  consistent  with  the  recent trend  in  the  data.

Both overall and core inflation has been running below our previous projections, leading us to lower our projected paths for both variables. The behavior of alternative measures of underlying inflation also is consistent with a lower inflation path over the next two years. In part, the lower path  for inflation reflects the impacts  of  the  further  decline  in  energy  prices  and  of  the  appreciation

of the dollar. However,  despite  the  further  fall in market-based  inflation  compensation  through  the end  of January,  we  continue  to  assume  that  inflation  expectations  remain  anchored  at  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective. The  objectives  of  avoiding  falling  into  the  low  inflation  trap  and  to  keep  inflation expectations  anchored  were  factors  behind  the  changes  to  our  projected  unemployment  and  FFR  paths under  appropriate  policy.

Respondent 15: As  noted  earlier,  we  revised  down  our  assumptions  for  the  long  run  unemployment and  federal  funds  rates. In  addition,  recent  data  have  caused  us  to  revise  down  our  growth  forecast  for early  2015. Our  forecast  for  2016  growth  is  also  lower  largely  due  to  the  higher  dollar. Our  path  for unemployment  is  down  from  December,  reflecting  a  lower  starting  point  as  well  as  our  lower  natural rate. We  slightly  reduced  our  forecasts  of  core  inflation  in  light  of  recent  data  and  made  larger  changes in our  near  term  total  inflation  outlook  to  reflect  the  drop  in  energy  prices.

Respondent 16: I have  revised my  real growth  projections  downward,  slightly,  reflecting  a more realistic view  of likely growth  in  the  working-age  population  and  my  belief  that  most  of  the  declines we've  seen  in  labor-force  participation  are  unlikely  to  be  reversed. My  unemployment  projections  are unchanged. The stronger dollar and lower price of oil have had a larger impact on both headline and conventional  core inflation than I had anticipated last December,  and  I  have  revised my  nearterm  inflation  projections  accordingly. I have  made  only  small  adjustments  to  my  assessment  of  the appropriate  funds-rate  path.

Respondent 17: N/A

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: No  major  diff erences  -  only  a  few  tenths  of  a  percentage  point  one  way  or  the  other.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: I expect  greater  continued  movement  in  the  dollar  and  greater  eff ects  of  exchange rate  movements  on  both  net  exports  and  core  inflation  due  to  lower  core  import  prices.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  calls  for  stronger  growth,  somewhat  higher  inflation,  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast  horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: My  forecast  is  for  more  rapid  GDP  growth  during  2015  than  in  the  Tealbook  (3.1% vs. 2.2%)  and  a  lower  unemployment  rate  (4.8%  vs. 5.2%). Related  to  unemployment,  I  also  see  the unemployment  rate  declining  further  below  its  long-run  value  before  reversing  course  and  reaching  its long-run  value. This  long-run  value  of  5.8%  exceeds  the  Tealbook  forecast  of  5.2%. With  respect  to inflation, my  forecast  for both  headline  and  core  measures  includes  an  overshooting  before  reaching 2.0%;  in  contrast,  the  Tealbook  has  both  inflation  measures  moving  to  2.0%  without  any  overshooting.

Respondent 6: The  two  forecasts  are  conditioned  on  broadly  similar  policy  assumptions,  and  have similar  outcomes  both  in  terms  of  economic  activity  and  inflation.

Respondent 7: My  forecast is somewhat  stronger than the March  Tealbook  forecast. Like the Tealbook  I  expect  that  GDP  growth  will  proceed  at  an  above-trend  pace  in  2015  and  2016  and  the unemployment  rate  will  continue  to decline. (I note that my  trend growth  rate is higher than the Tealbook's.) My  forecast  calls for somewhat  more  inflationary  pressure  than  the  Tealbook  forecast: I expect  that  inflation  will  return  to our 2 percent  longer-term  objective  by  late  2016  or  early  2017. Compared  with  Tealbook,  this  firmer  path  for  inflation  calls  for  a  steeper  path  for  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: I believe  that  the  natural  rate  of unemployment  is  a  bit  lower  than  the  staff  estimates,  but  this  is  a  minor  diff erence.

Respondent 10: My  growth  forecast  now  runs  roughly 1 2 / percentage  point  above  the Tealbook throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  mostly  due  to  our  diff ering  perspectives  on  potential  GDP  growth. My unemployment  rate  projection  is  identical  to  Tealbook's  path  throughout  the  medium  term. However, I lowered  my  estimate  for the long-run unemployment  rate  to  5.0  percent  as I have yet to see any material wage  or price pressure despite an (U-3) unemployment  rate  that  has  already  fallen to 5.5 percent. My  headline  and  core  inflation  forecasts  run  about 1 4 / percentage  point  above  the  Tealbook over  the  forecast  horizon,  as  it  is  still  my  view  that  inflation  expectations  remain  at  a  target-consistent level of 2 percent.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection. One  notable  diff erence is that  the  Tealbook  has  a  much  more  protracted  return  of  inflation  to  the  FOMC's  stated  2  percent objective. Also,  the  Tealbook  has  somewhat  slower  GDP  growth  in  2015  than  I  do,  though  I  broadly share  the  Tealbook's  view  on  GDP  growth  after  2015.

Respondent 12: There  are  no  important  diff erences.

Respondent 13: The  appropriate  path  for the federal funds rate in 2015, 2016, and 2017 in my forecast is slightly above the Tealbook  forecast. Nevertheless, I expect somewhat  faster real GDP growth, somewhat  lower unemployment,  and  somewhat  higher  inflation than Tealbook during the forecast horizon. In addition, since I have not fully taken on board the productivity slowdown  in Tealbook,  my  estimate  of  longer-run  real  GDP  growth  is  higher  than  Tealbook's  estimate.

Respondent 14: Since December,  the  Tealbook  forecast for real GDP  growth  has  been  reduced more than our forecast, such that real growth in the Tealbook forecast is now below that in our forecast, particularly  in 2016. For that year, the major  reason  for  the  diff erence appears  to  be  that the Tealbook  projects  a  larger  eff ect of dollar appreciation  on  net  exports  than  we  have,  suggesting that  the  Tealbook  has  more  persistent  eff ects  than  in  our  models.

Otherwise  on  the  real  side,  the  diff erences  are  principally  more  in  the  details. Among  such  details, one  long-standing  diff erence  regards  business  fixed  investment. The  Tealbook  projects  slower  growth in business fixed investment in 2015-16 than in our forecast; the reason for this diff erence is not immediately  clear,  but  it  may  in  part  reflect  the  Tealbook  assessment  that  the  capital  stock  is  fairly close to levels consistent  with  its downwardly-revised  assessment  of  potential  growth. This  factor  is off set by faster consumption  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  another  long-standing  diff erence  with our  forecast,  which  in  part  reflects  stronger  wealth  eff ects  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Because  we  both  now  project  a  small  undershoot  of  the  unemployment  rate,  our  forecast  relative  to our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  natural  rate  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook's  forecast  relative  to  its  estimate of the  longer-run  rate. Therefore,  the  diff erence  between  the  paths  of  the  unemployment  rate  reflects the  Tealbook's  higher  estimate  of  the  longer-run  rate  (5 1 4 / %)  than  in  our  forecast  (5%).

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  are  similar  in  2015-16. A  diff erence  arises  in  2017,  where  we  expect inflation  to  be  at  the  FOMC's  objective  while  the  Tealbook  projects  that  inflation  will  not  reach  that level until 2019. This diff erence reflects diff ering views about  inflation dynamics. In the Tealbook, with  the  underlying  inflation  rate  below  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective  and  considerable  persistence in the  inflation  process,  a  prolonged  period  of  low  unemployment  (and  a  positive  output  gap)  appears to be necessary  to  induce  inflation  to  rise toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. The  faster  return  of inflation to its goal in our forecast reflects our assumptions  of less inflation persistence and of the stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation  expections.

Unlike the Tealbook, we do not yet assess that the longer-run potential GDP  growth  rate has declined, although we are assessing this assumption  more  frequently  than previously has been our custom.

The change in the Tealbook's assumptions  about  the equilibrium real FFR  and  the longer-run level of the  nominal  FFR  means  that  the  Tealbook's  assumptions  now  match  ours.

In terms of the uncertainty and risk assessment, we see some  diff erences between  the two projections. On  the  real side, we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual  nature  of the  current  expansion,  the  atypical  policy  environment  in  the  U.S.  and  many  foreign  economies,  and the yet-unclear  net  eff ects of lower  oil prices and  of dollar appreciation  leave  uncertainty  about  real activity above  the SEP  standard  associated  with  the  20-year  window  of  forecast  errors. In another contrast,  we  see  the  risks  around  the  real  activity  projections  as  roughly  balanced  rather  than  tilted  to the  downside  as  in  the  Tealbook. The  stronger  growth  in  2014H2  and  the  indications  that  private  final domestic  demand  still  has  been  well maintained  into  2015  (despite  some  of the weaker  expenditure data)  signal  a  significant  risk  that  stronger  expansion  dynamics  have  been  established. Furthermore, the  possibility  of  a  positive  supply  shock  associated  with  lower  energy  prices  also  off sets  the  negative risks cited by the Tealbook. As for inflation, although  our  uncertainty  assessment  is  similar to the Tealbook, we still see the risks as roughly balanced: although the decline in longer-term inflation

compensation  and  low  inflation  in  other  areas of the world  pose  downside  risks  to the forecast, the possibility  that  slack  could  be  dissipated  more  quickly  than  anticipated  off sets  those  risks.

Respondent 15: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  early  in  2016,  three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of  increase  after  liftoff  is similar. Accordingly,  at  the  end of the  projection  period  our  assumed  level  of  the  funds  rate  only  reaches  2.63  percent.

Our projection for growth in 2015-2017 averages about 1 2 / percentage point stronger than the Tealbook. Much  of the diff erence reflects our somewhat  faster assumption  for the growth rate in potential output  over that period. Both  our  forecast of actual unemployment  and  our  estimates  of its natural  rate  are  somewhat  lower  than  the  Tealbook. Our  projection  for  inflation  is  similar  to  the Tealbook.

Respondent 16: I believe  longer-term  inflation  expectations  are  currently  well  anchored  at  a  rate consistent with the Committee's  inflation objective, I'm convinced that in the near term inflation responds  to changes  in slack as well as the level of slack, and  I prefer to use the trimmed-mean  as my  measure  of  core  inflation,  rather  than  strip  out  food  and  energy  price  increases. For all of these reasons,  I  see  inflation  rising  farther  and  faster  than  does  the  Tealbook.

At  the  same  time,  I  believe  that  increases  in  the  unemployment  rate  are  difficult  to  contain  once they  begin. An  implication  is  that  the  risks  to  misestimating  slack  are  asymmetric: It is substantially more  dangerous  to  overestimate  slack  than  to  underestimate  it.

Because I anticipate a higher inflation path than does the Tealbook, and because I see both substantially  less  benefit  from  overshooting  full  employment  and  substantially  greater  risk,  I  believe it is appropriate  for  monetary  policy  to  move  more  rapidly  to  a  neutral  policy  stance.

Respondent 17: Inflation  is likely to move  back  toward  2  percent  with  more  alacrity  than  in  the Tealbook,  and  containment  of  inflationary  pressures  over  time  will  require  somewhat  more  rapid  policy tightening.
