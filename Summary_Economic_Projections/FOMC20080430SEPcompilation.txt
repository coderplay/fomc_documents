1. Projections of real GDP growth, PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are fourth-quarter-to-fourthquarter growth rates, i.e. percentage changes from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the indicated year. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures and the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, respectively. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

Forecast Narratives

2(a). (Optional) If you have any explanatory comments regarding your judgment of the uncertainty attached to your projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past 20 years, you may enter them below.

Respondent 1:

Higher  uncertainty  around  GDP  growth  reflects  the  uncertainty  about  the  evolution  of  financial  markets  and their  effects  on  spending. Higher  uncertainty  around  prices  reflects  a  sense  we  do  not  understand  the  reasons for the persistent  surprises on energy  and  other  commo dity  prices  and  about  the  resulting  feedthrough  to core prices. In addition, elevated uncertainty about the output gap translates into elevated uncertainty about  inflation.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  standard  deviation  of  FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  GDP  growth  and core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  those  reported  in  Reifschneider  and  Tulip.

Respondent 4:

Uncertainty  rises  near  cyclical  turning  points. This  time  is  similar.

Respondent 5:

There  is  greater  uncertainty  associated  with  my  pro jections  of  GDP  growth  in  comparison  with  the  experience of the  past  20  years  because  of  the  severity  of  problems  in  financial  institutions  and  markets  and  questions about  the  effectiveness  of fiscal policy stimulus. There  is also greater  than  'normal'  uncertainty  attached to my  pro jections  of  PCE  inflation  because  of  the  volatility  of  energy  and  other  commo dity  prices.

Forecast Narratives

2(b). (Optional) If you have any explanatory comments regarding your judgment of the risk weighting around your projections, you may enter them below.

Respondent 1:

Although  financial conditions have stabilized, a further sudden  deterioration still seems more  likely than a sudden unexpected  improvement, and hence the downside  risks to growth and employment. For total inflation,  commodity  prices  seem  more  likely  to  rise  unexpectedly  than  to  fall,  based  on  recent  history. For core,  this  upside  risk  is  off set by  the  downside  risk  to  growth.

Respondent 2:

On  GDP  growth,  I  do  see  more  downside  risk  than  upside  risk,  but  by  much  less  than  my  January  pro jection. Thus  if the scale was  more  nuanced,  I  would  have  checked  off  something  in  between  broadly  balanced  and weighted  to  downside. Similarly  on  the  unemployment  rate,  I  would  have  checked  off  something  in  between weighted  to  upside  and  broadly  balance.

Respondent 3:

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  pro jection  and  expected  value  from  FRBNY  forecast distribution.

Respondent 4:

I have revised down  my  growth  forecast  since January. Risks to growth  are balanced  relative to my  new forecast. Given  the  monetary  policy  accommodation  in  the  pipeline  and  the  year-to-date  data  on  inflation and  inflation  expectations,  inflation  risks  remain  to  the  upside.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

It is still highly  uncertain  whether  the  economy  has  fully  shifted  into  a  recessionary  regime,  but  the  potential for it do  so is an  important  risk.

We  could be wrong  about the degree of persistence in the recent good news on core inflation. And  the current  low  level  of  gasoline  margins  suggests  a  risk  of  larger  increases  in  consumer  energy  prices.

Respondent 7:

I believe  the  downside  risks  to  the  economy  are  nearly  balanced  with  the  upside  risks  to  inflation.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

Risks  to  total  inflation  are  broadly  balanced  but  perhaps  a  bit  to  the  upside,  due  to  possibility  that  increases in energy  and  food  prices  may  continue.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  interest  rates  differ  materially from  the  interest  rate  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Greenbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

Assumed  a  25  bp  decrease  at  this  meeting  followed  by  a  period  of  stability  and  a  gentle  rise  in  09  and  10  as financial  conditions  improve  and  the  output  gap  closes.

Respondent 2: Yes

I condition  on  25  basis  point  cut  at  the  April  FOMC  meeting  and  possibly  another  25bp  by  the  June  FOMC meeting,  then  back  up  to  3.0  by  early  2009.

Respondent 3: Yes

FFR  target  at  2.0%  by  the end of 2008Q2  at  the  latest. Then  renormalized  with  the  target  rate  at 3.5% by end  of 2009  and  4.25%  in  2010. In the short-run  the  risks  are  to the downside  around  this  path  with  a similar  magnitude  to  the  model  based  probabilities  shown  in  the  Bluebook  box  on  the  likelihood  of  reaching low  rates,  in  the  medium  term  they  are  more  balanced.

Respondent 4: Yes

My  policy  path  is considerably  steeper  than  the  Greenbook  baseline  policy  path  assumption. My  forecast calls for the  funds  rate  to  begin  rising  in  2008Q4,  reaching  4.0  percent  some  time  in  2009Q3,  and  remaining there  in  2010. In  my  view,  in  order  to  keep  inflation  from  rising,  the  FOMC  needs  to  be  aggressive  in  taking back  the  insurance  it  has  put  in  place.

Respondent 5: Yes

I do not  expect  the  Federal  funds  rate  to  decline  quite  as  much  in  2008  as  in  the  Greenbook,  and  I  expect it to rise somewhat  more  in  2010  than  the  Greenbook  pro jection.

Respondent 6: Yes

We've  assumed  a  roughly  flat  funds  rate  path  for  the  rest  of the year, followed  by  a rising path  similar  to market  expectations  beginning  in  early  2009.

Respondent 7: No

N/A

Respondent 8: Yes

The  appropriate  near-term  funds-rate  path  lies  somewhat  above  the  Greenbook  assumption.

Respondent 9: Yes

Assume  rates  are  lowered  to  2%  at  upcoming  meeting,  and  then  increase  slowly  starting  4Q  2008

Respondent 10: No

N/A

Respondent 11: Yes

Appropriate  policy  would  be  designed  to  bring  about  1.5  percent  overall  PCE  inflation  within  a  couple  of years. That  is  likely  to  require  raising  the  funds  rate  later  this  year  or  early  next  year.

Respondent 12: Yes

I assume  some  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  during  2009.

Respondent 13: Yes

I assume  the federal funds rate remains  at 2.25 percent through  the end of this year. I then assume  the funds  rate  begins  to  increase  significantly  in  2009  and  returns  to  neutral  by  the  first  half  of  2010.

Respondent 14: Yes

I assume  that  the  funds  rate  falls  to  1-3/4  percent  by  the  end  of  the  current  quarter  (as  in  Greenbook)  and remains  there until the second half of 2009. It gradually rises to 2-1/2 percent in 2009.Q4  and  to 4-1/4 percent  in  2010.Q4.

Respondent 15: Yes

The  appropriate  path  for the Federal Funds  rate involves more  easing  in the near term  (roughly  50 basis points  of  additional  easing)  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  Greenbook. Monetary  policy  then  remains  on  hold until late 2009. At that point, the Federal Funds  rate starts to increase gradually, reaching 2 1 2 percent by the end  of 2010. The  assumed  accommodative  stance  for  the  Federal  Funds  rate  provides  the  stimulus necessary  to  bring  the unemployment  rate  down  to  our  estimate  of  the  NAIRU  by  the  end  of  the  forecast horizon. At  the  same  time,  the  policy  stance  is  consistent  with  achieving  a  target  inflation  rate as  measured by  core  PCE  inflation of 2.0 percent.

Respondent 16: No

N/A

Respondent 17: Yes

My  judgement  is that the FOMC  will  need  to raise interest rates materially, and sooner, than the path currently  pro jected  in  the  Greenbook  in  order  to  achieve  a  goal  of  1.5  percent  on  core  PCE  inflation  in  2010.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook

Respondent 1:

The  drag from housing abates slowly over the second half of the year and next year. Credit availability remains  very  tight  for  a  few  quarters  and  improves  gradually  thereafter  allowing  the  effects  of  the  low  federal funds  rate  gradually  to  show  through  to  slightly  above-trend  growth. GDP  growth  is  also  helped  over  time by  the  assumed  leveling  out  of  energy  prices  and  by  a  continued  boost  from  net  exports. Lower  house  prices and  reduced  credit  availability  weigh  on  consumer  spending  and  the  savings  rate  rises  gradually. In  the  near term,  recessionary  tendencies-evidenced  in  part  by  very  depressed  consumer  and  business  confidence-  hold down  spending,  but  not  by  as  much  as  in  the  Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 2:

I am  getting  somewhat  more  optimistic  that  we  may  have  turned  a  corner  in  the  credit  markets  and  that  they will  keep  on  improving. (However,  I  have  been  disappointed  before  and  I  would  not  count  on  this  outcome..) As a result of the better tone in the credit markets, I see less downside  risk and a lower probability of a serious  adverse  feedback  loop  developing. Nonetheless,  the  widening  of  credit  spreads  and  the  tightening  in the  Senior  Loan  Officer  Survey  will  make  growth  extremely  weak  in  2008  and  will  slow  the  recovery. This  is why  I  am  slightly  more  pessimistic  on  output  growth  and  unemployment  than  the  greenbook.

With the current and pro jected slack in the economy and long-run inflation expectations around 2.0% (they  may  be  slightly  higher  today,  but  I  think  they  will  come  down  with  the  coming  economic  slack),  I  see inflation  coming  down  to  2.0%  and  remaining  there  for  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon. I do  worry  that  high commodity  prices  could  cause  inflation  expectations  to  rise  a  little  bit,  but  the  current  slack  and  downside risks  to  economic  activity  would  tend  to  lower  inflation. Thus  I  see  the  risks  around  my  inflation  forecast  as being  symmetric.

Respondent 3:

Our  central  pro jection  has  the  US  economy  going  through  a  mild  recession  in  2008H1. By  the  second  half  of 2008  growth  recovers,  aided  by  the  preemptive  path  of  monetary  policy,  various  initiatives  to  foster  market functioning and fiscal stimulus. Growth  remains  near  its potential rate through  2009-10  implying  we  see only a narrowing  rather  than  a  complete  closing  of  the  output  gap  in  this period. Although  we  judge  the economy  will  experience  a  mild  recession  or  just  skirt  one  as  the  most  likely  near-term  outcome,  the  chance of a mild  recession  turning  into  a  more  severe  downturn  is  relatively  high.

Within the central scenario the bulk of the correction in housing production will be completed by mid2009  and  residential  investments  large  drag  on  GDP  will  be  over. The  decline  in  housing  prices  will  continue through the end of 2009 with about an 11%  peak to trough drop using the OFHEO  repeat  sales  index. Outside  of housing  and  autos we judge the inventories of US  business to be relatively lean. Further, the balance  sheets  of  non-financial  firms  appear  to  be  relatively  robust  for  the  onset  of  a  recession. These  factors produce  a very shallow recession with a somewhat  tepid  recovery. Net exports provide a boost to GDP growth  in 2008 and 2009. In the labor market  we expect demographic  changes, industry mix and, most importantly,  the  lack  of  a  very  tight  labor  market  at  the  business  cycle  peak  to  produce  a  labor  market  peak to trough  increase  in  the  unemployment  rate  of  less  than  1.5  percentage  points.

We  pro ject a continued  very gradual moderation  in  core inflation with total inflation running  well above core in 2008H1  due  to  higher food and  energy  prices but then moving  in  line with the core projection  as the forecast horizon  increases. This path  is based  on inflation expectations  remaining  well-contained,  our assessment  of the FOMC  inflation  objective, and the opening  of an output gap in 2008 along with little evidence  of  the  pass-through  of  higher  energy  and  food  costs  to  labor  compensation.

The risks to our central projection are substantial. The main short-term one is that the ongoing turmoil in financial markets  further  restricts  the supply  of credit exacerbating  contractionary  forces  which  in turn  leads  to  a further  tightening  of  credit  conditions  and  so  on. While  the  preemptive  easing  of  monetary policy and  the new  liquidity facilities provide  some  insurance  against  such  an  adverse  feedback  loop, it is difficult  to  know  whether  they  will  be  sufficient  given  the  uncertainty  around  house  prices  and  the  exposure of the  financial  sector  to  house  price  declines. Over  the  medium  term  a  ma jor  risk  is  that  trend  productivity growth  will  be  below  our  conditioning  assumption. A  related  risk  is  a  steeper-than-assumed  rise  of  the  personal  saving  rate  resulting  from  negative  housing  and  stock  market  wealth  effects,  if  consumers  assess  future prospects  to  be  weaker  either  because  of  weaker  productivity  growth  or  because  of  a  protracted  contraction. The  effects  of  these  medium  term  risks  might  also  be  amplified  by  the  fragile  state  of  financial  markets.

For inflation, we see the risks as roughly balanced. There are risks on the downside if the recession is deeper  and  longer  than  in  our  central  scenario. However,  potential  pass-through  of  higher  costs  stemming from higher energy and commo dity  prices, the decline in the exchange  value of the dollar and a possible lower trajectory for productivity raises some  upside concern. Further, the behavior of some  measures  of inflation  expectations  over  the  last  few  months  suggests  that  private  agents  might  have  less  confidence  in  the FOMCs  commitment  to  price  stability  than  in  earlier  periods  in  the  2000s  expansion  when  total  inflation was  running  above  core.

The  combination  of  this  risk  profile,  the  heightened  uncertainty  present  in  recessions  and  the  ongoing  volatility in financial and  commodity  markets  produces  elevated  uncertainty  around  our  central  pro jection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 4:

The  incoming  data  since  January  -  in  particular, readings  on business  fixed investment,  consumer  spending, and  employment  -  have  been  somewhat  weaker  than  expected  in  my  January  pro jection. In addition, financial  disruptions  have  been  wider  spread  and  more  persistent  than  incorporated  in  my  January  forecast. Thus,  I  have  revised  down  my  forecast  for  growth  and  employment  in  2008H1. I assume  trend  growth  of  2.7 percent,  but  there  remains  considerable  uncertainty  around  that  number. I expect  the  economy  to  pickup in 2008H2  and  back  to  trend  in  2009, as the effects of the monetary  accommo dation  already  put  in  place are felt, the housing  correction stabilizes, and financial market  conditions  stabilize. I assume  a relatively small  impact  of  the  tax  rebates  on  consumer  spending  this  year. In  this  forecast,  I  assume  a  long-run  neutral funds rate of about 4.0 percent. Given the monetary  policy easing already in place, there may  be more upward  pressure  on  core  inflation  in  2009  and  2010  than  in  my  baseline  forecast,  and  this  would  necessitate a perio d of an above-neutral  funds  rate  to  restrain  expectations  and  bring  inflationary  pressures  back  to  a rate  consistent  with  my  long-run  goal.

Respondent 5:

Given  the  magnitude  of  problems  in  financial  institutions  and  markets,  my  outlook  for  '08  and  '09  is  influenced  significantly  by  the  'headwinds'  episode  of  the  early  1990s  as  well  as  the  evident  recent  deterioration in the  economy  and  the  time  required  to  work  off  excess  inventories  in  the  housing  sector. However,  I  expect that  these  problems  will  have  diminished  appreciably  by  2010  and  that  the  economy  will  expand  at  a  pace modestly  above  trend  in  that  year. With  appropriate  monetary  policy,  I  expect  core  inflation  to  decline  to an  acceptable  rate  by  2010.

Respondent 6:

We  asssume  that  financial headwinds  dissipate  over  the forecast period, but remain  significant enough  to hold  growth  below  potential  through  the  first  half  of  2009. The  speed  at  which  the  improvement  takes  place is highly  uncertain,  and  presents  two-sided  risks  to  the  growth  forecast.

Our  base forecast has housing markets  bottoming  out late this year or early next year. There is a risk,

however,  that  continued  declines  in  housing  prices  and  reduced  credit  availability  could  weigh  more  heavily on  construction.

The build up of a modest level of resource slack should help to offset the effects on inflation of higher energy  and  commodity  prices  and  the  weaker  dollar. The  effect  of  world-wide  demand  on  commo dity  prices adds  considerable  uncertainty  to  the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 7:

Deterioration  in consumer  sentiment,  higher  energy  costs, and  a tightening  of credit terms  leads to a significant  slowdown  in  consumer  spending  that  is  only  partially  offset  in  QII  and  QIII  by  the  fiscal  stimulus. The  inventory  of  unsold  homes  and  financial  market  uncertainty  continue  to  weigh  on  the  residential  housing market, dampening  residential  construction  throughout  2008  and  into  2009. Growth  abroad  continues  to contribute  to improving  net  exports. However,  deterioration  of  business  sentiment, accompanied  by  more restrictive  financial  conditions,  dampen  nonresidential  investment.

The risks to my outlook include a substantial further deterioration in financial conditions, a weakening in growth  abroad,  higher  commodity  and  energy  prices,  and  a  potential  upward  drift  in  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 8:

- -Credit-market  headwinds  will  persist,  delaying  the  economy's  return  to  normal  growth.
- -Globalization will provide support for the economy through net exports, and will help restrain wage inflation,  but  also  contributes  to  upward  pressure  on  commodity  prices.
- -Oil  and  food  prices  continue  to  trend  upward,  as  demand-pull  forces  dominate.

Respondent 9:

Significant  uncertainty  for  2008  with  respect  to  impact  of  financial  institutions  weakness  on  broader  economy (credit  channel)

Respondent 10:

1)  Housing  continues  weak,  with  residential  construction  declines  moderating  over  the  year  but  still  subtracting from  growth  till early in 2009  2) Consumption  is  restrained  by  high  oil prices, housing  price declines, weakening  labor  market,  tighter  credit  conditions, and  poor  sentiment. Together  with  housing, this leads to negative growth  in the first half. However, fiscal stimulus package provides some  boost in the second half of 2008  3) With  house  prices  declining,  financial  conditions  remain  stressed  for  the  rest  of  the  year  as writedowns  continue  and  bank  capital becomes  harder  to raise. Tight credit conditions weaken  not only consumer  spending  and  housing  demand  but  also  nonresidential  construction  4)  Net  exports  provide  a  boost in both  2008  and  2009  5)  A  technical  recession  probably  began  around  the  beginning  of  2008

- 6)  Continued  problems  with  credit  quality,  spreading  outside  of  housing,  keep  credit  tight  into  2009. Growth improves  but  remains  below  potential  growth  rate. Recovery  is  largely  'jobless'. 7) By  2010,  above-trend growth  returns,  but  labor  market  recovers  more  slowly. 8)  Major  uncertainties  and  risks  include  the  evolution of the housing  market,  especially  house  prices, and  the closely linked development  of  financial  conditions. Risks  are  primarily  to  the  downside.
- 8) Stabilizing energy prices, not-to o-rapid food price increases, and a softer economy  and labor market

(slower  growth  in  unit  labor  costs)  reduce  overall  and  core  inflation  beginning  later  this  year. Uncertainty about  food  and  energy  prices  is  the  principal  source  of  risk  -  balanced  or  slightly  to  the  upside.

Respondent 11:

The  economy  has  entered  a  recession,  but  it  is  likely  to  be  shallow  and  brief  by  post-war  standards. Housing will continue  to  be  a  drag  on  growth  this  year,  and  business  fixed  investment  will  decline  this  year  as  well. Inflation  is  too  high,  and  the  public's  inflation  expectations  are  inconsistent  with  successful  monetary  policy.

Respondent 12:

The  key  risks remain  the  housing  market  and  financial  turmoil,  and  a  negative  feedback  between  the  two, that  could  result  in  a  substanial  slowing  of  consumption  and  more  balance  sheet  pressure  for  financial  institutions.

Respondent 13:

- (1) I expect  weak  growth  in  the  first  half  of  this  year,  with  some  pickup  in  the  second  half.

Near-term  weakness  is  mostly  due  to  continuing  declines  in  residential  investment  and  high  energy  prices. Tight  financial  conditions  linger  and  restrain  growth  somewhat  through  early  2009. Strong  export  growthdriven  by  a  decline  in  the  dollar  and  strong  foreign  growth-provides  near-term  support.

- (2) Beginning  in the second half of 2008 and continuing through  2010, I expect an economic  recovery  to be  driven  by  an  accommodative  monetary  policy,  the  tax  rebates  to  households,  a  less  rapid  pace  of  decline in housing,  and  some  decline  in  energy  prices.
- (3) I expect inflation to moderate gradually over the forecast horizon due primarily to a leveling off of food  and  energy  prices  . Since I assume  the  effect of slack on inflation is modest  at  best, I do not expect near-term  economic  weakness  to  contribute  to  a rapid decline in inflation. In addition, since longer-term inflation  is  driven  importantly  by  long-term  inflation  expectations,  I  am  concerned  that  the  recent  increases we  have  seen  in  inflation  expectations  will  limit  the  declines  in  actual  inflation  that  I  am  expecting.
- (4) Despite  below  trend  growth,  an  accommodative  monetary  policy,  higher  energy  and  commo dity  prices, and  greater  dollar  depreciation  pose  upside  risks  to  the  expected  moderation  in  core  and  overall  inflation.

Respondent 14:

Financial  conditions  remain  fairly  tight  with  elevated  risk  spreads  and  some  dislocations  in  credit  markets. Housing  activity has shown  few signs of stabilizing, labor market  conditions continue to deteriorate, and consumer  and  business  spending  have  slowed. The  economy  may  be  contracting,  and  there  are  substantial downside risks. Readings on headline inflation have been disappointing; however, inflation expectations remain  fairly  well  anchored. Going  forward,  weaker  growth  in  the  U.S.  economy  should  generate  more  slack in product  and  labor  markets,  thereby  putting  some  downward  pressure  on  inflation,  and  commodity  prices should  level  out.

I assume  that  monetary  policy  remains  accommodative  over  the  next  year. Coupled  with  the  fiscal  stimulus and  growing  exports,  growth  resumes  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  rises  above  trend  in  2009  and  2010. The  unemployment  rate  rises  gradually  through  early  2009  and  then  begins  to  drop  toward  the  NAIRU  of 4-3/4  percent. Core  PCE  inflation  declines  gradually  to  1-3/4  percent  in  2010, which  I view  as consistent with price stability. The  funds  rate falls to 1-3/4 percent  and  remains  there for over a year before rising gradually  to  its  equilibrium  rate  of  4 1 4 percent  by  the  end  of  2010.

Respondent 15:

Growth  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  has  slowed  significantly,  to  an  average  pace  of  half  of  one  percent. The

ongoing  retrenchment  in  residential  investment  is  now  coupled  with  weakness  in  consumer  and  business  expenditures. High  oil  prices,  declining  household  net  worth,  and  a  weakening  labor  market  weigh  heavily  on the  consumer. Businesses  have  responded  to  the  softness  in  demand  and  to  the  uncertainties  characterizing the current  economic  environment  by  trimming  hiring  and  capital  spending. The  only  demand  component now  showing  strength  is  exports,  thanks  to  a  weak  dollar  and  a  world  economy  that  is  still  robust. The  pace of activity  is  expected  to  accelerate  in  the  second  half  of  this  year. The  fiscal  and  monetary  policy  stimulus will provide  an  impetus  to  consumers  discretionary  spending,  while  the  drag  from  residential  investment  is expected  to  wane. Still,  the  economy  is  projected  to  grow  at  a  pace  slightly  below  potential,  as  monetary  and fiscal policy  impart  only  a  partial  offset  to  the  unfavorable  shocks  buffeting  the  economy. In 2009,  the  economy  continues  to  grow  near  potential,  notwithstanding  the  large  monetary  stimulus  underway. Households expenditures  remain  constrained  by  declining  net  worth  associated  with  falling  house  prices,  while  residential investment  is  still weak  as  builders  continue  to  bring  inventories  into  better  alignment  with  sales. The economy  is  then  expected  to  grow  significantly  above  potential  in  2010, when  households  net  worth  starts to stabilize and  the  underlying  monetary  stimulus  to  all  interest-sensitive  comp onents  of  demand  becomes more  apparent.

The  unemployment  rate  peaks  at 5.3 percent over the second half of this year, and starts to decline decisively only in 2010. Near-term  readings  of  inflation  are expected  to  stay somewhat  elevated,  as  some  of the increase  in energy  prices  is passed  through  into  core  inflation. However,  with  increasing  slack  in  labor markets,  inflation  is  expected  to  moderate,  and  settle  at  2  percent  by  2009.

Risks to economic activity continue to be skewed to the downside, and incoming data continue to feed concerns  that  the  economy  may  have  fallen  into  a  recession. While  there  have  been  improvements  in  financial markets,  conditions  have  yet  to  return  to  normal. Tighter  credit  markets,  coupled  with  the  continually deteriorating  housing  market,  have  the  potential  to  exert  more  restraint  on  spending  than  is  currently  embedded  in our baseline  forecast. In addition,  the  continued  fragility  in  financial markets  leaves  credit  markets vulnerable to event risks. A more pronounced  decline in house prices than we are currently envisioning could  severely  impair  financial  markets  functioning. The  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  are  broadly  balanced. Emerging  slack  in  the  labor  market  should  wield  downward  pressure  on  wages  and  prices. We  continue  to view  the  pass-through  from  oil  and  the  dollar  as  fairly  limited.

Respondent 16:

Disruptions  in  credit  markets  and  continued  weakness  in  real  estate  markets  lead  to  zero  growth  in  the  first half of the year. The  drag  on  economic  activity  from  lingering  problems  in  housing  and  financial  markets gradually dissipates through  the first half of 2009, and this contributes to modest  growth  starting  in the second  half  of  this  year.

The  possibility that financial market  turmoil  could  flare up again, the possibility that nonresidential  construction  could  deteriorate  more  rapidly  than  I expect, and  the uncertain  effect of rising energy  prices on consumer  and  business  spending  convince  me  that the risks to real GDP  growth  remain  weighted  to  the downside.

Continuing energy and commo dity  price developments, and the effect they might be having on inflation expectations  suggest  that  the  risks  on  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 17:

The  threat  that  the  U.S.  economy  might  enter  a  debilitating,  depression-like  state  because  of  financial  market turmoil  has  receded. There  is  still  some  residual  probability  associated  with  this  event,  but  it  is  substantially lower  than  it  was  earlier  this  year. This  retreating  probability  is  shaping  private  sector  expectations  for  2008 and  2009,  leading  to  a  more  robust  economy  and  a  more  worrisome  inflation  outlook  than  envisioned  in  the current  Greenbook.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  judgements  and  assumptions  affecting  your economic  projections  in  the  third  year.

Respondent 1:

growth  in  y*=2.5;  inflation  of  1-3/4  percent  is  acceptable.

Respondent 2:

Long-run inflation objective at 2% on PCE  deflator, NAIRU  at  4 3/4%  and potential GDP  same  as in greenbook.

Respondent 3:

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  between  2-2.5%  for  the  CPI  and  the  FOMC's  inflation objective  to  be  1.5-2.0%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  2-2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Potential  growth  is  2.6%  (in  2010  the retirement  of  baby  boomers  begins  to  have  a  perceptible  impact  on  labor  input),  and  that  the  output  gap opens  in  2008  and  narrows  in  2009-10. Our  extended  forecast  also  includes  some  implicit  judgments  about the likely ranges  for the NAIRU  and  the  neutral  policy  rate. Those  judgments  put  the  neutral  policy  rate in the  region  of  3.75%  to  4.75%  absent  the  current  disruptions  in  financial  markets  and  the  NAIRU  between 4.5%  to  5%.

Respondent 4:

Real  output  is  growing  at  about  a  trend  pace  of  2.7  percent  in  2010,  the  unemployment  rate  is  about  at  its natural  rate  of  5  to  5.25  percent,  and  inflation  is  running  slightly  above  my  long-term  goal  of  1.5  percent. As mentioned  in  4(a),  monetary  policy  easing  may  lead  to  upward  pressure  on  core  inflation  and  raises  the  risk that  inflation expectations  begin  to  move  upward. If this happens,  monetary  policy  would  have  to  tighten more  in  2009  than  in  my  baseline  forecast  and  possibly  remain  above  a  neutral  rate  in  2010  to  keep  inflation from  rising.

Respondent 5:

The  financial headwinds  will  have  diminished  significantly  by  2010  and  the  adjustment  in  housing  will  be largely  complete,  permitting  the  underlying  resilience  and  flexibility  of  the  economy  to  show  through. Monetary  policy  will  have  precluded  any  material  deterioration  in  inflation  expectations  or  appreciable  acceleration in core  inflation.

Respondent 6:

We  expect  growth  to  run  somewhat  above  the  rate  of  potenial,  which  we  place  at  2.6%  per  year. Our  forecast has  unemployment  falling  over  the  year,  but  remaining  above  its  natural  rate,  which  we  place  at  5.0%.

Respondent 7:

I have defined appropriate  policy  over  this horizon  as one that is consistent with achieving  PCE  inflation slightly  less  than  2  percent  and  I  have  adopted  assumptions  for  labor  productivity  and  employment  growth that  are  consistent  with  potential  GDP  growth  of  2.6  percent.

Respondent 8:

The  unemployment  rate  remains  elevated,  due  to  the  stretched-out  credit  cycle.

Respondent 9:

On  path  of returning  to trend  levels, but not at steady-state  at end  of projection  period. Tax  policy  and trade  policy  uncertainty  expected  to  impact  2010  economic  perfomance  negatively.

Respondent 10:

The  inflation  projections  in  2010  reflect  my  views  of  the  levels  of  inflation  that  combine  a  reasonable  approx-

imation  to  price  stability  (allowing  for  measurement  error)  with  some  buffer  against  zero-bound  problems.

The growth estimate for 2010 is above my estimate of potential growth, which is in the vicinity of 2.7, as it reflects a cyclical recovery. Likewise, the unemployment  rate  for 2010 is above my  estimate of the NAIRU  (around  4.8)  because  employment  will  lag  the  recovery.

Respondent 11:

Trend  growth  in  GDP  is  about  2.7  percent,  and  overall  inflation  would  average  1.5  percent  under  appropriate policy. Ongoing  increases  in  energy  prices  will  result  in  a  divergence  between  overall  and  core  inflation.

Respondent 12:

My  judgments  and  assumptions  are  largely  consistent  with  those  described  in  the  Greenbook,  except  that  I assume  the  federal  funds  rate  is  higher  in  2009  and  2010.

Respondent 13:

- (1) Economic  growth  returns  to  potential  in 2010. Demographic  changes  contribute  to  a  fall in potential growth  in  2009  and  2010. Potential  growth  is  estimated  to  fall  from  2.7  percent  currently,  to  2.6  percent  in 2009  and  2.5  percent  in  2010.
- (2) Core  PCE  inflation  remains  slightly  above  desired  levels  in  2010.
- (3) Monetary  policy begins to tighten aggressively in 2009 and reaches neutral by the first half of 2010.

Respondent 14:

In 2010, my  forecast  shows  inflation  that is consistent  with  price stability. By  the end  of 2010, real GDP growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  the  real  funds  rate  are  all  near  their  long-run  sustainable  levels.

Respondent 15:

Potential  GDP  growth  is  2 1 percent. The  NAIRU  is  4 3 percent. The  target  inflation  rate  is  2.0  percent. 2 4

Respondent 16:

In  making  these  pro jections,  my  staff  and  I  have  taken  on  board  the  housing  assumptions  in  the  Greenbook, and  assumed  the  slight  backing  off  of  oil prices implied  by  futures  markets. We  have,  however,  assumed  a less dramatic  decline  in  employment  than  in  the  Greenbook  and  a  smaller  fiscal  stimulus  impact.

Respondent 17:

The  2010  numbers  place  output  growth  at  the  steady  state  rate  and  core  inflation  at  target. Overall  PCE inflation  remains  elevated  because  of  longer-term  relative  price  changes  in  the  energy  sector.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook

Respondent 1:

see last sentence  of  4(a)

Respondent 2:

Not  a  big  difference. I see  a somewhat  slower  recovery  because  I  think  the  effects  of  the  financial  disruption will take  a  long  time  to  dissipate  and  will  be  a  drag  on  growth.

Respondent 3:

We  pro ject  higher  trend  growth  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline  in  the labor force participation  rate  will occur  later and  more  slowly  than  in  the GB.  We  assume  lower  inflation persistence  than  does  the  GB.

In terms  of short-term  forecast  details, consumption  growth  is  stronger  in  our  central  projection  than  the GB  in 2008H2  partly as we see less weakness in services. This stronger consumption  profile produces a smaller  positive contribution  from  net  exports  to  growth. In our central projection  the higher policy rate assumption  leads  to  a  slower  rate  of  depreciation  in  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar.

Respondent 4:

I assume  the  labor  force  grows  0.8  to  1  percent  per  year. Nonfarm  payroll  employment  growth  declines  by about  30  thousand  jobs  per  month  on  average  in  2008,  and  rebounds  to  around  120  thousand  jobs  per  month on  average  in  2009  and  2010. In 2009  and  2010,  the  economy  is  growing  at  about  trend.

Respondent 5:

I am  less optimistic  about  2009  than  the  Greenbook,  largely  because  of  the  anticipated  effects  of  financial headwinds. As  a consequence,  I  have  a  somewhat  higher  rate  of  unemployment  in  2009  and  2010.

Respondent 6:

As  noted  above,  we  have  not  assumed  that  the  economy  has  necessarily  shifted  into  a  recessionary  regime.

Respondent 7:

I forecast  a  less  severe  downturn  for  GDP  in  2008,  a  more  modest  recovery  in  2009,  and  a  less  robust  growth rate  in 2010.

Respondent 8:

The  economy  is  slower  to  resume  normal  growth  than  is  forecast  in  the  Greenbook,  and  headline  inflation moderates  more  gradually.

Respondent 9:

Expect  materially  weaker  growth  in  2009

Respondent 10:

Slightly  more  optimistic  on  potential  growth,  due  to  higher  projection  for  MFP.

Respondent 11:

The  path  of  monetary  policy  after  mid-year  is  the  main  difference. I believe  inflation  is unlikely  to  subside at an  appropriate  pace  without  rate  increases  later  this  year  or  early  next. A  firmer  policy  path  results  in  a more  subdued  recovery.

Respondent 12:

Broadly  similar.

Respondent 13:

My  near-term  outlook  for  real  GDP  and  unemployment  is  less  pessimistic  than  Greenbook  and  my  outlook for inflation  is less optimistic. These  differences  lead  to  very  different  policy  paths,  with  Greenbook's  path for the  federal  funds  rate  substantially  below  my  assumed  path.

Respondent 14:

My  forecast  shows  slightly  faster  growth  than  the  Greenbook  in  2008  and  2009,  in  part  because  of  an  assessment  of  more  impetus  from  the  fiscal  package  and  slightly  faster  growth  of  potential  output. The  forecast unemployment  paths  in  those  two  years  are  similar,  but  I  foresee  the  real  economy  converging  to  long-run values  by  the  end  of  2010,  rather  than  in  2012  as  in  Greebook. I am  also  slightly  more  optimistic  on  inflation.

Respondent 15:

Our  forecast  for  the  real  economy  is  more  optimistic  than  the  Greenbooks  in  2008. While  the  Greenbook  is envisioning  a  recession,  our  outlook  calls  for  a  growth  recession.  Differences  in  the  inflation  outlook  are  the result  of  our  lower  implied  sacrifice  ratio  once  the  economy  moves  considerably  away  from  full  employment, and  of  a higher  inflation  target  than  the  one  implicit  in  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 16:

Because  we  pro ject  somewhat  less  near  term  weakness  in  labor  markets,  our  near-term  GDP  forecast  is  not as pessimistic  as  in  the  Greenbook. Our  longer  term  forecast  does  not  incorporate  a  significant  bounce  back in growth,  and  so  GDP  growth  only  gradually  returns  to  trend. We  also  see  somewhat  more  inertia  in  the inflation  rate  going  forward.

Respondent 17:

Relative  to  the current  Greenbook,  this  forecast  envisions  a  stronger  real  economy  and  a  more  challenging inflation  scenario. The  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  could  not  remain  essentially  flat  for  2.5  years  in  this forecast  if the  2010  outcomes  are  to  be  achieved.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the projections submitted ahead of the January FOMC meeting.

Respondent 1:

the  credit  restriction  is  more  severe  and  the  housing  decline-both  activity  and  prices-is  steeper. For  inflation, the  resulting  larger  output  gap  is  offset  by  higher  energy  and  food  prices  than  anticipated  in  January.

Respondent 2:

Although  I  am  a  little  more  upbeat  than  at  the  March  FOMC,  credit  market  conditions  deteriorated  more and  the  economy  has  turned  out  to  be  substantially  weaker  since  the  January  pro jections. This  caused  me to lower  my  growth  pro jections  and  to  raised  my  unemployment  pro jections.

Respondent 3:

At  the  time  of  the  January  pro jections  we  expected  the  US  economy  to  skirt  a  recession  with  little  growth  in the  first half of the  year  but  a  strong  rebound  in  the  second  half,  which  is  a  similar  pattern  to  the  developments  in  late  2006  though  mid  2007. The  further  deterioration  in  labor  markets,  the  lack  of  any  stabilization in housing  and  the  large  increase  in  energy  prices  along  with  the  continued  financial  turmoil  and  declines  in confidence  have  increased  our  assessment  of  the  probability  that  the  US  economy  will  experience  a  recession in the  first half of 2008. Further,  we  have  lowered  the  strength  of  the  recovery  in  2008H2  and  2009  relative to  January  as  we  expect  that  tighter  financial  conditions  and  higher  energy  and  commo dity  prices  will  weigh on US  consumers  and  producers. At  the  same  time  the  downside  risks  to  this  weaker  central  forecast  have increased  with  additional  evidence  of  a  potential  adverse  feedback  loop  between  financial  conditions  and  the real economy.

Incoming  data  since January  have led to little net change  in our core inflation forecast in the near term but  higher  energy  prices  have  driven  up  the  near  term  forecast  for  total  inflation. We  have  slightly  increased our  medium  term  inflation  pro jection  to  reflect  the  higher  levels  of  energy,  food  and  commodity  prices  and the  decline  in  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar. A  range  of  models  of  inflation  suggest  that  the  higher  total inflation  of the  last few  months  is  unlikely  to  persist  partly  due  to  well-contained  inflation  expectations,  as well  as subdued  labor  compensation  and  the  pro jected  slowdown  in  the  US  economy.

The policy path underlying our central pro jection has been reduced in the near-term since January but we  have  not  altered  the  assumed  path  for  renormalization  of  real  interest  rates  in  2009-10. Given  our  projection  of  a weaker  recovery  this  implies  a  tighter  stance  of  policy  in  2009-10  in  the  medium  run  relative  to standard  policy  rules  than  our  January  path.

Respondent 4:

The  incoming  data  since  January  -  in  particular, readings  on business  fixed investment,  consumer  spending, and  employment  -  have  been  somewhat  weaker  than  expected  in  my  January  pro jection. In addition, financial  disruptions  have  been  more  wider  spread  and  more  persistent  than  incorporated  into  my  January forecast. Thus,  I have  revised  down  my  forecast  for  growth  and  employment  in  2008H1. Monetary  policy easing  has  been  more  aggressive  than  I  assumed  in  my  January  forecast. I assume  the  FOMC  begins  raising the funds  rate in 2008Q4  as  I  did in my  January  forecast,  but  from  a  lower  level. Monetary  policy  easing risks unanchoring  inflation  expectation  so  the  funds  rate  needs  to  increase  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  4.0 percent  by  2009Q3.

Respondent 5:

There  are  only  two  material  changes,  both  of  which  are  reflected  in  the  2008  forecast. The  weakness  evident in the  economy  currently  has  led  to  a  reduction  in  real  growth  for  the  year  and  greater  unemployment  than expected  previously. And  PCE  inflation  is  expected  to  run  higher  than  earlier  anticipated  because  of  devel-

opments  in  energy  and  other  commo dity  prices.

Respondent 6:

In line with  the  deterioration  of  the  economy  since  January,  our  outlook  has  worsened  somewhat.

Financial  headwinds  still  constrain  the  outlo ok,  but  market  functioning  appears  to  have  improved  to  some degree.

The  core  inflation  outlook  has  improved  somewhat  given  the  recent  inflation  data  and  the  somewhat  greater projected  slack  in  the  economy.

Respondent 7:

A higher  path  for energy  prices  combined  with  a  greater  and  more  prolonged  deterioration  in  the  housing market  have  resulted  in  a  downward  adjustment  to  my  real  growth  pro jection  in  2008. A  modest  boost  to economic  activity stemming  from  fiscal stimulus is now  assumed  in 2008. Higher commodity  prices, and particularly  energy  costs,  are  now  expected  to  exert  greater  upward  pressure  on  the  PCE  inflation  measure in 2009. However,  pass-through  effects  to  the  core  measures  are  expected  to  be  contained  by  a  slower  growth tra jectory.

Respondent 8:

Energy  prices  have  been  higher  than  anticipated,  and  the  drag  from  residential  investment  has  been  somewhat  greater  than  anticipated.

Respondent 9:

Deeper  weakness  pro jected  for  credit  channel

Respondent 10:

Data  indicate  that  we  may  have  switched  regimes  to  a  recession  scenario,  with  a  stronger  cumulative  downward  dynamic.  Consumption,  employment  data  have  weakened,  although  exports  have  helped  IP  and  spending  on  equipment  and  software  somewhat. Financial  crisis  continues  and  will  be  an  important  drag,  though not  necessarily  worse  than  expected  in  January.

Respondent 11:

The  data  on  employment,  nonresidential  construction  and  household  consumption  have  been  weaker  than expected,  so  I  now  believe  that  a  recession  has  begun. Energy  and  food  prices  have  increased  more  rapidly than  anticipated,  and  the  rise  in  inflation  expectations  between  January  and  early  March  was  unexpected.

Respondent 12:

Since  the  last  pro jection,  we  had  reports  relating  to  consumption,  the  labor  market,  and  the  housing  market that  were  softer  than  anticipated  so  I  marked  down  GDP  growth  and  marked  up  the  unemployment  rate  in 2008.

Respondent 13:

Further  weakness  in  housing  and  nonresidential  construction,  and  significant  increases  in  energy  prices,  led to a reduction  in my  near-term  outlook  for  growth. Higher  food  and  energy  prices led to greater upward pressure  on  overall  and  core  inflation  than  I  previously  thought. In addition,  based  on  discussions  with  my business  contacts,  inflation  psychology  has  worsened.

Respondent 14:

Despite  easier  monetary  policy  and  greater  fiscal  stimulus  than  expected  at  the  time  of  the  January  FOMC meeting,  I  have  lowered  my  forecast  for  2008  real  GDP  growth  by 3 percentage  point. This  reflects  tighter 4 credit  conditions,  weaker  housing  and  consumption  data,  and  higher  commodity  prices  (notably,  a  jump  in

crude  oil prices  of about  $25  per  barrel). Higher  prices  for  food  and  energy  are  also  largely  responsible  for the  upward  revision  in  my  2008  PCE  inflation  forecast  of of a percentage  point. However,  the  pass  through of these  higher  prices  remains  fairly  modest,  and  my  core  inflation  forecast  has  risen  only  slightly.

Respondent 15:

The  economy  is  currently  weaker  than  we  were  previously  projecting. Deteriorating  labor  market  conditions and  widespread  weakness  in  demand  have  increased  the  risk  of  a  recession. In  2009  and  2010,  headline  GDP projections  are  not  too  different,  but  they  are  conditioned  on  a  much  more  accommo dative  path  of  monetary policy. The  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 16:

In general,  we  have  kept  the  broad  tra jectory  of  our  January  pro jections,  though  commencing  from  a  lower level for growth  and  a  higher  level  for  inflation. These  adjustments  were  made  as  a  result  of  incoming  data suggesting  more  real-side  weakness  and  spillover  from  the  financial  markets  than  we  anticipated  in  January along  with  dissappointing  readings  on  inflation.
