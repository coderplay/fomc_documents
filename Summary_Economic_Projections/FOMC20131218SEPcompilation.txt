Table  1. Economic  projections  of  Federal  Reserve  Board  members  and  Federal  Reserve  Bank  presidents, December  2013

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in, respectively, the price index  for personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each participant's assessment  of the rate to which each variable would  be expected  to converge under appropriate monetary  policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The  September  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  September  17-18,  2013.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of  each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate  monetary  policy,  the  first  increase  in  the  target  federal  funds  rate  from  its  current  range  of  0  to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified  calendar year. In September  2013, the numbers  of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase  in the target federal funds  rate  would  occur  in  2014,  2015,  and  2016  were,  respectively,  3,  12,  and  2. In the lower panel, each  shaded  circle  indicates  the value (rounded  to  the  nearest 1 4 / percentage  point)  of  an  individual participant's judgment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  target federal funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar year or over  the  longer  run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: I anticipate a quicker  convergence  - real GDP  will  converge to its long  run value in 2017, the unemployment rate in  2016, and PCE inflation in  2016. As part of this process, I  anticipate that inflation will temporarily  overshoot  the  FOMC's  2  percent  target  and  that  unemployment  will temporarily  reach  levels  below  my  judgment  of  its  natural  rate.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 4: Our assessment of the  economy's potential growth rate  remains  within the 2% to 2 1 2 / %  range, with a point estimate of about  2 1 4 / %  (rounded  to 2.3%  above). Our  interpretation of the recent literature and some  additional  in-house  analysis indicates that a reasonable  range  for an estimate  of  the longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4 1 2 / %  to 6%,  with  a point  estimate  of  about  5 1 4 / % (rounded  to 5.3%  above). Assuming  appropriate  policy  and  no further significant shocks, we expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  level  sometime  in  2016  and  the  output  gap  to be  fairly  small  around  that  same  time. However,  our  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  suggests  there is a significant  probability  that  the  unemployment  rate  could  fall  modestly  below  5 1 4 / %  for  a  period within  the  5-6  year  timeframe.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about 2.5% for the CPI based on longer-term average of the difference between CPI and PCE inflation). Under  these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to shrink over the coming years,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2016.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  2016.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: The  convergence  process  may  be  somewhat  shorter  than  5-6  years

Respondent 7: As  shown  above,  I  expect  inflation  in  2016  to  be  2  percent  and  unemployment  to be at its long-run average of 5.8 percent at the end of  2016. Thus I  expect the  convergence process to be  complete  in  3  years.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9:

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Convergence to the long-run levels of the unemployment  rate and inflation is expected  to  take  roughly  five  years.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Based  on  my  forecast  we  appear  to  be  about  four  years  away  from  convergence on  both  inflation  and  unemployment.

Respondent 16: Shorter  than  five  years  under  appropriate  monetary  policy.

The  fall  in labor  force  participation  has  led  me  to  a  slightly  lower  estimate  of  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 4: Quantitative  judgment  based  on the width of the probability intervals from the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. The  widths  of these intervals have narrowed  some  from  those  at the time  of  the  September  SEP,  and  the  interval  for  core  PCE  is  now  close  to  that  20-year  average. Some of that  narrowing  reflects  the  apparent  resolution  of  some  of  the  political  contention  surrounding  the fiscal outlook. The probability  interval  for real GDP growth remains  wide in part because of the stillextraordinary  economic  and  financial  environment, including the policy rate remaining  constrained by  its effective  lower  bound.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: It remains  the  case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 7: Real GDP is likely to grow  more slowly than it has in previous cyclical  expansions, more in line  with growth in the last few years. I do not believe that fluctuations in growth around this lower  trend  are  likely to be larger than  in the past. Inflation  expectations  are  probably  more  firmly anchored  following the FOMC's January 2012  consensus statement, and  uncertainty is  correspondingly lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 8: Uncertainty about  my projection for  economic  activity is similar to its average level over the past 20 years. Of  course, that period  was characterized by  considerable turmoil, including the Great  Recession,  the  European  (and  earlier,  Asian)  financial  crises,  the  Iraq  war,  9/11,  the  dot.com boom  and  bust,  and  so  on.

Inflation is anchored by quite  stable inflation expectations. The  stability of these expectations has been reinforced by the release in 2012 of an explicit 2 percent objective for inflation. Hence, uncertainty  about  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades.

Respondent 9: At  this point, uncertainty  looks  to  be  broadly  similar  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20 years.

Respondent 10: As  with  the Tealbook, because  the  experience  of  the past 5 years  is now such  a large part of the  comparison period, we think the uncertainty  over the GDP growth and  unemployment rate forecasts  are  broadly  similar  to  the  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years. If not  for those years,  we'd  say  the  level  of  uncertainty  was  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: Uncertainty  about growth  is  the result  of uncertainty  that appears higher  than normal about potential  output, speed of recovery  following  a financial  crisis, US fiscal policy,  and the effects of unconventional  monetary policies. These  factors influence uncertainty about  unemployment, which is further  exacerbated by  variability in productivity growth  and in the Okun's Law relationship.

Uncertainty about inflation is lowered by well-anchored inflation expectations and low recent volatility in commodity  prices. On  the other side, surprisingly low inflation recently suggests that we  don't  understand  inflation  dynamics  near  zero  or  when  slack  is  high  all  that  well. On  net,  uncertainty  is normal  to  low-normal.

Respondent 4: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation outlook  are roughly  balanced,  as  has been  the case in the previous  five SEPs. The downside  risks to the real activity outlook have declined since September  such that the risks are balanced over near-term horizons, as indicated in the summary  of our judgment; however, at the longer  horizons  of  the SEP,  the  risks are still modestly  skewed  to  the  downside. This  decline  in downside risks reflects primarily three  factors. First, the probability of a political stalemate  concerning the federal budget  and debt  ceiling has declined noticeably. Second,  geopolitical  risks seem  to have moderated. Third,  the  global  financial  market  movements  suggest  somewhat  less  stress  on  financial and  economic  conditions  globally;  recent  global  economic indicators have been roughly  consistent  with lesser stresses. Partly counterbalancing  these  developments  is  the  low  inflation data in many  parts of the world, including the U.S., which suggest some  possibility of continued sluggish growth  that would  leave  the  U.S. and  world  economy  more  susceptible  to  negative  shocks. The  constraints  that monetary  policy  faces under  the zero lower bound  implies  that the effects of such shocks could be more  significant  than  they  would  be  in  more  normal  circumstances.

Respondent 5: Although  I  now  see  the  distribution  of  shocks  to  aggregate  demand  as  reasonably balanced,  the  balance  of  risks  to  GDP  growth  is  weighted  to  the  downside  due  to  the  constraints  that limit the ability of monetary  policy to offset negative shocks to demand  at the zero lower bound. For  the  same  reason,  I  see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  weighted  to  the  upside. Inflation  is running below  the  level I had  anticipated  due  partly  to  factors I expect  to be largely transitory. That  said, low inflation may  prove  more  persistent,  creating  risks  to inflation I consider  to be weighted  to  the downside.

Respondent 6: I view  the  risks  to  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside  over  the  medium  and  longer run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's  withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Risks to  economic  activity appear balanced.  The downside risks from fiscal brinkmanship have diminished  considerably  compared  with  September, when  the government  shutdown  and debt  ceiling were  imminent. In addition,  the  economy  has  so  far  weathered  the  run-up  in  mortgage and  other interest rates since the spring. Finally, as headwinds  continue  to  abate, upside  scenarios involving  a virtuous cycle of  economic  activity  become  more plausible.

The  zero lower bound does somewhat  constrain our ability  to respond  to adverse shocks. However, this constraint has become  less of  an issue over  time, in  light of the effectiveness of  forward guidance

(especially  with  the  threshold  language)  and  LSAPs. As  a  result,  I do  not  view  the  zero  lower  bound as a quantitatively  significant  source  of  downside  skew  at  this  point.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

Respondent 9: I believe the risks to my projections are broadly balanced. The real economy faces a number  of downside risks, including ongoing fiscal challenges, cautious business spending, tepid  wage  gains  for  households,  and  the  possibility  that  financial  markets  and  housing  markets  may respond  adversely  to  the  normalization  of  longer-term  interest  rates. But  the  economy  has  also  shown resilience in the face of considerable  fiscal drag in 2013. As fiscal drag eases, the housing  recovery progresses,  and  the  labor  market  gains  momentum,  upside  surprises  are  certainly plausible. The  risks to my  inflation outlook also appear to be broadly balanced. A  continuation of the recent low readings would  keep  inflation  at  lower  levels  than  I  anticipate,  but  I  already  expect  that  it  will  take  some  time for inflation to return to our 2 percent  longer-run  objective. Alternatively, faster economic  growth or an un-anchoring  of inflation expectations from our large balance sheet pose upside risks to the inflation  outlook.

Respondent 10: It is a close  call,  but  we  think  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  for  growth  and  unemployment  are  now  roughly  in  balance. On  the  downside,  we  have  experienced  a  number  of  false  springs during  this  recovery,  which  makes  us  naturally  wary  that  the  recent  good  news  regarding  labor  markets and consumer  spending  might  prove  to  be ephemeral. More  concretely, there still is a chance that  financial  conditions  will  tighten  once  we  actually  begin  to  reduce  the  pace  of  asset  purchases  if we  do  not  add  adequate  offsetting  enhancements  to  our  forward  guidance. There  also  continues  to  be downside  risks  to  growth  abroad. Moreover,  the  zero  lower  bound  makes  it  more  difficult  for  policy to respond  to  negative  shocks  that  might  hit  the  economy. On  the  upside,  improved  household  sector fundamentals-notably,  gains in housing  wealth and better job prospects  -raise the probability that the recent  acceleration in  consumer spending  may prove to be  more robust than we have projected. This, in turn, could produce  more pronounced 'virtuous cycle' dynamics then we are projecting. Finally, risks from the U.S. fiscal situation appear to be in better balance than they have been for some  time.

We  continue  to  see  downside  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  predominating  over  the  medium-term. Actual inflation has surprised us on the downside  since the September  SEP  and  we  don't see any obvious  forces  pushing  it  much  higher  in  the  near  term: Neither  the  data  nor  our  business  contacts suggest any meaningful  domestic  cost  pressures, demand  is  not strong enough  for firms to increase margins, and there are no inflationary pressures coming  from  abroad. Our projection  for inflation picking up steadily over the projection period depends heavily on an upward  pull on prices from inflation expectations  and  credible  FOMC  communications  about  its  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2 percent  inflation  target. For  some  time  we  have  noted  the  risk  that  this  upward  force  may  not  be  as strong  as  we  have  assumed,  and  the  recent  data  have  heightened  our  concern  about  this  risk.

Respondent 15: Downside  risks  to  output  include  the  ZLB  constraint,  adverse  changes  in productivity, effects of tighter financial  conditions, and fiscal risks, including the debt  ceiling  risk. In general, projections of pickups in  output have not been fulfilled,  and it is uncertain whether that is due to bad

luck or headwinds  that  are  stronger  than  we  appreciate. Normally,  downside  risks  to  output  would imply  upside  risks to unemployment,  but  some  unemployment-specific  risks  (participation  declines, slow  productivity)  have  led  to  downside  surprises  in  unemployment  that  could  be  repeated.

Main  risk  to  inflation  is  commodity  prices,  which  have  balanced  risks. On  the  upside,  I  don't  see an unanchoring of inflation  expectations,  economic overshooting,  or a weaker dollar  as significant  risks to inflation in the near  term. There is a small downside risk  associated  with the possibility  that slack is greater  than  understood  both  here  and  in  other  economies.

Respondent 16: I remain  concerned about  our ability  to respond effectively to a decline in inflation or inflation  expectations.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: Assuming appropriate policy and  my  views  on the  convergence process, my judgment  is  that  the  lift-off  of the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in Q4/2014.

Respondent 2: I expect  the  federal  funds  rate  to  remain  in  the  0  to  25  basis  point  range  for  some time after the unemployment  rate  reaches  6 1 2 / percent, providing  inflation  is projected  to be  close to the Committee's  2 percent  objective  in  the  medium  term  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations continue  to  be  anchored. Once  the  fed  funds  rate  lifts  from  the  zero  lower  bound,  I  expect  the  policy rate  to follow  a  relatively  shallow  path,  broadly  in  line  with  an  outcome-based  Taylor  rule.

Respondent 3: I continue to believe that it is our post-liftoff policy reaction function as it is understood  by  the  public  that  chiefly  matters  for  the  strength  of  the  recovery. This  reaction  function is not  well  conveyed  either  by  a  time-path  for  the  funds  rate  or  by  threshold-based  forward  guidance.

For purposes of this  exercise, I  rely heavily  on the prescriptions of the  1999 Taylor rule  with inertia, as that rule seems  to perform  reasonably  well  in a wide  range  of circumstances. In calculating the rule-prescribed  funds rate, I assume  that  the natural real rate of interest is temporarily  depressed, and  I respect  the  Committee's  public  commitment  to  delay  liftoff  until  after  the  unemployment  rate reaches 6.5 percent. It is important  to preserving the credibility of the Committee  that  we  try to honor  the pledges  of previous  FOMCs  unless  the  reasons  for  modifying  those  pledges  are  clear  and compelling.

Respondent 4: The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path  for monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the  central outlook. Overall, even though some indicators have become  somewhat  brighter since September,  we  still anticipate that expansion  will be sluggish; in fact, the real growth  forecast is modestly  lower  than  in September  and  the projected path  of  the  unemployment rate is slightly higher. Consequently, although the labor market outlook has improved some, our assessment  is  that  the  improvement  has  not  reached  the  'substantial'  standard. Financial  conditions have improved, but they  are still not fully normal  and  remain susceptible to sharp  reversals depending upon developments.  Furthermore, we believe that the strongly  accommodative policy approach of the Federal  Reserve  and  other  advanced  economy  central  banks  has  been  an  important  factor  behind  the extent  of  improvement  in  U.S.  and  global  economic  data. In  contrast,  uncertainty  about  whether  central banks  will  maintain  accommodative postures has  contributed to the occasional pressures evident in financial markets  since  May. Even  though  our  risk  assessment  for  real  activity is again  balanced and  remains balanced for inflation, the downside risks to both real  activity  and inflation probably are more  costly  in  the  current  environment.

In these circumstances  and noting that the economic  developments  since September  2012  have been in rough accord with our projection at that time (when we had proposed the introduction of an outcome-based  purchase  program  and  policy  stance), we see appropriate monetary  policy as remaining accommodative  to strengthen the economic expansion. Under such a policy, it will be the economic  outcomes  and  outlook  that will dictate the path of the policy stance. Based  on our modal  outlook,  we  anticipate  that  the  target  FFR  will  remain  near  zero  until  the  second  half  of  2015. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored over  this period. The pace  of

renormalization of the  target FFR  following the period of near  zero policy rates  will then depend  upon our  assessment of  economic  conditions  and the  outlook,  longer-term inflation  expectations,  and  overall financial  conditions. At this point, we expect that the increase in the FFR  will be gradual such that it will still be  below  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  at  the  end  of  2016,  as  a  commitment  to  remain 'low  for long'  is important  for  providing  accommodation  at  this  time  when  the  FFR  is  constrained by  the  zero  lower  bound.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate  is  in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0  - 5.0%. Given the behavior of nominal and  real Treasury yields and productivity growth  since  the  end  of  the  recession,  we  currently  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to be in the lower  half  of the indicated  range,  which  results  in  the  point  estimate  given  in  the  response to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  our  assessment  of  economic  and  financial  conditions,  our judgement of the  current 'neutral' FFR  is below  our estimate  of  the  longer-run  FFR  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  some  time.

Although we do not expect that additional tools  will need to be implemented to provide  accommodation in  our  modal  outlook, we believe it is still important  for the FOMC to be prepared to  employ all of its tools  in case  some  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  are  realized.

Respondent 5: My  path for the federal funds rate, both before and after liftoff from the zero bound, is shaped by  my  expectation that the headwinds that have been  holding back  recovery  since the financial crisis will to  continue to exert  a restraining, albeit abating, influence on aggregate demand for several years to  come. In addition, inflation is running  well below our 2% longer-run objective. To promote  the  attainment  of  our  maximum  employment  and price  stability  objectives  over  the  medium term, I  see it as necessary  to pursue a highly  accommodative policy throughout the forecast period. I would assess the equilibrium real funds rate at present and  over the  forecast to be substantially below my  estimate  of  its  longer  run  normal  level  of  around 1.5%. This  reflects  factors  such  as  abnormally  tight fiscal policy, lingering credit effects from  the financial crisis and  business  and  household  pessimism. My  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  level  of  the  nominal  (and  real)  federal  funds  rate  of  3.5%  (and 1.5%)  are  consistent  with  estimates  from  the  staff's  three  factor  model. This  estimate  likely  reflects some pessimism about the prospects for longer-run growth, consistent, for example, with current Laubach-Williams  estimates  of  trend  GDP  growth.

Respondent 6: I use the 6.5%  unemployment  rate  as  the  trigger  for  liftoff. The  economy  returns to steady  state  by  the  end  of  2015,  with  inflation  returning  to  2  percent,  growth  at  2.4  percent,  and the  unemployment  rate  at  5.8%. My  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over  the  forecast horizon  to  reach  its  long-run  level  of  4%  by  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 7: I expect  that  by  early  in  2015  labor  markets  will  have  improved  significantly,  and inflation  will be above 1.5 percent and increasing. Accordingly, I believe we  will want to begin raising the  funds  rate  to  keep  the  inflation  rate  from  rising  too  sharply.

Respondent 8: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  remain  large  and  persistent,  and  my  outlook  for inflation over the medium  term  is persistently below our 2 percent objective. This situation calls for very  accommodative  monetary  policy. Even  with  continuing  LSAPs,  appropriate  policy  calls  for delaying liftoff from the zero lower bound  until the third quarter of 2015, several quarters after I forecast  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  6-1/2  percent. My  judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is informed by  looking  at simple rules that adjust for the  zero lower bound  and by  my  expectations of, and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Respondent 9: While  the  unemployment  rate  threshold  is  likely  to  be  crossed  in  early  2015, low inflationary  pressures  will  justify  delaying  the  first  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  target  until  the second  half  of  2015. By  that  point,  the  unemployment  rate  will  have  declined  further  and  be  nearing my  estimate of the natural rate, and projected inflation will be closer to our 2 percent  longer-run objective. Consistent with our current guidance, once the first increase in the funds rate target occurs, I  also believe it  will be appropriate to raise the funds rate gradually.

Respondent 10: Our  forecast assumes  that  it will be appropriate  to begin reducing  the pace of asset purchases  sometime  between  now  and  March. We  also  assume  that  the  incoming  data  will  be strong  enough to justify  completing the purchase program by the end of  2014. To insure that  markets understand  the  Committee's  intentions  to  keep  policy  highly  accommodative, the first reduction  in purchases  should  be accompanied  by  enhanced  guidance  about  prospective  actions  once  the  unemployment  rate hits 6-1/2 percent. This guidance  should  state that in order to raise rates we must also observe  an improvement  in  a  broad  array  of labor market  indicators, that these improvements appear  to be sustainable, and that there are strong signs that inflation will achieve our longer-run target  within  two  years.

In our forecast, the unemployment  rate  reaches  6-1/2  percent  sometime  in  the  first  half  of  2015. However,  we  do  not  think  that  the  unusual  labor  force  dynamics  will  have  run  their  course  by  then, and  so  the  unemployment  rate  at  that  time  will  likely  overstate  the  improvement  in  the  labor  market as a whole. Furthermore,  we  do  not  think  we  will  have  enough  confidence  in  inflation  reaching  target by early 2017 to justify raising the funds rate at that time. Our baseline assumption  is that the pre-conditions  for  funds  rate  lift-off  will  not  be  firmly  in  place  until  sometime  in  early  2016.

Respondent 11: Liftoff  of  the  federal  funds  rate  from  the  zero-lower-bound  occurs  once  the  unemployment rate reaches 6 percent. With inflation well below  target  and a relatively  modest  acceleration in the pace of GDP  growth, monetary  policy can afford to be patient in the process of removing accomodation.

Respondent 12: I expect  moderate  growth  and  inflation  that  will  remain  low  and  return  only  very gradually to the 2% objective. As a result, I  expect that the  Committee  will move slowly to increase rates.

Respondent 13: I am  assuming  we  cross  the  6.5%  unemployment  threshold  in  approximately  the third quarter of  2014. From that point, we  continue to stay  at the  zero bound for roughly another six to nine  months, so  liftoff  occurs around mid-2015. After  liftoff, I have in mind that we raise the funds rate  only  gradually,  at  a  rate  of  25  basis  points  every  other  meeting,  or  100  basis  points  per  year,  for each  of  the  next  two  years.

Respondent 14: Key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy are achieving  an inflation objective of 2.0 percent, ensuring  a sustainable economic  recovery that reduces unemployment, and being  consistent  with our thresholds and forward guidance.  I believe that we should begin to taper asset purchases  at this meeting, to allow time between  ending  asset purchases  and beginning  to raise the funds rate. Once we begin to raise the funds rate, I believe we can  be  gradual-raising  the  funds  rate  by  25  bps  per  meeting.

Respondent 15: In my projection, the unemployment rate hits  6.5  early in  2015 but inflation  and year-ahead  inflation  are  still  modestly  below  target. I assume  one  rate  increase  late  in  2015  and  four more  in  2016. Headwinds  from  fiscal  policy  and  from  aftereffects  of  financial  crisis  contribute  to  the low  funds  rate  in  2016  by  lowering  the  equilibrium  real  rate  in  the  medium  term.

Respondent 16: Under  appropriate  monetary  policy, the FOMC  should  keep  the  fed  funds  rate extraordinarily low at  least  until the unemployment  rate  falls below  5.5%, as long  as the medium-term outlook  for  inflation  remains  below  2%.

It's worth  noting  that, under  my  benchmark  outlook,  the  FOMC  would  raise  the  fed  funds  rate considerably  in  2017. Growth  would  be  below  its  long-run  average. Unemployment  would  likely  rise (back  to  its  longer-run  level  of  5.5%)  and  inflation  would  fall  (back  toward  2%).

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

Respondent 1: No

N/A

Respondent 2: Yes

My  baseline  outlook  calls for the FOMC  to  announce  a  taper  of  our  asset  purchases  at  the  current meeting  and  to  end  the  asset  purchase  program  sometime  in  2014q2.

Respondent 3: Yes

I believe that the  Committee  ought to slow the pace of purchases at the turn of the year, and I  expect that  economic  conditions  will warrant  ending purchases  completely by the  end of June. This projected timing  produces  cumulative  purchases  materially  below  $1.4  trillion.

Respondent 4: No

As  in the Tealbook,  we  expect  the  pace  of  purchases  to  be  reduced  beginning  in  the  first  quarter  of 2014,  and  for  purchases  to  continue  through  most  of  the  year. We  anticipate  the  cumulative  amount of purchases to be around  $1.5 trillion, reasonably  close to that of the Tealbook. We would note that within  our  overall  strategy  for  appropriate  monetary  policy,  we  believe  that  a  collective  emphasis  on an accommodative  stance  based  on  a portfolio of tools would  enhance  the efficacy of policy under current  circumstances.

Respondent 5: No

N/A

Respondent 6: Yes

I anticipate  following  the  Commitee's  June  2011  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path  is steeper  than  in  the  Tealbook,  I  anticipate  that  we  would  reduce  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet more  quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 7: Yes

I favor immediate  cessation of long-term asset purchases and reinvestment of maturing mortgagebacked  securities.

Respondent 8: Yes

I assume  that  the  pace  of  purchases  slows  in  January  2014  and  that  purchases  end  in  the  middle  of 2014,  with  a  cumulative  amount  of  purchases  in  2013  and  2014  of  $1.3  trillion

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: I expect  an acceleration in near-term growth due to improving growth prospects abroad  and  progress  on  U.S.  fiscal  issues.

Respondent 2: A  modest  acceleration  in  aggregate spending  occurs  in  2014  amid dissipating headwinds and  ongoing policy  accommodation.  GDP growth rises somewhat above potential GDP growth over the medium  term, gradually reducing slack and supporting a further decrease in the rate of unemployment.

My  outlook  calls  for  a  strengthening  in  consumer  spending,  as  the  labor  market  firms,  disposable income  grows  at  a more  robust  pace, and  household  balance  sheets  continue  to  improve. The  pace of industrial production  quickens,  bolstered  by  improving  export  demand  and  global  growth. And, a combination  of  high profit levels, liquid corporate  balance  sheets, and low interest rates promote stronger  capital  expansion.

I expect  that  fiscal drag  on  the economy  will  gradually  lift  throughout  the  forecast  horizon,  and uncertainty over the Federal budget situation will dissipate early in 2014. Absent  these restraints on spending  and  investment,  the  pace  of  the  expansion  accelerates. The  fiscal position  of state and local  governments  continues  to  improve,  allowing  for  more  spending  activity  from  this  sector  over  the forecast  period.

As the growth  trajectory  firms through  the medium  term,  and  excess  slack  is reduced, disinflationary pressures  on  wages  and prices  will  lessen,  allowing  anchored  inflation  expectations  to pull  the underlying  trend  toward  our  inflation  objective.

I see the  risks to the  growth  outlook  as  being  roughly  balanced. A  renewal  of  fiscal  policy  uncertainty  would adversely influence fragile household, business,  and financial  market  confidence,  although I see the  likelihood of such  a scenario  as having diminished since September. Slow productivity growth may  also  continue  to restrain growth  more  than  I  expect. On  the  other  hand, there is a possibility that  latent  economic  strength  being  masked  by  significant  headwinds  (in  the  form  of  fiscal  drag  and policy uncertainty) is greater than I have assumed. Another  upside risk to my  growth outlook is the  possibility  of  a  virtuous  dynamic  where  improving  household  balance  sheets,  rising  wealth,  and  a firming  in  the  employment  trajectory  creates  more  robust  consumption  growth.

The already low underlying inflation trend has softened further in recent  months,  causing  me some concern that inflation  expectations  will  fail to  lift the inflation trend  and, instead, become  unhinged with downside  consequences  to inflation. This risk is balanced against the possibility that we are misreading the current level of slack in the  economy, which  would  mean policy is overly  accommodative, causing  an overshooting  of inflation  relative to  our price objective.

Respondent 3: Sustained  low  real  interest  rates,  abundant  credit,  improved  household  and  strong corporate finances, and pent-up  demand for durable goods provide the basis for an  acceleration in the pace  of  the  recovery. The  Euro-area  economy  appears  to  have  stabilized,  and  the  U.K.  and  Japanese economies  are expanding. The substantial drags from restrictive U.S. fiscal policy and from fiscal and  regulatory  uncertainty  seem  likely  to  diminish. New  oil and  gas extraction  technologies  reduce the  danger  that  higher  energy  prices  will  damp  the  recovery. On  the  other  hand,  corporations  so  far remain focused on squeezing  out  efficiencies, buying back  shares, and paying dividends rather than on expanding  their  operations  in  ways  that  lead  to  robust  employment  growth.

Inflation has stabilized. If the recovery  accelerates  as  expected, inflation  will  likely return  fairly quickly  to  near-target  levels.

Respondent 4: Other  conditioning assumptions: We expect the lower degree of inflation persistence evident since the  early  1990s  to continue. Inflation expectations remain  well anchored. We project foreign  real GDP  growth  (GDP  weighted)  at  2.9%  in  2013,  3.0%  in  2014,  and  3.1%  in  2015-changes from  September  are  small. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  doll  exchange  rate  are  similar  to those in the Tealbook. Reflecting  movements  in  futures  quotes  since  September,  our  assumed  path of WTI  oil prices has moved  down  to $96.50 (from $107.50 in September) for 2013Q4, to $92.00 (from $94.50 in September)  for 2014Q4,  and  to $86.50 for 2015Q4. Our  federal fiscal assumptions are similar to those in the Tealbook, taking on board the recently proposed  fiscal agreement  that modestly  mitigates  the  impact  of  the  sequester. We  adopt  the  Tealbook  assumptions  regarding  equity and  home  prices.

Outlook:  The  economic indicators paint a picture of the  economy in  2013Q4 that is in rough  accord with  our  prior  projection. Consumer  spending  appears  to  be  rising  more  strongly  than  we  expected in September,  but  residential and business fixed investment  continue to be somewhat  weaker  than anticipated. Nevertheless,  we  see  the  economy  on  somewhat  more  solid  footing  as  it  enters  2014  than it has  been  in  the  past  couple  of  years.

Therefore, we  continue to anticipate  economic growth be stronger in the next two years than it has been  so  far  during  this  expansion,  with  real  GDP  growth  of  about  2 3 4 / %  (Q4/Q4)  in  2014  and  about 3 1 4 / %  in 2015, both  notably  above  our  estimate  of  the potential growth  rate. We  believe  that the private  sector  of  the  economy  has  made  substantial  progress  in  repairing  balance  sheets  and  working off excesses. Consequently,  the  economy  has  been  set  to  move  to  a  higher  level  of  activity,  but  it  has been  delayed  by  a  series  of  negative  shocks-including  contractionary  federal  fiscal  policy  and  slowing global  growth-that  now  appear  to  be  dissipating.

Several  developments  support  our  view  of  a  pickup  in  2014-15. Growth  should  be  supported  by continued  accommodative  monetary  policy. Furthermore,  key  measures  of  household  financial  conditions signal  that household balance sheets have been  largely repaired  and  that household deleveraging is largely  over. The  household  net  worth-disposable  income  ratio  rose  to  615%  in  2013Q3,  the  highest since  2007Q4; if recent  rises in equity prices are sustained, we  could see a further rise in this ratio in the current  quarter. Household  liabilities  recorded  their  first  4-quarter  increase  since  2008Q3,  suggesting that households are  more  willing  and able to use credit than they had been  earlier in the expansion. Also,  at  about  5%,  the  personal  saving  rate  in  2013Q3  was  above  the  level  consistent  with  its  historical relationship  to  household  net  worth,  suggesting  that  households  have  the  capacity  to  raise  their spending  some. In addition,  it appears  that  the  foreign  economic  outlook  is  relatively  sanguine,  and the  contraction  in  state  and  local  government  spending  appears  to  have  ended. Federal  fiscal  drag  is on track to subside  in 2014, and  the recently announced  budget  agreement  would  lessen  fiscal  drag modestly  further  if  it  is  enacted.

The  somewhat  firmer  outlook  for  real  PCE  is  offset  by  a  weaker  investment  outlook. Growth  of business fixed investment  is ending 2013 on a weaker  note than we anticipated in September. We still expect growth  of business fixed investment  to strengthen as capacity utilization moves  higher and commercial  vacancy  rates decline, but that strengthening  has been pushed  back, lowering our projected path. Similarly, while we expect housing  starts  to resume  an  upward  trend, the slope of that trend has  been damped due to higher  mortgage  rates  and the stronger-than-expected  impact they  have  had  on  the  housing  market. The  recently  announced  increases  in  the  guarantee  fees  to  go into  effect  in 2014  could  have  a  modestly  further  dampening  effect.

With  real GDP  growth  improving,  we  expect  a  sustained  pace of improvement  in  overall labor market  conditions. However, it should be noted that from 2011 to 2013, productivity growth  was only 3 4 / % (annual rate), 1 2 / percentage point below our assumption  of trend productivity growth. Therefore, it is possible that average monthly gains in payroll employment  could fall back below 200,000  temporarily  even  with  stronger  real  GDP  growth,  although  we  still  see  the  average  over  201415 as over  that  level. On  the  flip side, the labor  force  participation  rate  has  continued  to  run  below our  expectations. Taking  these  factors  into  account,  we  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall

to around  6 1 2 / %  by 2014Q4,  to  about  5 1 2 / %  by 2015Q4,  and  then  to 5 1 4 / %, our estimate  of the longer-run  natural  rate,  in  2016.

With the gradual reduction of economic slack, a decline of the exchange rate of the dollar, a firming  in  global demand,  and the upward pull of  anchored inflation  expectations,  our  models predict that  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  will  gradually  move  upward  over  the  forecast  horizon. However,  we  see  the  recent  downside  surprises  to  inflation  (both  here  and  in  other  areas  around  the world)  as indicating  stronger disinflationary pressures than we had  anticipated. Consequently, we now expect  inflation  to  return  to  near  the  FOMC  longer-run  goal  of  2%  by  the  end  of  2015,  which  is  one year  later than we had  anticipated  in September. Thereafter,  with  stable  inflation  expectations  and dissipating economic  slack  (as the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  be near its longer-run  value), inflation is  expected to be near  the FOMC  longer-run objective.

Respondent 5: My forecast envisions a notable pickup in growth over the next  several years, further declines  in the unemployment  rate,  and  slow  movement  in  inflation  back  toward  the  Committee's  2 percent  longer-run  objective. An  accommodative  monetary policy  and  easing  credit  constraints  will serve  as important  factors  propelling  a  more  rapid  recovery. A  significant  factor  shaping  the  outlook is the prospect  of diminishing  fiscal drag next year. The  evidence  suggests  that private demand  is strengthening  meaningfully and  consumer spending appears to now be growing  at a reasonably robust pace. Factors  propelling  this  pickup  in  PCE  include  the  waning  impact  of  tax  increases  earlier  in  the year, a strengthening  of household  balance  sheets  due  to rising house  and equity prices, improving prospects  for the labor market  and  robust  auto  sales driven by low interest rates, readily available credit and an aging fleet, generating substantial replacement demand. Residential investment has slowed significantly this quarter, likely due to the effects of rising mortgage rates, but I expect a pickup  in  housing  starts  and  considerable  growth  in  residential  investment  next  year. Investment  in equipment  and  intangibles  has  also  advanced  at  a  very  slow  pace  in  recent  quarters,  but  I  anticipate that stronger  growth  in  sales  next  year  will lead to a meaningful  pickup. With  respect  to  the  labor market,  I have  been  surprised  that  with  growth  running  around  2  percent,  payroll  employment  has been  rising at a reasonably  consistent  pace  of 190,000  jobs per month  over  the  past  year-a  pattern that  is causing  me  to  adjust  down  slightly  my  assumptions  concerning  the  likely  pace  of  productivity growth over the next  few years. Unemployment has  also declined by  more than  I'd  anticipated due in part  to a decline  in labor  force  participation  which  I  view  as  partly  cyclical. In part  for this reason, I see the decline in the unemployment  rate  as  understating  the  extent  of  slack  in  the  labor  market. I anticipate  some  rebound,  or  at  least  a  flattening  out  of  the  participation  rate,  and  a  slower  decline in unemployment  going  forward. Inflation has been  running below  the  Committee's  2%  objective  in spite of the  fact that inflation  expectations  are well-anchored. In part, I believe this reflects significant remaining  slack  in  labor  and  product  markets;  a  decline  in  the  rate  of  increase  of  medical  prices  also appears  to  be an important  contributor. My  forecast  envisions  a  return  to 2%  inflation  beyond  the end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 6: I expect output growth to  accelerate to 3 percent in  2014. The pace of growth then runs near my longer-term trend  rate of 2.4 percent in  2015 and  2016. With a moderate pace of growth over the forecast horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the unemployment rate to move down to about 5.8 percent by the end of  2015, at which  time it reaches my  estimate of the natural  rate  of unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will rise gradually  to  1.8 percent in 2014  and  2 percent  in 2015  and  2016. Inflation stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary policy by  ending  asset purchases in  2014H1  and then beginning  to raise rates in  2014H2.

Respondent 7: With population growth below 1 percent  and productivity growth at 1 percent, the longer-run  trend  for  real  GDP  is  lower  than  in  previous  business  cycles.

Respondent 8: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes  are  associated  with  sustained weakness in  aggregate demand through a variety of channels, which policy has  only partially offset. Many of the  associated headwinds are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  has  turned  a  corner,  and  appears  poised  to  continue  its  recovery  despite  the  pickup  in mortgage  rates  this  year;
- · Consumer  balance  sheets  as  well  as  banking  and  credit  conditions  are  improving;
- · Fiscal  austerity  has been  a notable drag  on the  economy this year, but that drag should  lessen going  forward;
- · Europe  is still a source of downside  risk, but a severe crisis looks less likely over time; more broadly,  the  global  economy  is  looking  a  little  healthier;
- · Although  economic  and  policy  uncertainty  remain  high,  that  uncertainty  has  fallen  over  time. The  imminent  fiscal  deal  should  help  in  this  regard.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us to continue  making  progress  on  closing output  and  unemployment  gaps  over  the  next  few years. Even  with  substantial  monetary  stimulus,  it  will  take  several  years  of above-trend  growth  to return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity  and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2  percent inflation target for the next few years. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and diminishing  slack  eventually pull inflation back  to  our objective.

Respondent 9: Economic  growth has  once  again been  moderate  in 2013, held down  in part by considerable  fiscal drag, weakness  abroad,  and  generally  cautious  spending  by  businesses. However, even  with  these  headwinds,  the  labor  market  has  been  improving  and  enters  2014  with  momentum. Waning  fiscal  drag,  stabilization  in  foreign  economies,  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  easing of tight credit standards, and ongoing  recovery  in the labor market  make  me  cautiously  optimistic that the economy  is  poised  for  moderately  stronger  growth  in  the  years  ahead  compared  with  what we  have  experienced  in  the  recent  past. Furthermore,  the  resilience  of  the  economy  to  the  headwinds experienced  in  2013-and,  for  that  matter,  to  the headwinds  of  the  last  few years-suggests  to  me  that the  recovery  can  withstand  dialing  back  our  asset  purchases.

Recent inflation readings have  continued to be quite subdued, and  as a  consequence I have lowered my projected path for inflation slightly. Energy prices have been one downside surprise, as the combination  of the domestic energy boom  and  slower growth in emerging markets keeps prices in check. Outside  of  energy  prices,  the  surprise  has  not  been  that  inflation  has  truly  been  drifting  that much  lower than where  it was in the summer; rather, inflation has just not yet begun  to turn up as I had expected. Despite these low inflation  readings, inflation  expectation  measures appear  to be well-anchored,  which  should  limit  further  disinflationary  pressure. Alongside  an  improving  economy, I anticipate that inflation  should slowly move back toward the 2 percent  long-run objective over the next  few  years.

As  I discussed  above,  I  view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the last 20 years, in spite of the uncertain long  run U.S. fiscal situation. Risks to my  outlook appear to be balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation. While  there  are  downside  risks  to  the  real  economy coming  from  the  normalization  of  longer-term  interest  rates,  the  momentum  coming  from  the  labor market  could  point  toward  a  stronger  virtuous  circle  than  I  am  currently  anticipating.

Respondent 10: The key  factors shaping  our forecast are the same  as they have been  for some time. Accommodative  monetary  policy, improved  household  and business balance sheets, and the diminution  of  fiscal  restraint  should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move  through the projection period. Pent-up demands  for capital goods and consumer  durables should provide further impetus to growth. Demand from abroad is projected to firm  as the recovery in Europe and growth  in emerging  market  economies  build  momentum. Our  forecast also assumes  that  there will not be any unusual  changes  in financial conditions  beyond  those  warranted  by  the  improvement  in the  economic  outlook.

Together,  these  factors  are  assumed  to  produce  above-potential  growth  in  2014,  2015,  and  2016. Nonetheless,  growth  is  not  expected  to  be  strong  enough  to  close resource  gaps  completely,  and  we project that the unemployment rate  will still be nearly 1 2 / percentage point  above  its  long-run neutral level at the end of the projection  period. Resource  slack  thus is expected  to exert some  downward influence  on inflation through much of the projection period. However, under  our view of appropriate monetary policy, enough  accommodation  will remain in place (and be expected to remain in place) to support inflation  expectations and produce an updrift in inflation to 1.8 percent by the end of  2016, with perhaps some modest overshooting of target beyond the projection horizon. (Our extended inflation  forecast  has  PCE  prices  rising  2.0  percent  in  2017  and  2.2  percent  in  2018).

The  main  sources  of  uncertainty  and  risks  to  our  forecast  are  described  in  2(b)  above.

Respondent 11: While the pace of growth in real GDP  during the second half of this year is somewhat stronger that previously thought, advances in the private  component of demand  are broadly in line  with  expectations. On the positive side, recent data releases  are  consistent  with  an  acceleration in  consumer spending in the current quarter.  Household net worth appreciation and the waning impact of fiscal restraint on disposable income  should help to sustain the ongoing pickup in  consumption well into next  year. Other  components  of  private  demand  have  been  less  encouraging. Higher  long-term rates are slowing  residential investment  down,  although  pent-up  demand  for  housing  and  mortgage rates that are still low by historical standards  should  provide  support  to the sector going forward. Moreover, businesses have been expanding capital at a slow pace so  far this year. An improvement in this  component of demand  remains in the  outlook  and  should lag the firming  up of  consumer spending. Labor  market  data  indicators  have  been  generally  encouraging, although  the  portion  of the decline in the unemployment  rate  resulting  from  a  drop  in  labor  force participation  among  youger  workers may prove  temporary.  Wage increases remain muted, suggesting  that slack in the  labor  market is still significant. Similarly,  core inflation readings are low,  with  market-based price inflation hoverning  near one  percent  both  on  a  6-month  and  a  12-month  basis.

The  main  factors  shaping  the  contours  of  the  forecast  have  not  changed. As the effects of fiscal policy  wane,  the  pace  of activity is expected  to  accelerate  and  generate  a  virtuous  cycle  in  terms  of improved  confidence  and  spending. Still, the projected  acceleration is relatively  modest by  historical standards  and  requires  continued  support  from  monetary  policy. In particular,  the  outlook  is  conditioned on the current  asset purchase program to  total  $1.4 trillion,  with tapering of purchases starting in March  of next year. Moreover,  the  liftoff  of  the  federal  funds rate  from  the  zero-lower-bound  occurs only  once the unemployment rate  reaches 6 percent,  as the  modest projected  acceleration in growth in a low inflation environment  allows  for  additional  policy  accomodation. With  this  policy  stimulus in place, the unemployment  rate  is projected  to  reach 5.5 percent by  the end of 2016. Inflation is expected  to  remain  below  target  over  the  forecast  horizon.

While  the risks to the real outlook have become  somewhat  more balanced,on  the  inflation  side, the risk is that the recent low readings  of core inflation may  prove  more  long-lasting  than  what  we are  assuming  in  our  forecast.

Respondent 12: My  forecast  is for continued  moderate  increases  in  growth, but at a lower level than  the baseline. I expect  unemployment  to  continue  to  decline  at  least  as  fast  as the baseline, as

a result of decent  payroll  growth  in  the  200,000  - 250,000  range  and  continued  declines  in  the  labor force participation rate. Finally, I  expect that inflation  will return only gradually to the  Committee's 4%  objective.

Respondent 13: My  central outlook is based on the premise that fiscal drag  will fade over the next couple of years, so that barring  any  unexpected  shocks, growth in  2014  and  2015  should be stronger than  in  2013. I view  the  risks  around  this  central  tendency  as  roughly  balanced. On  the  downside,  I continue  to worry  that  the  exit process  from  asset purchases  and highly  accomodative policies  more generally  may  be  bumpier  than  we  would  like,  and  that  there  could  be  an  unintended  tightening  of financial  conditions at some point in the process that  could slow the recovery. On the upside, I think that if growth does pick  up, there  could be a virtuous circle whereby capital spending-which has been sluggish  relative  to  fundamentals-begins  to  accelerate  markedly. This  in  turn  would  further  feed  the step-up  in  growth.

Respondent 14: Despite  significant  fiscal tightening  this year, the economy  continues  to  grow  at a moderate  pace. However,  I  expect  growth  to  slow  in  the  fourth  quarter  as  inventory  accumulation moderates.  Even  so,  I  expect  growth  in  final  sales  to  accelerate. Overall,  I  expect  growth  to  be  about 2 1 4 / percent in  2013, and then to pick  up  to about 2 3 4 / percent next year  and 3 percent in  2015  and 2016. The  pickup  in  growth  reflects  a  significant  reduction  in  fiscal  drag,  an  improving  labor  market, and  rising  household  net  worth  from  both  the  stock  market  and  housing. Moreover,  the  rate  of  auto sales  has  returned  to  its  level  of  before  the  recession  and  an  improvement  in  manufacturing  is  seen  in both  employment  and  the  ISM.  Finally,  while  the  housing  recovery  has  slowed  somewhat,  it  remains on  track.

I continue  to see sustained  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions. A broad  measure  of labor market  conditions  (that includes the unemployment  rate,  labor  force participation, hires and quits rate, other  measures  of  resource  slack,  growth  in  employment  and  earnings,  and  survey  responses  by businesses,  consumer,  and  economists)  shows  that  conditions  have  improved  substantially  since  last September  and  that  labor  market  momentum  remains  strong  by  historical  standards.

Turning  to  inflation,  with  measures  of  inflation  expectations  holding  steady  and  the  labor  market continuing  to  gradually  normalize,  I  expect  inflation  to  firm  next  year  and  move  toward  two  percent over  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 15: Moderate  pickup  in  growth  and  inflation,  and  continued  gains  in  labor  markets, come  primarily  from  a  stronger  consumer  (increased  wealth,  labor  income,  higher  confidence,  diminishing  effects  of tax  increases),  diminished  federal  fiscal  drag,  and  modest  pickup  in  other  AFEs  and in EMEs.  Housing  is being  slowed by tighter financial  conditions, which  could be made yet tighter by slowing  of LSAPs. Capital  investment should do better  as  final sales  expand both domestically  and in export  markets. State and local governments  will be a small positive. Productivity  and labor force growth  are below pre-crisis  levels, slowing growth but increasing the pace of declines in unemployment. The  end  of  extended  UI  may  have  a  marginal  downward  impact  on  unemployment.

Inflation is anchored by stable expectations and low volatility of commodity  prices. However, inflation is lower than expected, in part because of special factors (medical prices, imports) but possibly  also because slack  remains greater (or the responsiveness to slack is greater)  than previously thought.

Respondent 16: 1. As noted above: I  continue to be  concerned about possible declines in inflation expectations.

2. As in September: the  main risk  to the outlook is  monetary policy itself. We seem to be  cautious in our pursuit of our long-run price stability  and employment goals. That  caution  will leave households

and  firms  concerned  about  our  ability/willingness  to  insulate  the  economy  against  tail risks,  and push down  on  current  spending.

Respondent 17: I have  made only modest changes from my Septermber projections to the near- and medium-term  outlook.  Probably  the  most  significant  change  in  my  outlook  over  the  last  three  months has been  the diminution in downside risk. It now appears reasonably  clear that,  contrary  to my  own suspicions,  the  government  shutdown  and  fiscall  cliff  debate  did  not  have  a  significant  negative  effect on the gorwoth trajectory  for this and  coming quarters. Inventory  build-up  in Q3  seems  to have been a more important  factor than these fiscal disruptions in slowing growth in Q4. But  with job  creation and  retail  sales holding  up  very  well  this  quarter,  there  is  additional  support  for  the  hypothesis  that there  is a decent  amount  of  self-sustaining  momentum  in  the  economy,  which  would  be  even  stronger were  it  not  for  the  ongoing  effects  of  fiscal  contraction. The  narrative  of  gruadually  diminishing  fiscal drag  and  of  substantial  progress  on  post-crisis  balance  sheet  repair  continues  to  be  a  reasonable  one. Still, I don't  think  those  downside  risks  have  completely  disappeared. A  good  bit of the increase  in consumer  spending  is  likely the result of wealth  increases from equity and house  appreciation, and perhaps  from  decreased  savings  rates,  as  opposed  to  income  increases. Slowing,  or  even  reversals,  in the rate of asset appreciation,  or  a limit to declines  in the savings  rate  could  impede  the  pick-up  in growth that I now regard  as the  most  likely scenario. Indeed, a change in  expectations  around  our monetary policy  could itself slow equity  and housing price increases, or perhaps even  lead to transitory decreases.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: My  forecasts have changed slightly. The changes are due to improving growth prospects  abroad,  progress  on  U.S.  fiscal  issues,  and  recent  inflation  results.

Respondent 2: My growth  forecast today is broadly similar to what it was in September.  However, the incoming data have  caused me to raise my 2013 growth projection by about  a 1 4 / percentage point. In response to further disinflationary  trends that  emerged during the intermeeting period, I've lowered my  inflation  forecast  by  roughly 1 4 / percentage  point  through  2015.

Respondent 3: The  economy  has performed much  as I had  expected,  and  my  forecast revisions  are small.

Respondent 4: The data released since the September  SEP  have  provided  mixed  signals about the economic  outlook. Consequently,  the  changes  to  our  medium-term  forecast  have  been  relatively modest  on  net.

Over  the  near  term,  the  data  indicate  that  real  growth  in  2013H2  will  be  somewhat  higher  than we  anticipated  in  September. Although  some  of  that  higher  growth  has  come  from  the  high  inventory growth  contribution  in 2013Q3,  the  recent consumption  indicators  also  point to stronger real PCE growth in  2013Q4 than we have seen in recent quarters.  However, at this  time we are not taking  much signal from  2013Q4  for  real  PCE  in  future  quarters,  and  have  made  only  minor  upward  revisions  to the  real  PCE  forecast  in  2014-16.

Business fixed investment indicators have been soft generally since September,  and  we have lowered modestly the path  for equipment  expenditures and  nonresidential structures expenditures.  In addition, the housing  indicators  have  continued  to  indicate  a  somewhat  stronger  response  to  higher  mortgage rates than we had  anticipated. Consequently, we have lowered  our projected path  for housing  starts and  residential  investment.

The inflation data this year  have been  lower than we had anticipated: to illustrate, in December 2012, we projected  total  PCE inflation of  1.8%  and  core  PCE inflation of  1.7%  for  2013. We do not have a fully satisfactory explanation  for the persistent miss, but given the weaker  inflation data in other  countries that we have seen, we have taken on board  some possibility that global disinflationary pressures  are  somewhat  greater  than  we  anticipated. Therefore,  even  though  we  still  expect  inflation to move toward the FOMC objective, we now anticipate that the process  will take somewhat longer.

As  we  stated  in  our  answere  to  question  2(b),  our  assessment  of  the  near-term  risks  to  real  GDP growth have shifted back to rough balance (although there is still some downside skew at longer horizons). This shift reflects some  resolution to the fiscal contentions, which includes the recently announced fiscal agreement, as well as a higher probability that headwinds-including those from overseas-may  be  receding  faster  than  anticipated.

Respondent 5: My forecast has changed  only  marginally since September.  My projected unemployment  path  is  slightly  lower  over  the  forecast  horizon,  in  light  of incoming  data  which  have  surprised me to the downside  and  my projection  for inflation is lower this year, in light of incoming data, but little changed  in  the  outyears.

Respondent 6: Inflation has been running  a bit weaker than I  expected,  leading  to a slight downward  revision to my  inflation forecast for 2014. I have lowered my  estimate of the natural rate of

unemployment to  5.8 percent based  on my  view that the  labor  force participation rate is not  likely to show  a  meaningful  increase  for  some  time.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Relative to September, I  now expect unemployment  and  output gaps to  close a touch faster. MyGDPforecast for  2013 is a touch stronger than in September, and the data remain  consistent with a recovery that gains traction over the coming year. Much  of the unexpected third-quarter strength  in the level of economic  activity  was  transitory,  reflecting  unexpectedly  large  accumulation of inventories  which, in turn, contributes  to lower fourth  quarter  growth. The  October  government shutdown  also  contributes  to  weak  fourth-quarter  growth  but,  again,  leaves  little  longer-term  imprint on  the  forecast. Other  data  on  consumer  and  business  spending  have  been  positive  on  net.

In addition,  the  labor  market  has  been  stronger  than  I  had  anticipated. For  example,  the  unemployment rate is running below what I had expected,  leading  me to lower its projected path somewhat and  also  to  trim  my  forecast  for  potential  output  growth.

Finally, incoming  data  on  core  and  overall  prices  have  also led me  to revise down  my  near-term inflation  forecast. Revisions  further  out  are  small,  despite  narrower  output  and  unemployment  gaps, reflecting  a  reassessment  downward  of  underlying  inflation  pressures.

Respondent 9: On  net,  the  economy  looks  to  be  entering  2014  with  more  momentum  than  I  had been  anticipating: GDP  growth  in  2013  looks  to  be  slightly  stronger  and  the  labor  market  recovery is further  along  than  I  had  previously  anticipated. As  a result,  I have  revised  up  my  growth  outlook, and I have  made yet  another modest downward  revision to my  unemployment  forecast. Despite these improvements  in  the real economy, broad inflation readings have continued their subdued  pattern, and  energy prices are lower than I had anticipated. Over  time, an improving  economy, a healing labor market, and stable inflation expectations will help pull inflation up toward  our 2 percent long-run objective. However, I  now  expect  that  it  will  take slightly  longer  to reach  this  objective  than I had previously  expected.

Respondent 10: Our  assumptions  for  appropriate  policy  have  changed  some  since  the  September SEP.  We  pushed  back  the  first  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  from  the  end  of  2015  to  early  2016 and  our  expected  level  for  the  rate  at  the  end  of  2016  is  25  bps  below  our  September  submission. We also  are  assuming  about  $250 billion  more  of  LSAPs  than  in  our previous projection.

Our  forecast  for  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2013  is  about 1 2 / percentage  point  stronger  than  we projected  in the September SEP. Some  of  this revision reflects  the surge  in  inventory  investment  in the third quarter. More  meaningfully, the data in hand for the fourth quarter show larger gains in  employment and  consumer spending then we had been anticipating,  leading  us to  mark-up  to our outlook for household  spending  in  the  near  term. We  have  not  materially  changed  our  projection  for  growth beyond  2013,  however. For  some  time  our  modal  forecasts  for  2013-2016  have  incorporated  sustained improvements  in  labor  markets  and  consumption. We  view  the  recent  good  news  as  diminishing  the downside  risks  to  this  outlook  as  opposed  to  shifting  the  baseline. We  have  treated  the  other  major positive developments since September, namely the apparent de-linking of  market  expectations  for the paths  for the LSAP  and  the  fed  funds  rate  and  the  recent  federal  budget  deal, in a similar fashion. Accordingly,  our  balance  of  risks  for  growth  in  2b  above  have  shifted  from  'weighted  to  the  downside' to  'broadly  in  balance.'

The unemployment  rate has declined somewhat  more than we anticipated in September.  However, the gap  between  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  its underlying  trend  has  surprised  us  on  the downside,  suggesting  an  extra  margin  of  slack  in  labor  markets.

On the inflation front, we have been surprised by  the softness in  core  consumer prices. In September, we  had  expected  core  PCE  inflation  to  be  somewhat  above  1-1/2  percent  in  2013:H2;  today,  we

are looking for a rate of about 1-1/4 percent. Our inflation projection is a  touch lower (0.1 percentage point per year)  through the remainder of the projection period. As a result, we still have  PCE inflation rising to 1.8 percent by 2016. However,  we  feel less confident about  the forecast than we did in September. We had  expected that  our  accommodative policies  would  exert  more of  an upward pull on  inflation  than  we  apparently  have  seen  to  date,  which  leaves  us  with  more  doubt  about  their ability  to bring  inflation  up  in  line  with  our  forecast.

Respondent 11: Changes to the outlook since October are minor. The unemployment  rate is on a lower trajectory than previously forecast, but we interpret some of the recent decline in the unemployment  rate  as temporary. As a result, by the end of the forecast horizon the level of the unemployment rate remains  close to  level projected in October.

Respondent 12: no  material  changes;  slightly  higher  growth  for  2014,  but  still  below  Baseline.

Respondent 13: My  forecast  is  little  changed,  other  than  taking  into  account  the  reduction  in  the unemployment  rate  since  the  last  round.

Respondent 14: The  contours  of my  forecast have not significantly changed  since the last SEP. Given  incoming  data,  I  have  increased  by  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2013. I have  also  reduced my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  in  2013  and  carried  that  reduction  into  2014.

Respondent 15: Labor  market  conditions have improved  faster than expected, partly reflecting revised data. Household  balance sheets look stronger with ongoing increases in equity and house values,  and  labor  income  is  growing  faster  than  thought. Presumably  as  a  result,  consumption  growth has picked up from  Q3  by more  than  I expected. Residential  construction, on the other hand, has apparently  been  hurt  more  by  higher  (but  still  low)  mortgage  rates  and  the  overall  decline  in  affordability than I expected. Longer-term  interest rates have risen somewhat. I have not changed  my growth  forecast much  but I have a bit more  confidence in a moderate  2014  pickup. I lowered my unemployment projections and  my  natural rate estimate to reflect  more rapid than expected declines in unemployment.

Inflation  readings  have  been  moderately  lower  than  expected,  for  reasons  that  are  partly  idiosyncratic  (e.g., medical  care  prices)  but  partly  unexplained. I lowered  my  inflation  forecasts  slightly.

Respondent 16: There has been  little change in my forecast, except that I have lowered my  estimate of the  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation.

Respondent 17: See  answer  to  4(a)

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: The  key  differences  are: 1) the  Tealbook  has  more  rapid  growth  in  2015  and  2016 than  I  forecast;  2)  the  Tealbook  has  a  much  lower  natural  rate  of  unemployment  than  I  forecast;  and 3) the Tealbook forecasts a  monotonic  convergence of inflation to the FOMC's  target, while I project a temporary  overshooting.

Respondent 2: My  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  projections  are  essentially  the  same  as the Tealbook for  2013 and  2014. My growth projection tracks 1 2 / percentage point under  the Tealbook in 2015  and  2016. This is a difference in perception about the pace of growth  for potential GDP, not an important  disagreement  about  the  cyclical  dynamics  of  the  recovery. My  inflation  forecast  is, on average, 1 4 / percentage  point  higher  than  the  Tealbook  in  2015  and  2016.

Respondent 3: I see a somewhat  faster  rise in inflation than is called for in the Tealbook. The higher inflation combines with an assumed  normalization of the natural real interest rate (due to balance-sheet  repair, greater  confidence in growth prospects,  and the  easing of fiscal  and regulatory drags),  to  produce  a  more  rapid  increase  in  the  funds  rate  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook  baseline forecast.

Respondent 4: Our forecast for real GDP growth in  2014-15 is modestly below that of the Tealbook, but  those  differences  are  not  particularly  significant. More  substantively,  the  composition  of  growth differs between the two forecasts. The Tealbook projects higher  consumption  growth  than  in our forecast;  the  difference  appears  to  reflect  a  stronger  wealth  effect  than  we  have  in  our  forecast. With higher  consumption growth from wealth effects, the Tealbook also projects the saving  rate to decline, while  our  forecast has  the saving  rate  roughly  flat over  the  forecast horizon. The Tealbook projects slower  growth  in  business  fixed  investment  in  2015  than  in  our  forecast;  the  reason  for  this  difference appears to be that the Tealbook has a  more moderate pace of business output growth than we have.  In contrast,  the  Tealbook  forecasts  stronger  growth  in  residential  investment,  as  it  assumes  that  stronger income  growth  and  higher  confidence  will  overcome  higher  mortgage  rates  to  a  greater  extent  than  we assume. The  Tealbook  also  has  a  higher  net  export  contribution  in  2015: the differences  are  largely in imports,  which  probably  reflects  a  higher  income  elasticity  for  that  year  than  that  implied  in  the Tealbook  forecast.

For  2016,  real GDP  growth  in  our  projection  is  almost  one  percentage  point  below  the  Tealbook forecast. This  difference  reflects  that  in  our  forecast,  unemployment  is  close  to  the  longer-run  natural rate  at the  end  of  2015  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  a  larger  gap  that  still  needs  to  be  closed.

Although  both  forecasts  have  unemployment  at  its  longer-run  natural  rate  at  the  end  of  2016,  the projected path of the unemployment rate in the Tealbook is somewhat above  our  forecast over  most of the forecast  horizon. The  Tealbook  also  sees  the  labor  force  participation  rate  declining  modestly over the forecast  horizon, whereas  we  anticipate  a  small  increase. In part, these differences  seem  to reflect  somewhat  differing  assessments  of  the  labor  market  flows  and  dynamics  that  would  be  typical for this stage  of  an  expansion.

Although  we  have  marked  down  our  inflation  forecast  modestly,  we  still  see  a  stronger  influence of anchored  inflation  expectations  on  inflation dynamics  than does  the Tealbook. Consequently,  our inflation forecast and  the Tealbook  forecast  are  similar  over  the near term, but beyond  that  we  see total  and  core  inflation  rising  more  quickly  to  near  2%  than  does  the  Tealbook.

On  the real side,  the uncertainty  and  risk  assessments differ between  the Tealbook  and  our projection. We  continue to see uncertainty  around the real GDP  and  unemployment forecasts as higher than

normal whereas the Tealbook sees uncertainty  at near normal levels.  This  assessment  reflects  our view that  the  unusual  nature  of  the  current  expansion  as  well  as  a  policy  environment  that  is  constrained by  the  effective  lower  bound  leaves  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  normal  levels  (even  the  more elevated normal  levels now  associated  with the  20-year  window of  forecast  errors). Over the near  term, we  see  the  risks  to  real  activity  as  balanced  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  them  skewed  to  the  downside: the difference seems  to reflect that we place somewhat  more probability  on headwinds receding  faster than  anticipated. Over  the  longer  term,  we  agree  with  the  Tealbook  assessment  of  downside  risks  for real  GDP  growth. Our  views  on  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment  for  inflation  are  similar  to  those in the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: My  forecast  calls  for  higher  inflation  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 7: I believe that the  level of GDP is near  its trend,  and that there  will  not be much growth  above  trend. I expect  inflation  to  reach  2  percent  more  quickly  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8: My  forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent 9: My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook. I expect that GDP growth  will pick up  and proceed at above-trend  rates from  2014 through  2016, which  will bring the unemployment  rate down  to  a level near its natural  rate by the end  of 2016  and  pull inflation up toward  our  2 percent long-term  objective.

Respondent 10: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  early  in  2016,  three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of  increase  after  liftoff  is similar. Accordingly,  at  the  end of the projection period our assumed  level of the funds rate is only reaches 1.25 percent. We  also assume  a  slightly  bigger  LSAP  than  the  Tealbook.

While  our  outlook  for  GDP  growth  is  close  to  the  Tealbook's,  we  assume  a  slightly  faster  pace  of growth  for potential  output over the projection period. This  leaves us  with  an  output  gap of about 1 percent by  the  end  of  the projection period  and  an unemployment rate  that  is  about 1 2 / percentage point  above  the  NAIRU.

Respondent 11: The two forecasts are similar both in terms of real  activity  and inflation. However, our forecast is conditioned on greater monetary policy stimulus, as the federal funds rate is not expected  to  increase  until  the  beginning  of  2016.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: They are quite similar through  2015, especially  with respect to the unemployment rate. I have GDP  growth  a  touch  slower, implicitly because I  am  just a bit more pessimistic  with respect  to productivity  growth. By  2016,  my  unemployment  forecast  lies  somewhat  above  that  in  the Tealbook,  as  I  have  in  mind  a  higher  value  of  the  natural  rate. So  once  unemployment  gets  down  into the  6.0  to 5.8 range,  I  see futher  progress  as  potentially  coming  more  slowly.

Respondent 14: The  key  difference between  my  forecast  and  Tealbook  is  that  I do not see consumption  growth  as  high  as  in  Tealbook. As  a result,  I see slower  economic  growth  over  the  forecast horizon (but still above trend) and, therefore, a slightly higher unemployment  rate. I also expect inflation  to  rise  more  quickly  than  Tealbook  and  will  average  2  percent  in  2015  and  2016.

Respondent 15: I moved  my  natural  rate  estimate  toward  that  of  the  TB  and  lowered  my long-run funds  rate.

My  forecast  is similar to the Tealbook  but  slightly  more  pessimistic  on  both  growth  and  unemployment. We  have  yet  to see a marked  pickup  so  headwinds  must  still  be  operative. Housing  may be  less  of a driver  than  hoped. Also,  financial  conditions  may  be  a  little  tighter  going  forward. I have inflation moving  toward 2.0 just a  little  more quickly than the TB, but recent data are pushing  me in the  TB's  direction.

Respondent 16: I see appropriate  monetary  policy  as  being  more  accommodative  than  the  TB's assumed policy  stance. As  a  result,  I'm  forecasting  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  more  rapidly than  does  the  TB  and  the  inflation  rate  will  rise  more  rapidly  (and  to  higher  levels).

Respondent 17: I am  slightly less optimistic  on growth  prospects  for  2015  and  2016, but not so much  as  to  constitute  an  important  difference.
