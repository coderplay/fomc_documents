Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  December  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  15-16,  2015.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

Convergence  completed  by  end  of  2018.

Respondent 5: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  takes  less than 5 years. Specifically, I expect real GDP  growth  to  slow  to its longer-run rate after 2018 and inflation to rise to close to 2 percent  by  late 2016. The  unemployment  rate  has  already  reached  my estimate  of  its longer-run  level,  and  I  expect  it  will fall below  its longer-run  level  in  2016,  2017,  and 2018,  before  moving  back  to  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Inflation is projected to be 2 percent in 2017, with unemployment  close to its natural  rate.

Respondent 10: We  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  reach  its  longer-run  level  by  mid-2016, and  that it will remain  near  that  level over the rest of the forecast horizon. However,  our  scenario analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate that  there  is  some  probability  of  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  our  point  estimate  of  its  longerrun  normal  level  at  some  time  over  the  forecast  horizon.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective. Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  resource  gap  anticipated to dissipate over the forecast horizon, we expect inflation as measured  by the PCE  deflator (on a quarterly  basis)  to  be  about  2%  by  the  end  of  2017.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  at  the  end  of  2017. Accordingly, the  projections  of  the  major  economic  variables  for  2018  are  at  their  longer-run  values.

Respondent 11: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projections  in  about five years.

Respondent 12: I anticipate  that  it  will take  five or six years  to achieve  full  convergence,  for  two reasons. First,  getting  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  2019  will  likely  require  pushing  the  unemployment rate  below  its  longer-run  value  (U*)  for  several  years. Thus,  I  don't  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to settle down  at  U*  until  2021  or  later,  especially  as  it would  be  inappropriate  for  monetary  policy  to tighten  quickly  to  speed  up  the  process,  as  that  would  risk  triggering  a  recession. Second,  I  anticipate that it will be at least five or six years until the headwinds  from  abroad  and  elsewhere  have fully faded,  and  thus  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  settle  in  at  its  longer-run  value.

Respondent 13: Convergence  to full employment  is expected to occur by the end of this year. Convergence to the inflation target is projected to follow later in 2018, as inflation expectations gradually  revert  back  to  2  percent.

Respondent 14: No  comment

Respondent 15: I think  that  unemployment  is  close  to  mandate  consistent  levels  today. I expect inflation  to  reach  such  levels  in  2017  or  2018.

Respondent 16: I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  sustainable  level  early  this year,  and  then  fall  below  that  level. In 2017,  with  the  labor  market  tight,  and  the  restraining  eff ects of oil-price declines and a stronger dollar having waned, I expect inflation to reach our 2 percent longer-run  objective. In the absence  of new  shocks,  the  unemployment  rate  eventually  converges  to its longer-run  sustainable  level  from  below,  and  the  inflation  rate  converges  to  2  percent  from  above. Full  convergence  is  likely  to  take  5-to-6  years.

Respondent 17: All measures  converge  in  five  or  fewer  years. GDP  growth  will  converge  in  2018, inflation  will  converge  in  2017,  and  unemployment  will  converge  in  2020.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced during  the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 4: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is  similar  to  its  average  level over  the  past  20  years. Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the FOMC's  stated  goal  of 2 percent. Inflation expectations  have  been  well anchored  for the past two decades,  so  I  see  the  magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  outlook  as  broadly  similar  to past  levels.

Respondent 10: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors  over  the  last  20  years. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are  roughly  the  same  as  in  our  December SEP  submission. The  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  remain  wider  than  the  SEP standard, as was the case in December;  the  extraordinary  economic  and  financial  environment, including  the  prospective  policy  divergence  across  advanced  economies,  point  to  significant  uncertainty about the real activity outlook. The forecast intervals for core PCE  inflation still appear broadly consistent  with  the  SEP  standard,  taking  rough  account  of  the  diff erences  between  forecast  errors  for overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: We  regard  to growth,  there  is a downside  risk  that structural  issues in emerging market  economies  will  continue  to  trigger  recurrent  'risk-off '  episodes  in  financial  markets,  with  negative consequences  for domestic  credit conditions, household  and  business  sentiment, and domestic spending. On  the  upside,  the  solid  labor  market  and  continued  low  energy  prices  could  lead  to  some stronger  household  spending  than  we  are  expecting,  with  attendant  spillovers  to  other  components  of domestic  demand.  However,  we  do  not  see  these  upside  developments  being  as  likely  or  as  potentially powerful  as  the  downside  risks  to  the  outlook. Accordingly,  we  see  the  balance  of  risks  to the GDP forecast  as  tilted  to  the  downside  and  those  to  unemployment  rate  projection  as  tilted  to  the  upside.

The  incoming  price data caused us to raise our forecasts for core inflation a tenth this year to 1.6 percent;  we  then  see  inflation  slowly  rising  to near  target  by  the end  of the forecast  period. We feel the  risks to our  inflation  forecast  are  tilted  to  the  downside. We  built  some  persistence  from  the recent  higher  readings  on  core  inflation  into  our  forecast,  but  we  recognize  a  strong  case  can  be  made for the Tealbook's  view  that  the bump  up  in  inflation will prove to be transitory. In addition, the persistently low readings on inflation breakevens  and  downward  drift  in some  surveys  suggest that longer-run  inflation  expectations  may  have  already  slipped  below  our  inflation  target;  at  a  minimum, they  point  to  fragility  in  inflation  expectations. Any  meaningful  reduction  in  expectations  would  make it all that  more  difficult  to  reach  our  inflation  target.

Respondent 2: Weak  global  growth  (despite  extraordinary  monetary  accommodation  in  many  important global economies) threatens U.S. growth both directly via lower demand  for exports and indirectly, by increasing the likelihood of further dollar appreciation and further bouts of financial market  volatility  and  aversion  to  risk. In addition,  the  tools  available  for  monetary  and  fiscal  policy to address  any  adverse  shocks  are  more  constrained  now  than  in  the  past. Persistently  low  inflation has  increased  the  risks  of  a  decline  in  inflation  expectations  (as  shown  by  declines  in  household  survey measures  of  inflation expectations  and  by  very  low  readings  on  inflation  compensation)  and, hence, tilts the  risks  to inflation  to  the  downside.

Respondent 3: Risks  for output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  eff ective lower bound  limits the ability of monetary  policy  to respond  to adverse shocks. The  strong dollar and  the  possibility  that  inflation  expectations  have  drifted  down  present  additional  downside  risks  for inflation. For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a  countervailing  risk  that  it  will  continue  to  fall  more rapidly  than  expected  for  a  given  path  of  output,  as  it  has  over  the  past  several  years;  therefore  I  see the  risks  to unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 4: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. GDP  over  the  past  year  has grown  faster  than  potential,  and  we  have  reached  our  objective  of  maximum  sustainable  employment according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures. Fiscal  policy  is  set  to  be  accommodative  in  the  near term  and,  despite  recent  financial  market  volatility,  consumer  spending  remains  on  track  for  moderate growth  this  year. There  are  upside  risks  to  consumer  and  housing  expenditure.

That  said,  with  foreign  economies  continuing  to  experience  weak  growth,  there  is  risk  of  a  deterioration  in  the  foreign  outlook.

Although  the  eff ective  lower  bound  constrains  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks,  this  constraint  is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target funds  rate  over  the  next  two  years.

Inflation risks are also balanced. Although  some  disinflationary  pressures  from  abroad  continue, the labor market  continues  to  strengthen,  increasing  the  likelihood  of  wage  pressures  mounting  and feeding  through  to  higher  inflation.

Respondent 5: In this projection I have moved down my estimates of longer run growth, the unemployment  rate, and the fed funds rate, each by 25 basis points. I have also made a small downward  adjustment  to  my  growth  forecast  for  2016  to  incorporate  some  of  the  weakness  seen  at  the end  of  last  year  and  early  this  year. Notwithstanding  recent  market  volatility,  I  view  the  risks  around my  projections  as  broadly  balanced.

Recent  financial  market  volatility  poses  a  downside  risk,  although  some  of  the  recent  tightening  in credit  conditions  seen  at  the  start  of  the  year  has  already  begun  to  subside. If volatility  were  sustained and  intensified  it  could  lead  to  a  sustained  pullback  in  risk  appetites  among  investors,  businesses,  and consumers,  but  so  far  we  have  not  seen  this.

Moves  by  several  foreign  central  banks  to  increase  monetary  accommodation  to  stimulate  growth and inflation reduce risks to global growth  but may  increase upward  pressure  on the dollar to the extent  the  magnitudes  of  the  actions  were  not  fully  anticipated. If the dollar  appreciated  more  than anticipated  it  would  pose  further  downside  risk  on  firms  exposed  to  the  trade  sector.

Low  oil  and  gasoline  prices  are  a  positive  for  household  and  business  spending  outside  of  the  energy sector. However,  they  pose  a  challenge  for  firms  in  that  sector.

The  labor  market  continues  to  improve. Recent  payroll  growth  has  been  somewhat  stronger  than I anticipated  and  this,  alongside  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  could  mean  faster  spending growth  than  I've  incorporated  into  my  growth  outlook.

Inflation  risks  are  balanced. Oil  prices  and  the  value  of  the  dollar  have  stabilized  since  mid-January and  if that continues  the downward  pressure  on  inflation  from  these  factors  will abate. The  recent core inflation numbers  have  been  higher  and  I  view  inflation  expectations  as  being  relatively  stable, with  recent  moves  being  quite  small. Should  inflation  expectations  show  a  more  significant  downward move, this would  pose a downside  risk to my  inflation projection. On  the other hand, too slow a withdrawal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  and  faster  than  expected  growth  have  the  potential  to create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium  run.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  and  I  expect  them to remain  so  as  we  gradually  normalize  interest  rates. As  normalization  continues  and  interest  rates rise, I would  expect  some  further  bouts  of  volatility  in  financial  markets  but  I  do  not  anticipate  they will be  significant  enough  to  materially  change  the  outlook.

Respondent 10: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  diff erence  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Given  the  continued  fragility  in  domestic and  foreign  financial  conditions  and  weakness  in  the  foreign  economic  outlook,  we  see  the  risks  to  real activity  and  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  downside. The  near-term  inflation  risks  are  fairly  balanced; however, the low levels of market-based  longer-term inflation compensation  in the U.S. and many advanced  foreign  economies,  of  survey  measures  of  longer-term  household  inflation  expectations,  and of various measures  of underlying  inflation as well as the general decline in commodity  and  import prices over the past several months  indicate  significant downside  risks in the medium  term. Many

of these factors also contribute  to our downside  risk assessment  for real activity. In addition, even though  the  immediate  outlook  in  a  number  of  emerging  market  economies,  most  prominently  China, has  stabilized  somewhat,  we  still  see  a  number  of  latent  risks  in  the  EMEs  that  could  weigh  on  U.S. real  activity  more  than  anticipated  in  the  modal  forecast. Other  downside  risks  include  the  continuing constraints that monetary  policy faces at or near the eff ective lower bound  in a number  of major economies. One  countervailing  factor  to  these  downside  risks  is  the  possibility  that  the  economy  has greater  underlying  strength  than  anticipated  in  our  projection,  which  is  consistent  with  the  continued improvement  in  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 11: The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  at  a  more  rapid  rate  than  expected  given  relatively  modest  real  GDP  growth. I am  anticipating  a  continued  decline  in  the  labor  force  participation rate,  though  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  the  path  and  the  implied  growth  of  the  labor  force. I see a risk  that  the  unemployment  rate  falls  further  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  average. Inflation expectations  appear  to  be  moving  down  slightly,  which  raises  the  risk  of  a  timely  return  to  our  target.

Respondent 12: Recent  global economic  and  financial  developments,  which  have  been  turbulent at times  since  the start of the year, indicate  to me  that  the  downside  risks  from  abroad  to  the  U.S. economy  are  greater  than  they  appeared  in  December. In addition, low readings  for both  inflation compensation  and  some  (albeit  not  all)  survey  measures  of  expected  long-run  inflation  have  increased my  concern  that  'true'  long-run  inflation  expectations  may  be  beginning  to  slip. Accordingly,  I  see the  risks  to both  real  activity  and  inflation  as  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 13: Recent  core  inflation  readings  have  been  higher  than  expected. While  this  may signal that risks to the inflation outlook are becoming more balanced, additional data is needed before  changing  our  assessment  of  the  risks  weighting  around  the  inflation  projection. So  far, upside surprises  have  not  been  particularly  broad  based,  and  in  the  recent  past  surprises  in  the  early  part  of the  calendar  year  have  proven  transitory.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

ffer Respondent 1: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  25  bps  two  times in 2016. This  is the same  path  as  in  our  December  projection. In terms  of  data  dependence,  we  feel any  incentive  to  raise  rates  from  the  upside  surprise  to  inflation  is  counteracted  by  the  unanticipated tightening  in broader  financial conditions  that  has occurred  since  the December  SEP.  Furthermore, given  the  considerable  uncertainty  and  downside  risks  emanating  from  international  economic  conditions, a risk management  approach  to  policy  continues  to  argue  in  favor of normalizing  rates  quite slowly in order to provide  an extra boost  to aggregate  demand  as  a  bu against future downside shocks. A  very  gradual  path  of  rate  increases  also  is  needed  to  help  buoy  inflation  expectations,  which, despite  the  recent  higher  readings  on  actual  inflation,  appear  fragile  and  could  be  slipping  lower. In our  view,  the  appropriate  policy  path  should  provide  a  strong  signal  of  our  commitment  to  a  symmetric 2 percent  inflation  target;  importantly,  it  should  show  the  Committee's  willingness  to  accept  more risk of a modest  over-running  of  target  to  insure  against  the  inflation  path  becoming  stuck  below  2 percent.

We  assume  such  communication  will  be  successful,  and  that  by  the  turn  of  this  year  higher  inflation readings  will  be  more  solidly  entrenched  in  the  data  and  that  inflation  breakevens  and  survey  measures of inflation expectations  will have firmed. Our  baseline forecast also has economic  growth  running moderately  above  trend, which, if it occurs, will give us more  confidence  that the equilibrium  real interest rate is moving  up  as  well. Under  this  scenario,  we  think  it will be appropriate  to  move  the pace of rate increases up to about  100 bps per year in 2017 and 2018, putting the funds rate at 3 percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 2: Two  factors are particularly important. First, the neutral federal funds rate is currently  quite  low  relative  to  historical  levels. As  this rate is likely to increase  only  gradually  going forward, policy must also adjust very gradually so as not to remove accommodation  prematurely. Second, the risks to both inflation and real activity are tilted to the downside. As long as these downside  risks  remain  prominent,  policy  should  be  skewed  toward  ensuring  the  continued  strength  of economy  and  the  return  of  inflation  toward  our  2  percent  target.

Respondent 3: The  labor  market,  as  measured  by  the  unemployment  rate,  is  nearly  back  to  normal. But  secondary  measures  of  slack,  such  as  the  fraction  of  the  labor  force  working  part  time  for  economic reasons, remain  elevated,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. In addition,  the neutral  federal  funds

rate  is  expected  to  rise  from  its  currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several  years. As  a result,  it is appropriate  to  raise  interest  rates  gradually.

Respondent 4: The  labor  market  is  essentially  at  full employment  according  to  various  measures of slack. On  inflation,  transitory  factors  are  significantly  damping  current  inflation  readings  but  there seems  to have  been  a firming  in underlying  price  pressures. I expect  inflation gradually  to rise and reach our 2 percent objective in 2018. Underpinning  this path is my view that the economy  will continue  to  improve  and  transitory  eff ects  from  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices  will  dissipate. My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for the  zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits of continuing  unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest. My  view is based on the following: The economy  continues to face headwinds in 2016, including constraints  on  credit  availability  for  some  borrowers,  weak  growth  abroad,  and  ongoing  eff ects  of  the recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar. These  continue  to  depress  the  shorter-term  equilibrium  real  interest rate  relative  to  its long-run  value.

Respondent 5: In this projection I have moved down my estimates of longer run growth, the unemployment  rate,  and  the  fed  funds  rate, each by 25 basis points, and have slightly lowered  my growth  forecast  to  reflect  the  weaker  growth  seen  at  the  end  of  2015  and  beginning  of  2016.

The  trajectory of my  forecast and the associated appropriate  policy path remains  basically the same. I project that growth  will be slightly above my  estimate of the longer run trend. I believe that the economy is basically at our goal of full employment  and that while certain measures of underemployment, like the number  of part-time workers who would rather work full-time, remain at higher levels than before the recession, I believe that targeted programs  rather than monetary policy would  be more  eff ective in addressing  those issues. I expect growth  to be strong enough  to lead to further  gains in employment  and  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate. In this scenario, labor compensation  measures  will  eventually  firm,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures across a range  of skill groups. I expect  the  eff ects on inflation of previous  declines  in oil prices and the  strengthening  of  the  dollar  to  fade  over  time. Reasonably  stable  inflation  expectations,  solid  labor market  readings,  an  uptick  in  recent  inflation  readings,  and  my  forecast  of  ongoing  economic  growth make  me  reasonably  confident  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  medium run. I project  this  to  be  by  the  end  of  2017.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should  reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Given  the  outlook, I believe it will be appropriate  for the FOMC  to  move  rates  up  gradually  throughout  the forecast horizon,  with  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  2018  near,  but  not  necessarily  equal  to,  its  longerrun  level,  which  I  now  view  as  3.25  percent. Forestalling  rate  increases  for  too  long  in  light  of  financial market  volatility  has  the  potential  to  require  sharper  rate  increases  in  the  future,  which  would  beget further  volatility.

Respondent 6: At  least so long as growth  remains  no  better  than  slightly  above  trend  and  inflation is not fairly convincingly moving  towards  2%, the dominant  consideration  in determining  the appropriate  path  of  monetary  policy  is  the  asymmetric  nature  of  the  Committee's  range  of  policy  instruments. The  nearly  certain  need  for  resort  to  unconventional  policy  instruments  in  the  event  that an  adverse  shock  were  to  threaten  the  continued  moderate  expansion  argues  strongly  for  maintaining accommodative  policies  so  as  to  increase  -  even  if  only  moderately  -  the  strength  of  that  expansion and, thereby, to increase  the economy's  resilience  to  such  a shock. With  a  global environment  that is still somewhat  disinflationary,  with  many  more  downside  than  upside  risks  to  growth  abroad,  with

extremely  accommodative  monetary  policies  in  most  other  mature  economies,  and  with  the  resulting continued  strength  of  the  dollar,  caution  in  moving  forward  with  further  rate  increases  is  warranted.

Respondent 7: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment rate to be below  its longer-run  level  and  inflation  close to two  percent  by  late 2016. Yet I view  the appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2016  and 2017. In my  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate  promotes  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 8: I believe  the  economy  is  stronger  than  statement  B  implies.

Respondent 9: With  the federal funds rate currently so far below  benchmark  values  implied  by policy rule formulas that embody  our past behavior, even allowing for plausible time-variation in intercept terms, it would be unacceptably  risky to leave the funds rate unchanged  with the labor market  at  full  employment,  real  activity  continuing  to  advance  and  inflation  rising. In order  to  being normalizing  our  balance  sheet  as  soon  as  possible,  we  should  end  reinvestments  in  the  very  near  future.

Respondent 10: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy are the current  state of the economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks around  the  central  outlook. The  pace  of  normalization  also  will  depend  upon  the  response  of  overall financial  conditions  to  our  policy  actions. As  such,  we  believe  it  is  important  to  communicate  clearly to the  public  that  these  factors  will  dictate  the  path  of  the  policy  stance.

Currently, the still-low levels of inflation and longer-term  inflation compensation,  the  continued significant uncertainty  surrounding  both  the  real  activity  and  inflation  outlooks, the downside  risks to those  outlooks,  and  the  lower  projected  path  of  the  short-term  neutral  rate  (r*)  all  point  to  a  more gradual  pace  of  normalization  than  was  our  assessment  in  December. A  further  consideration  is  that the tightening of financial conditions  since December  requires  a  flatter policy path. Therefore, our current  projection  of  the  appropriate  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2016,  2017,  and 2018 at 3 4 / -1%, 1 1 2 / -1 3 4 / %, and 2 1 4 / -2 1 2 / %  respectively; the projected  ranges  for 2017 and 2018  are  25  and  50bps  respectively  below  the  corresponding  ranges  in  our  December  submission. We thus  do  not  expect  that  the  FFR  will  reach  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate  until  after  2018. We  believe that this gradual path is necessary  to provide insurance  against the various restraining forces  still faced  by  the  U.S.  economy  (including  those  stemming  from  global  economic  and  financial developments)  as  well  as  uncertainty  about  r*. Our  modal  forecast  has  the  unemployment  rate  falling to our  4 3 4 / %  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate  by  mid-2016,  although  there  is  some  probability that  it could  fall  further  below  the  longer-run  rate,  which  would  provide  additional  insurance  against the  risk  of being  caught  in  a  low  inflation  trap.

Another factor informing our assessment of the appropriate policy path is our estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  over  the  longer  run,  which  we  maintain  in  the  range  of 1 2 / - 3% that  we  had  in  December: this  range  is  modestly  below  our  assessment  of  1%  - 3%  for  'normal  times.' Adding  the  objective  for inflation (2%)  then  gives our estimated  range  for the nominal  equilibrium rate as 2 1 2 / -5%. We  assess  that  the equilibrium  rate  is likely to be in the lower  half of the latter range,  leading  to  our  point  estimate  of  3 1 4 / %,  as  seen  in  the  response  to  question  3(a).

We  assume  that  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that  the exit  from  the  eff ective  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed to be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  sometime  in  2017.

Respondent 11: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  reflects  my  view that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than  has  been  typical  in  past  liftoff  scenarios  given

low  productivity  growth,  declining  labor  force  participation,  and  inflation  that  has  been  running  below target  for  some  time.

Respondent 12: Several  factors  continue  to  inform  my  judgment  that,  given  the  conditions  of  my baseline  forecast,  the  federal  funds  rate  should  rise  only  gradually  and  remain  well  below  its  longer-run value for a number  of  years. First, monetary  policy  needs  to  remain  accommodative  for  some  time longer in order to promote  further  labor market  improvement,  which  is  desirable  not only because some  slack  still  remains  but  also  to  speed  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation. Second,  the  neutral  federal funds  rate-the  rate  consistent  with  the  economy  expanding  at  its  potential  rate  when  it  is  near  full employment-is  quite  low  at  the  moment  but  I  anticipate  that  it  will  rise  over  time  as  various  headwinds, both  foreign  and  domestic,  slowly  fade. And  third,  given  that  our  ability  to  provide  accommodation in the  event  of  a  downturn  is  currently  so  much  less  than  our  ability  to  tighten  should  conditions  turn out  to unexpectedly  strong,  it  is  appropriate  to  proceed  cautiously  when  tightening. (Note-although I have not altered my  estimate of the longer-run value of the federal funds rate this round, I now anticipate  that  convergence  to  that  rate  will  take  longer  because  headwinds  will  be  slower  to  lift.)

Respondent 13: We  have  revised  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds rate down,  from  3.50  to  3.25  percent. The  revision  has  been  driven  by  the  observation  that  current estimates  of  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest  continue  to  remain  at  very  low  levels.

Respondent 14: I lowered  my  federal  funds  rate  projection  for  the  end  of  2016  by  25  basis  points to 1.13  percent,  as  I  feel  some  further  caution  is  warranted  in  light  of  the  uncertain  implications  from earlier  financial  market  volatility.

My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  beyond  2016  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a gradual  rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  rate  (r*).

Respondent 15: My  forecast  is for 2 rate increases in 2016, 3 in 2017, and  4 in 2018. My  view is that a rate path that is lower than that in the Teal Book  will be necessary  to support  the U.S. economy  through  an  extended  period  of  slow  global  growth.

Respondent 16: Our  policy  goals  are  the  same  as  in  December: reaching  full-employment  with  the expectation  of  an  unemployment  rate  that  ultimately  begins  to  level  off ,  and  the  reasonable  expectation that  inflation  will  reach  our  2-percent  longer-run  objective  within  the  next  couple  of  years.

What's  diff erent  now? The  dollar  is stronger. Oil is lower. Other  countries  have  cut  policy  rates or  are  expected  to  do  so. The  10  year  treasury  rate  has  declined,  so  that  the  yield  curve  has  flattened. Credit  spreads  have  widened  and  stock  prices  are  down. The  outlook  for  the  foreign economies  has marginally  deteriorated. China's  ability  to  manage  its  multiple  challenges  has  been  called  into  some question--particularly  its  ability  to  manage  currency  fluctuations  in  an  orderly  manner.

The  implication  of all of these developments  is  that financial conditions  are tighter and  the appropriate path for the funds rate has likely flattened. That keeps us closer to the zero bound  for longer. Downside  risks  to  the  outlook  may,  therefore,  have  increased-especially  since  there  is  very  low likelihood  of  fiscal  stimulus,  particularly  in  this  election  year.

On  the  other  hand,  labor-market  slack  has  diminished  over  the  past  three  months,  and  inflation  has moved  upward.  If  international  uncertainties  and  commodity-market  turmoil  were  to  suddenly  abate, we  could  find  ourselves  very  quickly  overshooting  our  full-employment  and  price-stability  objectives. I view the risk of this sort of positive demand  shock  as  somewhat  less  likely; I think international weakness  and  uncertainties  will  be  with  us  for  an  extended  period  of  time.

We  are  now  very  near  full  employment  and  price  stability,  but  haven't  put  much  distance  between ourselves  and  the  zero  bound. There  is  an  elevated  risk  of  error  on  both  sides--although  I  assess  the risks  here  as  weighted  marginally  to  the  downside.

I've  assumed  a  slower  path  of  funds-rate  increases,  reflecting  my  view  of  the  fragility  of  the  current recovery  in  light  of slowing  global  growth  and  the  risk  of  a  further  tightening  in  financial  conditions. I see the  risks  of a much  flatter  yield  curve  as  significant  if  we  raise  rates  too  quickly.

The  pace  of  rate  increases  picks  up  in  2017  as  we  seek  to  limit  overshoot  of  our  employment  and inflation objectives. I've again  shifted my  estimate  of  the longer-run  normal  policy  rate  downward-now  to  3.25  percent-based  on  my  sense  that  longer-run  real  growth  prospects  have  been  adversely aff ected  by  aging  demographics  in  developed  countries,  high  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  in  these  countries, and  sluggish  trend  productivity  growth. In this context,  I  believe  that  global  demand  for  safe  assets will remain  elevated  for  some  extended  period  of  time.

Respondent 17: The  key  factors informing  my  judgments  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  likely  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  combined  with  a  forecast  of inflation  converging  to  2%  in  2017.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  improved  household  and business  balance  sheets,  and  continued  low  energy  prices  should  allow  for  solid  consumer-led  growth in domestic  demand. Indeed,  we  would  be  expecting  more  of  a  cyclical  pop  in the near term  if not for the  more  restrictive  financial  conditions  that  have  developed  since  December. With  appropriately accommodative  policy,  these  financial  factors  should  not  leave  a  lasting  imprint  on  growth  beyond  the near  term. In addition,  we  assume  little  change  in  the  dollar  going  forward,  and  so  project  that  the drag  from  net  exports  will  wane  later  in  the  projection  period.

The  factors  supporting  activity  are  sufficient  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over the next  3 years. We  assume  that  resource  gaps  will  be  closed  in  2017; although  the  unemployment rate  has  already  reached  our  estimate  of  the  current  natural  rate,  we  think  it  will  take  a  bit  longer  to close the gaps  we  still see remaining  in  some  other  labor  market  indicators. We  expect  demographic forces  will  lower  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  to  4.8  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period. (We  also  note  that  these  demographic  factors  will  likely  push  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  down for some time beyond  the end of the current projection period.) We  think growth will be strong enough  to  push  the  actual  unemployment  rate  down  to  4.5  percent  by  the  end  of  2018.

We  believe  that  some  of  the  recent  bump  up  in  core  inflation  will  prove  to  be  transitory;  nonetheless, the data were  somewhat  heartening,  and  better  support  our  projection  that  inflation  will  end  2018 close  to  target. As  it  has  for  some  time,  our  forecast  for  rising  inflation  relies  on  reductions  in  resource slack,  stabilization  of  the  dollar,  some  upward  movement  in  energy  prices,  and,  eventually,  a  lift  from inflationary  expectations. As  noted  above,  we  assume  a  quite  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and that  the  Committee  strongly  communicates  its  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target; we  see these  as necessary  conditions  to  prevent  inflation  expectations  from  deteriorating  to  a  degree that they would  exert  a meaningful  downdraft  on  actual  inflation. Indeed, if inflation expectations become  de-anchored  to  the  down-side,  then  we  do  not  see  upward  force  from  other  factors  as  being adequate  to  bring  inflation  close  to  target  over  the  forecast  period.

As  to  sources  of  uncertainty,  international  developments,  their  influence  on  financial  markets,  and the  spillovers  to  household  and  business  confidence  are  likely  to  cloud  the  forecast  for  growth  for  some time  to  come. With  regard  to  inflation,  in  the  near  term,  the  difficulty  in  extracting  the  signal  from the recent inflation data is an important  source of uncertainty, while over the medium  and  longer term  discerning  the  linkages  between  Fed  policy  (including  communications),  inflation  expectations, and  actual  inflation  are  key  forecast  concerns.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: We  continue  to see gradual  improvement  in  secondary  measures  of  labor  market slack  as job creation  continues  and  labor  force  participation  picks  up. In part  because  room  remains to further reduce slack, inflation continues to run low and it is likely to be several years before it returns  to  target. The  continued  low  level  of  inflation,  the  benefits  to  the  economy  of  allowing  further improvement  in  the  labor  market,  the  elevated  risks  from  financial  markets  and  weakness  in  foreign economies,  and  the  potential  risks  to  the  U.S.  economy  from  international  policy  divergence  all  suggest a gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy.

Respondent 4: The  economy  has  recovered  from  the  severe  housing  collapse  and  financial  crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of  episodes  are  associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate  demand through  a  variety  of  channels,  for  which  policy  has  only  partially  compensated. However,  many  of  the associated  remaining  headwinds  are  easing  and  are  off set  by  important  sources  of  domestic  strength.

- · The  pace  of  housing  construction  starts  has  been  and  continues  to  be  sub-par. However,  given improved  household  balance  sheets and consumer  credit conditions, I expect improvement  in this sector;
- · The  relatively  strong  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year  compared  with  that  of the  rest of the  world,  the  subsequent  monetary  easing  in  Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  the  recent depreciation  of the renminbi  resulted  in a sharp  appreciation  of the dollar. This appreciation has  been  a  drag  on  net  exports  and  GDP  growth.
- · Despite  recent  financial  market  volatility,  consumer  spending  continues  to  grow  at  a  healthy  pace. Ongoing  declines  in  unemployment,  undershooting  its  longer-run  rate,  and  broader  strength  in the  labor  market  should  also  help  to  underpin  solid  consumption  growth  going  forward.

In this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace. Output  and unemployment  gaps  were  essentially  closed  by  the  end  of  2015  and,  with  substantial  monetary  stimulus still at play, I expect  them  to  overshoot  in  the  coming  year,  before  closing  towards  the  end  of  2018. In terms  of  inflation,  the  lagged  eff ects  of  remaining  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets,  combined  with subdued  commodity  and  import  prices,  should  keep  inflation  below  the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation target over the next year and  a half. Well-anchored  inflation  expectations  and  above-trend  growth eventually  pull  inflation  back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 5: The fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including highly accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  sustained  strengthening  in  labor  markets,  and  low  oil  prices. Consistent  with  the  data,  business contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets  and  some  increased  wage  pressures  across  a  range of skill groups  and  occupations. While  global  growth  prospects  remain  subdued,  several  foreign  central banks  have  added  accommodation  to  promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad. Overall,  I expect  growth  to  be  slightly  above  trend  in  the  U.S., which  will  support  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. By  the  end  of  2018,  I  project  that  the  economy  will  essentially  be  at  its  steady state.

Inflation  rates  have  been  gradually  moving  up  as  the  eff ects  of  past  declines  in  oil  and  commodity prices, and  appreciation  of the dollar, work  themselves  through. This path  is consistent  with what the  FOMC  has  been  expecting. In my  judgment,  inflation  expectations  remain  reasonably  anchored. Anchored  inflation  expectations  along  with  an  improving  economy,  and  stabilizing  oil  prices  and  the dollar, are consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to  the  2  percent  longer-run  objective  by  the  end  of 2017. As  the  expansion  continues  and  labor  markets  continue  to  improve,  I  expect  wage  growth  will pick  up  as  well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 6: My  baseline  expectations  have  changed  very  little  over  the  course  of  the  last  several SEPs  -  modestly  above  trend  growth  supported  by  continued  recovery  of  the  labor  market  (though still not  of  wages)  and  generally  improved  household  balance  sheets. I do  regard  risks  to  that  outlook as more  to the downside  than  in  December. (though  a  bit less than  they  appeared  for  a good  part of the  inter-meeting  period)  While  the  January-February  risk-off  volatility  in  markets  has  stabilized, the conditions that gave rise to that volatility -particularly foreign economic  conditions  could  yet produce  another  negative  market  reaction,  one  that  would  have  more  impact  on  the  real  economy.

Respondent 7: My  forecast for real GDP  growth  is  characterized  by above-trend  growth  in the period  from  2016  to  2018. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising  employment and  wages,  past  gains  in  household  wealth,  accommodative  financing  conditions,  and  increased  purchasing  power  from  lower  energy  prices. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  slow  over  time  as  the  economy

operates  at  full  capacity. I see  the  unemployment  gap  as  essentially  closed  after  the  rapid  reduction  in economic  slack  in  the  past  few  years. My  inflation  outlook  projects  a  gradual  rise  in  inflation  reflecting improving  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  eff ects  of  dollar  appreciation  and  lower  energy prices.

I view  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projection  of  PCE  inflation  as  higher  than  levels  of  uncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  reflecting  the  heightened  volatility  in  crude  oil  prices.

I see the risks to economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced. Downside risks for real GDP  growth, stemming from the recent weakness in global economic and financial conditions, are roughly off set by the strength of households' balance sheets, which  presents upside risk for consumer  spending  and  housing  activity. Regarding  inflation risks, while the potential for further dollar appreciation  could  delay  the  projected  increase  in inflation, inflation could  rise faster than  expected  given  the rapid improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  and  the  potential  for  faster growth  in  unit  labor  costs. Risks  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  largely  tied  to  the  continued  growth in aggregate  demand,  the  uncertain  pace  of  productivity  growth,  and  the  trajectory  of  the  labor  force participation  rate.

Respondent 8: The  exchange  rate  response  to  interest  rate  changes  will  be  critical  to  my  interest rate  path  as  events  unfold.

Respondent 9: Real  GDP  per  worker  has  risen  by  somewhat  less  than  1  percent  per  year  over  the last  10  years. I expect  roughly  the  rate  of  growth  through  2018. Population  ages  16  to  64  is  projected to grow  by  0.5  percent  per  year. These  supply-side  factors  suggest  longer-run  growth  in  real  GDP  of 1 3/4  percent. My  projection  for  2016  is  slightly  higher,  reflecting  robust  consumer  spending  growth and  a  pickup  in  investment  spending  later  this  year.

Respondent 10: From  1.9%  (Q4/Q4)  in  2015,  we  expect  growth  to  pick  up  modestly  to  just  over 2%  in 2016. The  firming  in  growth  reflects  an  end  of the current  inventory  correction  by  mid-2016, continued  solid  growth  of  consumer  spending,  some  pickup  in  business  fixed  investment,  and  somewhat stronger  growth  of  federal  spending. These  positive  developments  are  off set  to  a  large  extent  by  further drag  from  net  exports. By  2017  we  expect  growth  to  slow  to  about  1 3 4 / %  due  to  a  combination  of  aging of the  business  cycle  and  gradual  tightening  of  financial  conditions  generated  by  policy  normalization. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  decline  to  4.7%  by  the  end  of  2016  and  then  level  out  at  4.8%our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate-in  2018. This  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  assumes  that the labor force participation rate will be roughly  flat at 62.8%  and  productivity  growth  will  revert to its longer-run  trend. Inflation  moves  gradually  up  to  2%  in  2018  as  slack  continues  to  decline  and the eff ects of previous dollar appreciation subside. Despite the significant financial volatility since December,  the  broad  parameters  of  this  forecast  are  in  line  with  the  December  SEP.

Real consumer  spending  is expected  to grow 2.9%  (Q4/Q4)  in  2016, up from 2.6%  in 2015. A couple  of factors underlie  this projection. First, after tightening  in January,  overall  financial conditions  have  improved  since  mid-February,  making  it  less  likely  that  we  will  see  negative  wealth  eff ects weigh  significantly  on  consumer  spending. Second,  with  the  labor  market  continuing  to  improve,  real disposable  income  growth  is  expected  to  remain  relatively  strong,  helping  to  maintain  solid  real  PCE growth. For 2017, we expect  consumer  spending  to  slow  to  2.2%  as real disposable  income  growth slows and  the consumer  durable  goods  cycle  ages. With  this  consumer  spending  path,  the  personal saving  rate  is  expected  to  be  around  5 1 2 / %  in  2016  and  2017.

We  expect  residential  investment  to  increase  around  10%  in  2016  and  2017,  reflecting  some  tightness in the housing  market  that  is  pushing  rents  and  home  prices  higher. Supporting  housing  starts  is  a higher  pace  of household  formations,  spurred  by  the  ongoing  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  and the  anticipated  easing  in  mortgage  underwriting  standards.

Given our assumptions  for the exchange value of the dollar and for foreign growth, we expect exports to be weak  in 2016 and to begin growing  only at the end of 2016. Along  with the end of the current inventory correction by mid-2016, this development  is expected to result in a gradual improvement  in  manufacturing  output  and  a  rising  capacity  utilization  rate. The  anticipated  rise  in capacity  utilization  should  in  turn  increase  incentives  for  business  investment  in  new  capacity.

However, the net export growth contribution in 2016 is projected to be -1.1 percentage points versus  the  -0.6  percentage  points  of  2015. Growth  of  real  imports  is  expected  to  increase  from  around 3%  in  2015  to  about  6 1 2 / %  in  2016. Recent  import  growth  has  been  weaker  than  expected  despite  the appreciation  of  the  dollar,  possibly  reflecting  the  relatively  elevated  level  of  domestic  inventories. For 2017  we  project  the  net  export  growth  contribution  to  improve  to  -0.7  percentage  points  as  exports begin  to  grow  while  import  growth  slows  modestly.

The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  stabilize  near  our  estimate  of  the  longer-term  normal  rate of 4 3 4 / %  from  mid-2016  through  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon. Monthly  gains  in  nonfarm  payroll employment  are  expected  to  slow  to  around  200,000  in  2016  and  then  to  120,000  in  2017.

With  our  estimate  of  potential  growth  and  NAIRU  unchanged,  our  projections  of  real  growth  and the unemployment  rate  would  imply  that  the path of the output gap is also little changed. With that,  our  models  of  inflation  continue  to  predict  gradual  firming  of  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon. Our  forecast  for  core PCE  inflation  of  1.5%  in  2016  and  1.8%  in  2017  is  little diff erent from  that  in December,  as  we  see  the  recent  firming  of  core  inflation  as  largely  transitory. It remains  to  be  seen  if health  care  inflation  and  goods  prices,  which  have  firmed  recently,  have  truly  turned  the  corner.

Respondent 11: I expect  the  pace  of  output  growth  over  the  medium  term  to  be  somewhat  above my  longer term  trend of 2.2 percent as the headwinds  that  have  been  depressing  growth  recede. I have  lowered  my  estimated  future  path  for  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  labor  force  growth, which  has  led  to  a  slight  downward  revision  to  my  estimate  of  longer-run  growth  and  the  natural  rate of unemployment.  With  a  strong  labor  market  and  declining  participation  rate,  I  anticipate  that  the unemployment  rate  will  edge  down  further  from  its  current  level  of  4.9  percent  even  as  output  growth remains  modest. Headline  inflation has been held down  by  falling energy prices. As energy prices stabilize  and  dollar  appreciation  wanes,  I  anticipate  that  inflation  will  begin  to  rebound  in  2016  and rise toward  the  Committee's  2  percent  target  over  the  remainder  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 12: My  outlook  for  real  activity  assumes  that  increases  in  the  underlying  strength  of the  economy  will  enable  real  GDP  to  grow  at  a  pace  slightly  faster  than  potential  on  average  even  as the federal funds  rate  rises gradually,  thereby  generating  further  improvements  in  the  labor  market. This increasing strength partly reflects a gradual diminution of the drag on net exports from the dollar and  foreign  growth,  continuing  recovery  of  the  housing  market,  somewhat  easier  fiscal  policy, modestly  faster  productivity  growth,  and  a  bottoming  out  of  the  contraction  in  oil  drilling. A  tighter labor  market  (including  a  modest  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment), combined  with  a  fading  of  the  transitory  inflation  eff ects of dollar appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices, should  enable  headline  inflation  to  move  back  to  2  percent  by  2019..

The  key  risk to this forecast is that the headwinds  currently  restraining  real  activity  will  fail to dissipate as rapidly or by as much  as I anticipate; I am  particularly concerned  by  risks emanating from  abroad. I am  also  concerned  that  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation  may  prove  to  be  slower  than I anticipate, reflecting several risks-the potential for further dollar appreciation  and declines in oil prices  if  global  growth  worsens;  the  possibility  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  may  be  starting  to slip; and  the  possibility  that  labor  market  slack  is  somewhat  greater  than  I  estimate.

Respondent 13: The  tightening of financial market  conditions since December  has  been  largely retraced, and  the pace of economic  growth  appears  to  be  roughly  in  line with expectations. Labor market conditions as measured by payroll growth and the unemployment  rate have continued to

improve,  with  the  fall  in the unemployment  rate  being  cushioned  by  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  labor force participation. Private  domestic  final  demand  appears  to  be  growing  well  above  potential  early this  year,  with  consumer  spending  supported  by  high  net  worth  relative  to  disposable  income,  and  by  a decline  in  energy  prices. Past  dollar  appreciation  and  relatively  weak  demand  abroad  are  a  significant off set to the strength in domestic  demand. The  modest  downward  revision  to  the  real outlook for this year  relative  to  the  December  projections  largely  reflects  a  deteriorating  outlook  for  our  trading partners. An  elevated  level  of  corporate  bond  spreads  is  also  expected  to  dampen  growth  in  business fixed  investment.

The projected pace of GDP  growth  should lower the unemployment  rate to 4.7 percent -our estimate of the natural level -over the course of this year. Over  the forecast horizon, the decline in the unemployment  rate  relative  to  the  pace  of  GDP  growth  is  attenuated  by  more  individuals  reentering  the  labor  force. We  continue  to  view  the  share  of  people  not  in  the  labor  force  but  wanting a job as somewhat  elevated  at this stage of the cycle, suggesting that slightly more  slack remains than  what  is  conveyed  by  the  U3  measure. With  the  unemployment  rate  projected  to  stay  close  to  its natural  level, inflation eventually  reaches  2 percent. The  gradual  removal  of  policy  accommodation provides  monetary  policy  with  the  opportunity  to  probe  for  a  lower  equilibrium  real  rate  of  interest than  we  are  currently  assuming. It also provides  room  for  a  faster  but  disciplined  pace  of  tightening should  inflationary  pressures  occur  more  rapidly  than  expected.

The  risks  to the growth  outlook  are  roughly  balanced. On  the  downside,  data  abroad  have  been disappointing  and,  despite  some  improvement  in  financial  conditions,  the  risk  of  a  more  pronounced slowdown  possibly  coupled  with  a  financial  crisis  remains  an  important  concern. The  expected  tightening  of  U.S.  monetary  policy  could  also  entail  a  stronger  dollar  than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning. On  the  upside, the increase in the pace  of growth  of final sales to domestic  purchasers  could  signal a stronger-than-expected  acceleration in activity. Risks to the unemployment  rate  outlook  remain somewhat  tilted  to  the  downside,  even  if  recent  readings  have  been  consistent  with  a  cyclical  rebound in labor  force  participation.

While  January  inflation  numbers  have  surprised  to  the  upside,  we  continue  to  perceive  some  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  for  inflation  beyond  this  year. In particular,  we  see  risks  associated  with  the possibility  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below  the  2  percent  target.

Respondent 14: My  outlook  consists  of  above-trend  growth  over  the  next  several  quarters,  a  further reduction  of  labor  market  slack,  and  inflation  that  gradually  converges  to  target.

Growth  over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  a  sustained  pace  of  consumption  growth  and a strengthening  in  investment  growth. This growth  of domestic  demand  is  supported  by  continued firming in the labor market and of household incomes. Past declines in energy prices provide a modest  boost  to  near-term  consumption  growth. Ongoing  global  weakness  and  past  increases  in  the dollar  exchange  rate  are  moderate  headwinds  in  my  outlook,  continuing  to  restrain  export  growth  and domestic  industrial  activity.

The risks to my growth outlook are weighted modestly to the downside. It appears that the domestic  economy  has  bounced  back  from  a  soft  patch  in  the  fourth  quarter. However,  uncertainty has  increased  somewhat. My  staff  has  collected  survey  evidence  that  indicates  some  businesses'  hiring and  capital  investment  plans  were  aff ected  by  the  recent  bout  of  financial  market  volatility  that  could result in a slower pace of hiring and lower business investment  than  I have marked  in my  baseline forecast. Also,  we  are  still dealing  with  restraints  to  industrial  activity  in  the  form  of  weaker  foreign growth  and  a  strong  dollar  that  could  prove  more  persistent  than  I  currently  expect.

The  risks to my  inflation outlook are tilted to the downside. In the near term, the magnitude of pass-through  from the recent declines in commodity  and  import  prices into core inflation could be greater than I expect. Also, while I assume  longer-run  inflation expectations  are anchored  at a policy-consistent level, it is possible that inflation expectations  are moving  lower  as a result of the prolonged  period  of  below  target  inflation  we've  experienced  during  the  current  expansion.

Respondent 15: My  outlook  calls for continued  2%  growth. Weakness  around  the  globe  means that  U.S.  rates  will  need  to  remain  lower  than  the  Teal  Book  forecast  to  get  inflation  back  to  2%  and provide  adequate  support  for  demand.

Respondent 16: Although  sharp  changes  in  the  relative  price  of  traded  goods  (related  to  weakness in  the  overseas  outlook)  and  in  the  price  of  oil  (mostly  supply  driven),  have  created  challenges  for  some sectors  of the U.S.  economy,  these  challenges  have  so  far  not  substantially  altered  the  trajectories  of aggregate  output  and  employment. Risks  to  the  modal  outlook  are  significant  on  both  sides: Growth could  well be sufficient to cause  us to overshoot  our  objectives; or tightening  financial  conditions  in emerging-market  economies  (particularly  China)  and  other,  secular  trends  could  cause  growth  to  slow. Secular  influences  on  the  outlook  include  aging  demographic  changes  in  the  U.S.  and  other  developed countries,  and  the  impact  of  high  ratios  of  debt  to  GDP  in  these  countries.

Respondent 17: The  absence  of  robust  growth  in  conjunction  with  declining  unemployment  during this  recovery  are  the  key  factors  shaping  my  outlook. Whether  weak  productivity  growth  will  continue is a major  uncertainty  for  my  growth  forecasts. Changes  in  oil  and  commodity  prices  have  made  nearterm  inflation  forecasting  especially  challenging.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: The  data  on  spending  for  late  2015  were  somewhat  weaker  than  we  anticipated  in December,  but  the  early  2016  expenditure  data  have  been  broadly  in  line  with  expectations. The  labor market  has  improved  somewhat  faster  than  we  had  assumed,  while  financial  conditions  are  moderately more  restrictive. Balancing  these  factors, we left our forecast for growth  in 2016 unchanged  at  2.3 percent. Looking  ahead, we lowered our forecast for U.S. GDP  growth  in  2017  and 2018 a touch, reflecting  a  somewhat  lower  assumption  for  potential  output  growth.

The  incoming  data  on  core  inflation  were  above  our  expectations  in  the  December  SEP.  However, inflation  breakevens  have  moved  down  even  further  since  December  and  survey  measures  of  inflation expectations also appear to be faltering on the downside. Energy prices have surprised us to the downside. Putting it all together, we revised our projection for total inflation in 2016 down 0.4 percentage point to 1.2 percent, and raised our core inflation forecast 0.1 percentage point to 1.6 percent. We  left our projections  for  both  total  and  core  inflation  in 2017  and  2018  unchanged  from December.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4: Since December,  I  have  made  few  changes  to  my  forecast. My  forecast  for GDP growth  is  unchanged. Given  slower  than  expected  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  and  labor  force participation  rate in recent months,  I have  raised slightly my  forecast  of the unemployment  rate  at the  end  of  2016,  which  is  now  4.6  percent.

My  near-term  inflation  forecast  is  slightly  lower  owing  to  lagged  eff ects  of  import  and  energy  price declines. My  forecast  for core inflation in 2016  is one-tenth  of a percentage  point  higher, reflecting firming  in  observed  data.

Respondent 5: In this projection I have moved down my estimates of longer run growth, the unemployment  rate,  and  the  fed  funds  rate, each by 25 basis points, and have slightly lowered  my growth forecast to reflect the weaker growth seen at the end of 2015 and beginning of 2016. I've lowered  my  forecast  of  headline  inflation  to  reflect  the  weaker  readings  on  energy  prices  at  the  end  of last year  and  the  beginning  of  this  year.

The  trajectory  of  my  forecast  and  the  associated  appropriate  policy  path  remain  basically  the  same as in December.  My  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  slightly  flatter  to  reflect  the  downward  revision to my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  federal  funds  rate  to  3.25  percent.

Respondent 6: As  explained  above,  not  much  has  changed  in  the  bottom  line  of  my  forecast.

Respondent 7: I have  revised  down  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  and  headline  PCE  inflation in the  first half  of 2016  based  on  the  incoming  spending  and  price  data,  with  no  ramifications  for  the medium-term  projections.  Stronger  than  expected  employment  growth  since  December  has  led  me  to revise  down  my  forecast  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  the  period  from  2016  to  2018.

Respondent 8: I believe  the  resilience  of  the  economy,  as  seen  following  the  Jan  1  - Feb  11  volatility, is greater  than  I  had  previously  assumed;  also  the  unexpected  rise  in  Q1  core  inflation  has  influenced my  2016 forecast but, of course, I had to take account  of current levels of interest rates and asset prices.

Respondent 9: Weakness  in  the fourth quarter of 2015 led me  to reduce my  projection for real GDP  growth  in  2016. Energy  price declines led me to mark  down  my  projection for overall PCE inflation for 2016  as well. A lower projected  path  for real GDP  per  worker  contributed  to  a  higher projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 10: Our  macroeconomic  projections  relative  to  those  of  December  have  changed  somewhat. Real GDP  growth  in  2016-17  is anticipated to be a little lower than in the December  SEP projections, reflecting mostly  the impact  of some  weaker  data  between  the December  and  January FOMC  meetings  as  well  as  the  tightening  of  financial  conditions. Overall  inflation  at  near-term  horizons  is  lower  because  of  the  further  decline  in  oil  prices  since  the  December  FOMC  meeting;  however, core  inflation  and  overall  inflation  projections  at  medium-term  horizons  are  unchanged. As  noted  and explained  in  the  response  to  3(b),  we  judge  that  a  lower  path  of  the  policy  rate  is  necessary  to  support these  projections.

Respondent 11: I have  revised  down  my  estimated  path  for  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and the  unemployment  rate. I have  assumed  that  the  funds  rate  rises  at  a  slightly  more  gradual  pace  than in my  December  projection.

Respondent 12: My forecasts for real activity and inflation are little changed from December despite  weaker  foreign  growth  and  higher  risk  premiums,  because  I  now  assume  that  the  federal  funds rate  will rise less steeply  over  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 13: Changes to the real outlook have been minor, with only a modest downward revision  to  GDP  growth  stemming  from  a  less  favorable  outlook  for  our  trading  partners. The  projected path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  roughly  unchanged. Interest  rates  have  been  lower  than  expected, but  their  impact  on  activity  is  being  off set  by  a  downward  revision  to  the  natural  real  rate  of  interest. Such  a  revision  also  implies  that  the  projected  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  on  a  somewhat  lower trajectory  than  previously  envisioned. The  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 14: I left  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate  and  core  inflation unchanged.

I've lowered  my  headline  PCE  inflation  forecast  for  2016  by  0.1  percentage  points  to  1.5  percent, as oil prices  are  lower  than  what  I  forecasted  in  December.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: While  the  labor  market  and  inflation  have  evolved  consistent  with  my  December projections, GDP  growth  has (again) been sluggish. I've taken CBO  estimates of potential GDP growth  to  heart  and  revised  downward  my  GDP-growth  estimates  over  the  entire  projections  horizon. Again,  my  views  are  shaped  by  the  backdrop  of  secular  concerns  regarding  overcapacity  outside  the U.S., high ratios of debt to GDP, the long-term nature and difficulty of China's transition to a more  service  and  consumer-based  economy,  and  aging  demographics  in  advanced  economies. I have somewhat  hardened  my  view  that  these  issues  will  continue  to  be  transmitted  through  bouts  of  tighter financial  conditions  which  have  the  potential  to  create  negative  headwinds  for  GDP,  unemployment, and  inflation.

Respondent 17: My  forecasts  have  changed  little  since  the  previous  SEP.  I  have  reduced  my  GDP growth  forecast  for  2016  to  reflect  recent  growth  performance.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: We  assume  fewer  increases  in  the  funds  rate  during  2016  than  the  Tealbook  does-our  end-of-2016  rate  is 65 bps  lower. We  incorporate  a  slightly  faster  pace  of increase  in 2017  and 2018,  and  at  the  end  2018  our  funds  rate  is  just  25  bps  lower  than  the  Tealbook's.

Our  projection for GDP  growth  is close to the Tealbook  in 2016 and 2017 and 1/4 percentage point  faster in 2018. However,  our  assumptions  about  potential  output  growth  are  somewhat  above the Tealbook's. We  see the natural rate of unemployment  trending  down  from  5  percent  today  to 4.8 percent by the end of the projection period, in contrast to the Tealbook's constant 5 percent assumption. We  also  think  that  the  gap  today  between  actual  and  trend  labor  force  participation  is somewhat  larger  and  that  it  does  not  close  until  the  unemployment  rate  is  further  below  the  natural rate. Taken  together,  this  means  our  forecast  for  activity  does  not  overshoot  potential  output  to  as great of a degree as in the Tealbook. Nonetheless, our outlook  for inflation is similar. One  reason is that we assume  more  of  the recent increase in core inflation will prove to be persistent than the Tealbook  does. A  second  reason  is  that  we  feel  our  more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will be successful at buoying  inflationary expectations, firming the inflationary attractor, and therefore providing  a  larger  boost  to  actual  inflation.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: My  forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook except  that  I believe the improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  draw  workers  back  into  the  labor force,  leading  to  more  progress  on  the  labor  force  participation  rate  than  the  unemployment  rate. This would  lead  to  less  upward  movement  for  wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the  path assumed  in  the  Tealbook. Removing  monetary  accommodation  more  gradually,  as  in  my  projection, would  produce  a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 4: The Tealbook projects a protracted overshooting of full employment, with the unemployment  rate  declining  to  4.3  percent  at  the  end  of  2018. In my  forecast,  the  economy  almost returns  to  steady  state  (closing  all  gaps  for  the  real  interest  rate,  unemployment,  output,  and  inflation) by the end  of 2018. I see the unemployment  bottoming  out  at  4.6  percent  in  late  2016.The  gradual removal  of  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows  growth  to  below potential in 2017 and 2018, respectively. This pushes up the unemployment  rate  to its 5 percent natural  rate  by  the  end  of  2018. Finally,  the  persistent  overshoot  of  full  employment,  combined  with firmer  price  pressures,  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  the  second  half  of  2018.

Respondent 5: As  in the Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  the labor  market  will  continue  to  improve,  and  inflation  will  gradually  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term objective. My  outlook  for  the  real  economy  is  generally  similar  to  Tealbook's  forecast. I see  somewhat greater  inflationary  pressures  than  in  the  Tealbook,  with  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  by  the  end of 2017 compared  with  2020  in  the  Tealbook. My  funds  rate path  is similar to the Tealbook's  but my  projection  has  a  slightly  shallower  path  in  2016  and  slightly  steeper  path  in  2017  compared  to  the Tealbook  .

Respondent 6: No  significant diff erences for this year or next. For 2018, however,  I build in an expectation  of  some  cyclical  slowing  in  2018,  a  development  not  projected  in  the  Tealbook  forecast. Of

course,  as  with  all  projections  several  years  out,  the  conviction  behind  that  expectation  is  necessarily not  too  strong.

Respondent 7: My  projected paths for real GDP  growth  and  the unemployment  rate in 20162018  are  close  to  those  of  Tealbook. While  the  projections  for  headline  GDP  growth  are  similar,  the contributions to growth  are diff erent as my  forecast calls for somewhat  softer growth  in consumer spending  and  somewhat  less  weakness  in  net  exports. My  forecasts  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE inflation  are  approximately 1 2 / percentage  point  higher  than  Tealbook's  projection  in  2016  and  2017 and 1 4 / percentage  point  higher  in  2018. With  inflation  expectations  well  anchored,  I  view  inflation  as less inertial than  Tealbook,  and  therefore  expect  the  eff ects  of  past  dollar  appreciation  and  oil  price declines  to  wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projection.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: Unlike  the  Tealbook,  I  am  not  willing  to  completely  dismiss  recent  inflation  readings. I believe  that  inflation  will  reach  2  percent  in  2017,  three  years  earlier  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 10: Unlike  the  December  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  diff erences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and  our  projections  for  the  key  SEP  variables. In part, these  diff erences reflect divergences  in  some  of  the  underlying  assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts  that  influence  the  dynamics  in  the projections.

The  two  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  are  similar,  but  the  Tealbook  projects  moderately faster  growth  in  2017  and  2018  than  in  our  outlook. Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential GDP  growth,  which  is  below  our  assumption  for  potential  growth  in  2016-18,  the  Tealbook  path  of real  GDP  leads  to  a  notable  positive  output  gap  by  2017-18. Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise estimates  of  the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  there  is  not  a  significantly  positive  output  gap  at that  time.

The  major  component  behind  the  diff erences  in  real  GDP  growth  is  consumption. The  Tealbook forecast  has  faster  real  PCE  growth  in  2017-18  than  in  our  projection,  even  though  the  2016  real  PCE projections  are  similar. Real  PCE  has  been  a  long-standing  diff erence  between  the  two  forecasts; it appears  in part to reflect the stronger wealth eff ects in the Tealbook  forecast. As a partial off set, the Tealbook  projects  somewhat  slower  growth  in  business  fixed  investment  in  2016-17  than  in  our forecast. This  diff erence  is also a longstanding  one  that  partly  reflects  the  Tealbook  assessment  that the  capital  stock  is  closer  to  steady-state  levels  than  in  our  assessment.

Another  notable  diff erence  in  the  underlying  assumptions  continues  to  be  the  longer-run  natural rate of unemployment: although  the  Tealbook  has  lowered  its assumption  to  5.0%, it is still above our assumption of 4.8%. Consequently, unemployment  in our projection falls only to around the natural  rate,  consistent  with  our  assessment  that  slack  dissipates  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon. In contrast, the Tealbook  path  means  that  unemployment  significantly  undershoots  the  longer-run natural rate; this pattern  is the counterpart  of the positive output  gap  that arises in the Tealbook forecast.

One  other  diff erence  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: our  projection  has  the  participation  rate  flat  through  2017  at  62.8%  while  the  Tealbook  has  it  declining gradually  to  62.5%  at  end-2017. This  diff erence  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  eff ects on  participation.

For inflation, the two forecasts diff er on how quickly inflation reaches the 2% objective: our projection has inflation near 2%  at end-2017  whereas  the Tealbook  projects that inflation will not reach  that  level  until  2020. The  Tealbook  has  this  slower  rise  even  though  there  are  a  positive  output gap and undershooting of unemployment  in its projection. This diff erence between the Tealbook and our projections reflects diff ering views about inflation dynamics. In the Tealbook, with the

underlying  inflation rate below  the FOMC  longer-run  objective  and  considerable  persistence  in  the inflation process,  a prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  (and  a  positive  output  gap)  appears to be necessary to induce inflation to rise toward the longer-run inflation goal. The faster return of inflation to its goal in our forecast reflects our assumptions  of  less inflation persistence and of a stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation  expectations.

In terms of the uncertainty  and risk assessment, we see a few diff erences between  the two projections. On  the  real side, we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual  nature  of the  current  expansion,  the  atypical  policy  environment  in  the  U.S.  and  many  foreign  economies,  and foreign  risks leave uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard. However,  we  agree  with the Tealbook  that  the  risks  to real growth  are  tilted to the downside  for  many  of  the  same  reasons cited in the Tealbook. As  for inflation, our uncertainty  and  risk  assessments  are  similar  to  those  in the  Tealbook,  with  uncertainty  near  the  SEP  standard  and  risks  tilted  to  the  downside.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  lies  further  below  that  in  the  Tealbook  projection. As  discussed earlier  in our  submission,  we  believe  a  very  gradual  path  of  normalization  is  necessary  to  achieve  the FOMC  objectives  as  well  as  provide  insurance  against  forces  restraining  the  U.S.  economy. This  path is shallower  than  that  implied  by  the  inertial  Taylor  1999  rule  used  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  calls  for  a  somewhat  more  gradual  pace  of  policy  normalization  over the  forecast  horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: The  Tealbook  implicitly  assumes  that  the  underlying  strength  of  the  economy  will improve  noticeably  faster  than  I  anticipate, resulting  in a steeper  trajectory  for the real funds  rate; the reason  for their greater  optimism  is  unclear. In addition,  the  Tealbook  sees  a  somewhat  greater need  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  undershoot  its  longer-run  value  than  I  do,  probably  because  their projection  incorporates  a  higher  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  and  a  lower  estimate of long-run  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 13: The  Tealbook's  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  at  5.0  percent,  is higher  than  our  estimate,  which  currently  stands  at  4.7  percent. The  Tealbook  forecast  implies  a  more pronounced  overshooting  of  full  employment  than  our  forecast. As  a result, the Tealbook  outlook  is conditioned  on  somewhat  tighter  monetary  policy.

Respondent 14: My  growth  forecast  is  similar  to  that  in  the  Tealbook  throughout  the  projection period. However,  my  headline  and  core inflation forecasts run 0.3-0.4 percentage  points above the Tealbook  over  the  medium-term  horizon. A  large  part  of  this  diff erence  is  due  to  a  divergence  of  views on  inflation  expectations. It is my  view  that  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  policy-consistent levels.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: There  are  several  notable  diff erences. First,  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  as  falling a bit  faster  than  is  projected  in  the  Tealbook,  but  not  quite  as  far. Allowing  the  unemployment  rate  to drop  0.7  percentage  points  or  more  below  the  natural  rate  might  create  real  and  financial  imbalances that  would  be  difficult  to  unwind. Second,  I  see  a  more  rapid  return  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective than  does  the  Tealbook. In  my  view,  the  longer-term  inflation  expectations  relevant  to  wage  and  price setting  remain  anchored  at  2  percent. Finally,  I  see  financial  conditions  as  having  tightened  relatively more  than  is  allowed  for  in  the  Tealbook,  with  the  result  that  the  appropriate  path  for  the  funds  rate is shallower  than  the Tealbook  baseline  assumption. The  neutral  real rate is quite low, at present, and  is likely to return  only  gradually  to  normal  levels.

Respondent 17: The  primary  diff erence  involves  inflation. My  forecasts  for  2016  and  2017  exceed the Tealbook  forecasts. Relative  to the Tealbook,  I expect  a relatively shorter time for inflation to converge  to  2%.
