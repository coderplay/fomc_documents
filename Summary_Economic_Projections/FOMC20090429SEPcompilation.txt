Uncertainty and Risks

- 2(a). (Optional) If you have any explanatory comments regarding your judgment of the uncertainty attached to your projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past 20 years, you may enter them below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

Quantitative judgment  based  on  standard  deviation  of  FRBNY forecast  distribution  for  GDP  growth  and core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  forecast  errors  over  the  last  20  years.

Respondent 3:

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

The  stresses in the financial sector remain significant. Traditional  monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound  and  the  precise  impact  on  the  economy  of  quantitative  easing  is  unknown. For  these  reasons,  I  view forecast  uncertainty  as  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 11:

Despite  recent  improvements in  credit  markets, the speed  and degree to which  nonstandard policies by the Federal  Reserve,  Treasury,  and  the  FDIC  will  ameliorate  credit  conditions  remains  highly  uncertain. Additional  uncertainty  concerns  the  speed  at  which  private-market  price  discovery  will  take  place  and  the  effect that it  will have  on  institutions'  lending  capacity. The political landscape,  the implications of  the upcoming stress  test  results,  and  the  still  unknown  parameters  of  the  PPIP  and  CAP  have  added  uncertainty  and  risk aversion  to  private-sector  markets,  and  so  have  added  corresponding  uncertainty  to  our  forecast.

Respondent 12:

I believe  that  the  projections  for  GDP  and  unemployment  have  above-average  uncertainty  this  year,  due  to the difficulty in forecasting the timing  of the recession's trough. Beyond  this  year, uncertainty  is normal. Inflation  expectations  would  be  anchored  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy,  and  therefore  uncertainty would  be  lower  than  the  trailing  twenty-year  average.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

Uncertainty  is  unusually  high  because  the  depth  and  duration  of  the  recession  are  far  from  clear,  as  is  the timing  and  magnitude  of  the  recovery.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

The unusual global financial and economic crisis and  uncertainty about the effects of fiscal policy  and  unconventional  monetary policies increase  the  degree  of uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook  for economic  activity. Elevated  variability  of  commodity  prices  and  heightened  risks  to  the  outlook  for  economic  activity  raise  the degree  of  uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 17:

high  uncertainty  naturally  accompanies  a period  of  financial  and  economic  stress  with  little  if  any  precedent in the  post  WWII  era-especially  taking  account  of  its  global  dimensions.

Respondent 5:

Incoming data have led me to revise down my  view on the likely path for growth and unemployment  compared to  my  January  forecast. With  the  downward  revision,  I  now  view  the  risks  to  growth  and  the  unemployment rate as roughly balanced. I view longer-term inflation risk as tilted to the upside, reflecting uncertainty about  the  Fed's  ability  to  reduce  the  size  of  its  balance  sheet  at  the  appropriate  time. However,  in  the  near term,  the  risk  to  inflation  is  likely  tilted  to the  downside  given  the  weak  economic  outlook.

Respondent 6:

Going  forward into  2010  as  the  economy  recovers from the current  recession  and  experiences the  fiscal  stimulus program  as well as substantial persistent increases in the  monetary  base, I believe  that the risks to real growth  will  become  weighted  to  the  upside. In  the  near  term  I  see  the  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced, but  over  the  longer  run  the  risks  will  likely  move  to  the  upside  as  it  proves  difficult  to  unwind  the  rapid  near term  projected  growth  in  the  monetary  base  in  an  expeditious  fashion.

Respondent 7:

I have revised my  assessment  of the risks to inflation away  from  'weighted  to the downside'  and  toward being  'broadly balanced'. There remains a  risk  the  economy's potential is greater  than I have  assumed  and that as a result, the disinflationary  consequences  of  projected  economic  weakness  are  stronger  than  shown in my  forecast. However,  recent  policy  actions  have  increased  the  potential  for  growth  in  the  Fed's  balance sheet to contribute to rising  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

In the near-term, I believe the risks to overall and core inflation are to the downside. However, in the longer-term, I believe the risks are to the upside if we delay removing  accommodation  and  shrinking  our balance  sheet.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

We still face risks on both the up and downsides with regard to growth.  There are both up and downside risks surrounding  the potential  influence  of Fed  asset purchases  on  credit conditions  and  economic  activity. There is a downside  risk  that  uneasiness  over  the  costs  of  participating  in  government  programs  will  reduce  their acceptance  by  potential  market  participants  and  thus  diminish  their  positive  influence  on  financial  markets and  economic  activity. There  is  an  upside  risk  that  aggressive  inventory  control  and  pent-up  demands  will generate  a  more  pronounced  cyclical  recovery  than  in  our  baseline  forecast.

As we thought  last time, in the near term  price risks are tilted towards  lower-than-expected  inflation  due the  substantial  slack  in  the  economy  and  falling  commodity  prices. Over  the  longer  run,  there  is  a  risk  that actual  or  perceived  difficulties  in  unwinding  the  large  expansion  to  the  Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet  will boost  inflationary  expectations.

Respondent 16:

A  further  intensification  of the ongoing  adverse  feedback  loop  represents  a  significant  downside  risk  to  the outlook  for  growth. The  looming  problem  in  the  commercial  real  estate  market  poses  additional  downside risks to the outlook  for  economic  activity. The  sizable  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  for  economic  activity imply  greater  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 17:

Growth  risks  are  still  weighted  to  the  downside,  which  implies  a  similar  asymmetry  to  inflation  risks. Those risks reflect still-fragile financial markets and incomplete adjustments  of financial and household balance sheets to more  sustainable  configurations. In the baseline those adjustments  are  gradual  and  orderly; the risk is that they are accelerated, tightening financial conditions and restraining demand. However, the risks are less strongly  skewed  than  they  were  in  January; signs of stabilization  in key demand  sectors  and improvement  in  financial  markets  suggest  that  the  odds  on  gradual  and  orderly  adjustments  are  higher.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  interest  rates  differ  materially from  the  interest  rate  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Greenbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: No

N/A

Respondent 2: Yes

Through  2009-10  identical. We  assume  the  normalization  of  interest  rates  starts  in  2011. Because  of  differences in  our inflation  forecast,  real policy  rates remain  similar in  2011. Our  views  on the size of the balance sheet  are  close  to  the  Greenbook  assumption.

Respondent 3: No

N/A

Respondent 4: Yes

Expect policy  to begin  to  normalize  sooner  than  under  Greenbook  base  case, but not quite as rapidly as market  expectations

Respondent 5: Yes

My  forecast  continues to  assume a less  accommodative federal funds  rate path than in the Greenbook baseline. I view the appropriate policy as raising the funds  rate toward the end of 2009 to 0.5 percent. The funds rate  rises gradually  through  the  forecast  horizon  reaching  2.5 percent  at the  end  of  2010  and  3.5 percent  at the  end  of  2011.

Respondent 6: Yes

While the  exact timing and pattern of recovery from the  current recession is highly uncertain and becoming stuck  in a deflationary  trap  is a possibility, I do not see the latter as the modal  outcome. Hence  I believe that,  under  appropriate  monetary policy,  we  likely  will  have  to  move  away  from  the  current  target  range  for the  funds  rate  as  part  of  the  process  of  withdrawing  from  quantitative  easing  much  sooner  than  assumed  in the  Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 7: No

N/A

Respondent 8: No

N/A

Respondent 9: Yes

Like Greenbook, I  assume the funds rate target  will be  maintained in the range of 0  to 1/4 percent  through the end  of 2010. However,  I  expect  it will be necessary  to start raising the funds  rate in 2011. I am  also concerned  that  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  will  constrain  our  ability  to  raise  the  funds  rate  in  2011.

Respondent 10: No

N/A

Respondent 11: Yes

We  assume  that  the  funds  rate  will  begin  to  increase  sometime  in  2010. We  also  assume  that  the  Fed  will take some active measures to reduce the size of our balance sheet instead of simply letting it run down

passively  as  assets  mature.

Respondent 12: Yes

I believe that under  an appropriate policy, the committee  will  announce a numerical inflation objective. I believe  that  further  expansion  of  the  monetary  base  this  year  will  be  necessary  to  move  toward  an  inflation 1 target  of  1 percent. This  is consistent  with  the  Greenbook  assumption  for  asset  purchases. I believe  that 2 the  funds  rate  is  likely  to  remain  low  for  at  least  a  year.

Respondent 13: No

The  forecast  is conditioned  on  roughly  the  same  short- and  long-term  interest  rates  assumptions  as  in  the Greenbook.  But  as  the  Greenbook  is  also  suggesting,  such  a  path  for  the  interest  rates  does  not  necessarily represent  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 14: Yes

I expect  the  Federal  funds  rate  to  begin  to  move  up  modestly  sometime  in  the  second  half  of  2010  or  early in 2011.

Respondent 15: Yes

In my  projection,  the  federal  funds  rate  would  likely  begin  to  rise  sooner  than  in  the  Greenbook.

No

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook.

Respondent 1:

I chose  the Greenbook  scenario  on  the  strength  of  a  belief  that  housing  markets  are  stabilizing  due  to  the low  absolute  levels  of  activity  and  government  programs. The  specific  programs  I  think  are  having  a  strong influence  are (a) low  mortgage  rates (b) first  time  homebuyer  tax credits and (c)  refinance  ability  at higher LTVs  through  the  GSEs. I am  still concerned  about  the potential for further stress in financial markets caused  by  destabilization  around  specific  large  financial  institutions. However,  I  wasn't  able  to  translate  my concern  into  support  for  the  false  dawn  scenario.

Respondent 2:

In our  central  projection,  the  US  economy  remains  in  recession  through  mid  2009,  making  this  the  longest recession  of  the  post  WWII  period. At  the  trough,  the  level  of  real  GDP  is  about  2  3/4%  below  the  NBER peak, modestly  less than  the  most  severe  recessions  of  that period. By  the second  half  of  2009  a  relatively tepid  recovery is expected  to take hold, aided by  the  preemptive path of  monetary policy, various initiatives to foster financial market  stability, and  aggressive  fiscal stimulus  measures. Growth  returns  to  just above its potential  rate by the second  half of 2010  and  then  accelerates  to about  2 1 2 %  above  its potential  rate in 2011. Barring a significant decline in the economy's potential growth  rate, this point forecast implies that a  significant  output  gap  will persist over  this  entire period. At the trough,  the  unemployment rate  is expected  to  be  around  8 3 4 %, a full  four percentage points above the level at  the peak. This is  somewhat  less than  might  be  expected  from  an  Okun's  Law  relationship  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  average weekly  hours  have  declined  and  productivity  growth  has  slowed,  all  of  which  tend  to  damp  the  increase  in unemployment.  The unemployment  rate is expected to  continue rising  over the first year  of  recovery, likely to between 9  1/2%  and 9 3 4 %,  as  growth  remains  relatively sluggish  and  as  the  participation  rate  and  average weekly  hours  begin  moving  upward  again. Thereafter,  the  unemployment  rate  moves  down  only  gradually. The  risks to  this modal forecast  are substantially skewed  to the downside  with an uncomfortably high probability that the current downturn will end up of  similar depth and duration to pre-World War II  contractions.

The  broad outlines of this central projection are as follows. Consumer  spending  remains  relatively sluggish  as  household  boost  saving  out  of  current  cash  flow  in  response  to  continued  somewhat  restrictive  credit conditions  and  an apparent  sustained  decline  in their net worth. The  correction  in housing  production  is expected to be largely completed  by mid-2009. At that point the large drag that residential investment has exerted on growth for nearly the past four years will be over. Thereafter, housing is likely to be a modest plus for growth, but  we do not anticipate the  usual surge of residential investment  experienced in the early  stages  of  past  recoveries  due  to  the  continued  high  volume  of  homes  coming  onto  the  market  through the  foreclosure  process  and,  again,  continued  relatively  tight  mortgage  underwriting  standards. Indeed,  the correction in house prices is expected  to continue through  the end of 2010 with a cumulative  22%  peakto-trough  decline  in  the  FHFA  purchase-only  home  price  index. (For  other  indices,  such as  the  Case-Shiller 20 city  composite, the peak-to-trough decline is likely to be  around 40 percent.) Business investment in  new structures and new  equipment  and  software  is expected  to decline sharply in 2009 as capacity utilization rates decline and vacancy  rates rise. In typical business  cycle fashion, these components of  final  demand do not begin  to recover  until the second  half of 2010. In addition, during  the  first half of 2009  businesses aggressively  pare  inventories  to  get  them  better  aligned  with  sales. With  the  sharp  downgrading  of  foreign growth  prospects,  exports  are  expected  to  decline  through  mid  2009  with  significant  growth  not  returning until  2010. Nonetheless,  in  the  near-term  net  exports  remain  a  plus  for  growth  from  an  accounting  sense  as imports  also  decline  sharply due to  the weakness of  domestic demand. During the second half of  2009  the net export  contribution  gradually  declines  and  then  turns  negative  in  2010  as  the  recovery  of  domestic  demand induces  an increase in the rate of growth  of imports. Finally, the growth  contribution  of the government sector begins to rebound in the second half of  2009 as the  effects of the stimulus legislation begin to take hold.

Underlying  this  projected  path  of  private  final  demand  is  the  expectation  that  financial  market  functioning returns  to  more  normal  conditions  and  that  consumer  and  business  confidence  is  gradually  restored.

In this central scenario, total consumer price inflation is negative over the first half of 2009 as the effects  of  the  sharp  declines  in  energy  and  other  commodity  prices  during  2008Q4  work  their  way  through  the system. Core  inflation remains  relatively low in 2009  reflecting the significant increase in slack in the US economy.  But  by  2010  both  total  and  core  inflation  gradually  increase  back  as  final  demand  firms  within  the context  of  anchored  inflation  expectations. However,  it  will  likely  take  until  2011  before  inflation  returns  to the  mandate  consistent  range.

The risks to our central projection for real activity are substantial and are skewed to the downside. In the  near-term,  the  key  risk  is  that  financial  market  conditions  and  consumer  and  business  confidence  do  not improve  as  assumed. This  in turn  leads to lower  than  expected  asset  prices,  less  recovery  in  the supply  of credit  and,  therefore,  an  even  weaker  path  for  final  demand. A  related  risk  is  that,  even  if  financial  markets and  asset  prices  behave  as  assumed,  the  decline  of  household  net  worth  embedded  in  this  central  projection induces a  steeper-than-expected increase  of  the personal  saving  rate, keeping  consumer spending  weaker  for longer. The  sharp  increase  in the prime  age male  unemployment  rate  during  the  current  cycle, combined with  the  large  share  of  workers  nearing  retirement  age,  make  this  risk particularly  acute. Finally,  an  important risk over the medium  term  is  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our  assumption  of  the  economy's  potential growth  rate. There  is  increasing  evidence  that  potential  growth  has  slowed  somewhat,  but  it  is  too  soon  to tell whether  this  is  a  cyclical  or  a  structural  phenomenon.

The  balance  of  risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  is  also  skewed  to  the  downside,  but  somewhat less so  than for growth. Clearly, the significant downside risk  to the growth projection implies downside risk to the inflation projection. Further, if some  of the more  adverse  risks to the global economy  are  realized, then  we  assess  a  substantial  chance  of  deflation. In contrast,  in  the  current  environment  of  aggressive  global monetary  and  fiscal policy  response  to  the  ongoing  financial  crisis, there is some  risk of higher  inflation if the economy  proves  more  resilient  than  in  our  central  scenario. The  net  effect of these competing  risks  is somewhat  to  the  downside.

The heightened uncertainty associated with banking  and financial crisis periods, and the uncertainty associated  with  the  timing,  magnitude, and  effectiveness  of policy  responses have  resulted  in highly  elevated uncertainty  around  our  central  projection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 3:

The economy's sharp decline over the fall and winter months threatens a further deterioration in loan performance  that will put new  stress on the  financial sector. Thankfully, consumer demand appears  to be stabilizing, residential construction  has  little  room  left  to  fall,  and  fiscal stimulus should soon begin  kicking in.

The economy's longer-term prospects depend very much  on whether policy makers and private decision makers  take advantage  of the anticipated lull to make  meaningful  progress  on  the reorganization and recapitalization  of  the  financial  system. Poor  execution  of  reorganization  and  recapitalization  by  government authorities  will  retard  private-sector  confidence  and  inhibit  employment  gains  and  capital  expenditure  commitments.

On the price front, a perception  that the Federal Reserve  will  monetize  fiscal  deficits  will  undermine  confidence  in  our  commitment  to  price  stability,  discourage  capital  markets  and  distort  business  decision  making so as to impede  recovery.

Respondent 4:

Expect  less benefit from  fiscal  stimulus,  particularly beyond  2009. Expect  somewhat higher  NAIRU,  lower producitivity  and lower growth  rates throughout the forecast period and beyond. Recession expected to last longer  and be somewhat  deeper. And  finding  new equilibrium will  take somewhat  longer than during typical recoveries

Respondent 5:

The  recent  data  on  the  economy  have  been  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  January  forecast. I expect continued  weakness  in  the  housing  sector,  tight  credit  market  conditions,  lower  household  wealth,  and  poor growth  prospects  in  the  rest  of  the  world  to  hold  down  economic  growth  to  a  significantly  below-trend  pace through  the  first half of 2009. As  these  factors  begin  to  unwind,  the  economy  rebounds  to  an  above-trend pace of 3 percent in  2010 before  edging  back  down  to  trend  at  2.7 percent  in  2011. In my  view,  the  substantial liquidity that is now  in the financial system  raises  the  risk that inflation will rapidly  accelerate  to unacceptable  levels  and that  inflation expectations will become  unanchored. To ward  off  these  developments, the FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening  of  monetary  policy  that begins toward  the end of 2009.

Respondent 6:

I expect  continued,  though  slowing,  contraction  in  the  first half  of  2009  with  output bottoming  out  in  the middle  of the year and  recovering  in the second  half. In 2010  and  2011  I anticipate that real growth  will occur  at greater  than  steady-state  rates,  reflecting  normal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by  a  modest  impact of the  recently  adopted  fiscal  package  and  the  impact  of  the  substantial  monetary  stimulus  that  is  in  train. I expect  relatively low, but positive inflation in  2009, but  rising intermediate  run inflation  as a consequence of current  monetary stimulus. Subsequently I believe  that  inflation, under  appropriate  monetary policy,  should approach  my preferred  long-run  rate of 1.5%. I do not believe that future energy  shocks can be  forecasted, so with available  information I  expect  that  core  and headline  inflation  will be  roughly  equal over the projection period.

Respondent 7:

Slow  restoration  of  financial  market  functioning,  sluggish  consumer  spending,  and  lingering  economic  uncertainty are likely to retard the recovery  process. I have assumed  a  bottoming  out  of  the  real estate sector in the second  half  of  this year, no  new  adverse  shocks  to  financial  markets  here  or  abroad,  and  some  boost from  combined  fiscal  and  monetary  stimulus,  particularly  in  the  second  half  of  2009. However,  the potential for another adverse shock to the financial system, an accelerated decline in foreign growth, or a further deterioration  in  consumer  confidence  tilt  the  balance  of  growth  risks  to  the  downside.

I continue  to assume  that  forces adversely  affecting economic  growth  are  also  weighing  somewhat  on  economic  potential.

Respondent 8:

In the near  term,  some  stabilization  seems  likely  if  only  because  the  pace  of  deterioration  in  the  preceding several  quarters  had  been  so  rapid. The  drawing  down  of  inventories,  delay  of  durables  purchase,  and  similar developments  should  -  absent  another  major  shock  -  reverse  to  some  degree. Over  the  longer  term, I anticipate  that  important  parts  of  capital  markets  will  remain  unusually  encumbered  for  some  time  to  come, and that structural changes in important  economic  sectors  will  retard  employment growth well beyond the end  of  the  recession

Respondent 9:

While  the  economy  is  likely  to  contract  in  the  second  quarter,  we  are  beginning  to  see  signs  of  a  deceleration in the  pace  of  decline. As  a result  of this deceleration,  I  have  greater  confidence  that  we  are  likely  near  the bottom  and  will  see  a  recovery  by  year-end.

My  outlook balances the negative effects of job losses, falling income, and continued problems in housing  with  the positive effects of  an  eventual  rebound in  residential  and inventory investment,  and  stimulative monetary  and  fiscal policy. As a result, I expect real GDP  to  decline 3.4 percent in the first half of this year before rebounding  to 0.8 percent in the second  half and 2.8 percent in  2010. Continued weakness in the economy  and  labor  markets  along  with  continued  financial  stress  means  the  near-term  risks  to  GDP  growth are  weighted  to  the  downside.

Recent data on consumer price inflation has been higher than expected, leading to an upward revision in near-term  inflation. I expect  that  continued  economic  weakness  will  keep  downward  pressure  on  inflation in the medium-term. And  as  long  as  long-term  inflation  expectations  continue  to  remain  stable,  I  see  little risk of significant  disinflation  or  deflation. In the longer  term,  I  fear the risks are to the upside  if we  delay removing  accommodation  and  shrinking  our  balance  sheet.

Respondent 10:

Modest  improvement  in  the  outlook  arising  from  1)  Q1  stabilization  in  consumption,  with  further  support expected  from  fiscal policy 2) some  improvement in financial markets (in  part reflecting  Fed policies), stock price  rise, 3) progress in inventory adjustment and 4) some stabilization (at a low level) in housing. However, financial improvement  remains  tentative  and  conditioned  on  policy  and  incoming  data,  and  banks  remain somewhat  fragile. Other  downside  risks  include  commercial  real  estate  (both  activity  and  impact  on  balance sheets), consumption  (reflecting primarily deterioration in labor market  and  loss of housing wealth), and global economic  and  financial  conditions. A  relatively slow  recovery, the result of financial headwinds  and the 'jobless recovery' phenomenon  seems the  most likely  outcome, although conditions  should begin to pick up  later  in 2010  and  in  2011.

Respondent 11:

We  feel that monetary  accommodation  (including  that  provided  by  special  credit  facilities  and  large-scale asset purchases),  fiscal policy stimulus, private sector  financial adjustments,  and the  economy's  natural cyclical adjustment  dynamics  will  result  in  a  resumption  of  positive  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2009. Growth will remain  below  potential  for  some  time,  however,  reflecting  the  still  net-negative  influence  of  restrictive credit conditions, weak  demand  from  abroad, and a hesitancy for households  and businesses to spend in the uncertain  economic  environment. As  these  factors  diminish,  growth  is  projected  to  pick  up  well  above potential  in late 2010  and  in  2011. The  increases  in  output  will  not  be  enough,  however,  to  close  resource gaps  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

The  inflation forecast balances  two  opposing  forces. On  the downside,  substantial  domestic  resource  gaps and the influence of weak world demand  on  commodity  prices  will reduce cost pressures and hold down markups. In contrast, unless managed  appropriately, the expansion of the Fed's balance sheet and the prospects for persistently  large  fiscal deficits could have upside consequences for  inflation expectations. Our forecast  assumes  that  the  effects  of  these  forces  on  inflation  expectations  will  roughly  cancel  out,  and  thus inflation  will  settle  out  in  a range  consistent  with  the  achievement  of  our  dual  mandate.

Respondent 12:

I believe  that  the  recession  will  end  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  and  that  the  economy  will  then  begin  to grow slowly. I believe that business investment is likely to be quite weak  this year. I believe  that fiscal policy effects  will be  smaller  than  generally projected,  as  appears  to  have been  the case  last year,  and  consequently my  outlook  is  not  heavily  dependent  on  the  probable  course  of  fiscal  policy

Respondent 13:

After the sharp drop in GDP  in both 2008:Q4 and 2009:Q1, there are tentative signs that the ongoing contraction  in  economic  activity  is  leveling  off. These  signs  of  stabilization,  however,  are  mitigated  by  still dire  labor  market  conditions  which  will  worsen  further  before  starting  to  improve  gradually. Activity  should

continue  to decline in the near term, though  at  a slower pace than  in the past two quarters. A return to mild positive growth in activity should occur  only later this year. The fiscal stimulus will provide some wherewithal to consumers, but the  factors that hamper a faster  recovery both  later  this year and in  2010 are numerous.  Credit  constraints  remain  a  crucial  factor  behind  a  subpar  recovery  under  present  circumstances. Households' and firms' spending should  suffer from a  lack of credit availability  well into next year. Support to consumer spending  will  also be hampered by the  large declines in  households'  net worth,  and the uncertainty surrounding  the fate of the auto sector  could lead to postponements in consumers' decision to buy a  car. In addition,  residential  investment  is  unlikely  to  provide  the  same  boost  to  activity  as  in  past  recoveries,  while labor  market  reallocation  could  also  be  disrupted  this  time  around  by  less  geographical  labor  mobility  as  a result  of  the  poor  housing  market. In all, these  factors  point  to  a  relatively  shallow  turnaround  in  economic activity  late this year  and  in 2010. The  unemployment  rate  is  still  high  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon despite an acceleration  in growth  in 2011  as credit constraints  wane. Given  the  sizable slack in the labor market over  the forecast  horizon, the rate of  core  inflation hovers  around zero percent in  2011.

The risks to real activity are tilted to the downside. Further deterioration, albeit at a reduced pace, in economic  activity in the near term  implies that conditions at many  financial institutions will continue to worsen. This raises the likelihood of further restrictions on credit supply  and  of increased  financial instability. As concerns inflation, the risks are to the downside, too. The  downside  risks are not just due to real-side uncertainty, but are also the result of our limited experience  with  near-zero  inflation. Given  the unemployment rate forecast,  our  models would  predict  outright  deflation  starting  in  2010. We  tempered  this deflationary  outlook  by  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  downward  nominal  rigidities  could  attenuate  the inflation-unemployment  trade-off. Still, the  risks  of deflation  are  significant.

Respondent 14:

I expect the recession to persist through  the middle of 2009, followed by a modest  recovery for three or four  quarters. The  expansion  will  be  constrained  by  ongoing  problems  in  financial  markets  and  institutions and  in housing. As  these problems  diminish,  economic  growth  should  gain  momentum. Underpinning  the expansion  is  accommodative  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  policy  stimulus.

Respondent 15:

Fallout  from  the  financial  crisis  continues  to  impact  real  economic  activity,  depress  business  investment  and further  dampen  consumer  spending. These  adverse  effects  only  begin  to  dissipate  in  the  second  half  of  2009. Recent  signs of stabilization in  consumption and housing buttress  our view that positive growth  will return in the  second  half  of  2009. Fiscal  stimulus  and  Federal  Reserve  asset  purchases  help  to  foster  that  growth. The rapid  and  uneven  deterioration  in  employment  along  with  continued  sharp  declines  in  job  openings  means that unemployment will  continue to rise into  2010 and  require an extended period of time to  recover. Along with  the  reallocation  reducing  the  size  of  the  output  gap, policy-informed  inflation  expectations  support  the core  inflation  rate  and  diminish  the  chances  for  a  deflationary  episode.

There  is a substantial amount  of uncertainty  surrounding  this projection. Forecasting  in periods such as these  is notoriously  difficult. The  primary  risks  are  to  the  downside  on  medium-term  growth  and  inflation.

Respondent 16:

Although tentative  signs of stabilization of the economy have emerged and financial conditions have improved somewhat,  the  economic  situation  remains  very  weak  and  public  confidence  in  the  economic  outlook  is  in tatters. The  housing  sector  is  moribund,  labor  markets  continue  to  deteriorate,  business  spending  is  falling sharply, and other major  economies  are contracting as fast as the United  States. The  process of healing the banking  and  financial  sectors  is  proving  to  be  difficult  and  slow, and  impaired  financial  intermediation will interfere with the pace of recovery. In addition, households  are in the midst of a lengthy process of repairing  their  balance  sheets  that  have  been  weakened  by  massive  stock  and  housing  market  losses. Fiscal

and  monetary  stimulus  provide  key  drivers  for  recovery  over  the  next  few  years. Significant  slack in labor and goods markets should keep inflation low, but well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid sustained  deflation.

Respondent 17:

inventory overhangs in houses and goods are gradually worked  off, leading to increases in production to meet  demand. demand  itself  is  bolstered  by  gradual  healing  in  financial  markets,  fiscal  stimulus,  and  lower interest  rates  reflecting  monetary  accommodation  as  spreads  decline. But  the  pickup  is  gradual  because  of continuing  financial  strains  as  intermediary  capital  is  restored  in  the  face  of  elevated  losses  in  the  recession, and  rebuilding  of  household  wealth  through  a  substantially  higher  saving  rate  than  over  recent  decade. confidence  returns  slowly,  holding  back  spending. And  the  restoration  of  strong  growth  abroad  also  takes  time for much  the  same  reasons.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

We  project  slightly  higher  trend  growth  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline in the  labor force  participation  rate  will  occur  later  and  more slowly than in the  GB. In  terms of differences for the  outlook  in  2009-10  this  implies  a  slightly  higher  peak  to  the  unemployment  rate  than  the  GB  as  the labor  force  participation  rate does not  decline  as sharply  as in  the  GB. We  assume lower  inflation persistence than  does  the  GB.  Thus,  for  our  medium-term  inflation  outlook  we  project  inflation  within  the  'mandateconsistent'  range  in  2011  under  the  assumption  of  well-anchored  inflation  expectations

Respondent 3:

The  Greenbook  baseline  forecast  underestimates  the  continuing  drag  on  real  activity  from  a  weakened  financial sector. On  the inflation front, unconventional  policy  initiatives, necessitated  by unusual  and  extreme financial conditions, have created confusion and uncertainty about the future course of monetary  policy. Also, frictional unemployment  is  likely  to  increase,  both  because  of  the  large,  permanent  shift  in  resources away  from  the  construction  and  financial-services  industries  and  because  home-price  declines  inhibit  labor mobility. Consequently,  inflation  pressures  are  likely  to  be  somewhat  greater  than  is  assumed  in  the  Greenbook  baseline.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

My  inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy. In my  view, inflation will likely run at a higher pace in 2010 and  2011 than in the Greenbook. Given  the strength  of the economy  in  my  forecast  and  the  higher  inflation  path,  the  monetary  policy  path  is  less  accommodative beginning  in  2009Q4.

Respondent 6:

I am  somewhat  more  optimistic on real growth for the second half of 2009. I see substantially stronger recovery  in  real growth  during  2010-11. I see higher  inflation  than  the  Greenbook  throughout  the  forecast period.

Respondent 7:

I anticipate  that  real  growth  will  be  lower  in  2010  and  2011,  as  the  forces  restraining  economic  activity  are likely to be  in place  for  a considerable  period  of  time.

Respondent 8:

I am  influenced  by  several,  though  not  all,  the  factors  mentioned  in  the  Greenbook  in  connection  with  the alternative  'false  dawn'  and  'labor  market  damage'  scenarios

Respondent 9:

Over  the forecast  horizon  (2009  -  2011), I  expect  real  GDP  growth  to average  about 2 percent,  similar  to Greenbook (1.9 percent). In addition, the general  contour of my forecast for real GDP is  similar  to  Greenbook's  forecast: a modest  rebound  in  growth  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  with  growth  then  rising  above trend  in  2010  and  2011.

Like Greenbook, I expect overall and core PCE  inflation to remain near 1 percent through the forecast horizon. With the relatively stable long-term inflation expectations we have seen and potential upward pressure  on  inflation in  the  medium  to  longer  run, I  do  not  expect  to see  the  1/2 percentage point decline in long-term  inflation expectations  that is assumed in Greenbook. As a result, I expect core  and overall inflation  to  be  higher  than  Greenbook  in  2011.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

We  think inflation expectations will run higher than in the Greenbook  baseline. The effect of economic slack  on  actual  inflation  could  reduce  inflation  expectations  modestly  over  the  near  term. But,  moving  out further in the projection  period, we feel some  active  adjustment  of  our  balance  sheet  will be necessary  to keep  longer-run  inflation  expectations  from  rising  above  rates  consistent  with  the  dual  mandate.

Respondent 12:

I believe that under  an appropriate  monetary  policy  the  public's  inflation expectations  would  be  well  anchored,  and  the  inflation  path  would  be  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook. I expect  growth  to  be  a  bit  weaker next  year  than  the  Greenbook  projects,  in  part  due  to  weaker  investment  in  residential  and  nonresidential structures.

Respondent 13:

We see the unemployment  rate peaking higher than in the Greenbook, but the  differences to the real outlook are  relatively  minor. As  concerns  inflation,  we  expect  core  inflation  to  be  lower  than  in  the  Greenbook,  as  a result  of a more  meaningful  trade-off  between  inflation  and  unemployment.

Respondent 14:

Relative  to  the  Greenbook,  I  have  a  more  rapid  snap-back  in  economic  activity  in  2010. I also  have  a  lower unemployment  rate  at  the  end  of  the  forecast  period.

Respondent 15:

My  projected  real  GDP  growth  path  is  broadly  similar  to  the  one  in  the  Greenbook,  although  I  have  somewhat larger losses in the first half of 2009 and a steeper recovery in  2010. Despite the overall  similarity in the two  growth  profiles,  the  labor  market  in  my  outlook  is  notably  weaker,  with  the  unemployment  rate  going above  10%  in  the  middle  of  2010.

My  outlook is for more  core PCE inflation in both  2010 and  2011. Because the current recession is generating a substantial  amount of worker  dislocation  the effective  gap would be  smaller. This  implies  more  inflation. Furthermore,  my  inflation  outlook  also  assumes  that  inflation  expectations  remain  near  current  levels  which keeps  core  PCE  inflation  higher  than  in  Greenbook.

As a consequence of the stronger inflation profile, the federal funds rate begins to rise sooner than the Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 16:

My  forecast for economic activity is very similar to that of the Greenbook. My  forecast for inflation is somewhat  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook,  reflecting  an  expectation  that  inflation  expectations  will  remain well  anchored.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

In January we judged it likely that the US economy  would  experience a recession of intensity  similar to  1981-2 and  1973-5. Incoming  labor  market  data,  the  continued  synchronized  decline  in  the  pace  of  global  economic activity  and increasing evidence of restricted credit flows produced initially  another large downward  revision in our  projections  for  2009H1  but  tentative  signs  of  stabilization  over  the  last  few  weeks  have  reversed  much of that downward  revision. Although  the fiscal stimulus passed was similar to our January  conditioning assumption,  we  view  the  signs  of  stabilization  as  initial  evidence  that  monetary,  fiscal  and  financial  stability policy actions are starting to gain traction. On  the other hand, we have slightly lowered  our estimate  of potential  growth  as  the  capital  stock  will  be  lower  going  forward  for  a  considerable  time.

Core inflation data surprised to the upside relative to our January forecast for three months in a row. We  view  these  upward  surprises  as  transitory  and  have  not  carried  them  forward  into  future  quarters.

The downside  risks to our central scenario projection have decreased slightly since January. The source of this risk mitigation  is  again  some  evidence  that  previous  policy  actions  are  starting  to  gain  traction.

In January the policy assumption underlying our central projection was a renormalization of the policy rate in 2011 along with an expansion of the TALF  and  more  communication  on  medium  term  inflation objectives. While  it  now  seems  unlikely  that  TALF  will  expand  as  quickly  as  expected,  the  effectiveness  of direct  purchases  of  Treasuries  has  been  more  effective  than  our  initial  assumptions.

Respondent 3:

The  labor  market  performed  somewhat  worse  than  expected  in  2009:Q1,  but  reassuring  signs  that  the  pace of decline  in  real  activity  is  moderating  have  recently  emerged.

Respondent 4:

Unemployment  is  now  expected  to  be  more  pronounced.

Respondent 5:

The  key factors that have caused  me  to revise down  my  near-term  forecast  are  the weaker-than-expected data over the past few months. In addition, financial markets  conditions  are  only slightly improved  from last time  and growth abroad deteriorated  more  than I  expected.

Respondent 6:

Substantially weaker  real growth  in the first quarter of 2009 than I anticipated; More  negative food and energy  price  changes  in  the  first  quarter  of  2009  than  I  anticipated  and  a  faster  than  anticipated  increase  in the  unemployment  rate  are  responsible  for  revisions  to  my forecast  for  the  first  half  of  2009. My  forecasts  for fourth  quarter  over  fourth  quarter  2009  GDP  growth  have  been  revised  by  only  a  small  amount  as  a  result of this information. I now  see  somewhat  higher  intermediate  term  (2011)  core  and  headline  inflation  given the  higher  than  previously  projected  expansion  of  the  monetary  base.

Respondent 7:

On  balance,  data  for  Q1  were  a  little weaker  than  I  expected,  producing  a  downward  revision  to  Q1  GDP estimate  and  pushing  back  the  recovery  until  later  in  the  year. The  deterioration  in  labor  markets  has  also been  more  severe  than  was  anticipated  in  January  and  I  have  revised  upward  the  forecast  rate  of  unemploy-

ment  accordingly.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

Since  last  quarter,  I  have  made  slight  downward  revisions  to  real  GDP  growth,  significant  upward  revisions to the unemployment  rate,  and  an  upward  revision  to  inflation  in  2009. A deterioration  in  labor  markets, industrial  production,  and  housing  were  the  key  factors  leading  to  these  small  revisions.

Respondent 10:

As above, consumption  stabilization, better housing results, tentative improvement  in financial markets, some  progress  in  inventory  adjustment.

Respondent 11:

The incoming data on real economic activity in late 2008 and early 2009 came in weaker than we had expected. In  addition,  we  have  scaled  back  the  assumed  impact  of  fiscal  stimulus  on  growth  in  2009. In  contrast, our nonstandard policies  and private-sector adjustments have led to a  somewhat larger  improvement in financial  conditions  then  we  had  been  assuming  in  January. We  also  now  have  incorporated  the  current targets  for  large-scale  asset  purchases  into  the  policy  assumptions  conditioning  our  forecast.

Respondent 12:

The data on employment, incomes, and production have been weaker than expected at the time of the previous  projections. However,  data  on  spending  have  been  stronger.

Respondent 13:

The  current  forecast  for  real  activity  reflects  the  fact  that  economic  conditions  have  deteriorated  somewhat more  than  expected.

Respondent 14:

My  forecast  has  changed  little  over  the  past  quarter.

Respondent 15:

Fourth-quarter  2008  real  GDP  was  revised  much  lower  than  was  expected  in  my  January  projection,  shifting the level of the near-term  growth  forecast down  dramatically. Some  recent data suggests stabilization in both  consumption  and  housing  supporting  the  view  that  a  trough  in  economic  activity  will  occur  in  mid2009. An  unusually  dramatic  deterioration  in  the  labor  market  has  pushed  up  the  peak  unemployment  rate by roughly  one  percentage  point  from  the  January  projection. Other  data  indicate  a  strong  role for labor market  reallocation during the  recovery process, thereby pushing up  trend  unemployment  and tempering the  effects  of  economic  slack  on  inflation. Recent  unexpected  strength  in  core  CPI  inflation  has  also  pushed my  near-term  inflation  outlook  higher.

Respondent 16:

Since  January,  economic  data  have  come  in  somewhat  worse  than  anticipated,  causing  me  to  lower  my  forecast for real GDP  growth  in  the  first  half  of  this  year. The  worsening  outlook  for  foreign  growth  and  signs that the repair of the banking  and  financial  sectors  will take longer  than  previously  expected  have  caused me to lower my  forecast for growth by  a modest  amount over the  next few years. Recent  inflation data have been  higher  than  expected  and  measures  of  inflation  expectations  remain  well  contained,  causing  me  to  raise my  forecast  of inflation over the next few years, despite the higher  forecasted  path  for the unemployment rate.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate that  the  convergence  process  will take  shorter or longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estimate  of  the duration of  the  convergence  process. You may  also include below  any  other explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

By  2015 potential  growth  is  2.4%  down  from  our  current  estimate  of  2.7%  as  the babyboomers  retire  and there are some  lingering  effects of the present  contraction  on  the  capital stock. A reasonable  estimate  for the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4.5%  to  5.5%. We  would  expect,  with  appropriate  policy  and  no  further adverse  shocks,  that  unemployment  to  be  in  this  range  in  2015  and  the  output  gap  around  zero.

We  assume  long-term  inflation  expectations  to  be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's inflation  objective  to be  around  2% for  the  PCE deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Under  these  conditions,  with  the  output  gap  around  zero,  we  would  expect  PCE  inflation  of  around  2%.

Respondent 3:

Convergence  will  make  little  headway  until  the  housing  market  has  bottomed  out,  household  finances  are  in better shape, the Fed  has convincingly  exited  or clearly articulated  strategies for exiting its 'quantitative easing'  programs  without  having  created  an  inflationary  dynamic,  and  consumption  has  begun  to  support solid economic  growth in a  more  sustainable  fashion. The world economy  must  recover  sufficiently  to provide a boost  to  export  growth. It is doubtful  whether  all  of  these  conditions  will  be  met  quickly  enough  that  full convergence  can  be  achieved  before  2015.

Respondent 4:

Convergence  process  likely  to  take  longer  than  five  to  six  years.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

I anticipate that the convergence  process  for real GDP  growth  and  inflation  will be substantially shorter than  5-6  years,  perhaps  on  the  order  of  3  years  for  real  growth  (with  a  period  of  overshoot  of  real  growth  in the  interim  during  recovery)  and  an  overshoot  in  the  interim  in  inflation  as  a  consequence  of  significant  near term  growth  in  the  monetary  base  supported  by  longer-term  asset  purchases  that  cannot  be  sold  off  over  a very  short  time  period. I anticipate  that  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  will  lag  behind  the  recovery of real growth

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8:

Given  the  severity  and  breadth  of  shocks  to  the  economy,  and  the  non-trivial  chance  that  there  are  more  to come,  the  convergence  process  may  well  extend  beyond  five  or  six  years  to  something  closer  to  eight  years.

Respondent 9:

If appropriate  policy  is followed, I would  expect  convergence  to  occur  within  5  or  6  years. However,  I  am concerned  that  delaying  the  removal  of  policy  accommodation  and  shrinkage  of  our  balance  sheet  will  mean

convergence  will  take  longer.

Respondent 13:

Convergence  to  the  real  economy's  equilibrium  and  to  my  inflation  goal  within  five  years  requires  lowering long-term  interest  rates  in  the  near-term  considerably  more  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  baseline  outlook. Absent such a policy action, it is unlikely that the dual mandate's objectives will be achieved within a five-year  horizon.

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15:

At a 5-6 year horizon, the economy  has yet to fully converge for output and unemployment. Given the substantial  weakness  in  my  near-term  projection,  the  convergence  process  will  likely  take  7-8  years.

Respondent 16:

Owing  to  the  magnitude  of  the  forecasted  degree  of  slack  and  the  limits  on  monetary stimulus  resulting from the zero  lower bound  on  interest  rates  , I  expect  the  economy  will  take  about  seven years  for  the  economy to converge  fully.
