Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of  the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of the year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds rate at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  September  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee on September  20-21,  2016. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with the  September  20-21,  2016,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  December  13-14,  2016,  meeting.

- 1. For each  period, the median  is the middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even, the median  is the average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Current  economic  conditions  are  consistent  with  an  economy  operating  very  close  to  (if  not  at) full  capacity. Over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  projected  pace  of  growth  should  lead  to  an  economy  operating  above full  employment,  albeit  by  a  relatively  modest  amount.  Given  the  recent  dollar  appreciation  and  some  persistence in  the  inflation  process,  convergence  to  the  2  percent  inflation  target  is  expected  to  occur  in  2018.

Respondent 3: Our  assumptions  for  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment are  the  same  as  in  the  September  submission.

The  unemployment  rate  is  currently  modestly  below  its  longer-run  normal  level,  and  we  project  that  it  will remain  below  that  level  in  2017-18  before  rising  to  its  longer-run  level  by  2019. However,  our  scenario  analysis  of labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long  expansions  indicate  that  there  is  some probability  that  the  unemployment  rate  could  fall  more  substantially  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  in  the medium  term.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the FOMC  longer-run  objective.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  resource  gap  anticipated  to  dissipate  over  the forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  (on  a  quarterly  basis)  to  be  2%  by  end-2017.

As  indicated  in  our  projections,  we  anticipate  that  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  no  further  shocks, the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  2018. Accordingly,  the  major  economic  variables  are projected  to  be  at  their  longer-run  values  in  2019.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  three  to  four  years.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9: I anticipate  that  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate  and  inflation  will  be  back  to  their long-run  values  within  five  or  six  years.  However,  the  full  macro  convergence  process  may  take  longer  because  the real  value  of  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  -  which  I  estimate  is  currently  near  zero  -  may  be  rising  for  many  years, in  part  because  the  term  premium  effects  of  the  Fed's  asset  holdings  will  not  fully  disappear  until  sometime  in  the next  decade.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12:

I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  five  years.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  or  exceeded  by  2018. However,  it  will  take  a  couple more  years  to  achieve  complete  convergence  to  our  longer-run  projections.  The  effects  from  accommodative  fiscal and  monetary  policy  will  generate  some  overshooting  of  both  inflation  and  unemployment  before  dissipating  over the  longer  run.

Respondent 15: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of 2.0%,  an  unemployment  rate  of  4.7%,  and  inflation  of  2.0%.  Because  there  are  multiple  medium  term  outcomes,  we cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  longer-run  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment.  Calculating  an  average for  these  variables  based  on  multiple  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading.  We  do  provide  a  2.0%  longer-run  inflation projection,  which  is  independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 16: In my  view,  the  economy  has  essentially  converged  to  its  longer-run  path  at  the  end  of 2016.  My  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  is  at  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  the  unemployment  rate has  moved  slightly  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  rate,  and  inflation  is  near  2  percent. Barring  unforeseen shocks,  I  anticipate  that  real  GDP  growth  will  remain  close  to  its  longer-run  rate  over  the  next  three  years. The unemployment  rate  will  likely  decline  somewhat  further  below  its  longer-run  rate  before  moving  back  toward  it.  I expect  inflation  will  stabilize  around  2  percent  over  the  next  three  years.

Respondent 17: Labor-force  participation  is  now  near  its  demographic  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  is roughly  at  its  longer-run  sustainable  level. With  negligible  labor-market  slack  and  with  the  restraining  effects  of oil-price  declines  and  a  stronger  dollar  waning,  I  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2-percent  objective  by  early  2018.  At that  point,  though,  we  will  have  pushed  well  past  full  employment,  and  a  soft  landing  will  be  difficult  to  engineer. If  we  are  successful,  convergence  will  likely  take  5  years.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: Ours  is  a quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are somewhat  wider  than  in  our  September  SEP  submission,  reflecting  heightened  post-elections  uncertainty. As  it has  been  the  case  in  recent  submissions,  the  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  remain  slightly  wider than  the  SEP  standard;  those  for  core  PCE  inflation  now  have  become  modestly  wider  than  that  standard,  taking rough  account  of  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 4: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath. Uncertainty  about  near-to-medium  term  changes  in  fiscal  and  trade  policy  have  slightly  increased  the  uncertainty of  my  projections.

Respondent 5: Myjudgment that the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projections  is higher  than'normal'owes largely  to  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal,  trade,  and  regulatory  policy.

Respondent 6: Fiscal, regulatory,  trade,  and  other  economic  policy  choices  are  likely  to  change  over  the forecast  period. At  this  time  it  is  difficult  to  predict  the  size,  timing,  and  composition  of  the  policy  changes  that will  occur.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Clearly,  the  uncertainties  surrounding  new  fiscal,  trade,  immigration,  and  regulatory  policies are  high. Indeed,  not  only  are  these  policy  outcomes  unclear,  so,  too,  are  the  effects  on  spending  of  the  potential swings  in  financial  markets  and  household  and  business  confidence  that  could  occur  with  the  inevitable  ebb  and flow  of information  as  proposals  get  worked  out. That  said,  though  higher,  we  did  not  think  that  the  level  of uncertainty  has  increased  enough  to  shift  us  out  of  the'broadly  similar'uncertainty  bucket.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Thedegreeofpolicyuncertaintyacrossavarietyofareasoverthenextyearmakesprojections especially  vulnerable  to  factors  other  than  those  endogenous  to  the  current  strengths,  weaknesses,  and  trajectory of  the  economy.

Respondent 12: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  elevated  by  heightened  uncertainty  about  the  course  of  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  reform,  and  trade  policy.  The  impact  on  inflation  uncertainty is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: The  Brexit  vote  has  turned  out  to  be  a  bit  of  a  non-event,  so  far,  but  the  real  risks  lie  ahead. We  may  see  a  re-ignition  of  the  euro-area  debt  crisis,  and  China  continues  on  an  unsustainable  trajectory.  Recent election  outcomes  suggest  a  broad  global  backlash  against  open  borders, which  if  mapped  into  policy  actions,  could have  a  detrimental  effect  on  long-term  growth  prospects. On  the  other  hand,  with  expansionary  fiscal  policy  in prospect  the  ELB  is  less  of  a  concern  than  before. I show  a  balanced  risk  weighting  on  real  growth  and  inflation, and  roughly  average  uncertainty  about  these  variables  over  the  projections  horizon. Because  of  possible  fallout from  overshoot  of  our  full-employment  and  inflation  objectives,  uncertainty  beyond  2019  is  elevated,  with  risks  at that  point  weighted  to  the  downside  for  GDP  growth  and  to  the  upside  for  unemployment.

Uncertainty  about  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  projections  horizon-not  something we  ordinarily  comment  on-is  unusually  high,  with  risks  weighted  to  the  upside.

December 13-14, 2016

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: Ourbaselineforecastfeaturesexpansionaryfiscalpolicyin theformofataxcutwhich, asinthe Tealbook,  raises  the  primary  deficit  to  GDP  ratio  by  1  percentage  point.  While  there  is  considerable  uncertainty surrounding  future  fiscal  policy,  our  assumption  may  prove  too  conservative.  As  a  result,  risks  to  the  GDP  growth outlook  are  tilted  to  the  upside,  and  vice  versa  for  the  unemployment  rate. We  view  this  upside  risk  to  the  real outlook  as  having  only  minor  effects  on  inflation,  and  thus  our  assessment  of  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  remains broadly  balanced.

Respondent 3: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution.  Future  changes  in  U.S.  fiscal  and  trade  policy  that  may take  place  under  the  new  administration  have  increased  risks  on  both  sides  of  the  real  activity  outlook.  However, our  overall  assessment  is  for  risks  to  be  roughly  balanced  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Inflation  risks  have  also  increased  on  both  sides  relative  to  the  September  submission,  but  remain  balanced throughout  the  forecast  horizon. The  rise  in  longer-run  inflation  compensation  indicates  an  increase  in  upside inflation  risks,  but  global  disinflationary forces are still  apparent and could  offset possible  fiscal  stimulus,  indicating there  are  still  significant  downside  risks.  Core  measures  of  inflation  have  been  stable  as  we  had  anticipated  and  we project  convergence  to  objective  just  a  tad  faster  relative  to  the  September  projections,  which  is  consistent  with little  change  in  the  balance  of  inflation  risks.

Respondent 4: Risks  for  output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  effective  lower  bound limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks.  The  low  level  of  inflation  expectations  presents an  additional  downside  risk  for  inflation.  For  the  unemployment  rate,  there  is  a  countervailing  risk  that  labor  force participation  stops  increasing  and  rapid  job  growth  will  lead  to  large  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate;  therefore I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 5: I have  not  yet  incorporated  any  potential  changes  in  fiscal  policy  into  my  baseline  outlook. My  view  is  that  the  lack  of  clarity  over  the  potential  set  of  policy  options  and  the  attending  probabilities  of  those options  was  too  great  to  overcome  at  this  point.

Any  changes  to  fiscal  policy  are  likely  to  be,  on  net,  expansionary  in  the  near-to-medium  term.  Expansionary fiscal measurescouldpushtheunemploymentratewellbelowitsfull-employmentlevel.  Wehavelimitedexperience in  such  regimes  and  the  possibility  for  either  a  non-linear  response  in  inflation  or  for  an  unanchoring  of  inflation expectations  cannot  be  dismissed.

Respondent 6: There  are  a  number  of  possible  policy  changes  that  could  a ffect  the  projections.  For  example, it is possible  that  trade  restrictions  will  lower  GDP  and  raise  unemployment. It is also  possible  that  regulatory changes  will  raise  multifactor  productivity  and  thereby  raise  GDP.  In  addition,  tax  changes  and  reduced  regulatory burden  could  lead  to  more  investment,  and  stronger  growth  in  labor  productivity  and  GDP.

Respondent 7: I continue  to  view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

The  prospects  for  some  changes  to  fiscal  and  other  economic  policies,  such  as  infrastructure  spending,  tax code  changes,  immigration  policy,  trade  policy,  and  regulatory  changes  have  increased. But  the  form  any  policy change  will  take,  the  timing  of  passage,  and  the  timing  and  size  of  the  impacts  are  very  uncertain  at  this  point. The  Tealbook's  baseline  forecast  of  the  size  and  timing  of  the  impact  of  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  package seem  plausible  to  me,  but  the  package  could  be  larger  or  smaller,  and  its  design  will  be  an  important  factor  in assessing  the  expected  impact;  the  longer-run  effects  will  depend  on  how  the  package  is  financed. We  have  few details  at  this  point.  I've  incorporated  a  modest  increase  in  output  growth  and  inflation  in  2018  due  to  fiscal  policy effects.  A  larger  package  could  impose  upside  risks  to  growth  and  inflation,  especially  if  monetary  policy  does  not

appropriately  respond. A  larger  fiscal  policy  package  could  also  impose  some  downside  risks  over  the  longer-run depending  on  the  implications  for  the  budget  deficit  and  therefore  long-term  interest  rates.  A  smaller  fiscal  policy package  would  be  a  downside  risk;  financial  market  expectations  appear  to  be  incorporating  fairly  large  effects. Should  the  package  fail  to  meet  those  expectations,  it  could  generate  financial  market  volatility  to  the  extent  that investors  react  in  a  sharp  way.

Policies  that  constrain  immigration  and  trade  would  have  negative  effects  for  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  longer run,  but  I  have  not  incorporated  these  into  my  projections.

There  continue  to  be  some  risks  to  the  U.S.  economy  posed  by  developments  abroad.  Although  U.S.  banks  have small  direct  exposure  to  Italian  banks,  the  weak  banking  system  in  Italy  could  a ffect  other  European  banks  and result  in  some  contagion  to  financial  markets  more  broadly. The  Chinese  economy  continues  to  rebalance,  which will  be  a  lengthy  process.  Monetary  policy  in  many  countries  is  likely  to  remain  highly  accommodative  in  the  near to  medium  run.  This  will  help  support  their  economies  but  also  result  in  further  appreciation  of  the  dollar.

The  labor  market  may  have  more  momentum  than  I've  built  into  my  forecast. This  could  result  in  a  wider under-run  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  estimate  of  its  long-run  level.  Should  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve steepen  as  economic  growth  picks  up,  the  tightness  in  labor  markets  could  translate  into  higher  inflation,  especially if the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is  slower  than  I've  assumed.

At  this  point  I  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced. Oil  prices  have  increased  since  the  last  meeting,  and tangible  signs  of  a  reduction  in  supply  could  boost  prices  further.  The  value  of  the  dollar  has  strengthened  in  recent weeks  after  having  stabilized  for  much  of  this  year. Further  strengthening  poses  downside  risks  to  my  inflation forecast.  Market-based  measures  of  inflation  expectations  have  moved  up,  but  overall  I  view  inflation  expectations as  relatively  stable  at  this  point.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far,  but  given  the  outlook  and the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an  appropriate  pace, these  risks  would  rise.

Respondent 8: Our  forecast  assumes  a  modest  change  in  fiscal  policy,  but  we  see  a  risk  that  the  package  could be  larger. In  contrast,  we  did  not  incorporate  any  new  trade  or  immigration  policies,  which  we  see  as  a  downside risk  to  growth. With  regard  to  the  private  sector,  our  business  contacts  have  become  somewhat  more  optimistic than  they  were  in  September;  even  though  most  firms  still  appear  to  be  taking  a  wait-and-see  attitude,  the  risks regarding  hiring  and  capital  expenditures  appear  to  have  moved  into  better  balance.

We feel  the  balance  of  risks  to  our  inflation  forecast  are  still  tilted  to  the  downside,  though  to  a  lesser  degree  than they  were  in  September. In  part,  this  reflects  the  better  alignment  of  the  risks  to  our  growth  and  unemployment projections.  The  increase  in  financial  market  inflation  compensation  also  has  been  encouraging,  but  these  as  well as  household  measures  of  inflation  expectations  are  still  uncomfortably  low.  The  recent  appreciation  in  the  dollar is  a  reminder  that  international  conditions  could  pose  a  greater  headwind  on  inflation  than  we  have  assumed.

Respondent 9: I view  the  risks  to  the  outlook  as  broadly  balanced,  particularly  in  the  near  term. Over  the medium  term,  we  continue  to  face  downside  risks  from  our  limited  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks,  given  the asymmetries  created  by  the  ZLB.  However,  we  now  also  face  upside  risks  to  real  activity  and  inflation  from  fiscal policy,  which  could  turn  out  to  be  easier  than  I  have  assumed  in  my  modal  projection.

Respondent 10: I have  assumed  that  we  will  see  more  accommodative  fiscal  policy  along  the  lines  of  the  teal book  baseline  (see  question  4,  below).  Policies  along  these  lines  seem  to  me  to  reduce  the  risk  of  low  inflation  across the  forecast  period.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Fiscal  uncertainty  is  high.  Most  likely,  some  stimulus  will  be  forthcoming  in  2017  that  would boost  demand,  raise  output  growth  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further. However,  the  magnitude  of  any such  stimulus  is  highly  uncertain.

Respondent 13: The  possibility  of  a  substantial  increase  in  fiscal  stimulus  has  increased  the  upside  risks  to real  activity  and  inflation. At  the  time,  the  outlook  for  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy  and  the  higher  funds  rate path  it  implies  have  reduced  to  some  extent  the  likelihood  that  monetary  policy  will  be  constrained  by  the  effective

lower  bound  for  conventional  policy  over  the  medium  term.  As  a  result,  the  risks  to  real  activity  and  inflation  are closer  to  balanced.

Respondent 14: Risks  to economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. We  have  essentially  reached  our objective  of  maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures  and  will  likely overshoot  full  employment  for  the  next  few  years. The  main  uncertainty  is  by  how  much  and  for  how  long. Consumer  spending  is  on  track  for  solid  growth  this  year,  bolstered  by  a  stronger  labor  market.

Fiscalpolicyislikelytobemoreaccommodativeforthenextfewyears.  However,thereissignificantuncertainty about  the  size,  composition,  timing,  and  effect  of  future  fiscal  policy  initiatives.

Uncertainty  about  growth  in  foreign  economies  appears  to  have  subsided  somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  some risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  remain.

Althoughtheeffectivelowerboundsomewhatconstrainsourabilitytorespondtoadverseshocks,thisconstraint is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target  funds  rate  over  the next  two  years.

Inflation risks are also balanced around an inflation path that is slightly higher than in September.  A tightening of  resource  utilization  supports  the  continued  movement  of  inflation  towards  2  percent  and  a  slight  overshooting some  time  afterwards. In  recent  months,  the  dollar  has  strengthened,  which  will  hold  down  import  prices  in  the near  term.  On  the  other  hand,  oil  prices  have  increased  somewhat  and,  if  sustained,  could  lead  to  higher  inflation. The  size,  scope,  and  impact  of  expected  fiscal  policy  measures  are  a  contributing  factor  to  inflation  risk.

Respondent 15: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as  they  may  be  a ffected  by  important regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  growth  regime  is  low. A  higher  productivity  growth regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. We  do  not  see  the  fiscal  and deregulation  proposals  of  the  new  administration  as  sufficiently  concrete  or  close  enough  to  enactment  to  forecast a high  productivity  regime. Such  a  possible  switch,  however,  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion.  If  a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially,  We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict a recession  during  the  forecast  horizon,  However,  such  a  possibility  lead  us  to  allow  for  a  higher  unemployment rate.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  some  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate.  Thus,  we  see the  risks  as  broadly  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a  risk  that  Phillips Curve  effects reassert themselves  and that inflation moves  higher,  It  is  also possible  that inflation expectations,  which  are  currently  low,  could  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation,  In  addition,  much  depends  on  the  behavior of  energy  and  other  commodity  prices.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the  upside.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: The  low  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  has  been  necessary  to  move  inflation  and  unemployment back  toward  our  targets.  This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low  rate  of  productivity  growth and  other  factors. Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring  a  low  federal  funds  rate  for  some time  in  order  to  deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 2: The  gradual  tightening  of  monetary  policy  is  accompanied  in  this  projection  by  a  contraction in  the  SOMA  portfolio  starting  in  the  third  quarter  of  next  year,  as  maturing  securities  are  no  longer  reinvested. Over  the  earlier  part  of  the  forecast  horizon,  the  projected  tightening  of  policy  assumes  an  equilibrium  federal funds rate  that  is  below  our  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent.  Absent  this  temporary  effect,  the  projected  trajectory  for the  federal  funds  rate  would  be  somewhat  higher.

Respondent 3: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  How steep  the  policy  path  will  be  will  in  turn  depend  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

Our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2016,  2017,  2018, and  2019  at 1 / 2 -3 / %, 1  - 1 4 1 / %,  1 4 3 / 4 - 2%,  and  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / %,  respectively;  these  projected  ranges  are  the  same  as 2 in  our  September  submission,  and  imply  a  25  bps  rate  increase  at  the  upcoming  FOMC  meeting.

ff DSGE  model. The  rate  increase  in  December  is  consistent  with  the  overall  evolution  of  the  economy  according  to  our  projections;  moreover,  the  upside  risks  to  our  outlook  are  higher  than  they  were  earlier  in  the  year.  At  the  same  time,  the policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  consistent  with  the  gradual  rising  of  the  path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as projected  by  the  sta

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  our  estimate  of  the  equilibrium real  short-term  interest  rate  over  the  longer  run,  which  we  judge  to  be  in  the  range  of  0  -  2%,  the  same  as  our estimated  range  in  the  September  SEP  submission  and  consistent  with  the  estimates  and  forecasts  from  a  variety of  models. Adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as 2 -4%. Our  modal  projection  for  the  equilibrium  rate  is  in  the  lower  half  of  this  range  due  to  the  combination of  subdued  productivity  growth,  low  longer-term  sovereign  yields,  continued  indications  of  a  global'saving  glut,' and  demographic  factors. These  considerations  lead  to  our  point  estimate  of  2 1 / %  in  the  response  to  question 2 3(a).

We  assume  that  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that  the  exit  from  the effective  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed  to  be  negligible.  Based  on  our modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  sometime  in  2018.

Respondent 4: The  labor  market,  as  measured  by  the  unemployment  rate,  is  essentially  back  to  normal. But  secondary  measures  of  slack,  such  as  the  fraction  of  the  labor  force  working  part  time  for  economic  reasons, remain  elevated,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued.  In  addition,  the  neutral  funds  rate  is  expected  to  rise  from  its currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several  years. As  a  result,  it  is  appropriate  to  raise  rates gradually.  Because  the  nature  of  potential  changes  to  fiscal  policy  in  the  near-to-medium  term  is  very  uncertain, the  changes  I  have  made  to  my  path  for  monetary  policy  only  reflect  surprises  from  recent  labor  market  data.

Respondent 5: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual  rise in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate,  similar  to  that  used  in  the  current  Tealbook.

Respondent 6: With  core  inflation  nearing  2  percent  and  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  longer-run  value, we  need  to  start  closing  the  gap  to  funds  rate  paths  given  by  policy  rules  that  capture  our  behavior  over  the  last few  decades,  such  as  the  Taylor  (1999).  Since  debt-financed  fiscal  policy  actions  are  likely  to  raise  the  natural  real interest  rate,  we  should  be  prepared  to  adjust  rule  parameters  accordingly. I also  believe  that  we  should  begin reducing  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  in  the  very  near  future.

Respondent 7: Thetrajectoryofmyforecastover2017-2018is slightlysteeper thanmy September projection, reflecting  ending  2016  at  a  lower  rate  than  I  projected  in  September  and  my  slightly  higher  projections  of  output and  inflation,  and  lower  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate.

In  2017  and  2018,  I  project  that  growth  will  be  slightly  above  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  somewhat below  my  estimates  of  their  longer  run  levels.  I  anticipate  that  labor  compensation  measures  will  firm  moderately, in line with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  a  variety  of  data showing  that  wage  and  compensation  gains  have  picked  up.  However,  these  gains  will  likely  be  slower  than  in  past expansions  reflecting  slower  growth  in  productivity.

Inflation  is  nearing  our  goal  of  2  percent. Reasonably  stable  inflation  expectations  coupled  with  continued improvement  in  labor  markets  and  ongoing  economic  growth  suggest  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2 percent  over  the  next  couple  of  years.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Given  the  outlook,  I  believe  it  will  be appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  move  rates  up  with  a  somewhat  steeper  trajectory  in  2017  and  2018  than  I  assumed in  my  September  projections. I now  assume  that  the  funds  rate  will  end  2019  at  a  level  slightly  higher  than  my longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent,  but  admittedly  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around  this  path.  Forestalling rate  increases  for  too  long  increases  the  risks  to  financial  stability  and  has  the  potential  to  require  even  sharper rate  increases  in  the  future,  which  poses  it  own  risks  to  the  outlook.

Respondent 8: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  25  bps  at  this  meeting, twice  in  2017,  4  times  in  2018,  and  then  reaching  its  long-run  neutral  rate  of  3  percent  in  the  second  half  of  2019. We  also  assume  the  Committee  strongly  communicates  that  our  rate  path  will  depend  on  continued  progress  in achieving  our  inflation  objective.  These  policy  assumptions  are  the  same  as  in  our  September  submission.  Under standard  policy  rules,  the  changes  in  our  growth  and  inflation  forecasts  would  elicit  a  small  upward  revision  to  the fundsratepath.  However,recentchangesintermpremiaandthedollarrepresentatighteningoffinancialconditions that  reduce  the  need  for  monetary  restraint.  Furthermore,  while  some  uncertainties  have  been  resolved,  new  ones have  emerged.  Like  the  Board  sta  , our  forecast  incorporates  a  modest  fiscal  policy  stimulus.  But  this  and  other potential  legislative  or  administrative  policy  changes  are  still  speculative,  as  are  the  domestic  and  international reactions  to  the  new  environment. Accordingly,  risk  management  considerations  continue  to  argue  in  favor  of tempered  policy  reactions. So,  until  we  see  more  clarity  on  the  situation,  we  think  our  previous  shallow  path  for the  funds  rate  continues  to  represent  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 9: Myprojectionfortheappropriatepathof the federalfundsrate through2019runspersistently below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  value,  for  several  reasons. First,  I  view  it  as  appropriate  to  keep  the  funds rate  relatively  low  in  order  to  achieve  a  modest  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  order  to  help  speed the  return  of  inflation  to  2  percent.  Second,  I  judge  that  the  level  of  the  real  neutral  federal  funds  rate  is  currently near  zero  and  will  only  gradually  rise  to  its  longer-run  level  of  75  basis  points,  even  after  factoring  in  the  effects  of the  easier  fiscal  policy  that  I  have  incorporated  into  my  projection  this  round. Third,  the  downward  pressure  on

term  premiums  from  our  asset  holdings  is  projected  to  fall  steadily  over  time,  thereby  removing  accommodation independent  of  increases  in  the  federal  funds  rate. And  fourth,  risk  management  concerns  related  to  the  ZLB suggest  that  a  gradual  pace  of  tightening  is  advisable  as  long  as  the  neutral  rate  remains  low.

Respondent 10: I  have  added  one  rate  increase  for  2017  (three  instead  of  two)  but  have  made  no  other  changes in  my  rate  path. This  increase  seems  to  me  to  be  justified  by  the  strengthening  of  the  unemployment  gap,  and  by expectation  of  added  support  from  fiscal  policy.  I  have  also  raised  my  estimate  of  the  long-term  neutral  rate  by  25 bp  to  2.75%.

Respondent 11: Although  the  growth  trend  of  the  U.S  economy  has  not  really  picked  up  its  pace,  the  fact that  gradual  growth  has  continued  -  with  a  few  anomalous  intervals  -  for  quite  some  time  means  that  a  rate increase  would  become  a  reasonable  policy  step  at  some  point. This  is  the  case  even  in  the  context  of  continued relative  proximity  to  the  zero  lower  bound  and,  accordingly,  the  limitations  of  tools  available  for  providing  more accommodation  should  be  it  be  needed  because  of  external  shocks.  In  part  for  the  reasons  mentioned  in  my  answer to  question  4(a)  ,  this  seems  a  not  unreasonable  time  to  remove  a  bit  more  accommodation. However,  precisely because  of  the  modest  pace  of  growth,  I  have  not  much  changed  my  expectations  for  appropriate  federal  funds rate  levels  in  the  out  years. Indeed,  on  the  expectation  (well,  speculation  really)  that  the  economy  will  slow  down noticeably  sometime  in  the  next  few  years,  I  have  actually  removed  one  increase  from  the  2018-19  period  relative to  my  September  projection.

I am  not  assuming  any  significant  changes  to  fiscal  policy  in  these  projections. It all just  seems  to  hard  to project  right  now.

ff scenarios  given  low  productivity  growth,  declining  labor  force  participation,  and Respondent 12: In  response  to  elevated  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal,  regulatory,  and  trade  policy,  I  have a somewhat  shallower  path  for  the  funds  rate  in  2017  and  2018  compared  to  September. My  projection  for  the appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  reflects  my  view  that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than has  been  typical  in  past  lifto inflation  that  has  been  running  below  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 13: The  economy  has  made  important  progress  this  year  toward  the  Committee's  goals  of  full employment  and  2  percent  inflation. However,  full  employment  has  not  yet  been  achieved,  and  inflation  has remained  persistently  below  our  target.  Given  that  the  real  neutral  rate  is  likely  to  remain  close  to  0  through  next year,  there  are  important  downside  risks  from  abroad,  and  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  shocks will  remain  asymmetric  initially  (due  to  the  effective  lower  bound  on  conventional  policy),  appropriate  policy  calls for the  funds  rate  to  rise  only  gradually  through  the  medium  term. By  the  end  of  the  medium  term,  with  the recent  increase  in  the  probability  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy  raising  aggregate  demand  beyond  its  longer-run sustainable  level,  and  with  full  employment  and  2  percent  inflation  likely  to  be  achieved,  I  expect  the  funds  rate  to rise  somewhat  above  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 14: The  labor  market  is  essentially  at  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  of  slack. Labor  markets  will  continue  to  tighten  over  the  next  year-with  the  unemployment  rate  falling  further  below  its natural  rate-before  gradually  returning  to  full  employment.  This  overshooting  partly  reflects  expected  additional fiscal  policy  stimulus.  On  inflation,  despite  some  transitory  factors  a ffecting  recent  data,  I  expect  inflation  to  rise gradually  and  reach  our  2  percent  objective  in  2018  and  overshoot  it  in  2019. Underpinning  this  path  is  my  view that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run  somewhat  above  its  potential,  and  that  the  slope  of the  Phillips  curve  is  non-negligible.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the zero  lower  bound,  as  well  as  by  my  expectations  of,  and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2017  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  reflects the  fact  that  inflation  has  been  rising  only  gradually  to  our  objective  from  below.  Beyond  the  near  term,  I  envision a  pace  of  normalization  of  the  fed  funds  rate  that  is  faster  than  market  based  fed  funds  rate  expectations.  The  fed funds  rate  will  overshoot  its  long-run  level  a  bit  in  the  second  half  of  2018  and  in  2019  to  unwind  the  overshooting in inflation  and  labor  market  conditions. Similarly  to  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  Committee  will  cease  to reinvest  the  proceeds  from  maturing  assets  in  the  SOMA  portfolio  in  the  second  half  of  2017.

Respondent 15: Our  small  change  in  the  target  federal  funds  rate  for  2017,  2018,  and  2019  reflects  the  upward movement  in  the  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. We  think  all  variables  have  essentially converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  still  low  rate  on  short-term  government debt.

Respondent 16: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  be below  its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  to  be  at  two  percent  in  2017.  Yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2017.  In  my  view  such  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate promotes  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 17: The  prospect  of  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  incentives  for  public  and  private  investment,  and  lighter  regulation  have  likely  raised  the  neutral  real  funds  rate,  r*. This  increase  makes  the  current monetary  policy  setting  more  accommodative  and  reduces  the  chances  that  policy  will  become  constrained  by the  zero  bound  in  the  event  of  an  adverse  shock. In  response  to  these  developments,  I've  increased  my  estimate of the  longer-run  value  of  the  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points  and  have  assumed  a  steeper  path  for  the  funds  rate over  the  projections  horizon. However,  the  pace  of  funds-rate  increases  may  be  constrained  by  the  potential  for financial  dislocation  in  the  emerging  markets:  High  volumes  of  dollar-denominated  debt  substantially  increase  the vulnerability  of  foreign  firms  to  dollar  appreciation.

The  exact  nature  and  timing  of  non-monetary  policy  changes  is,  at  this  point,  highly  uncertain-as  are  their economic  effects. Consequently,  my  confidence  that  the  funds-rate  path  I  have  specified  will,  in  fact,  prove  to  be appropriate  is  lower  than  usual.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: My  central  economic  outlook  is  based  on  the  performance  of  the  economy  in  the  last  3  to  4 years.

Respondent 2: Incoming  data  have  been  in  line  with  expectations,  and  remain  consistent  with  a  pace  of growth  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  that  is  roughly  one  percentage  point  above  our  estimate  of  potential  GDP growth.  Progress  in  closing  the  output  gap  is  also  generating  a  tighter  labor  market,  with  some  signs  of  a  pickup  in wage  inflation.  Continued  labor  market  improvements  are  sustaining  households'  disposable  income,  while  other consumption  fundamentals  remain  positive.  As  a  result,  an  upbeat  outlook  for  consumption  supports  a  forecast for  overall  GDP  growth  modestly  above  potential  over  the  period  2017-19.

The  current  forecast  assumes  more  stimulative  fiscal  policy  starting  next  year,  with  an  assumption  about the  size  and  composition  of  the  stimulus  that  is  similar  to  the  one  in  the  baseline  Tealbook  outlook. The  fiscal expansion,  however,  is  largely  o ffset  by  higher  longer-term  interest  rates  and  additional  dollar  depreciation.  As  a result,  we  continue  to  project  a  relatively  modest  overshooting  of  full  employment,  with  the  unemployment  rate expected  to  reach  4.2  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. The  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  projected  path  for  the  federal funds  rate  that  balances  the  need  for  probing  for  better  labor  market  outcomes  with  the  risk  of  overshooting  full employment  by  a  larger  amount.  We  view  the  post-WWII  experience  with  soft  landings  from  a  situation  in  which the  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  below  its  equilibrium  level,  both  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad,  as  supportive  of  this cautious  approach.  Our  federal  funds  rate  assumption  is  coupled  with  a  contraction  in  the  SOMA  portfolio  starting in  the  second  half  of  next  year,  when  maturing  securities  are  no  longer  reinvested.

Downside  risks  emanating  from  abroad  are  still  present. The  expected  tightening  of  U.S.  monetary  policy could  also  entail  a  stronger  dollar  than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning. On  the  upside,  the  increase  in  the pace  of  growth  of  final  sales  to  domestic  purchasers  could  signal  a  stronger-than-expected  acceleration  in  activity. Moreover,  there  is  a  considerable  degree  of  uncertainty  surrounding  the  timing,  size,  and  composition  of  the  fiscal stimulus  in  coming  years.  For  example,  a  composition  that  is  tilted  towards  spending  rather  than  tax  cuts  would imply  a  larger  fiscal  multiplier,  and  thus  a  larger  simulative  effect,  than  what  we  are  currently  assuming.  In  sum,  we view  the  potential  for  more  stimulative  fiscal  policy  as  shifting  the  overall  balance  of  risks  around  the  real  outlook to  the  upside. As  concerns  inflation,  the  risk  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below the  2  percent  target  continues  to  be  present. Still,  with  the  economy  expected  to  overshoot  full  employment  and upside  risks  to  growth,  there  is  also  the  risk  of  a  nonlinear  response  of  inflation.  In  all,  we  take  the  recent  progress towards  the  inflation  target  as  signaling  that  the  risks  around  the  inflation  outlook  are  balanced.

Respondent 3: We  expect  real  GDP  growth  to  rebound  to  around  2 1 2 / %  (annual  rate)  over  2016H2,  resulting in  a  Q4/Q4  growth  rate  of  1.8%,  slightly  below  the  projections  in  our  September  SEP  submission.  Over  the  second half  of  2016  the  US  economy  appears  to  have  fully  absorbed  the  shocks  of  dollar  appreciation  and  commodity  price depreciation,  with  both  the  manufacturing  sector  and  service  sector  showing  signs  of  rebounding.  We  project  the unemployment  rate  to  decline  to  around  4.6%  by  the  end  of  2017  and  then  edge  up  to  4.7%  by  the  end  of  2018 as  productivity  growth  gradually  moves  up  toward  what  we  regard  to  be  its  long-run  trend. With  the  economy operating  at  full  employment  and  inflation  expectations  well  anchored  at  the  FOMC's  objective,  we  expect  total PCE  deflator  inflation  to  move  up  to  2%  by  the  end  of  2017,  a  tad  faster  than  in  our  September  SEP  submission, and  to  remain  at  the  longer-run  objective  afterwards  despite  the  slight  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate in  2017-18.

Since  the  election  there  have  been  some  significant  moves  in  financial  asset  prices. The  broad  trade-weighted exchange  value  of  the  dollar  is  up  nearly  4%,  the  10-year  Treasury  yield  is  up  about  65  basis  points,  high  yield  bond spreads  have  narrowed  by  about  25  basis  points,  and  the  S&amp;amp;P  500  equity  index  is  up  about  5%.  The  Goldman Sachs  Financial  Conditions  Index  has  moved  up  somewhat  as  a  result  of  these  movements,  suggesting  on  balance some  tightening  in  financial  conditions. However,  the  associated  narrative  of  these  moves  is  that  they  have  been prompted  by  an  upgrading  of  future  growth  prospects  stemming  from  the  increased  likelihood  of  significant  fiscal stimulus  in  2017,  rather  than  by  an  increase  in  risk  aversion.

At  this  point  we  believe  that  there  is  not  enough  information  regarding  the  nature,  magnitude,  and  timing  of future  changes  in  fiscal  policy  to  attempt  to  incorporate  them  into  our  modal  forecast.  In  addition,  it  is  not  at  all

clear  how  much  stimulus  such  actions  will  be  able  to  deliver  with  the  economy  at  or  near  full  employment,  especially given  the  likely  response  of  asset  prices,  particularly  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar,  to  the  prospects  of  stimulus.

Respondent 4: The  improvement  in  secondary  measures  of  labor  market  slack  we  had  seen  earlier  has  slowed. Because room remains to further  reduce  slack,  inflation  continues  to  run  low  and  it  is  likely to  be  several  years  before it returnstotarget.  Thecontinuedlowlevelofinflation,thebenefitstotheeconomyofallowingfurtherimprovement in  the  labor  market,  weakness  in  foreign  economies,  uncertainty  about  future  fiscal  policy,  and  potential  risks  to the  US  economy  from  international  policy  divergence  all  suggest  a  gradual  approach  to  normalizing  the  stance  of monetary  policy.

Respondent 5: Myoutlookconsists ofabove-trend growth overthenextfew yearsandinflation thatconverges to  target  by  the  end  of  next  year.

Growth over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  a  sustained  pace  of  consumption  growth  and  a  strengthening  in  investment  growth.  This  growth  of  domestic  demand  is  supported  by  continued  firming  in  the  labor  market and  growth  of  household  incomes.

As  indicated  in  section  2,  I  view  the  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  as  weighted  to  the  upside. I am  waiting  for further  clarity  on  the  size  and  composition  of  potential  fiscal  actions  before  I  incorporate  them  into  my  outlook. My  assumption  is  that,  whatever  set  of  fiscal  policy  changes  are  eventually  enacted,  they  are  likely  to  be,  on  net, expansionary  in  the  near-to-medium  term.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  weighted  to  the  upside.  The  prospect  for  additional  fiscal  stimulus  at a  time  when  the  unemployment  rate  is  near  its  full-employment  level  suggests  upside  risk.  Recent  history  suggests that  the  response  of  inflation  to  changes  in  resource  slack  is  somewhat  muted  (perhaps  owing  to  well-anchored inflation expectations).  However, thatmaynotremainthecaseiftheunemploymentratefallswellbelowitsnatural level.

Given  the  lack  of  clarity  about  future  fiscal  policy,  I  view  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projections  as  being elevated  relative  to  recent  history.

Respondent 6: In September  I  projected  real  GDP  to  grow  at  its  trend  rate. I have  raised  growth  in  the current  projection  the  reflect  the  transitory  effect  of  some  form  of  expansive  fiscal  policy,  which  seems  likely.  I  have followed  the  Tealbook  regarding  the  timing  and  magnitude  of  fiscal  effects  on  real  growth. Appropriate  policy limits  the  effect  of  these  fiscal  actions  on  inflation,  but  requires  more  aggressive  rate  increases.

Respondent 7: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  relatively  low  oil  prices. Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  further tightening  in  labor  markets,  more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified  workers,  and  some  increased  wage pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations.  While  global  growth  prospects  remain  subdued,  monetary policy  globally  is  highly  accommodative,  which  should  promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad.

The  prospect  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy  has  increased, but  there  is considerable  uncertainty  about  the specifics  of  the  fiscal  policy  in  terms  of  the  size  of  the  package,  the  timing  of  passage  and  impact.  I've  incorporated fiscal  policy  assumptions  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  and  I  expect  that  expansionary  fiscal  policy  will  provide a  modest  boost  to  growth  and  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon.

After  a  weak  start  to  the  year,  U.S.  growth  has  strengthened  over  the  second  half  of  the  year  and  we  have  seen further  strengthening  in  labor  market  conditions. I believe  we  have  achieved  the  maximum  employment  part  of the  dual  mandate.

Inflation  rates  have  moved  up  from  their  year-ago  levels  as  the  effects  of  past  declines  in  oil  prices  and  the appreciation  of  the  dollar  have  faded. This  path  is  consistent  with  what  the  FOMC  has  been  expecting. I view inflation  expectations  as  reasonably  well-anchored. This,  coupled  with  continued  strengthening  in  labor  market conditions  and  ongoing  economic  growth  suggest  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the next  couple  of  years.

While  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  my  fiscal  policy  assumptions,  I  view  overall  uncertainty as  roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described  above,  while  there  are  a  number  of risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 8: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  healthy  labor  market,  improved  household  and  business balance  sheets,  and  a  modest  boost  from  fiscal  policy  should  allow  for  consumer-led  growth  in  domestic  demand. Net  exports  likely  will  be  drag  on  growth,  but  one  that  we  expect  to  wane  moving  through  the  projection  period. We  expect  growth  to  run  moderately  above  potential  over  the  next  three  years.  At  4.8  percent,  our  projected  level for  the  unemployment  rate  in  2016:Q4  is  slightly  above  our  estimate  of  the  current  natural  rate,  but  we  expect  this gap,  as  well  as  those  remaining  in  some  other  labor  market  indicators,  to  close  as  we  move  through  next  year.  We project  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  4.3  percent  in  2019,  about  a  quarter  percentage  point  below  the  natural rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

Our  forecast  has  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  by  2019,  which  is  an  improvement  from  September. The incoming  data  on  inflation  have  moved  us  closer  to  target,  and  the  eventual  overshooting  in  resource  slack  and our  assumed  stabilization  of  the  dollar  and  energy  prices  should  provide  further  lift  going  forward. In  addition, we  assume  the  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment  to  a  symmetric  2 percent  inflation  target  will  further  solidify  inflation  expectations  and  help  return  actual  inflation  to  target.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 9: My  forecast  is  conditioned  on  several  key  assumptions. First,  I  continue  to  assume  that  the forces  which  are  currently  restraining  growth  -  slow  productivity  growth,  an  elevated  exchange  rate,  weak  foreign growth,  and  restrictive  mortgage  credit  -  will  abate  only  gradually. Second,  I  assume  that  some  significant  fiscal initiative  will  be  enacted,  although  what  that  may  be  is  highly  uncertain  at  this  point. As  a  placeholder,  I  have assumed  that  Congress  will  enact  a  fiscal  package  in  late  2017  that  raises  the  deficit-to-GDP  ratio  by  about  1 percentage  point  for  a  number  of  years,  and  that  this  package  will  have  a  modest  net  stimulative  effect  on  real activity  in  2018  and  2019  after  factoring  in  the  effects  of  recent  movements  in  financial  market  conditions  and  a somewhat  higher  average  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  starting  late  next  year. Third,  I  assume  that  the  federal funds  rate  gradually  rises  over  time  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  (rising)  neutral  rate. Finally,  I  continue  to  assume that  inflation  will  move  up  to  2  percent  over  the  next  several  years,  in  an  environment  of  moderately  tight  labor market  conditions  and  anchored  inflation  expectations.

Fiscal  policy  and  the  accompanying  response  of  financial  markets  are  key  risks  to  the  outlook;  at  this  point,  we can't  be  sure  what  Congress  will  pass  or  what  the  effect  of  its  provisions  will  be  on  real  activity.

ff baseline Respondent 10: It  seems  likely  that  more  accommodative  fiscal  policy  will  arrive  during  2017. The  timing, size  and  components  of  that  policy  are  highly  uncertain  at  this  time. I have  therefore  followed  the  sta in  assuming  a  personal  income  tax  cut  of  1%  of  GDP,  as  a  placeholder. I have  also  raised  my  estimate  of  the  long run  neutral  rate  by  25  bp  to  2.75%. I have  also  written  down  three  rate  increases  for  2017  rather  than  two  in  my September  2016  SEP  submission.

Respondent 11: Most  labor  market  indicators  continue  to  strengthen,  and  those  that  do  not  are  already reasonably  strong.  Although  it  is  difficult  to  read  through  monthly  labor  force  participation  rate  figures  in  order  to accurately  discern  underlying  trends,  the  convergence  of  actual  toward  trend  participation  rates  in  the  last  couple of  months  suggests  that  a  good  bit  of  slack  that  did  not  show  up in  the  unemployment  figures  has  now  been  removed. Unlike  a  number  of  occasions  over  the  last  several  years  -  when  one  factor  holding  down  inflation  faded,  only  to  be replaced  by  another  -  it  appears  as  though  the  fading  of  the  effects  of  the  big  energy  price  decreases  has  not  been o ffset  by  some  new  disinflationary  impulse.  While  the  dollar  could  strengthen  some  more,  further  such  moves  are likely  not  to  be  of  the  magnitude  of  the  earlier  ones.  Thus  what  I  would  still  regard  as  a  tentative  case  for  inflation returning  at  last  to  the  Committee's  target  has  been  boosted  a  bit.

There  are  obviously  substantial  risks  - both  upside  and  downside  -  with  respect  to  policies  that  the  new Administration  and  Congress  may  pursue. External  risks  remain  weighted  to  the  downside,  though  they  have shifted  a  bit  recently  -  away  form  what  was  concededly  only  a  moderate  risk  of  financial  turbulence  from  Brexit towards  Italy  and  its  banks. And,  while  near  term  risks  associated  with  instability  in  Chinese  markets  has  not recurred,  the  persistent  and  still  unaddressed  overhang  of  bad  loans  in  secondary  Chinese  banks  and  its  shadow banking  system  may  at  some  point  manifest  itself  in  a  bit  of  a  credit  crunch  in  the  real  economy,  renewed  financial instability,  or  both.

Respondent 12: My  forecast  calls  for  output  growth  at  close  to  a  2  percent  pace  over  the  forecast  horizon. I expect  that  some  fiscal  stimulus  is  likely  to  occur  over  the  course  of  the  next  two  years  though  its  magnitude  is

highly  uncertain. Consequently,  I  see  higher  upside  risk  to  output  growth  in  this  forecast. The  unemployment rate  falls  modestly  below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  as  the  economy  grows  at  about  its  trend  pace  and  the labor  force  participation  rate  continues  to  edge  down. Headline  inflation  has  been  held  down  by  falling  energy prices,  but  as  the  price  of  oil  rises  in  the  near  term  and  then  stabilizes,  inflation  will  move  up  to  the  2  percent target  by  the  beginning  of  2018. With  inflation  and  output  growth  running  near  my  longer-term  trends,  and  the unemployment  rate  slightly  below  my  natural  rate  estimate,  monetary  policy  becomes  less  accommodative  over the  forecast  horizon. However  accommodation  is  removed  at  a  gradual  pace  in  light  of  economic  uncertainties surrounding  fiscal  policy,  regulatory  and  trade  reform,  productivity  growth,  and  inflation  dynamics.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: The  recovery  from  the  housing  collapse  and  financial  crisis  is  essentially  complete, and incoming  data  indicate  that  the  economy  is  expanding  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  the  meager  pace  of  potential, which  has  pushed  the  unemployment  lower. Going  forward,  the  strength  in  the  labor  market  hiring,  faster  wage growth,  and  gains  in  household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  climate  for  future  fixed business  investment  is  less  certain  given  the  stronger  trend  in  the  dollar  and  interest  rates,  which  is  o ffset  by  likely higher  after-tax  corporate  cash  flow  and  a  likely  lighter  regulatory  burden.

The  expected  fiscal  stimulus  is  likely  to  boost  economic  growth  during  the  next  few  years. Similarly  to  the Tealbook,  I  expect  some  new  measures  to  be  approved  by  the  end  of  the  first  half  of  next  year.  However,  I  assume that  the  effects  of  those  measures  are  less  front-loaded  with  only  a  modest  impact  on  growth  in  the  second  half  of that  year.  In  2018  and  2019  there  will  be  a  more  appreciable  contribution  to  growth-on  the  order  of 1 / 4 percentage point-which  is  partly  o ffset  by  less  accommodative  monetary  policy.  Due  to  the  substantial  uncertainty  about  the composition  of  the  stimulus  it  is  premature  to  adjust  the  outlook  for  the  longer  run.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  a  bit  above  potential.  Output and  unemployment  gaps  were  essentially  closed  by  the  end  of  2015. With  substantial  monetary  stimulus  still  in place  and  renewed  fiscal  stimulus,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for  the  next  few  years  before  closing  at  the  end of  2020. This  overshooting  should  lead  to  faster  inflation  over  the  next  few  years. I expect  inflation  to  reach  our 2  percent  target  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018,  and  to  overshoot  slightly  in  2019. Tighter  monetary  policy  will  bring inflation,  growth,  and  unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the  end  of  2020.

Respondent 15: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  medium  and  long-term  outcomes for  the  U.S.  economy. In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  converged  to  one  of them. The  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  so  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current regime  over  the  forecast  horizon. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent,  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the current  regime.  longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  some  of  the  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession.  If  the  economy  transitions to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may  be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  rate would  require  adjustment. However,  we  have  no  way  of  predicting  when  these  transitions  may  occur,  and  so  we forecast  that  we  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 16: Modal  forecast: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  growth  near  trend in the  period  from  2016  to  2019. As  the  stimulus  from  accommodative  financing  conditions  and  past  gains  in household  wealth  gradually  diminishes,  I  expect  growth  to  become  more  self-sustaining,  based  on  modest  increases in  aggregate  hours  worked  and  a  moderate  recovery  in  the  pace  of  productivity  gains. After  the  rapid  reductions in  economic  slack  in  the  past  few  years,  I  view  the  economy  as  currently  operating  near  full  capacity.  I  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  move  somewhat  lower  next  year,  before  gradually  moving  back  toward  its  longer-run  rate  in 2019.  My  inflation  outlook  projects  an  inflation  rate  at  2  percent  from  2017  onwards,  an  increase  from  the  inflation rate  in  2016  that  reflects  tightening  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  effects  of  past  dollar  appreciation and  lower  energy  prices.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors,  the  current  economic  problems  in major  regions  around  the  world,  and  economic  and  policy  uncertainty  at  home.  I  have  reduced  my  assessment  of uncertainty  about  PCE  inflation,  consistent  with  the  sharp  decline  in  the  option-implied  volatility  of  oil  prices  since the  beginning  of  the  year. The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly  balanced.

In  particular,  downside  risks  to  the  foreign  outlook  emanating  from  Europe  and  China  are  roughly  balanced  by upside  risks  related  to  the  resilience  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  the  possibility  of  a  more  expansionary  fiscal  policy stance.

Fiscal  policy: My  assumption  for  fiscal  policy  has  not  changed  since  September,  as  any  possible  changes in taxes,  government  spending,  or  regulations  remain  highly  uncertain. I do  see  a higher  likelihood  of  a  more accommodative  fiscal  policy  stance,  which  poses  upside  risk  for  growth  and  inflation  and  downside  risk  for  the unemployment  rate.  Considering  this  increased  risk  in  the  context  of  the  known  global  and  domestic  risks  to  the outlook,  I  view  uncertainty  as  broadly  similar  to  the  past  20  years  and  the  risks  around  my  outlook  as  broadly balanced.  With  no  change  in  the  modal  outlook  and  no  marked  change  in  my  assessment  of  uncertainty  and  risks, I have  not  changed  my  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 17: The  transition  to  sustainable  growth  with  low  inflation  is  likely  to  become  more  challenging. As  we  have  discussed  at  FOMC  meetings,  these  transitions  can  become  more  difficult  once  the  unemployment  rate has  fallen  below  the  natural  rate. (Over  the  past  60  years  there  are  no  gradual  increases  in  the  unemployment rate  of any  appreciable  size.) The  exact  mechanisms  are  unclear,  but  probably  revolve  around  levels  of  debt and  physical  capital  that  suddenly  become  problematic-inducing  sharp  cutbacks  in  spending-when  it  becomes apparent  that  growth  prospects  must  be  revised  downward.  With  fiscal  policy  likely  to  become  more  expansionary, unemployment  undershoot  now  seems  all  but  inevitable,  and  it  will  take  unusual  skill  and  a  good  measure  of  luck to  engineer  a  soft  landing.

The  transition  to  sustainable  growth  will  be  complicated  by  a  further  significant  slowing  in  labor-force  growth as  the  U.S.  (and  world's)  population  ages.

December 13-14, 2016

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: At  this  point  I judge  the  uncertainty  around  the  outlook  for  fiscal  policy  to  be  too  great to  build  any  additional  fiscal  effect  into  my  forecast. My  forecast  will  likely  change  significantly  when  the  new administration  presents  its  first  budget.

Respondent 2: Changes  to  the  real  outlook  have  been  very  minor. The  effects  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  in  the current  forecast  are  largely  o ffset  by  a  higher  path  for  interest  rates  and  a  more  appreciated  dollar  than  what  was assumed  in  the  September  outlook.  The  dollar  appreciation  also  lowers  our  near-term  projection  for  inflation,  but the  inflation  outlook  for  2018  and  2019  has  not  changed.

Respondent 3: Our  macroeconomic  projections  have  changed  modestly  relative  to  September. Real  GDP growth  is  anticipated  to  be  slightly  lower  in  2016  than  we  projected  in  the  September  SEP  submission,  largely as  a  result  of  a  markdown  in  2016Q4  expected  growth,  due  to  higher  drag  from  trade. The  recent  labor  market dynamics  led  us  to  lower  slightly  our  unemployment  projections  for  2016  and  2017. Overall  and  core  inflation forecasts  ticked  up  relative  to  our  September  projections:  inflation  is  now  expected  to  converge  to  the  longer-term objective  by  end-2017. As  noted  and  explained  in  the  response  to  3(b),  we  still  judge  that  a  shallow  path  of  the policy  rate  is  consistent  with  these  projections.

Respondent 4: Incoming  data  caused  me  to  mark  up  GDP  growth  in  2016  and  near-term  inflation  has  run  a bit  higher  than  I  expected.  The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  a  bit  faster  than  I  had  expected,  leading  me  to  shift down  my  expected  path  for  unemployment.

Respondent 5: I lowered  my  forecast  of  the  unemployment  rate  because  it  has  fallen  more  over  the  past  three months  than  I  expected. I marked  up  my  2016  Q4/Q4  PCE  inflation  projection  0.1  percentage  point  due  to  the recent  increase  in  oil  prices.

Respondent 6: The  result  of  the  U.S.  presidential  election  along  with  subsequent  developments  in  financial markets  and  anecdotal  reports.

Respondent 7: My  modal  forecast  has  changed  relatively  modestly  since  September.  I've  incorporated  fiscal policy  assumptions  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  and  I  expect  that  expansionary  fiscal  policy  will  provide  a modest  boost  to  growth  and  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon.  I  have  not  incorporated  changes  to  other  economic policies  such  as  immigration  policy  and  trade  policy,  but  view  these  as  risks  to  the  outlook  over  the  longer  run.

The  pickup  in  growth  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  further  strengthening  in  labor  market  conditions  were largely  as  I  had  expected,  but  inflation  readings  have  been  a  little  stronger  than  anticipated. The  latter  give  me confidence  that,  even  with  the  recent  strengthening  of  the  dollar,  inflation  will  move  up  to  our  2  percent  objective over  the  next  couple  of  years.

I  view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as  appropriate  given  that  unemployment  is  expected  to  remain  below its  longer-run  level  and  inflation  is  nearing  our  goal  of  2  percent.  My  path  is  slightly  steeper  than  in  my  September projections  reflecting  the  effects  of  expansionary  fiscal  policy,  which  will  provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth.

Respondent 8: The  incoming  data  on  spending  and  production  since  our  September  submission  led  us  to slightly  reduce  our  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2016;  the  revision  largely  reflects  weaker-thanexpected  business  fixed  investment  and  net  exports.  We  didn't  take  much  signal  from  these  misses  for  our  forecast for  2017  or  beyond.

Fiscal  Policy. We  incorporated  a  modest  degree  of  fiscal  expansion  in  our  outlook. (We  did  this  to  keep  our forecast  assumptions  from  drifting  too  far  from  the  fiscal  policy  expectations  apparently  now  embedded  in  financial market  prices  and  perhaps  also  in  nonfinancial  business  and  household  sentiment.) We  assumed  that  about  1/3 of  the  personal  and  business  tax  cuts  proposed  by  President-elect  Trump  would  be  enacted  in  mid-2017  and  that about  $35  billion-a-year  of  additional  government  purchases  (largely  defense)  would  begin  in  FY2018.  Together,

we  assume  these  policy  changes  would  increase  the  primary  deficit  by  a  little  over  a  percentage  point  of  GDP,  and that  their  direct  impulse  on  consumption  and  government  purchases  would  boost  the  level  of  GDP  by  about 1 / 2 percentage  point  by  the  end  of  2018.  However,  given  the  sharp  reactions  we  have  already  seen  in  treasury  rates  and the  dollar,  we  assume  some  of  this  impulse  will  be  crowded  out,  and  accordingly  boosted  our  projection  for  GDP at  the  end  of  2018  by  only  0.3  percentage  point.

The  incoming  data  on  core  PCE  inflation  led  us  to  revise  up  our  projection  of  inflation  in  2017:H2.  Our  forecast for  somewhat  stronger  GDP  growth,  as  well  as  the  increase  in  inflation  compensation  and  the  repricing  of  inflation risks  in  financial  markets,  also  support  a  touch  higher  inflation  path  going  forward.  (We  would  note,  however,  that that  the  current  level  of  inflation  expectations  is  probably  not  high  enough  to  exert  an  upward  pull  on  inflation.) On  the  downside,  the  appreciation  in  the  dollar  suggests  that  import  prices  will  continue  to  be  a  drag  on  inflation for  a  while. Putting  these  factors  together,  we  are  projecting  core  PCE  inflation  at  1.7  percent  this  year.  Then,  as dollar  effects  wane,  the  economy  overshoots  potential,  and  inflation  expectations  firm  further,  we  expect  inflation to gradually  rise  to  target  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period. Relative  to  September,  this  forecast  is  up  0.1 percentage  point  throughout  the  projection  period.

Respondent 9: My  forecast  now  incorporates  easier  fiscal  policy. However,  its  net  effect  on  real  activity  is limited  because  of  recent  financial  market  developments  as  well  as  a  somewhat  higher  projected  path  for  the  federal funds  rate.  In  addition,  I  have  revised  down  my  expectation  for  real  GDP  growth  (net  of  fiscal  effects)  over  the  next few  years,  on  the  grounds  that my previous  projection  was too  optimistic  about how fast  the  economy would  expand as  monetary  accommodation  was  removed. Finally,  my  near-term  forecast  has  taken  on  board  the  surprisingly large  drop  in  the  unemployment  rate  in  November,  but  assumes  that  much  of  the  decline  is  noise  that  will  be  reverse in  coming  months.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11:

See  above.

Respondent 12: My forecast  is  largely  unchanged  from  September.  I  do  anticipate  slightly  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  over  the  near  term  in  response  to  uncertainty  surrounding  fiscal  policy.

Respondent 13: The  increase  in  inflation  compensation  together  with  the  increased  probability  of  a  sizeable andsustainedincreaseinfiscaldeficitshaveprovidedgreaterconfidenceintheachievementofourinflationobjective, although  there  is  some  downside  risk  that  the  tightening  in  financial  conditions  we  have  seen  so  far  could  outpace the  ultimate  fiscal  package.

Respondent 14: ThekeydevelopmentsinceSeptemberhasbeen increased likelihood ofgreaterfiscalstimulus in  coming  years. My  modal  projection  assumes  that  fiscal  policy  will  push  up  growth  by  a  tenth  or  two  in  each  of the  next  three  years  after  factoring  in  some  o ffset  from  higher  interest  rates  and  a  stronger  dollar.

My  inflation  projection  is  also  revised  a  bit  higher  based  on  my  expectation  of  more  overshooting  in  output  and unemployment.

Respondent 15: Our  forecasts  are  virtually  unchanged. We  made  very  small  changes  to  our  near-term inflation  forecasts  based  on  recent  data  for  2016. In addition,  the  recent  increase  in  the  real  interest  rate  on short-term  government  debt  led  us  to  increase  our  federal  funds  rate  target  by  25  basis  points  for  2017,  2018,  and 2019.

Respondent 16: I have  made  minor  revisions  to  my  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate, and  PCE  inflation  in  2016,  based  on  the  incoming  data.

Respondent 17: As  previously  indicated,  prospects  for a  more  expansionary fiscal  policy,  incentives  for public and  private  investment,  and  lighter  regulation  have  led  me  to  increase,  somewhat,  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run value  of  r*. With  the  idea  that  investment  incentives  may  pay  o ff,  I  have  also  slightly  increased  my  estimate  of  the economy's  longer-run  growth  potential.  In  doing  this,  I  implicitly  assume  that  the  most  extreme  anti-immigrant and  anti-trade  campaign  rhetoric  does  not  translate  into  policy  action.

Despite  a  higher  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  monetary  and  non-monetary  stimulus  is  sufficient  to  drive GDP  upward  at  a  faster  pace  than  previously  projected,  and  to  move  the  unemployment  rate  to  a  lower  level.  The tighter  labor  market  drives  inflation  upward  more  quickly  and  a  bit  farther  than  before.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: I believe  the  administration's  fiscal  policy  will  be  more  expansionary  than  assumed  in  the Tealbook,  but  since  I  have  no  idea  of  how  their  policies  will  differ  from  the  Tealbook  estimates,  I  have  not  yet adjusted  my  forecast  to  reflect  the  change  in  administration.

Respondent 2: The  Tealbook's  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  at  5.0  percent,  is  higher  than our  estimate,  which  stands  at  4.7  percent. Therefore,  while  the  two  forecasts  feature  the  same  projected  path  for the  unemployment  rate,  the  Tealbook  forecast  implies  a  more  pronounced  overshooting  of  full  employment  than our  forecast.

Respondent 3: As  in  the  September  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast andourprojectionsforthekeySEPvariables.  Thesedifferencesreflectinpartdivergencesinsomeoftheunderlying assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts. In  particular,  the  Tealbook  forecast  incorporates  a  substantial  fiscal  stimulus in  the  forecast  in  the  form  of  a  personal  income  tax  that  commences  in  2017Q3. As  we  said  in  our  answer  to  4(a), we  do  not  attempt  at  this  time  to  incorporate  future  changes  in  fiscal  policy  in  our  modal  forecast  as  there  is  not enough  information  regarding  their  nature,  magnitude  and  timing.

The  two  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  are  similar,  but  the  Tealbook  projects  faster  growth  in  2017  and 2018  than  in  our  outlook,  as  it  did  in  September.  Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential  GDP  growth, which  is  below  our  assumption  in  2016-18,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to  a  notably  positive  output  gap  in 2017-19.  Even  though  we  do  not  calculate  precise  estimates  of  the  output  gap,  our  assessment  is  that  there  is  not a  significantly  positive  output  gap  at  that  time.

A  major  component  behind  the  differences  between  the  real  GDP  growth  projections  is  consumption. The Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  in  2017  -  19  than  in  our  projection;  while  this  is  a  long-standing difference  between  the  two  forecasts,  in  this  round  the  discrepancy  is  larger  as  the  fiscal  policy  assumption  boosts significantly  the  Tealbook  estimate  of  consumption  growth  relative  to  its  September  projections.

Another  notable  difference  is  the  underlying  assumptions  on  the  longer-run  natural  rate  of  unemployment: the  Tealbook  assumption  of  5.0%  is  above  our  assumption  of  4.8%. Combined  with  our  growth  projections,  we anticipate  that  unemployment  will  be  fairly  close  to  its  natural  rate  over  the  projection  period;  in  contrast,  the Tealbook  projects  that  unemployment  significantly  undershoots  the  longer-run  natural  rate. This  pattern  is  a counterpart  of  the  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  but  not  in  our  projections.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: in  our projection  the  participation  rate  is  roughly  flat  through  2018  at  62.8%  while  in  the  Tealbook  it  declines  gradually to  62.3%  at  end-2018.  This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  continue  to  differ  on  how  quickly  inflation  reaches  the  2%  objective. In  our projection  inflation  is  at  2%  at  end-2017  whereas  the  Tealbook  projects  inflation  below  2%  until  2020,  despite  a sizable  undershooting  of  unemployment  in  its  projection.  The  considerable  persistence  of  inflation  and  flat  Phillips curve  within  the  Tealbook  framework  appears  to  require  a  prolonged  period  of  above-potential  growth  in  order to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. In  our  forecast,  the  faster  return  of  inflation  to  its goal  reflects  our  assumptions  of  less  inflation  persistence  and  a  stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation expectations.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  a  few  differences  between  the  two  projections.  On  the real  side,  we  continue  to  see  higher  uncertainty  than  normal  in  the  projections  of  real  activity  and  unemployment, whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual nature  of  the  current  expansion  and  the  atypical  policy  environment  in  the  U.S.  and  abroad  keep  uncertainty  about real  activity  above  the  SEP  standard.  However,  we  now  see  the  risks  to  real  growth  as  roughly  balanced,  in  contrast to  the  Tealbook's  assessment  of  a  downside  skew  to  the  risks.  As  for  inflation,  we  now  see  higher  uncertainty  than  in the  Tealbook,  particularly  because  we  have  not  taken  into  account  fiscal  stimulus  in  our  modal  forecast;  however, we  see  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced,  as  does  the  Tealbook.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  significantly  shallower  than  the  Tealbook  path  for  2017-19.  As  discussed earlier in our submission,  we  believe  that  a  very  gradual  removal  of  accommodation  is  necessary  to  support our  projections  and  to  address  risk-management  considerations. In  addition,  our  assumption  for  the  longer-run

normal  policy  rate  is  50bps  below  that  of  the  Tealbook,  as  we  take  a  somewhat  stronger  signal  from  our  staff  models' estimates  of  the  longer-run  equilibrium  rate.

Respondent 4: My  forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  except  that I believe  the  improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  increase  labor  force  participation,  leading  to  more  progress on  the  labor  force  participation  rate  than  the  unemployment  rate. This  would  lead  to  less  upward  movement  for wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the  path  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.  Removing  monetary  policy more  gradually,  as  in  my  projection,  would  produce  a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the  Tealbook.  In  addition,  I  have not  made  any  notable  changes  in  my  assumptions  about  fiscal  policy,  given  the  high  degree  of  uncertainty  of  how it  will  evolve  over  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 5: I have  yet  to  mark  in  any  potential  changes  in  fiscal  policy  into  my  modal  outlook. My projection  has  a higher  long-run  growth  trend  owing  to  a  somewhat  stronger  productivity  assumption. My forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  declines  more  modestly,  owing  to  somewhat  slower  employment  growth. I have  a  faster  acceleration  in  inflation  to  its  longer-term  target  and  I  am  assuming  that  inflation  expectations  are currently  anchored  at  policy-consistent  levels.

Respondent 6: We  hit  our  inflation  target  in  2018,  two  years  before  the  Tealbook. Also,  a  steeper  path  for the  funds  rate  is  necessary  to  prevent  inflation  from  overshooting  our  target.

Respondent 7: As  in  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  labor  market conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term  objective.  My  outlook for  the  real  economy  is  generally  similar  to  Tealbook's  forecast,  but  I  see  somewhat  greater  inflationary  pressures than  in  the  Tealbook,  with  inflation  returning  to  2  percent  over  the  next  couple  of  years  compared  with  2020  in  the Tealbook.  As  a  result,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  to  have  a  somewhat  steeper  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate compared  with  the  Tealbook,  which  limits  the  extent  to  which  the  unemployment  rate  undershoots  its  longer-run value. My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook,  but  there  is  considerable  uncertainty around  these  assumptions.

Respondent 8: Our  Federal  Funds  rate  path  is  about  40  bps  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  period, ending  2019  at  3  percent,  which  is  our  view  of  its  long-run  equilibrium  level. The  size  of  our  assumed  fiscal  policy package  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook.  We  did  not,  however,  change  our  r*  in  response  to  our  new  fiscal  assumptions. Our  projection  for  GDP  growth  over  2017-2019  averages  0.2  percentage  point  per  year  higher  than  the  Tealbook, largely reflecting our somewhathigherassumptionforpotentialoutputgrowth.  Wedonot, however, expectoutput to  overshoot  potential  as  much  as  the  Tealbook  does.  This  is  because  we  see  some  slack  remaining  in  the  economy today: we  assume  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  currently  is  about  4.7  percent  and  will  trend  down  to  4.5 percent  by  the  end  of  2019  (in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's  constant  5  percent  assumption);  we  also  think  that  the labor  force  participation  rate  is  still  below  its  long-run  trend.  Despite  our  differences  in  resource  slack,  our  outlook for  inflation  is  very  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  as  we  feel  our  more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  be successful  at  buoying  inflationary  expectations,  firming  the  inflationary  attractor  and  therefore  providing  a  larger boost  to  actual  inflation.

Respondent 9: The  Tealbook  implicitly  incorporates  a  faster  rise  in  the  neutral  funds  rate  over  the  next  few years  than  I  do.  It  also  assumes  that  easier  fiscal  policy  will  have  a  somewhat  larger  effect  on  real  activity  over  the medium  term,  after  controlling  for  the  effects  of  accompanying  movements  in  financial  conditions.  In  addition,  the Tealbook  assumes  that  easier  fiscal  policy  will  raise  the  long-run  equilibrium  real  interest  rate  by  25  basis  points, where  as  I  have  incorporated  no  change  in  my  projection  of  long-run  R*. Finally,  the  Tealbook  assumes  that  a more  pronounced  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  needed  to  return  inflation  to  2  percent,  in  part because  they  assume  that  inflation  expectations  are  currently  anchored  at  a  somewhat  lower  level.

Respondent 11: I do  not  assume  any  fiscal  stimulus  next  year.

December 13-14, 2016

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the unemployment rate declining  to  4.2  percent at the  end  of  2019,  and with inflation  returning  to  the  2  percent target  only  very  gradually. In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output through  2019,  and  those  gaps  close  in  2020.  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  4.6  percent  in  2017.

The  Tealbook  assumes  that  the  effects  of  expected  fiscal  stimulus  start  in  the  second  half  of  2017  and  are  fairly front-loaded,  with  some  smaller  impact  to  growth  in  2018  and  2019.  Additionally,  the  Tealbook  assumes  that  the permanent  changes  to  fiscal  policy  lead  to  an  increase  of  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate.  In  my  projections I assume  that  the  expected  fiscal  policy  stimulus  is  less  front-loaded,  with  the  biggest  impact  on  growth  taking place  in  2018,  and  no  change  to  the  long-run  level  of  the  fed  funds  rate.

The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows growth  to  below  potential  in  2018  and  2019,  respectively. This  pushes  up  the  unemployment  rate  to  4.8  percent by  the  end  of  2019.  Finally,  the  persistent  overshoot  of  full  employment  pushes  inflation  back  to  2  percent  in  2018 and  a  slight  overshooting  for  some  time  afterwards. Tighter  monetary  policy  brings  inflation  back  to  target  and unemployment  back  to  its  long-run  sustainable  level  in  2020.

Respondent 15: The  Tealbook  forecast  is  in  many  ways  similar  to  our  forecast,  but  incorporates  the  idea  of a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is  converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the economy  transitions  toward  the  longer-run  steady  state.  This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. The  regime  conception  we  use,  in  contrast,  views  monetary  policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is viewed  as  persistent. It  is acknowledged  that  the  economy  may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to those  regimes  cannot  be  forecasted.  This  suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook. The  forecast  in  the  Tealbook  also  has  an  undershooting  of  the  unemployment rate  before  returning  to  its  long-run  value  sometime  after  2019.

Respondent 16: My  projected  path  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017  and  2018  is  lower  and  my  projected  path  for the  unemployment  rate  is  flatter  than  in  Tealbook.  Unlike  Tealbook,  my  projection  does  not  incorporate  a  change in  the  stance  of  fiscal  policy. My  forecasts  for  PCE  inflation  and  core  inflation  in  the  period  2017-2019  are  a  few tenths  of  a  percentage  point  above  Tealbook's  forecasts,  with  the  difference  narrowing  over  time. With  inflation expectations  well  anchored,  I  view  inflation  as  less  inertial  than  Tealbook,  and  therefore  expect  the  effects  of  past dollar  appreciation  and  oil  price  declines  to  wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projections.

Respondent 17: My  projected  paths  for  GDP  growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  policy  over  2017-2019 are  now  quite  similar  to  those  in  the  September  and  December  Tealbook  baseline  forecasts.  However,  I  see  a  more rapid  return  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  than  is  forecasted  by  Board  sta  . In  my  view,  the  longer-term inflation  expectations  relevant  to  wage  and  price  setting  remain  anchored  at  2  percent.
