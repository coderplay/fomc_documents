1. Projections of real GDP growth, PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are fourth-quarter-to-fourthquarter growth rates, i.e. percentage changes from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the indicated year. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures and the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, respectively. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

Uncertainty and Risks

- 2(a). (Optional) If you have any explanatory comments regarding your judgment of the uncertainty attached to your projections relative to levels of uncertainty over the past 20 years, you may enter them below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  standard  deviation  of  FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  GDP  growth  and core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  those  reported  in  Reifschneider  and  Tulip.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

Uncertainty  regarding  growth  and  unemployment  stems  from  the  difficult-to-predict  nature  of  both  the  financial crisis and  the housing  correction. Large  swings  in energy  and  other  commodity  prices  make  PCE inflation  unusually  difficult  to  predict.

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8:

The  persistent run-up  in energy and food prices, and highly uncertain prospects for prices of these commodities,  implies  greater  uncertainty  associated  with  my  pro jections  of  PCE  inflation. There  is  also  greater uncertainty  surrounding  my  pro jections  of  GDP  growth  in  comparison  with  the  experience  of  the  past  20 years  because  of  persistent  strains  in  financial  markets  and  on  large  financial  institutions  and  because  it  is unclear  if  consumer  spending,  in  particular,  will  be  sustained  over  the  next  several  quarters.

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

No  Comment.

Respondent 12:

The  size  and  persistence  of  the  financial  and  oil  shocks  and  the  housing  cycle  raise  the  level  of  uncertainty around  our  pro jections  for  real  economic  activity. The  elevation  in  some  measures  of  inflation  expectations, as  well  as  the  increased  volatility  in  commo dities  prices,  also  raise  the  level  of  uncertainty  about  our  inflation projections.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15:

Uncertainties  about  the  path  for  financial  market  improvement  hence  for  financial  conditions  and  about  oil prices  result  in  heightened  uncertainty  about  GDP  and  overall  inflation.

Respondent 16:

N/A

Respondent 17:

The uncertainty attached to my projections for GDP  and  unemployment  over  the next four quarters is above  average,  after  which  uncertainty  returns  to  average. The  uncertainty  surrounding  inflation  pro jections is about  average,  reflecting  higher  uncertainty  about  commo dity  prices  offset  by  lower  uncertainty  associated with  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 4:

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  pro jection  and  expected  value  from  FRBNY  forecast distribution. Upside  risk to total inflation from  risks to conditioning  assumption  on  future  oil prices and refining  margins.

Respondent 5:

While  we  still  believe  the  risks  to  growth  are  weighted  to  the  downside,  we  believe  those  risks  have  diminished over the past two  months. This  reflects the lack of evidence  that  a negative  feedback  loop  is in train-the scenario  that  had  presented  the  largest  down  side  risk  to  the  outlook  in  April.

We  continue to see the risk of a larger-than-expected passthrough  of energy and other commodity  price increases  to  core  inflation  and  inflationary  expectations.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8:

Although  less  likely  than  formerly,  there  remains  a  nontrivial  probability  that  the  economy  will  contract  in the  second  half  of  the  year  because  the  number  of  'identifiable  negatives'  is  high.

Respondent 9:

My  growth  forecast  is  essentially  the  same  as  in  the  April  pro jection  and  risks  to  growth  remain  balanced. I've revised  up  my  near-term  inflation  forecast. Given  the  monetary  policy  accommodation  in  the  pipeline, the  year-to-date  data  on  inflation  and  inflation  expectations,  and  the  recent  behavior  of  oil  and  commodity prices,  inflation  risks  remain  to  the  upside.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

No  Comment.

Respondent 12:

Despite recent upside surprises for real growth, we continue to view the risks to the forecast distribution for economic  activity  as  skewed  toward  weakness,  as  the  credit  crunch  boosts  a  recessionary  tail  risk. An

upside  risk to overall inflation is consistent  with  a possible  continuation  of  the  recent  surprising  run-up  in energy  and  food  prices. Despite  recent  downside  surprises  for  core  inflation,  we  view  the  risks  to  the  forecast for core inflation as somewhat  skewed  to  the  upside,  as  commodity  price  passthrough  may  finally  come  to fruition.

Respondent 13:

As  in my  last  pro jection,  although  I  see  somewhat  more  downside  risk  on  GDP  growth  (and  upside  risk  on unemployment),  I  do  not  see  the  skewness  to  be  very  large  because  the  tail  risk  is  much  lower  than  it  was  in the  first quarter  of  the  year.

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15:

Growth  risks  are  skewed  to  the  downside  by  the  possibilities  that  financial  conditions  do  not  improve  along the  assumed  path,  that  global  monetary  policies  are  tightened  appreciably  to  counter  the  potential  effects  of recent  increases  in  oil  prices  on  inflation  expectations,  and  that  the  depressed  level  of  consumer  and  business confidence  begins  to  show  through  more  to  spending. The  upside  risk  to overall inflation results from  the greater possibility that oil prices continue to rise, dragging  along inflation expectations. With  respect to core  inflation  the  upside  oil  and  downside  growth  risks  tend  to  offset.

Respondent 16:

N/A

Respondent 17:

The  risk  to  real  growth  is  weighted  to  the  downside  in  the  second  half  of  this  year,  due  to  the  possibility  of a weaker  fundamental  trend  in  consumer  spending  emerging  after  the  effects  of  the  stimulus  checks  wear  off, and  the  possibility  of  a  greater  than  expected  weakness  in  business  fixed  investment.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  interest  rates  differ  materially from  the  interest  rate  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Greenbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

Expect  rate  increases  substantially  more  aligned  with  current  market  forecast

Respondent 2: Yes

I assume  the  federal  funds  rate  is  raised  25  basis  points  at  this  meeting,  and  then  reaches  3  percent  by  the end  of  this year  and  4.25  percent  by  the  end  of  2009.

Respondent 3: Yes

Achieving  an  acceptable  path  for  inflation likely requires a more  restrictive policy than  is assumed  in  the Greenbook.

Respondent 4: Yes

Target  federal  funds  rate  held  at  2.0%  through  the  end  of  2008Q3. By  the  end  of  2009,  it  renormalizes  back to 3.75%, then 4.25%  by mid-2010. In the near-term  the risks around  this path are balanced  but in the medium  term  they  are  to  the  upside.

Respondent 5: Yes

Our  funds  rate  assumption  is  close  to  that  embedded  in  futures  markets. Specifically,  we  assume  the  funds rate  will be  2-1/2  percent  in  2008:Q4  and  3-3/4  percent  in  2009:Q4

Respondent 6: No

Slightly  more  aggressive  in  raising  rates  late  in  2008  and  during  2009,  higher  terminal  point  in  2009.

Respondent 7: Yes

I assume  a  somewhat  greater  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  during  2009  and  the  possibility  of  increasing rates  before  the  end  of  2008.

Respondent 8: Yes

I expect  the  Federal  funds  rate  target  to  increase  earlier  than  indicated  in  the  Greenbook  and  to  rise  modestly more  rapidly  as  well.

Respondent 9: Yes

My  policy  path  is considerably  steeper  than  the  Greenbook  baseline  policy  path  assumption. My  forecast calls  for  the  funds  rate  to  begin  rising  in  2008Q3. It reaches  2.75  percent  by  the  end  of  2008  and  4.5  percent by the end  of 2009. The  funds  rate  remains  at  4.5  percent  in  2010. In my  view,  in  order  to keep  inflation from  rising  and  keep  inflation  expectations  anchored,  the  FOMC  needs  to  be  aggressive  in  taking  back  the insurance  it  has  put  in  place.

Respondent 10: Yes

Appropriate  monetary  policy  requires  an  easier  stance  in  2009  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 11: Yes

My  path  for  the  fed  funds  rate  is  based  on  a  Taylor-rule  specification. It calls  for  a trajectory  that  begins  to rise in the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  and  remains  somewhat  higher  than  the  Greenbook  path  through  2009.

Respondent 12: Yes

I assume  that  the  federal  funds  rate  edges  up  to  2-1/4  percent  at  the  end  of  2008,  and  then  gradually  rises to 3 percent  in  2009:Q4  and  to  4-1/4  percent  in  2010:Q4.

Respondent 13: Yes

Because  I  think  the  delayed  credit  recovery  scenario  is  most  likely  and  do  not  think  that  inflation  expectations are likely to blow  out,  I  have  the  fed  funds  rate  increasing  by  less  than  the  greenbook  baseline  and  more  in line with  the  delayed  credit  recovery  scenario.

Respondent 14: Yes

My  judgement  is  that  the  FOMC  will  need  to  raise  interest  rates  more  aggressively  than  the  path  pro jected in the  June  2008  Greenbook  in  order  to  achieve  a  goal  of  1.5  percent  on  core  PCE  inflation  in  2010.

Respondent 15: No

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

My  baseline  assumption  is  that  the  funds  rate  will  remain  at  2  percent  over  the  balance  of  2008,  and  then increase  to  the  4  to  4-1/2  percent  range  by  sometime  in  2010.

Respondent 17: Yes

Under  appropriate  policy  the  funds  rate  is  likely  to  increase  sooner  than  in  the  Greenbook. Recent  statements by Federal Reserve officials have bolstered expectations that the FOMC  will  react promptly  to inflation pressures, and  market  have  built in two rate increases this year as a result. I believe the Committee  will find it too damaging  to  its credibility to disappoint  those expectations, despite rising unemployment  and lingering  financial  market  'strains.'

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook

Respondent 1:

Significant uncertainty for 2H 2008 with respect to impact on financial institution weakness on broader economy

Respondent 2:

(1) I expect  growth  to  be  below  trend  through  the  end  of  2008,  reflecting  continuing  declines  in  residential investment  and  high  energy  prices. Tight  financial  conditions  linger  and  restrain  growth  somewhat  through early  2009. Strong  export  growth-driven  by  a  decline  in  the  dollar  and  strong  foreign  growth-provides  nearterm  support. Finally,  continued  high  energy  prices  pose  a  downside  risk  to  growth.

- (2)  Over  time,  I  expect  economic  growth  to  be  driven  by  an  accommodative  monetary  policy,  tax  rebates,  a less rapid  pace  of  decline  in  housing,  and  stable  or  falling  energy  prices.
- (3) I expect inflation to moderate gradually over the forecast horizon due to a leveling off of food and energy  prices, and  due  to faster removal  of policy accommodation  and  the  insurance  taken  out  against  financial  turmoil. Since  I assume  the  effect  of  slack  on  inflation  is  modest  at  best,  I  do  not  expect  near-term economic  weakness  to  contribute  to  a  rapid  decline  in  inflation.
- (4) Despite  below  trend  growth,  an  accommodative  monetary  policy,  higher  energy  and  commo dity  prices, greater  dollar  depreciation,  and  a  possible  loosening  of  the  anchoring  of  long-term  inflation  expectations  pose considerable  upside  risks  to  the  expected  moderation  in  core  and  overall  inflation.

Respondent 3:

Commodity-price  increases  soon  begin  bleeding  over  into  core  inflation and  inflation expectations. Policy responds  with  a  series of rate increases during  the second  half of 2008. The  housing  and  financial  sectors undergo  a  long,  drawn  out  convalescence. Banks  gradually  repair  their  fragile  balance  sheets.

Respondent 4:

Our  central  pro jection  has  the  US  economy  experiencing  a  weak  recovery  from  the  subdued  growth  in  the first part  of  2008. Growth  remains  near  its  potential  rate  through  2009-10  implying  we  see  only  a  narrowing rather  than  a  complete  closing  of  the  output  gap  in  this  perio d. Although  we  judge  the  economy  will  just skirt a recession,  the  chance  of  a  recession  remains  high.

Within  the  central  scenario  the  bulk  of the correction  in housing  will be completed  by  mid-2009  and  residential  investments  large  drag  on  GDP  will  be  over  by  the  end  of  2008. The  decline  in  housing  prices  will continue  through  the  end  of  2009  with  about  an  12%  peak  to  trough  drop  using  the  OFHEO  repeat  sales index  (purchase  only). Net  exports  provide  a  boost  to  GDP  growth  in  2008  and  2009.

We  pro ject a continued  very gradual moderation  in  core inflation with total inflation running  well above core  in  the  summer  of  2008  but  then  moving  in  line  with  the  core  pro jection. This  path  is  based  on  inflation expectations  remaining  well-contained,  our  assessment  of  the  FOMC  inflation  objective,  and  the  opening  of an  output  gap  in  2008  along  with  little  evidence  higher  energy  and  food  costs  are  passing-through  to  labor compensation.

The risks to our central projection are substantial. The main short-term one is that the ongoing turmoil  in financial  markets  further  restricts  the  supply  of  credit,  exacerbating  contractionary  forces  which  in turn  leads  to  a  further  tightening  of  credit  conditions  and  so  on. Over  the  medium  term  a  ma jor  risk  is  that

trend  productivity  growth  will  differ  from  our  conditioning  assumption. A  related  risk  on  the  downside  is  a steeper-than-assumed  rise  of  the  personal  saving  rate  resulting  from  wealth  effects.

For core inflation, we see the risks as roughly balanced and for total inflation to the upside. There are risks on  the  downside  if  a  recession  occurs. However,  potential  pass-through  of  higher  costs  stemming  from higher  energy  and  commodity  prices,  and  the  decline  in  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar  pose  upside  risks. Further,  the  behavior  of  some  measures  of  inflation  expectations  over  the  last  few  months  continues  to  suggest that private agents might  have less confidence in the FOMCs  commitment  to  price  stability  than  in previous  periods  during  the  2000s  expansion  when  total  inflation  was  running  above  core.

The combination  of this risk profile, the heightened uncertainty present around potential turning points and the ongoing  volatility in financial and commodity  markets  produces  elevated  uncertainty  around  our central  pro jection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 5:

We  assume  that  financial headwinds  and  reduced  purchasing  power  due  to  higher  energy  prices will hold growth  below  potential  over  the  course  of  2008.

The  financial  headwinds  are  assumed  to  dissipate  as  we  move  forward,  as  institutions  build  on  the  progress they  have  already  made  in  coping  with  problem  assets  and  in  raising  new  capital. The  speed  at  which  these headwinds  ease  presents  a  two-sided  risk  to  the  forecast.

Increases in consumer  energy prices are assumed  to peak relatively soon; this assumption relies on current  quotes  from  futures  markets,  which  have  proved  to  be  poor  predictors. The  associated  uncertainty  over the  prospects  for  energy  prices  presents  a  risk  to  both  the  growth  and  inflation  outlooks.

Under  our forecast for growth, the economy  maintains  a  modest  degree  of resource slack throughout  the projection  perio d. This  slack  is  viewed  as  necessary  to  offset  the  cost  pressures  from  energy  and  other  commodity  prices  and  to  help  keep  inflationary  expectations  in  check. The  ability  of  the  slack  to  offset  the  other pressures  on  inflation  is  another  source  of  uncertainty  and  risk  to  the  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 6:

Consumption  spending  was  surprisingly  strong  in  Q2  Seems  likely  to  be  much  weaker  in  H2,  reflecting  falling real income  and  wealth,  the  waning  effects  of  the  rebates, high  energy  prices, tight credit, and  poor  sentiment. Residential  investment  will  continue  weak  and  nonresidential  investment  will  slow  considerably  from recent  pace. Exports  will  continue  to  supp ort  growth  and  the  negative  impact  of  residential  construction  on GDP  may  begin  to  wane  by  Q4,  but  overall  the  second  half  now  looks  weaker  than  the  first  half. Financial conditions will remain  stressed with periods of improvement  and  retreat. A technical recession probably began  in the first half of 2008, based  on monthly  data. The  jump  in  the unemployment  rate  in  May  was probably  overstated  but  unemployment  will  rise  as  growth  remains  very  slow. Growth  will  be  slow  until  the second  half  of  2009  (above  trend  in  2010)  and  job  creation  will  lag,  as  in  previous  downturns.

Inflation depends critically on commodity  prices, which are very difficult to predict. The best guess is for stabilization  or more  moderate  increases  in  energy  prices,  which  will  lead  headline  inflation  to  slow  toward  the end of this year. There  will be more  passthrough  to core than in the past, as the increases in raw materials will be perceived as persistent rather than transitory. Slack in the labor market, slowing wage  growth,  decent  productivity  growth,  slightly  tighter  markups,  modest  increases  in  rents  will  keep  core inflation  from  rising  much.

Respondent 7:

The  persistence  in  the  increases  in  a  number  of  commodity  prices,  particularly  energy,  have  led  me  to  increase my  assessment  of  the  uncertainty  surrounding  forecasts  of  both  headline  and  core  inflation. The  risks due to the  housing  market  and  the  impact  of  the  financial  turmoil  -  and  a  continuing  concern  about  a  lingering negative  feedback  between  the  two  -  also  lead  to  my  assessment  of  high  uncertainty  surrounding  forecasts of real GDP  and  unemployment.

Respondent 8:

My  outlook  for  '08  and  '09  continues  to  be  influenced  by  the  'headwinds'  episode  of  the  early  1990s  and  the extensive  time  required  to work  off excess inventories  in the housing  sector. However,  I  expect  that  these problems  will  have  diminished  appreciably  by  2010  and  that  the  economy  will  expand  at  a  pace  modestly above  trend  in  that  year. With  appropriate  monetary  policy,  I  expect  core  inflation  to  decline  to  an  acceptable  rate  by  2010.

Respondent 9:

The  recent  data  on  the  economy  have  been  only  slightly  better  than  assumed  in  my  April  forecast. I continue to assume  trend  growth  of  2.7  percent  but  there  remains  considerable  uncertainty  around  that  number. I expect  the  economy  to  pick  up  at  the  end  of  2008  and  get  back  to  trend  growth  in  2009  as  the  housing  correction  unwinds  and  financial  markets  stabilize. I continue  to  assume  a  relatively  small  impact  of  tax  rebates on consumer  spending  in  2008. Given  the recent behavior  of oil prices and  other commodity  and  import prices,  and  the  monetary  policy  easing  already  in  place,  there  may  be  more  upward  pressure  on  headline  and core  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon  than  in  my  baseline  forecast. This  would  necessitate  more  aggressive monetary  policy  than  in  my  baseline  to  restrain  expectations  and  bring  inflationary  pressures  back  to  a  rate consistent  with  my  long-run  goal.

Respondent 10:

We  maintain  a  weak  outlook  for  GDP  growth  over  the  course  of  this  year. While  consumer  expenditures  in April  and  May  were  stronger  than  expected,  we  view  the  current  strength  in  consumption  as  temporary,  with more  consumption  now  coming  at  the  expense  of  less  consumption  for  the  remainder  of  the  year. The  consumption  fundamentals  remain  weak. The  labor  market  is  contracting,  households  net  worth  is  decreasing, and  soaring  energy  prices  are  limiting  discretionary  spending. Moreover,  longer-term  yields  have  increased noticeably  and  credit  markets  remain  tight. In  this  context,  the  fiscal  stimulus  provides  only  a  partial  offset. We  expect  the  pace  of  economic  activity  over  the  second  half  of  this  year  to  be  only  slightly  faster  than  in the  first  half the  result  of  a  diminishing  drag  to  growth  from  residential  investment. In  the  first  half  of  2009, growth  is  still  slightly  below  potential,  as  households  expenditures  remain  constrained  by  declining  net  worth associated  with  falling  house  prices. The  economy  is  then  expected  to  grow  significantly  above  potential  in 2009:H2  and  in  2010,  when  households  net  worth  starts  to  stabilize  and  the  underlying  monetary  stimulus to all interest-sensitive  components  of  demand  becomes  more  apparent.

The unemployment  rate  peaks  at 5.6 percent at the beginning of 2009, and is then on a downward  trajectory for the rest of the forecast horizon. Inflation is responsive  to  the slack emerging  in  labor  markets. As  a result, inflation is pro jected  to decline  slightly below  2  percent  by  the  end  of 2010. This  occurs  even when  factoring  into  the  forecast  some  pass-through  from  high  energy  prices  into  core  inflation.

Risks  to  economic  activity  continue  to  be  skewed  to  the  downside. While  there  have  been  improvements  in financial  markets,  conditions  have  yet  to  return  to  normal. Tighter  credit  markets  have  the  potential  to  exert more  restraint  on  spending  than  is  currently  embedded  in  our  baseline  forecast. In addition,  the  continued fragility  in financial  markets  leaves  credit  markets  vulnerable  to  event  risks.

The risks to the outlook for core inflation are broadly balanced. We  rely on an economically meaningful short-run tradeoff between inflation and unemployment. While there is uncertainty surrounding the extent  of this tradeoff, an unemployment  rate  well  above  the  natural  rate  for  some  considerable  period  of time  has  historically  been  asso ciated  with  declines  in  inflation.

Respondent 11:

The  large  inventory  of  unsold  homes  and  higher  foreclosure  rates  continues  to  weigh  heavily  on  the  residential housing  market,  dampening  the  growth  rate  of  the  economy  as  a  whole. My  below-trend  pro jection  for output  contributes  to  my  forecast  for  declining  inflation  rates,  especially  the  core  rate,  but  I  also  see  evidence supporting  that  view  in  the  less  worker  bargaining  power  scenario  from  Greenbook.

Although downside risks to output growth remain, the primary risks to this forecast are for higher input  prices  and  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 12:

Financial  conditions  remain  tight,  with  elevated  risk  spreads  and  tightening  of  credit  availability. The  associated  credit  crunch  will  likely  restrict  the  pace  of  economic  activity  over  the  next  year. In  addition,  housing activity has shown  few  signs  of stabilizing, labor market  conditions  continue  to  deteriorate,  and  consumer and  business  spending  are  likely  to  remain  subdued. Hence,  the  risk  that  the  economy  might  fall  into  recession  remains  elevated  despite  the  resilience  shown  so  far  by  consumers  and  the  recent  upside  surprises  to  the GDP  growth.

Recent readings on core inflation have been better than expected, although energy price increases have pushed  headline  inflation  to  uncomfortable  levels. Despite  increases  in  some  measures  of  inflation  expectations,  I  still,  on  balance,  view  inflation  expectations  as  fairly  well  anchored. Going  forward,  weaker  growth  in the  U.S.  economy  should  generate  more  slack  in  product  and  labor  markets,  thereby  putting  some  downward pressure  on inflation. In addition, I expect  commodity  prices  to  level  out  around  their  current  levels, but risks are  to the  upside.

I assume  that  monetary  policy  remains  quite  accommodative  over  the  next  year, helping support  growth even  after  the  fiscal  stimulus  ends. In  particular,  the  funds  rate  remains  at  2  percent  until  the  fourth  quarter of 2008,  and  then  rises  gradually  to  its  equilibrium  rate  of  4 1 4 percent  by  the  end  of  2010. Monetary  policy, along  with  robust  exports,  helps  push  growth  modestly  above  trend  in  2009  and  2010. The  unemployment rate remains  fairly  steady  at  about  5-1/2  percent  until  the  middle  of  2009  and  then  begins  to  drop  toward the NAIRU  of  4-3/4  percent. Core  PCE  inflation  is  elevated  in  the  second  half  of 2008  and  early  in 2009, reflecting  some  pass-through  from  the  surge  in  energy  and  food  prices. Core  inflation  then  declines  gradually to 1-3/4  percent  by  the  end  of  2010,  which  I  view  as  consistent  with  price  stability.

Respondent 13:

Although  I  see  a  much  lower  probability  that  the  credit  markets  will  deteriorate  substantially  in  the  future because  I  think  we  are  likely to have  turned  the  corner  in  this  episode  of  financial  disruption, I think  that the clean  up  in the credit markets  will  take  a  long  time  because  they  won't  get  back  to  normal  until  there has been  a recapitalization of financial institutions, which  will be a slow process. I thus find the delayed credit  recovery  scenario  (which  I  think  of  as  having  similarity  to  the  'headwinds'  perio d  of  the  early  1990s) to be the most  likely  scenario. This  is why  I have  slower  GDP  growth  and  higher  unemployment  than  the greenbook  baseline. I am  a  little  more  sanguine  on  the  inflation  outlook  than  the  greenbook  because  I  think there  has been  only  a slight deterioration  in  long-run  inflation  expectations,  which  I  view  as  a  key  driving factor  of  the  inflation  process. I am  concerned  that  inflation  expectations  could  rise  a  little  bit,  but  also  see the  downside  risk  on  GDP  growth. Thus  I  see  the  inflation  risk  as  balanced.

Respondent 14:

The  threat  of severe damage  to  the  intermediation  sector  due  to  ongoing  turmoil  in  financial  markets  has receded. There is still some residual probability asso ciated with this event, but it is substantially lower than  it  was  earlier  this  year. This  retreating  probability  is  shaping  private  sector  expectations  for  2008  and 2009. The  FOMC's  pre-emptive  moves  made  earlier  this  year  were  designed  in  part  to  mitigate  against  a particularly  poor  real  economic  performance  during  the  spring  and  summer  of  2008. That  performance  has been  stronger  than  anticipated,  leading  to  a  more  robust  economy  and  a  more  worrisome  inflation  outlook

than  envisioned  earlier  in  the  year.

Respondent 15:

The  forces  restraining  growth  this  year-tight  credit  availability  as  lenders  conserve  capital  and  liquidity,  decreases  in  housing  prices  and  activity,  and  oil  price  increases-slowly  recede  over  the  next  1-1/2  years,  so  that economic  growth  next  year  begins  to  exceed  the  growth  rate  of  potential, given an accommo dative  stance of policy. The  assumed  leveling  off  of  oil prices and  persistent  output  gap  reverse  the  increase  in  inflation and  any  incipient  rise  in  inflation  expectations  from  the  near-term  elevation  of  headline  inflation. Policy  is tightened  gradually  to  forestall  oversho oting  and  cap  inflation  at  just  under  2  percent.

Respondent 16:

Based  on  positive incoming  data  my  2008  GDP  forecast  is  notably  higher  than  in  April. However,  I still expect  the  housing  and  financial  markets  to  exert  a  significant  drag  on  real  activity  for the balance  of the year and  into 2009. As a result, my  GDP  growth  forecast  for  2009  is  similar  to my  last submission. The possibility that financial market  turmoil  could  flare  up again, the possibility that nonresidential  construction  could  deteriorate  more  than  I  expect,  and  the  uncertain  effect  of  rising  energy  prices  on  consumer  and business  spending  convince  me  that  in  the  near  term  the  risks  to  real  GDP  growth  remain  weighted  to  the down-side.

Although I assume that oil prices will stabilize at current levels, rapid increases in oil and food prices over the first half of 2008 will lead to average headline inflation being close to 4 percent in 2008. I also assume  that  inflationary  pressures  will unwind  relatively  slowly in 2009, a judgment  that  is reinforced by anecdotal  reports  on  pricing  from  businesses  in  my  district,  along  with  the  recent  uptick  in  some  measures of inflation  expectations. These  developments  suggest  to  me  that  inflationary  risks  remain  weighted  to  the upside.

Respondent 17:

The  economy  has  slowed  significantly  but  I  now  believe  it  has  not  entered  and  likely  will  not  enter  a  recession. Temporary  fiscal  stimulus  is  providing  a  temporary  boost  to  activity,  but  that's  likely  to  wear  off  and commercial  construction  is  likely  to  soften  significantly  before  the  end  of  the  year. Recovery  is  likely  to  be slow  in  2009.

Headline  inflation  is  too  high,  and  likely  to  rise  in  the  near  term  as  commodity  price  increases  work  their  way through. Inflation expectations  appear  to  remain  stable  for  now,  although  they  lie  above  levels  consistent with  inflation  objectives  below  2  percent. Appropriate  policy  works  to  restore  price  stability  in  a  reasonably timely  manner. Commodity  price  volatility  will  pose  continuing  challenges  for  that  endeavor.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  judgements  and  assumptions  affecting  your economic  projections  in  the  final  pro jection  year.

Respondent 1:

On  path  of  returning  to  trend  levels,  but  not  at  steady-state  at  end  of  projection  period. Tax  policy,  trade policy  and  regulatory  policy  uncertainty  expected  to  impact  2009  and  2010  economic  performance  negatively

Respondent 2:

- (1) Economic  growth  returns  to  potential  in 2010. Demographic  changes  contribute  to  a  fall in potential growth  in  2009  and  2010. Potential  growth  is  estimated  to  fall  from  2.7  percent  currently,  to  2.6  percent  in 2009  and  2.5  percent  in  2010.
- (2) Core  PCE  inflation  approaches  desired  levels  by  2010.
- (3) Monetary  policy  begins  to  tighten  this  year  and  reaches  neutral  by  the  end  of  2009.

Respondent 3:

Because  of  the  slow  recovery  of  the  housing  and  financial  sectors,  the  unemployment  rate  remains  elevated through  the  end  of  2010.

Respondent 4:

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  are  between  2-2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's  inflation  objective  to  be  1.5-2.0%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  2-2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Potential  growth  is  2.6%  (in  2010 the retirement  of  baby  boomers  begins  to  have  a  perceptible  impact  on  labor  input),  and  that  the  output gap opens  in 2008 and narrows  in 2009-10. Our  extended  forecast also includes some  implicit judgments about  the  likely  ranges  for  the  NAIRU  and  the  neutral  policy  rate. Those  judgments  put  the  neutral  policy rate in the region of 3.75%  to 4.75%  absent  the current disruptions in financial markets  and  the NAIRU between  4.5%  to  5%.

Respondent 5:

We  assume  a  modest  degree  of  slack  will  be  necessary  to  insure  that  inflation  will  fall  below  2  percent  as  we move  beyond  the  forecast  horizon. Accordingly,  under  appropriate  policy,  we  do  not  see  growth  exceeding our estimate  of potential  (which  is 2.6 percent)  in 2010. This  leaves our pro jection for the unemployment rate  in 2010:Q4  at  5.6  percent,  somewhat  above  our  assumption  for  the  NAIRU  (which  is  5.0  percent).

Respondent 6:

The  growth  estimate  for  2010  is  above  my  estimate  of  potential  growth,  which  is  about  2.8,  as  it  reflects  a cyclical  recovery. The  unemployment  rate  in  2010  is  above  my  estimate  of  the  NAIRU  (around  4.8)  because job growth  will  lag  the  recovery. The  core  inflation  projection  in  2010  reflects  my  views  on  the  operational definition  of  price  stability; I have  the  overall  inflation  rate  in  2010  slightly  higher  reflecting  continued  momentum  in  food  and  energy  prices.

Respondent 7:

My  judgments  and  assumptions  are  largely  consistent  with  those  in  the  Greenbook, except  that I assume the  federal  funds  rate  is  higher  in  2009  and  2010.

Respondent 8:

The financial headwinds will have diminished significantly by 2010 and the adjustment in housing will be largely complete, permitting  the underlying  resilience and flexibility of the economy  to  show  through. Monetary  policy will have acted, and will be positioned, to resist any material deterioration in inflation

expectations  or  appreciable  acceleration  in  core  inflation.

Respondent 9:

Real output  is growing  at about  a trend pace of 2.7 percent in 2010, the unemployment  rate  is  about  at its natural  rate of 5 to 5.25 percent, and  inflation is running  above  my  long-term  goal  of  1.5  percent. As mentioned  in  4(a),  accommo dative  monetary  policy  may  lead  to  upward  pressure  on  core  inflation  and  raises the risk that  inflation  expectations  begin  to  move  upward. If this happens,  monetary  policy  would  have  to tighten  more  in  2009  than  in  my  baseline  forecast  and  possibly  remain  above  a  neutral  rate  in  2010  to  keep inflation  and  inflation  expectations  from  rising.

Respondent 10:

Potential  GDP  growth  is  2 1 2 percent. The  NAIRU  is  4 3 4 percent. The  target  inflation  rate  is  2.0  percent.

Respondent 11:

I have defined appropriate  policy  over  this horizon  as one that is consistent with achieving  PCE  inflation slightly  less  than  2  percent  and  I  have  adopted  assumptions  for  labor  productivity  and  employment  growth that  are  consistent  with  potential  GDP  growth  of  2.6  percent.

Respondent 12:

In 2010, my  forecast  shows  inflation  that is consistent  with  price stability. By  the end  of 2010, real GDP growth,  the  unemployment  rate,  and  the  real  funds  rate  are  at  or  near  their  long-run  sustainable  levels.

Respondent 13:

Long-run  inflation  objective  at  2%,  NAIRU  at  4.75%  and  potential  GDP  same  as  in  greenbook.

Respondent 14:

The  2010  numbers  place  output  growth  at  the  steady  state  rate  and  core  inflation  at  target. Overall  PCE inflation  remains  elevated  because  of  longer-term  relative  price  changes  in  the  energy  sector.

Respondent 15:

potential output  increases at 2.5 percent; the NAIRU  is  4.75  percent; inflation a little below  2 percent  is consistent  with  price  stability.

Respondent 16:

My  2010  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  roughly  corresponds  to  my  estimate  of  potential  growth.

My  2010  projection  for  headline  inflation  is  in  the  range  of  my  preferred  long-run  inflation  rate.

Respondent 17:

Trend  real  GDP  growth  is  around  2.7  percent,  and  the  average  realized  PCE  inflation  rate  in  2010  under  an appropriate  monetary  policy  is  1.5  percent.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook

Respondent 1:

Expect  weaker  growth  and  higher  inflation  in  2009  than  GB  forecasts

Respondent 2:

- (1) My  outlook  for growth  in 2008 is less pessimistic than Greenbook. In particular, I expect real GDP growth  will  remain  stable  in  the  second  half  while  Greenbook  expects  a  significant  decrease  in  growth. For core  inflation,  I  am  more  concerned  about  the  upside  risks  than  appears  to  be  the  case  in  Greenbook.
- (2)  I expect  a  faster  removal  of  policy  accommodation  and  the  insurance  taken  out  against  financial  turmoil than  Greenbook,  with  the  federal  funds  rate  reaching  neutral  (approximately  4  1/4  percent)  by  the  end  of 2009. As a result, I expect  real GDP  growth  will  be  at  potential in 2010, rather than  significantly above potential  as  forecast  in  Greenbook. I also expect  core  PCE  inflation  will  be  lower  in  2010  than  Greenbook.

Respondent 3:

Core  inflation  follows  a  path  similar  to  that  in  the Greenbook  baseline  forecast,  but  only  because  policy  is tightened  more  quickly. Continuing  increases  in  food  and  energy  prices  mean  that  headline  inflation  retreats more  gradually  than  in  the  Greenbook. Persistent  headwinds  from  high  energy  prices  and  the  recapitalization  of the  banking  system  imply  an  extended  period  of  sluggish  growth.

Respondent 4:

We  pro ject  slightly  higher  trend  growth  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline in the labor force participation rate will occur later and more slowly than in the GB.  We  assume  lower inflation  persistence  than  does  the  GB.  In  terms  of  the  short-term  forecast  we  pro ject  lower  core  and  total inflation  in 2008H2. The  difference  for  total  inflation  appears  to  be  driven  by  lower  assumptions  on  energy prices  (we  assume  average  oil  prices  slightly  below  current  future  prices)  and  markups  by  refiners.

Respondent 5:

We  do  not  think  that  negative  influences  from  credit  conditions  and  higher  energy  prices  are  severe  enough to reduce  growth  in  2008:H2  to  the  degree  assumed  in  the  Greenbook. We  also  think  that  a  more  aggressive path  of  policy  tightening  will  be  necessary  to  keep  inflation  and  inflationary  expectations  in  check.

Respondent 6:

My  estimate  of  potential  growth  was  above  the  Greenbook  until  this  round;  staff  have  moved  their  estimate up  close  to  mine  in  this  iteration. I am  a  bit  more  pessimistic  about  near-term  growth  because  I  see  recession dynamics  taking  hold  and  expect  significant  restraint  from  credit  conditions.

Respondent 7:

No  important  differences.

Respondent 8:

The  differences  are  minor.

Respondent 9:

I assume the labor force grows at about 0.8 percent per year. Nonfarm  payroll employment  declines in 2008Q2,  is flat in 2008Q3,  and  rises  by an average  of about  54  thousand  jobs  per  month  in  2008Q4. The Greenbook  has payrolls declining by about 33 thousand  jobs per month  in 2008Q3  and  2008Q4. In my forecast,  employment  rebounds  to  a  better  than  120  thousand  jobs  per  month  pace  in  2009  and  2010. The

Greenbook  has  weaker  employment  growth  than  this.

Respondent 10:

We  concur  with  the  Greenbook  that  activity  is  likely  to  remain  weak  at  least  for  the  rest  of  this  year, and possibly  also  for  the  first  half  of 2009.

Differences  in the inflation outlook  are slightly more  significant, and  they are essentially the result of our lower  implied  sacrifice  ratio.

Respondent 11:

Over  the  balance  of  the  forecast  horizon,  my  pro jections  for  output  and  inflation  are  broadly  similar  to  the Greenbook.

Respondent 12:

The  broad  contours  of  the  forecast  are  similar  to  the  Greenbooks. The  most  important  differences  are  that  I am  slightly  more  optimistic  on  inflation,  reflecting  my  view  that  inflation  expectations  have  drifted  upwards by less than the Greenbook  has  assumed; and because I expect the economy  to converge to its long-run values  more  quickly  than  Greenbook  assumes.

Respondent 13:

I see a somewhat  slower  recovery  because  I  think  the  clean  up  of  the  financial  system  will  take  a  long  time and  will  be  a  drag  (headwind)  on  growth  along  the  lines  of  the  delayed  credit  recovery  scenario.

Respondent 14:

Relative to the June Greenbook, this forecast envisions a stronger real economy  and  a more challenging inflation  scenario. The  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  would  have  to  rise  more  aggressively  in  this  forecast if the  2010  outcomes  are  to  be  achieved.

Respondent 15:

less recessionary  tendencies  in  the  second  half  of  this  year; a reversal  of the recent  upcreep  in  inflation  expectations  once  energy  prices  level  off.

Respondent 16:

NA

Respondent 17:

The  key  difference  is  a  more  hawkish  policy  assumption  which  results  in  a  more  subdued  recovery  and  lower final year  inflation.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

No  material  changes

Respondent 2:

My  outlook  for  first  half  growth  has  been  revised  upwards  despite  higher  energy  prices. The  upward  revision reflects  first  quarter  growth  that  is  stronger  than  I  expected  and  an  upward  revision  to  my  estimate  of  second quarter  growth. However,  my  outlo ok  for  growth  in  2009  and  2010  is  relatively  unchanged. My  outlook  for PCE  inflation  in  the  first  half  is  somewhat  higher  and  my  outlook  for  core  PCE  inflation  is  somewhat  lower than  last  time,  again  reflecting  recent  economic  developments.

Respondent 3:

More-resilient-than-expected  consumer  spending  is responsible for an upward  revision to near-term GDP growth.

Respondent 4:

In  April  we  pro jected  the  US  economy  would  experience  a  mild  recession  in  the  first  half  of  the  year. Relative to our  April  forecast,  the  labor  market  has  been  stronger  (we  view  the  out-sized  jump  in  the  unemployment rate  in  May  as  a  seasonal  quirk),  household  spending  outside  of  autos  has  been  firmer,  business  spending  has been  little better  and  housing  data  has  not  been  materially  worse  than  our  forecast. These  data  combined with  the  confirmed  strength  of  net  exports  makes  it  most  likely  a  recession  has  been  avoided. In addition,  if a recession  still  does  occur  it  is  more  likely  to  be  mild.

Incoming  data  since  April  were  consistent  with  our  core  inflation  forecast  in  the  near  term  but  higher  energy prices have  slightly  increased  the  forecast  for  core in 2008H2. Energy  prices  have  continued  to  surprise  on the upside  and  we  have  increased  the  forecast  for total inflation and  now  assess  the risks to the upside  in the  near  term.

The  policy  path  underlying  our  central  pro jection  is  unchanged  in  the  near-term  but  we  have  slightly  steepened  the  assumed  path  for  renormalization  of  real  interest  rates  in  light  of  the  tentative  signs  of  stabilization and  pro jected  higher  readings  on  total  inflation.

Respondent 5:

The  incoming  data  on  the  real  economy  and  the  improvements  in  financial  market  conditions  have  caused  us to mark  up  our  outlook  for  growth  in  2008. We  feel  these  changes  more  then  offset  the  dampening  influence on demand  from  higher  energy  prices. That  said, the higher  prices for energy  and  other  commo dities  and the  increasing  risk  that  inflation  expectations  have  moved  up  a  bit  have  caused  us  to  raise  our  forecasts  for both  total  and  core  PCE.

Respondent 6:

Modest  improvement  in financial markets and stronger-than-exp ected incoming data led me to raise my growth  forecast  for  2008,  especially  the  first  half. Otherwise  the  general  contour  of  my  forecast  is  not  much changed.

Respondent 7:

My  main  changes  are  in  a higher real GDP  forecast  for  2008  and  higher  headline  inflation in 2008. Both of these have been driven by the data received since the last FOMC.  My  longer  term  projections  remain little changed. I also have changed  the increased the uncertainty around  the inflation outlook given the movements  in  commodity  prices,  particularly  energy.

Respondent 8:

There  are  three changes  worth  noting. My  forecast  of real growth  for  2008  is back  up  (approximately)  to the January  pro jection,  reflecting  the  better-than-anticipated  performance  of  the  economy  in  the  first  half of this year. And,  in light of somewhat  better  prosp ects  for  2008, I raised my  outlook  for  growth  in  2009 marginally  as  well. Finally,  PCE  inflation  in  2008  is  expected  to  run  higher  than  earlier  anticipated  because of developments  in  energy  and  other  commo dity  prices.

Respondent 9:

The  incoming  data  on  the  real economy  have  largely  been  consistent  with  my  April  pro jection. However, recent readings  on inflation, inflation expectations,  oil prices, and  other commodity  prices  have  led  me  to revise  upward  my  estimate  of  near-term  inflation. Consequently,  my  path  for  the  funds  rate  is  steeper  than in the  last  forecast. I now  assume  the  FOMC  begins  raising  the  funds  rate  in  2008Q3. Accommodative  monetary policy risks unanchoring  inflation  expectations  so  the funds rate needs to increase over the forecast horizon  to  4.5  percent  by  the  end  of  2009.

Respondent 10:

The  differences are small. More  growth  in the first half of this year comes  at the expense  of less growth in 2008:H2. Consequently,  the  outlook  for economic  activity this year is unchanged. Over  the remaining of the forecast  horizon,  we  pro ject  some  more  labor  market  slack  than  previously  thought. This  additional slack  offsets  pressures  to  core  inflation  stemming  from  higher  energy  prices. As  a  result,  the  outlo ok  for  core inflation  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 11:

Incoming  data  led  me  to  revise  up  my  pro jections  for  BFI  and  PCE  in  the  first  half  of  2008. Higher  prices  for energy  and  some  other  commo dity  have  caused  me  to  increase  my  headline  inflation  pro jections  throughout the  balance  of  the  forecast  period.

Respondent 12:

Recent  data  on  second-quarter  activity  have  been  stronger  than  I  expected,  and  readings  on  core  inflation have  been  a bit lower than  I expected. However,  the  surge  in commodity  prices  (particularly  the  roughly $25/barrel  jump  in  the  path  of  oil  prices)  has  boosted  my  2008  forecast  for  headline  inflation  substantially, and  my  2008  forecast  for  core  inflation  modestly. Higher  energy  prices  will  also  dampen  growth  a  bit  in  the second  half  of  2008  and  early  2009. Taken  together,  I  have  raised  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2008 by about 1 2 percentage  point  and  reduced  it in 2009 by about  0.1 percentage  point. At the same  time, I have  raised  my  PCE  inflation  forecast  for  2008  by  a  bit  less than  1 percentage  point,  with  a  more  modest increase  in  2009. However,  the  pass-through  of  higher  food  and  energy  prices  remains  fairly  modest,  and  my core  inflation  forecast  in  2009  has  edged  up  only  slightly.

Respondent 13:

My  forecast  has  only  changed  because  of  the  stronger  growth  we  have  been  seeing  in  this  quarter. However, as with  the greenbook,  I  see some  payback  and  so  have  lower  growth  in  2009  and  2010. I have  raised my inflation  forecast  (only  slightly  for  core)  because  of  higher  energy  prices  and  a  slight  uptick  (10  basis  points) in long-run  expected  inflation.

Respondent 14:

Some  of  the  news  on  headline  inflation  has  been  worse  than  anticipated  in  the  previous  forecast,  but  much of the  forecast  remains  the  same.

Respondent 15:

Stronger  than  expected  growth  in  the  first  half  of this year and  a greater  rise in oil prices account  for  the higher  growth  rate  and  higher  headline  inflation  for  2008. Rates  of  increase  in  output  and  prices  and  unemployment  rates  for  2009  and  2010  are  not  materially  different  from  my  previous  projections.

Respondent 16:

As  a  result  of  generally  positive  incoming  data  I  have  revised  up  my  2008  H1  real  GDP  forecast  by  150  basis points. However,  I  assume  that  the  effects  of  higher  energy  prices  offset  these  positive  surprises  in  the  second half of the  year,  leaving  my  2008  H2  forecast  essentially  unchanged.

As  a result  of continued  increases  in  energy  prices  I  have  revised  my  2008  headline  inflation  forecast  higher by  90  basis  points. In addition,  hints  of  increases  in  inflation  expectations  and  accumulating  reports  I  have received  about  anticipated  cost-based  pricing  decisions  by  businesses  leads  to  me  to  raise  my  2009  forecast for both core and headline inflation by 20 basis points. These developments  also cause me to assume  a steeper  tra jectory  for  the  funds  rate  during  2009  in  order  to  return  inflation  to  my  preferred  range  in  2010.

Respondent 17:

Unexp ectedly  favorable  data  on household  spending, personal income, private nonresidential  construction and  new  orders  have  led  me  to  raise  my  forecasts  for  consumption  and  business  fixed  investment. Unfavorable readings  on  inflation and  inflation expectations  have  led  me  to  mark  up  my  inflation  and  policy  rate forecasts  as  well.
