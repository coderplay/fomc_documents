Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The June projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on June 19-20, 2012.

- 1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In June 2012, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 were, respectively, 3, 3, 7, and 6. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 4 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 5: In my  view,  real  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  converge  in  3.5  to 4 years,  while  PCE  inflation  will  converge  quicker,  likely  in  2013.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16: Convergence  to  the  longer-run  levels of the unemployment  rate  and  inflation  is expected  in  about  5  years.

Respondent 17: Our  current estimate of the economy's  potential  growth  rate is in the 2%  to 2 1 2 / %  range,  which  was  not  revised  following  the  annual  revisions  of  the  GDP  and  productivity  data. By  2017-18  we  anticipate  potential  growth  of  around  2 1 4 / %. A  reasonable  estimate  of  the  long-run unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%. Assuming  appropriate  policy  and  no  further  significant  shocks,  we expect the unemployment  rate  to  be  in this range and the output  gap to be around  zero by 201718; analysis of recent long expansions  (1980s  and  1990s) suggests the unemployment  rate  could  be somewhat  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator and  around 2.5%  for the CPI.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  be  near  zero, we expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  close  to  2%  in  2017-18.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: I believe  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  forecasts  of  GDP  growth,  unemployment, and  inflation  remains  elevated  relative  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20 years, primarily  reflecting  the  crisis in Europe  and  the  fiscal  problems  facing  the  United  States  next  year.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: Several  factors  contribute to heightened uncertainty, including  the European  debt crisis, U.S.  fiscal policy  (near-term  and  longer-term),  slowing  world  growth,  and  ongoing  changes  in the regulatory  environment. In addition, the Federal  Reserve's unconventional policies  are a source of uncertainty  because  they have no historical precedent.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for economic  activity is elevated relative to its average  over  the  past  20  years. My  assessment  includes  the  following  factors:

- (i) The'new normal'for  macroeconomic relationships going forward  remains unclear.  For example, there is greater  uncertainty  than usual about the  level  and growth rate of potential  output.
- (ii) The evolution of Europe's crises remains impossible to predict and is a  wild-card in the forecast. For  example,  in  some  scenarios,  financial  market  contagion  to  the  United  States  could  be  severe. At the  same  time,  other  major  economies  in  the  world,  such  as  China,  are  slowing.
- (iii) Domestically, a downside risk is a U.S. political stalemate that leads to abruptly  contractionary fiscal policy.
- (iv) In the event of adverse shocks, there is  limited ability for  monetary  and fiscal policy to dampen the  effects. This  limited  scope  for  countercyclical  policy  implies  greater  variance  in  outcomes.
- (v) Of course, there are upside risks to the outlook as well. For example, the housing market may  be poised to improve faster than expected, which  could potentially encourage a virtuous cycle of improving  confidence,  fundamentals,  and  financial  conditions.

In contrast,  underlying  inflation  is  anchored  by  quite  stable  inflation  expectations. The  stability of these  expectations has been reinforced by  the  announcement of a 2 percent numerical objective  for inflation. Hence,  uncertainty  about  core  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades. Uncertainty about  headline  inflation is broadly  similar  to the past two decades, reflecting the lower uncertainty about  underlying  inflation  that  is  offset  by  greater-than-usual  uncertainty  about  oil  prices.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Uncertainty  about  growth  and  unemployment  reflects  uncertainties  about  Europe, US fiscal policy, developments in EMEs, and  our lack of experience  with recoveries from financial crises in developed  economies. Core inflation  remains quite  stable, reflecting  stable inflation  expectations and  limited passthrough of  commodity prices. However, uncertainty  about the degree of slack  creates some  uncertainty  about  inflation, as does uncertainty  about  the  effects  of unconventional  monetary policies. Overall inflation is relatively uncertain because of the volatility of  commodity prices, which depend  sensitively  on  changes  in  global  growth  and  financial  conditions.

Respondent 9: It is not clear that real output will grow appreciably and persistently above its longer-term trend in this recovery. Inflation expectations are probably  more firmly anchored  following the  FOMC's  consensus  statement,  and  uncertainty  is  thus  lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: The possibility  that the European debt crisis is not resolved in  an  orderly  fashion continues to be a risk to the forecast. There is uncertainty about domestic fiscal policy as well. It remains  the case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and uncertainties surrounding  the  future  path  of policy, including  the timing  of the exit from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Uncertainty  was  unusually  low  in  the  past  twenty  years.

Respondent 14: Given the uncertainty about future fiscal policy, 'forecasting' how slack  and GDP growth  will  evolve  beyond  2012  is  almost  pure  guesswork.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16:

N/A

Respondent 17: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  standard  deviation  of  the  FRBNY  forecast distribution  for GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  the  forecast  errors over the last 20 years. Our  assessment of the uncertainty for  all of these projections under  our appropriate policy path has decreased  some  since  the  June  SEP.  In  part, this reflects our view  of the appropriate  monetary policy  path  providing  insurance  against  realizations  of  some  of  the  downside  risks.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: I believe the risks are weighted  primarily to the downside  for GDP  growth  and inflation and  to the upside for unemployment. In the medium  term, the potential for a severe crisis in Europe  and  a  fiscal  meltdown  in  the  United  States  pose  large  downside  risks  to  growth  and  inflation and  upside  risks  to  unemployment.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: The  risks to GDP  growth  are  weighted  to  the  downside, and the risks to unemployment  are  weighted  to  the  upside. Downside  risks  to  growth  (and  upside  risks  to  unemployment) in the near  term include the European  debt  crisis, a slowdown in  emerging  market growth,  and the fiscal cliff in the  United  States. In the  medium  term,  I  see  the  risks  to  growth  and  unemployment  as balanced  with  the  resolution  of  uncertainty  and  headwinds  posing  upside  risks  to  growth  (downside risks to unemployment)  offset  by  downside  risks  to growth  (upside  risks to unemployment)  from  a possible  spillover of near  term  risks into the medium  term. The  risks to inflation are skewed  to  the upside due to the highly accommodative  stance  of monetary  policy and short-term and long-term fiscal imbalances.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Risks  to growth  are  skewed  to  the  downside  and, consequently,  to  the  upside  for unemployment. Key downside  risks  to the outlook are the European  sovereign debt  crisis and the looming  U.S. fiscal  cliff. In addition, negative shocks  could have particularly severe effects, because of the  continuing  vulnerability of  the  financial  system  as  well  as  the  limited  ability of  fiscal  and  monetary policy  to  respond  to  offset  them. Inflation  risks,  in  contrast,  are  more  typically  balanced.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Downside  risks  to  growth  and  upside  risks  to  unemployment  include  Europe,  other global risks (China), fiscal cliff/debt limit, oil/Iran, slow recovery that is especially vulnerable to downside shocks because the ZLB  is binding. These outweigh upside risks including better than expected  developments  in  Europe  or  US  fiscal  issues  or  greater  momentum  in  the  economy. Downside risks to output  are also downside  risks to core inflation to some  extent. Commodity  prices  involve risks slightly  to  the  upside,  affecting  both  total  and  (to  a  lesser  extent)  core  prices.

Respondent 9: In the near term  there  is an appreciable  downside  risk  to  growth  in  Europe  that could  lead to lower US.  exports  to Europe  and  emerging  economies. Moreover,  the  fiscal cliff poses a clear downside  risk. In the medium  term,  impediments  to  growth  may  be  serious  and  persistent enough  to pull GDP  growth  below  the  path  given  above. Also, a large surprise in energy  prices is more  likely  to  be  on  the  high  side  of  the  futures  market  path  of  a  steady  decline.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal of accommodation. Over the near term, the risk to output growth is weighted to the downside and the risk to the unemployment  rate  is weighted to the upside, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the ongoing crisis in Europe and domestic fiscal policy. Over the medium  term, as these uncertainties  abate,  the  risks  shift to the upside  for GDP  growth  and  to  the  downside  for  the unemployment  rate.

Respondent 12: Substantial risks stemming  from  possible fiscal cliff effects and still unresolved issues in Europe  tilt the balance of risks to my growth outlook to the downside. However, these downside risks  are partially balanced by  upside growth potential  should the uncertainties described above get favorably resolved in the near-term. Stable inflation  expectations  are providing  a sufficient anchor to my inflation outlook so as to  make my  assessment of inflation risks as being broadly balanced.

Respondent 13: My projection  for inflation is  conditioned  on my  view that the  output  gap is  less negative than in the Tealbook. My  weighting of risk  for inflation reflects the possibility that this view could  be  wrong.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: Our forecast is premised on the Federal Reserve making  a credible  commitment to keep  monetary  accommodation in place  for  longer than what would be prescribed by policy rules that do not  account  for the prolonged period  over which  monetary policy has been  constrained by  the  zero lower  bound. If we  do  not  successfully  communicate  this  commitment-or,  later,  fail  to  carry  through on  it-then  both  growth  and  inflation  would  be  lower  than  in  our  forecast. Other  risks  evident  todayfinancial contagion  emanating  from  European,  a  larger-scale  weakening  in  other foreign economies, and  the  fiscal  cliff in the  U.S.-also  skew  the  forecast  distribution  towards  lower  growth  and  inflation.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between the  central projection  and the expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  path, the risks to the inflation outlook  have  moved  from  a  downside  skew  to  roughly  balanced. The  balance of risks to the real activity outlook  remain  to  the  downside,  although  less  so  than  in  June. In part, the shift of the balance  of risks for inflation and  real activity reflects our view  that  the appropriate monetary  policy  in  the  current  environment  provides  insurance  against  tail  risks.

Respondent 18: I view  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  as  weighted  to  the  downside  and  unemployment to the upside.  The  main risks are from the U.S. fiscal  cliff, potential European developments and the possibility  that prolonged high unemployment  may, via hysteresis, raise structural unemployment  and  lower  potential  output.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2: In light of the recently disappointing  news on the pace of recovery  and the  likelihood of slow progress in reducing  unemployment,  I  have  adjusted  my  view  of  the  timing  of liftoff of the target federal funds rate. I now believe it  will be appropriate to begin raising the  target for the federal funds rate in mid-2015, rather than late 2014. By 2015, the economy  will have recovered enough that preserving  the  stability of long-term  inflation expectations  and, in turn, inflation will warrant beginning  to  take  steps  to  gradually  reduce  monetary  stimulus. This  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of policy reflects the importance  I  place  on  keeping  the  underlying  inflation  rate  close  to  2  percent, to preserve  our  credibility  and  to  maintain  price  stability.

Respondent 3: The economic recovery is so mediocre as to demand  an appropriate monetary policy that is  accommodative. To achieve such  accommodation at the  zero lower bound, and given the potential  costs of further Treasury LSAPs, I would recommend forward guidance that  contains  explicit and appropriately  considered  communication  of  the  rates of unemployment  and  inflation  necessary prior  to lift-off. The  forward  guidance  language  would  also  include  a  statement  that  accommodation will remain  appropriate  for  a  considerable  time  after  the  economic  recovery  strengthens. In addition, appropriate  monetary policy also should include  action that would have a  more direct effect on growth. Such action  includes  an MBS purchase  that begins  with  the purchase  of  $30 billion per  month  of  agency MBS  while  completing  the  MEP.  As  these  are, at this moment,  my  views  of  appropriate  monetary policy,  they  are  included  here  as  informing  my  forecast.

Respondent 4: Key  factors informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy  are  achieving  an inflation objective of 2 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that reduces unemployment.  In  order to preempt the potential  for rising inflationary pressures and the buildup  of  risks  in  the  financial  system  that  could  impede  the  achievement  of  these  goals,  I  currently anticipate  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  the  process  of  normalizing  monetary  policy  in  late  2013.

Respondent 5: Assuming appropriate policy and  my  views  on the  convergence process, my judgment  is  that  the  lift-off  of the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in Q2/2014.

Respondent 6: Large  and  persistent  output  and  unemployment  gaps  coupled  with  inflation  that is moderately below  our 2 percent  objective  call  for  very  accommodative  monetary policy. Indeed, in the absence  of  an  increase  in  accommodation,  my  forecast  would  show  no  progress  on  closing  the unemployment gap for several years.  I view such  an outcome as inconsistent  with appropriate  monetary policy. As a result, I have  pushed  out  the  liftoff date for the fed funds  rate until mid-2015. I have also added  additional  LSAPs  in  this  forecast,  which  helps  speed  convergence  towards  our  mandates. My  judgment  is  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero-lower-bound  and  for  the effects of unconventional  policy;  and  it  is  informed  by  my  assessment  of  risks  to  the  economy  (which are  large  and  skewed  to  the  downside). In addition,  it  is informed  by  my  assessment  of  the  costs  and benefits  of  further  unconventional  actions.

Respondent 7: I would  begin raising rates when  it is clear that 1) we are making  material  and sustained progress  in  reducing  unemployment; and 2) we believe  with  confidence  that we can raise rates  without  risking  a  quick  and  unwelcome  return  to  the  ZLB.

I am  concerned that we have reached the point at which the very  modest potential benefits of using further  LSAPs  as  a  job  creation  tool  no  longer  outweigh  the  longer  term  costs,  which  are  admittedly uncertain. I would be prepare to support further LSAPs  as a defensive tool, in particular if there were a credible  deflation  threat.

Respondent 8: I assume  rates are kept low until unemployment  drops  below  7%  (with  inflation close to target). I assume  the MEP  is  completed  in December  2012  as  scheduled  and  that further balance  sheet  actions  are  taken  during  the  next  twelve  months.

Respondent 9: I believe  a  rise  in  the  rate  of  growth  will  necessitate  in  increase  in  interest  rates  by early  2014  in  order  to  keep  inflation  from  rising.

Respondent 10: I am  assuming  that  lift-off  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  later  than  it  would  be  if  the rate  was  not  already  at  the  zero  lower  bound.

Respondent 11: Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation. Economic  growth  will  be  slightly  above  trend  toward  the  end  of  2012  and  beyond; unemployment  will decline slowly. The  Committee  will find it necessary  to adjust policies  to prevent inflation  from  rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 12: I expect  the  federal  funds  rate  to  remain  in  the  0  to  25  basis  point  range  at  least as long  as the unemployment rate exceeds 7 percent, providing  that inflation is projected to be  close to the Committee's  2 percent  objective  in  the  medium  term  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations continue  to  be  anchored.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: First off, funds-rate paths don't provide the public with the information that they  need,  which  is  a  sense  of  how  monetary  policy  will  respond  to  economic  developments  in  future years. A  corollary is that  for a given  long-run policy reaction function, near-term differences in fundsrate paths are relatively inconsequential. The  key to achieving  a more  robust  recovery  is changing longer-term  expectations  of  the  conduct  of policy.

Second, over the years FOMC policy  actions have done too  little to check imbalances and  excesses that were obviously not sustainable but which posed no immediate threat to the dual mandate. Evidently,  there  are  variables  besides  inflation  and  the  output  gap  that  ought  to  influence  the  conduct of monetary  policy. Returning  to  'business  as usual'  as soon  as the recovery  is on a firmer footing would  be  unwise.

Evidently,  too,  the  best  way  to  deal  with  the  (near-)zero  bound  is  to  avoid  it. Whatever  policysetting approach  we  take  ought  to  put  high  priority  on  reducing  the  chances  of  another  zero-bound encounter. This may  mean moving  to some version of flexible price level  targeting, provided long-term inflation  expectations  remain  anchored.

In summary,  'appropriate  policy'  cannot  be  captured  by  a  time-path  for  the  federal  funds  rate. An  important  part  of  'appropriate  policy'  is  communicating  a  long-run  strategy  for  monetary  policy that does a better job of resisting  imbalances  and  excesses than did past strategy,  and which is not so dependent  for  its  success  on  large  downward  movements  in  short-term  interest  rates. The  formulation and  communication  of  such  a  strategy  would  strengthen  the  recovery  more  reliably  than  either  our

current  form  of  forward  guidance  or  another  LSAP  program,  allowing  us  to  move  away  from  the  zero bound  more  quickly.

For purposes of this exercise, I assumed a modest  amount of funds-rate smoothing  and  a temporary downward  adjustment  to  the  neutral  real  interest  rate  (to  capture  residual  damage  from  the  financial crisis). I then  considered  the  implications  of  policy  rules  ranging  from  the  1993  Taylor  rule  to  a  level target  for  nominal  gross  domestic  purchases.

Respondent 15: Our  judgments  regarding  appropriate  policy  reflect  a  loss function  that equally weights  deviations  in  inflation  and  unemployment  from  their  long-run  goals. In  the  absence  of  further monetary  accommodation,  we  would  forecast  inflation  running  a  bit  below  our 2 percent goal over the entire forecast  period  and  the  unemployment  rate  still  being  7  percent  at  the  end  of  2015. This is a small miss on our inflation goal but a massive miss against our employment  mandate. (Our assumption  for  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  our  mandate  is  5.2  percent.)

We believe that a  more  accommodative  monetary policy  could be implemented that would bring the unemployment  rate  down  more  quickly  towards  mandate-consistent  levels  and  result  in  inflation only  running  a  few  tenths  above  our  inflation  goal.

Our  appropriate  policy  assumption  calls  for  a  commitment  to  maintain  high  levels  of  accommodation until we see a substantial reduction  in the unemployment  rate. As illustrated by numerous simulations we have seen from the staff, this likely  will require the funds rate to remain near its current level until at  least mid-2015. To further demonstrate our  commitment  and its  economic  conditionality, we  assume  an open-ended LSAP program  will  commence in September,  along  with  an  announcement that it will continue  until  we see clear downward  momentum  in  the  unemployment  rate. As  a safeguard, we would  communicate that the open-ended purchases  could be  concluded if the  medium  term inflation outlook  rose noticeably  above  2 percent. This view of appropriate  policy  is similar to the flow-based  LSAP  cases  with  unemployment  rate  triggers  analyzed  in  the  August  28,  2012  staff  memo, 'Flow-Based  Balance Sheet Policies: Communication  Issues  and Macroeconomic  Effects.'

Conditioned  on  this policy, we project  that  the unemployment rate  would be a percentage point lower at the end of 2015 than under a no-policy-change  scenario. The inflation component  of the policy loss would not be  materially different from that associated  with the undershooting  of 2 percent we  would  forecast  if  these  measures  were  not  implemented.

Respondent 16: In my  judgment,  appropriate  monetary  policy  entails  additional  stimulus. Part of this additional  stimulus  takes  the  form  of  changing  the  guidance  for  the  lift-off  date  of  the  federal funds  rate  to  mid-2015.

Respondent 17: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. Indicators of economic conditions have been mixed, but generally indicate that the expansion  remains  tenuous. Indicators of financial conditions have improved  following  signals  from  central  banks  of  their  willingness  to  undertake  more  accommodative policies  (including  the  words  and  actions  of  the  ECB  and  some  of  the  communication  of  the  Fed),  but conditions  are still strained and  the improvement  is  susceptible  to  sharp  reversals if actions do not fully  meet  expectations. If policy  would  follow  the  path  implied  by  the  August  FOMC  statement,  we would  anticipate  a  combination  of  continuing  substantial  resource  underutilization,  slow  growth,  high unemployment, near- or below-objective inflation, and  substantial downside risks to the real  activity and  inflation  outlooks. Consequently,  we  see  appropriate  monetary policy  as  calling  for  further policy accommodation  with that stance remaining in place  as the  economy  strengthens until a self-sustaining recovery  is fully established. In an environment where the policy rate is  constrained by  the  zero lower bound  and the financial system remains impaired, we anticipate that the target FFR  will remain near  zero  until  mid  2015. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over

this period. The  pace  of renormalization  of  the  target  FFR  following  the  period  of  near  zero  policy rates  will  depend  upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions,  longer-term  inflation  expectations,  and overall  financial  conditions.

An  important  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our estimate  of  the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate is in the  range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0  - 5.0%. Given the recent behavior of nominal and  real Treasury yields and productivity growth, we currently see this rate over the longer run as  more likely to be in the lower half  of the  indicated  range,  which  results  in  the point  estimate  given  in  the  response  to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  the  weak  state  of  the  economy  and  our  expectations  of  continued  strained  financial conditions,  our  assessment  of  the  current 'neutral' FFR  is below  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run FFR and  is expected  to  remain  so  for  some  time.

As discussed in our answer to question  3(e), our policy path is predicated on the FOMC  suspending the  Maturity  Extension  Program  (MEP)  and  instituting  a  flow-based,  open-ended  purchase  program of agency MBS  and  long-term Treasury  securities. In  our appropriate policy  assumption, we  also have a reduction  in  the  IOER  from  25  bps  to  15  bps.

Respondent 18: My  assessment  of  economic  conditions  accords  closely  with  Tealbook  but  I  have incorporated substantially more policy accommodation  than  in  the Tealbook  baseline and thereby project a notably  faster recovery with inflation closer to our 2%  objective. In particular, I assume an open-ended  LSAP  consisting  of  Treasury  and  MBS  purchases  at  a  pace  of  about  $75  billion  per month. I would  continue  these  purchases  until  the  unemployment  rate  has  declined  significantly  and progress  labor  market  progress  appears  to  be  sustainable. I estimate  the  total volume  of  purchases under  this program  will  amount  to  around  $1  trillion. In  addition, I  assume  that  the FOMC holds  the federal funds rate at its effective lower bound  until the fourth quarter of  2015, when the unemployment rate  has  declined  to  around  6.5%. For  such  a  policy  to  provide  meaningful  additional  support  to  the recovery, it must be  communicated  as a  conditional  commitment to keep policy  more  accommodative than  would  be  'normal'  according,  for  example,  to  well-known  policy  rules  such  as  Taylor  (1999). In other words,  the  FOMC  commits  to  keep  the  funds  rate  'lower  for  longer'  than  usual. An  effective way  to  communicate  such  an  intention  would  be  by  establishing  thresholds  for  maintaining  the  funds rate near zero-e.g., that the funds rate will be held near zero until unemployment  has  declined  to 6.5% (assuming projected  inflation remains under say 2.5% and inflation expectations remain  well anchored.) I would  also  note  that  I  have  assumed  an  equilibrium  funds  rate  that  is  depressed  below its average  historical  level. The  staff now  estimates  based  on  its  three-factor  yield  curve  model  that the expected  nominal  short  rate ten years ahead  is now  3.07-well below  the  staff's assumed  4.25% equilibrium  nominal  rate.

Respondent 19: I am  assuming  that  the FOMC  decides  to  adopt  what  is currently Alternative B', that is, it plans  to keep  the funds  rate at its current  value  until the unemployment  rate  falls  to 6.5%. The  outlook  for  both  unemployment  and  inflation  suggests  a  need  for  further  accommodation. Moreover, I  view B' as the  most  attractive of the  alternatives  on the  table, in  terms of my perception of its benefits relative to costs. If the plan is viewed as credible, it has the potential to create a meaningful degree  of  additional  easing,  without some  of  the  costs  and uncertainties  associated  with further  LSAPs.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

I assume  additional  asset  purchases  through  the  end  of  this  year and  adoption  of more  informative forward  guidance

Respondent 2: No

N/A

Respondent 3: Yes

As noted above, my  view of the appropriate path of the Federal  Reserve's balance sheet includes MBS purchases  and,  accordingly,  is  more  stimulative  than  what  is  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 4:

No

N/A

Respondent 5: Yes

In addition to the projected timing, (i.e., earlier than the Tealbook), the pace of the subsequent reduction  of  the  SOMA  portfolio  exceeds  the  one  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 6: Yes

Under  appropriate  policy, I assume  that  the  Committee  implements  an  open-ended  LSAP  program along  the  lines  of  Alternative  A  from  the  July/August  meeting. This  would  involve  ending  the  MEP and initiating additional purchases of both Treasuries and agency  mortgage-backed  securities. My expectation is that we would  continue this policy until the  fourth quarter of  2013,  for a  total balancesheet  expansion  of  around  $1  trillion.

Respondent 7: Yes

I assume  that  the  committee  will  adopt  Alternative  B  prime

Respondent 8: Yes

I assume  some  further  balance  sheet  action  taken  within  the  next  twelve  months.

Respondent 9:

No

N/A

Respondent 10: Yes

I assume  the  policy  indicated  in  Alternative  B'.  In  addition, I assume  that  conditions  at  the  end  of the year  will meet  the  threshold  for  additional  asset  purchases  and  that  purchases  will  continue  at  a $75  billion  per  month  pace  throughout  2013.

Respondent 11: No

My  forecast  does  not  incorporate  any  additional  LSAPs  or  MEP.

I anticipate  following  the  Committee's  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path is steeper than  in the Tealbook,  I anticipate  that we would  reduce  the  size of the balance  sheet  more quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 12: Yes

I assume  the  Committee  will  expand  its  holdings  of  longer-term  securities  by about  $75  billion per month,  including  $30  billion  in  agency  mortgage-backed  securities,  until  about  the  end  of  2013. Further, I assume  forward  guidance  on  maintaining  the  fed  funds  rate  at  its  effective  lower  bound  until early  to  mid-2015.

Respondent 13: No

I believe  that  it  will  be  optimal  to  initiate  exit  earlier  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline.

Respondent 14: No

N/A

Respondent 15: Yes

We  assume  an  open-ended  LSAP  program  purchasing  about  $75  billion  per  month  of  securities,  concentrated  in MBS  to  the  degree  possible without  impairing  market  functioning. The  purchases  are assumed  to  continue  until  the  unemployment  rate  is  clearly  on  a  path  to  7-1/2  percent,  which  in  our projection  occurs  late  in  2013  so  that  total  purchases  would  be  about  $1  trillion.

Respondent 16: Yes

Appropriate  monetary  policy  entails additional LSAP  at  a pace of $75 billion per month  until the unemployment  rate reaches 7 1 2 / percent. Under the baseline forecast, the open-ended LSAP  is expected to total about $1.3 trillion by the time the unemployment  rate reaches 7 1 2 / percent in 2014:Q1. A reduction  in the size of the Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet  starts to occur  only at the time  of  the  federal  funds  rate's  lift-off  from  the  zero  lower  bound,  which  occurs  in  mid-2015.

Respondent 17: Yes

As noted above, in part to reinforce a change in  forward guidance, we assume that the FOMC  suspends the MEP  and  institutes  a  flow-based, open-ended  purchase  program  of  agency  MBS  and  long-term Treasuries, with the initial pace of purchases set at about $75 billion per months  (similar to that discussed in the August 28 background  memo on flow-based balance sheet policies). In addition, we assume  that  the  communications  associated  with  the program  will  signal  that purchases  will  continue at  least  until the FOMC observes significant improvement in labor  market  conditions and  expects such improvement  to  persist, provided  that  the medium-term  inflation  outlook  and  longer-term  inflation expectations remain consistent with the FOMC's  longer-run  objective. Based on our outlook, we currently  expect  that  the  program  will  last  one  year  or  a  little  longer,  with  purchases  totaling  about $1 trillion, although that total can easily change depending  upon  the progress toward the FOMC objectives-it is the progress toward objectives that is important in  our  assumed policy stance rather

than a particular size of the balance sheet. We believe that a collective  emphasis of  an  accommodative stance  based  on  a  portfolio  of  tools  would  enhance  the  efficacy  of  policy  in  these  circumstances.

Secondarily,  with  the  Tealbook  assumption  of  lift-off  of  the  target  FFR  having  moved  earlier  and our  assumption  moving  later,  the  differences  in  the  timing  of  the  renormalization  of  the  balance  sheet (based  on  the  June  2011  exit  strategy  principles)  also  are  more  substantial.

Respondent 18: No

As noted above, I  assume an open-ended LSAP program  consisting of $75 billion per month of Treasury and MBS purchases which  continues until there has been ongoing  labor  market improvement which is projected to  continue  after purchases stop. I project  total purchases of around $1 trillion.

Respondent 19: No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: My  forecast  is  still premised  on  the  assumption  that  uncertainty  and  stress  associated  with the Eurozone sovereign debt problems  continue at high levels through the remainder of this year,  and  that  much  of  the  Eurozone  remains  in  recessionary  or  near-recessionary  conditions  through much of next year, but that a full-blown systemic crisis does not develop. If this darker outcome  were to materialize,  my  expectations  for US growth  and  unemployment would be substantially worse,  and my  expectations  for  inflation moderately  lower. Conversely,  if the ECB  and  Eurozone  governments follow through sufficiently on the near- and medium-term  measures they have announced in principle, and  there is a resulting relaxation  of market  tensions,  I would  expect  a  smaller  drag  on both  trade flows  and  confidence  levels,  and  thus  modestly  stronger  numbers  for  growth  and  unemployment.

The  slow-moving  recovery  is  unlikely  to  accelerate  significantly  anytime  soon  with  the  uncertainty of the  election  and  the  high  likelihood  of  at  least  some  -  and  possibly  considerable  -  fiscal  consolidation next  year. Underlying  conditions  in  housing  and  household  balance  sheets  continue  to  improve gradually,  but  tepid  pace  of  job  creation  make  it  likely  that  those  improvements  will  remain  gradual. Very hard to say how  much  the  housing inventory overhang  could dampen  overall  housing  market gains,  but  that's  at  least  a possibility. Risks  for  the  next  six  months  still  seem  weighted  towards  the downside.

Respondent 2: The  soft tone of the recent news  on  economic  activity, including  August's  disappointing jobs report, has  led me to lower my  near-term  forecast of GDP growth. The pace of recovery this year is  clearly being  held back by  headwinds that include household deleveraging, fiscal restraint, and  uncertainty  about  conditions  in  Europe.

In response to recent developments, I have adjusted my view of appropriate policy to include additional accommodation. This additional accommodation, along with a gradual turn-around in the housing  market  and  the  economy's  usual  self-correcting  mechanisms,  will  help  boost  the  pace  of recovery  in  2013  and  subsequent  years.

In this environment,  I expect inflation to remain  at or slightly below  2 percent throughout  the forecast horizon. This projection  reflects  recent  PCE price  trends, stable  inflation  expectations,  and slow growth in wages.  With the job  market still weak, there is unlikely to be much pressure on inflation coming  from  wages  over  the  next  couple  of  years.

I believe  the  uncertainty  surrounding  my  forecasts  of  GDP  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation remains  elevated  relative  to  the  norms  of  the  last 20 years. The  risks are weighted  primarily  to  the downside for GDP growth and inflation and to the upside for unemployment. In the medium  term, the potential  for a severe  crisis in Europe  and  a fiscal  meltdown in the United States pose  large downside risks to growth  and  inflation  and  upside  risks  to  unemployment.

Respondent 3: The  economy  continues  to grow, but slowly and in a way that is insufficient to bring  about  an  achievement  of  mandate  consistent  levels  of  employment. These  general  contours  have persisted  for quite some  time. In addition  to an unsatisfactory  modal  projection,  downside  risks  to the outlook  particularly  from  the  European  crisis  and  issues  relating  to US  fiscal policy -remain quite elevated. Continued  uncertainty  about  these  scenarios  could  restrain  household  spending  and business  investment  over  the  rest  of  this  year  more  significantly  than  appears  to  have  been  the  case thus far. With  a substantial fraction of unemployed  workers  having  been  jobless for long periods, there is a risk that this high level of long-term unemployment  will persist long  enough to permanently depress  labor  supply  and  potential  output.

Respondent 4: I continue to expect a moderate economic recovery over the next several years with a gradual improvement  in  unemployment. Recovering  demand, improving  labor and housing markets,  and  accommodative  monetary policy  will support  economic growth over the  forecast horizon. However,  financial headwinds,  high  household  debt  levels, reductions in government  spending, and elevated  concerns about the European  sovereign debt  crisis  will  weigh  on growth. The  considerable uncertainty  surrounding  U.S.  fiscal  policy  poses  an  additional  risk  to  the  outlook.

Turning to inflation, I  expect that a gradually improving  economy  and  stable inflation expectations will keep core inflation at 2 percent over the forecast horizon. Over the medium  term, a highly accommodative  monetary  policy  and  large  long-run  fiscal imbalances  pose upside risks to inflation expectations  and, hence, inflation. In addition, the current extraordinary  level of monetary policy accommodation raises the possibility of distortions in financial  markets  and the  mispricing of risk that could  eventually  destabilize  the  economy.

Respondent 5: I continue  to  think  that the convergence  process  is  progressing. Nonetheless,  the recent  growth  and  inflation  data  have  caused  some  changes  in  my  outlook.

Respondent 6: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes tend  to be slow, and  are associated  with sustained weakness in aggregate  demand  through  a  variety  of  channels. Some  headwinds  are  slowly  easing,  including  those related  to  banking  and  credit  conditions. Housing  prices  look  to  have  stabilized,  which  helps  support a recovery  in home  construction. At the same  time,  however,  other  headwinds  remain  intense. For example, the simmering European crisis  continues to weigh on U.S. financial and  economic  conditions; and  U.S.  fiscal  policy  at  all  levels  is turning  increasingly  contractionary.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us  to  continue  making  modest progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps over  the next few years. This expectation is dependent on a substantial increase in  monetary  stimulus. In any  case, it will take  many years  of  above-trend  growth  to  return  the  economy  to  full  employment. In terms  of inflation, significant  slack in labor and goods  markets and  subdued import prices should keep inflation somewhat  below  the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation  target  for  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 7: Limited current bright spots: housing, auto, continued household deleveraging, some  others. Monetary policy has helped avert a  far worse outcome, but  utility is declining. Businesses and households have great uncertainty about  recovery, US fiscal policy  and Europe.  Fiscal policy a net drag  that  is  highly  likely  to  get  worse. There  is  plenty  of  slack,  and  no  persuasive  case  for  structural damage  to  aggregate  supply  -  yet. But  insufficient  demand  to  put  resources  to  work.

Despite  all  of  that,  the  economy  retains  much  underlying  flexibility  and  strength. In the  medium term, I believe that the recovery  will  gain strength,  and that we  will find that  NAIRU hasn't  moved much,  if  at  all.

Respondent 8: Pattern  of  sluggish  growth  continues. At  this  stage  of  the  cycle  the  economy  should be  growing  noticeably  above  trend;  however,  the  recovery  is  being  held  back  by  a  number  of  unusual factors. These  include  Europe  and  its  effects  on  trade  and  financial  markets  (most  important);  fiscal restraint  at  both  the  federal  and  state-local  levels  (next  most  important);  households'  need  to  rebuild wealth; maybe  some  uncertainty  and  confidence  effects; and the relative weakness  of housing. The drought is a temporary  headwind. Other cyclical factors are behaving more normally, e.g., autos and  other durables. Unemployment  is  at  about  the  same  level  in  January  reflecting  growth  a  little below  trend  (and  Okun's  Law). The  end  of EEB  and  weakening  labor  force  participation  put  mild downward  pressure  on  unemployment. Skills mismatch  is probably  close to normal  but  employers' recruiting  intensity  is  low  given  the  lack  of  demand.

Core inflation is stabilized by  well  anchored inflation  expectations, stagnant  wage growth, stronger dollar. Recent  increases  in  commodity  prices  will  raise  both  headline  and  core  inflation  a  bit  relative to expectation, but not much if at all above  2%.

Respondent 9: Growth has been softer than expected so far this year.  Over  time, additional firming in the labor market  will be reflected in gradually  improving  personal  income  growth  and  consumer spending. Uncertainty  over  the  fiscal  cliff  could  dampen  business  investment  for  the  remainder  of  the year. After the immediate  issues are resolved, fiscal drag will reduce domestic demand  early  next year. Residential  investment  is  growing  at  a moderate  pace  that  is  likely to continue. Home  prices appear to have bottomed  and  modest growth is likely. Government  consumption and investment  will continue  to  move  lower  due  to  budget  pressures  at  all  levels.

Respondent 10: The outlook for the second half of 2012 and the first of 2013 hinges on the resolution  of  the  fiscal  cliff.

As we get closer to the end of the year, I believe decisions by businesses and households will increasingly be driven by the need to take action before the various tax and spending provisions become  effective. These  actions  could  include  changes  to  tax  withholding  tables,  lay-off  notices  from employers  affected  by  spending  cuts,  asset  sales  by  taxpayers  concerned  about  capital  gains  rates  or  a pull forward of planned purchases that  will receive favorable  tax treatment in  2012. In addition,  many investments  and purchases  will simply be postponed until there is greater visibility about  federal  taxes and  spending.

It is especially difficult to judge how  an  extended  fight, a temporary  fall off the fiscal cliff or a series of short  term  extensions  will  affect  business  and  consumer  confidence. Finally,  there  is always the possibility that once  fiscal issues are resolved, the resulting  clarity (regardless  of the specifics of the policies  chosen)  will unfreeze  spending  and improve  confidence.

Respondent 11: Incoming  data  on  economic  activity  have been somewhat weaker than I  expected in my  June  forecast  leading  to  a  slightly  downward  revision  to  my  near-term  economic  outlook. My view is that this weakness  it is tied to uncertainties about Europe  and domestic fiscal policy and is temporarily  leading  to  restrained  business  spending. I expect  that  spending  will  pick  up and  the economy will rebound as uncertainty surrounding the crisis in Europe and domestic fiscal policy diminishes  toward  the  end  of  this  year.

I expect  3 percent  growth  over  the medium  term,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. With  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6  percent  by  the  end  of  2015,  at  which  time it reaches  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will be 1.8 percent in 2012 and then edge up to 2 percent over the remainder  of the forecast horizon. Inflation stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary  policy  that  begins  some  time  toward  the  end  of  2012..

Respondent 12: The  economy  continues  to  work  against  the  currents  of  high  unemployment  and fiscal restraint at all levels of government. Elevated uncertainty about Europe, domestic fiscal  concerns, and  persistence  of  weak  growth  indicators  are  damping  the  demand  for  expansion  of  net  new  capital and  jobs. Slow  jobs  growth  will  restrain  consumer  spending  over  the  medium  term.

Respondent 13: Consider  the  following  counterfactual. Suppose  we  were  able  to  engineer  an  increase in aggregate  demand  sufficiently  large that inflation equalled 2%  from  2013  onwards. What would  happen  to  the  unemployment  rate?

I see a couple  of  plausible  answers  to  this  question. Some  might  say  that  the  unemployment  rate would  immediately  jump  to  its long-run level. This is a view that says that the high UR  and  low inflation  are  both  due  only  to  an  aggregate  demand  shortfall. If you  have  this  belief,  there  is  no  need to have  inflation  run  above  2%  - the  goal  is  simply  to  get  inflation  back  to  2%  (from  its  current  low level)  as rapidly  as  is possible.

My  answer is different. I believe that, even if  aggregate demand  could be raised sufficiently so that inflation  equalled  2%  from  2013  onwards,  the  unemployment  rate  would  be  above  6.3%  (my  long-run projection) for some  time. In other words, I believe there have been transitory  shocks that are pushing upward  on  both  inflation  and  unemployment,  along  with  the  permanent  shocks  that  have  driven  the long-run  unemployment  rate  up. I'll call these  transitory  shocks  that  push  upward  on  both  inflation and  unemployment 'supply'  shocks.

How  should  monetary  policy  react  to  these  supply  shocks? In most  models,  some  of  these  supply shocks (for example, shocks to firm  markups) make unemployment inefficiently high while other shocks (to preferences  and  technology)  make  efficient  unemployment  higher. So, there  is no easy  answer  to this question. My  own  assessment  is  that  at  least  some  of  these  shocks  represent  inefficiencies,  while others  do  not.

When  I  put  all  this  together,  I  conclude  that:

a. even  under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  it  will  take  some  time  for  unemployment  to  fall  back down  to  its  long-run  level  of  6.3%

b. along  the  path  of adjustment,  it  is appropriate  for  inflation  to  be above  2%  for  at least some time  (so  as  to  offset  the  transitorily  inefficiently  high  unemployment).

I don't  think  that  this  assessment  is qualitatively different  from  the staff's. However, my  assessment  of the magnitude  of the various inefficiencies, and the sacrifice ratio (the inflation  'price'  of unemployment  reductions)  is  quantitatively  different.

Respondent 14: Drags on growth from excess household debt continue to ease, and residential investment  is now  making  consistently  positive  growth  contributions. However,  cuts  in government purchases  and  extreme  tax  and  regulatory  uncertainty  are  limiting  the  pace  of  the  expansion  and  are retarding the impact of a highly accommodative  monetary  policy. Downside  risks stemming  from economic  and  financial problems  abroad remain significant. In  the  U.S., businesses  are holding  abovenormal  levels  of  cash  as  a  hedge  against  the  elevated  uncertainty. The  effect  is  to  restrain  job  creation and CAPEX.  The  pace  of  the recovery is unlikely to accelerate until next year, after some of the aforementioned  non-monetary  uncertainties  have  been  resolved. If they remain  unresolved,  I  would expect  to  lower  my  growth  projections  and  raise  my  unemployment  estimates,  perhaps  significantly.

Respondent 15: The  key  factors  shaping  our  forecast  have  not  changed  for  some  time. Households and  some  businesses  still  have  a  way  to  go  in  rebuilding  their  balance  sheets. In  addition,  uncertainty over the potential fall out to the U.S from the European  debt  crisis and the potential for a messy resolution to U.S. fiscal cliff are weighing on confidence and depressing spending. Adding in the negative  effects from  the  drought,  we  see  output  growing  at  roughly  a  2  percent  pace  in  the  second half of the  year.

We  expect  growth  to  pick  up  as  we  move  through  2013  and  2014. Supported  by  further  accommodative  monetary policy, households  and businesses  will  eventually  make  enough progress in shoring up their balance sheets to resume spending  more briskly;  some of this  will reflect pent-up demands  for capital goods  and  consumer  durables,  which  will  provide  an  impetus  for  above-trend  growth  as  the associated  stock-adjustment process  takes place. Furthermore,  under  our baseline  scenario,  Europe will muddle  through  without  a  financial  meltdown,  and  the  resolution  of  the  U.S.  fiscal  situation  will

involve  restraint  on  the  order  of  magnitude  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. As  the  odds  on  the  more  damaging European  and  U.S.  fiscal scenarios fade, household  and  business  confidence  will be bolstered and the  associated  restraint  on spending  will diminish. All told, we see real GDP growth picking  up about  3  percent  in  2013  and  a  bit  over  4  percent  in  2014  and  2015.

Under  our  view  of appropriate  policy, sufficient accommodation  will  be  in  place-and  will  be  expected  to remain  in place-to  result  in  inflation drifting  up  some over  the projected period. Still, given we expect  resource  gaps  to remain  substantial  even  into  2015, this projected  increase  in inflation is quite  modest,  with  the  PCE  price  index  rising  just  2.3  percent  in  2015.

Respondent 16: Incoming  data  have  been  mixed  but  overall  consistent  with  an  economy  growing modestly,  with  signs  of  a  slowdown  relative  to  the  already  tepid  pace  of  growth  witnessed  in  the  first half  of the year. Improvements  in  the  labor  market  remain  unsatisfactory: Gains  in payroll  are  small, and declines in the unemployment  rate  have been importantly influenced by declines in the labor force participation rather than by  increases in the  employment  to population  ratio. Firms'  reluctance to hire is also mirrored  by  a  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  as  the  economic  environment  remains uncertain. Recent statements by the European  Central Bank  have contributed to lessen financial stresses,  but  risks  of a renewed  deterioration  are  still  high. On  the  domestic  side,  as  important  fiscal deadlines near a contentious process surrounding the direction of fiscal policy is likely to increase uncertainty  further. The  large  amount  of  slack  in  labor  markets  is  contributing  to  only  modest  gains in compensation.  With  little  hiring  and  meager  wage  growth,  consumers  do  not  have  the  wherewithal to step  up  expenditures  significantly  despite  some  improvement  in  household  net  worth.

Given these prevailing  conditions,  economic  activity  is expected to grow below potential  over the rest  of this year. With  little  underlying  momentum  and  fiscal  consolidation  likely  to  restrain  the pace of growth  significantly  next  year,  additional  monetary  policy  stimulus  is  needed. The  outlook  is  thus conditioned  on  (i)  additional  LSAP  at  a  pace  of  $75  billion  per  month  until  the  unemployment  rate reaches  7 1 2 / percent,  (ii) a mid-2015  lift-off of the federal funds  rate, and  (iii) lowering  the  interest on excess reserves to 10 basis point. The  amount  of  quantitative  easing  (together  with  the  forward guidance and the reduction in the interest rate  on excess reserves)  is  expected  to provide sufficient stimulus to spur growth in  2013 and beyond  so as to lower the unemployment  rate to  close to 6 percent by  the end of  2015. In this  context, risks to the projection for real  activity  continue to be weighted to the  downside,  but  the  additional  policy  actions  contribute  to  lift  some  of  the  uncertainty. Too,  more stimulus  helps  to  keep  inflation  closer  to  the  2  percent  target  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 17: Other Conditioning  assumptions: We  expect the lower degree of inflation persistence evident  since  the early 1990s  to continue. Inflation expectations  remain  well  anchored. We project real foreign GDP  growth  in  2012  at  2.1%  and  for  2013  and  2014  at  2.8%. Reflecting  intermeeting developments,  our  assumed path of WTI  oil prices, based  on recent futures quotes, has  moved up  to $96.50  for 2012Q4  and  $96  for  2013Q4,  and  then  ease  to  $92  by  2014Q4. We  adopt  the  same federal  fiscal  assumptions  as  in  the  Tealbook,  which  are  unchanged  from  late  July;  however,  we  see  a somewhat  larger drag  on GDP from these  actions.  We  also adopt the Tealbook  assumptions regarding equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: Both  in absolute terms  and relative to expectations  at the beginning  of the year, the performance  of the US  economy  over  the first half of 2012 was disappointing as real GDP  growth averaged a  little  under 2% (annual rate). As a result, progress in reducing  unemployment has stalled. We  expect  growth  to  remain  around  2%  (annual  rate)  in  the  second  half  of  the  year.

So  why  is  it,  three years  after  the  official  end  of  the 'Great  Recession,' that  the  economy  continues to languish? Several  factors appear  to be restraining  the  economy  at the present  time.

- · The  deleveraging  process  among  US  households  continues  to  restrain  spending  on  housing  and consumer  durables.
- · Spending  by  state  and  local  governments  has  been  contracting  for  over  two  and  a  half  years.

- · Consumers  and  businesses  are  confronted  with  an  unusual  degree  of  uncertainty  regarding  the strength of the  economy  in the near future, particularly in regard  to the sovereign debt crisis in the  euro  area  and  the  possibility  of  substantial  additional  fiscal  drag  beginning  in  2013.
- · Export  growth  has  gradually  slowed  over  the  past  year  as  global  growth  has  weakened.

Going forward, our expectation is that these impediment to stronger growth  will gradually subside. The  improvement  in  home  prices  that  we  have  seen  this  year,  and  which  we  expect  to  continue,  will certainly help. In addition, uncertainty about the US fiscal path is likely to diminish  after the  election. World  growth  is expected  to pick up in 2013 as the Euro  area emerges  from  recession. Combined with  our  assumptions  for  monetary  policy,  we  thus  expect  some  firming  of  growth  in  2013  and  2014. However,  growth  in  2013 is likely to be held back to just around  2 1 2 / %, with a modest  decline  of the unemployment  rate,  due  to  our  fiscal  policy  assumptions. In fact, recent analysis suggests  that growth  could  be  restrained  more  than  generally  expected  as  the  impacts  of  fiscal  policy  changes  are magnified  when  monetary policy  is constrained by  the zero lower bound. Thus, risks to projected growth next year  are skewed  to  the downside. As we  enter  2014,  fiscal drag  is  expected  to diminish greatly, allowing  the  full force of monetary  accommodation  and  the  natural  healing  of  the  economy to be  realized;  therefore  we  expect  growth  of  around  4%,  with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  more substantially  even  though  the  participation  rate  begins  to  rise  gradually.

Total  inflation  has  slowed  significantly  over  the  past  several  months,  with  the  total  PCE  deflator up just  1.3% over the 12  months  ending in July, down from  2.9%  last September. Given the recent  rise of energy prices,  12-month changes  are  expected  to begin rising  again, reaching  around 1 3 4 / %  by  the end of the year. While this projection  also includes  more rapid increases in food prices  later this year as the  effects  of  the  drought  work  their  way  through  the  distribution  network,  the  magnitude  of  those price increases is highly uncertain at this  time. Our projection for  core PCE deflator inflation for the second half  of 2012 has been  lowered  to just  1.3%  (annual rate), based  on recent data  and  forward looking indicators such  as our Underlying  Inflation Gauge. This brings the  2012 Q4/Q4  change of the core  PCE  deflator  to  1.7%  versus  1.8%  in  the  last  cycle.

In 2013 and 2014, as the economy begins to establish greater forward momentum,  we  expect both  total and  core inflation to move  higher  gradually,  with  total  PCE  deflator  inflation  moving  to around  2%  in 2013 and 2 1 4 / % in 2014. The  expected  decline of the exchange  value of the dollar and  resulting  more  rapid  increase  of  nonpetroleum  import  prices  contributes  to  this  increase. Stable inflation  expectations  will  limit the  extent of inflation  overshooting the FOMC objective,  as such  an overshoot  is  consistent  with  optimal policy  in  a  wide  variety  of  models  under  situations  similar  to  the current  one.

Our risk  assessment depends upon  our  assumption of appropriate policy, which  we see  as providing insurance  against  realizations  of  the  downside  risks. Under  that  assumption,  we  assess  less  downside risks to real  activity  and inflation than in the June SEP,  with the inflation risks now roughly balanced. However, if we  assume that the policy path implied by the August FOMC  statement, then there would be  considerable  downside  risks  to  both  real  activity  and  inflation,  as  the  developments  since  the  June SEP  by  themselves  would  have  implied  only  marginal  changes  in  our  risk  assessment.

Respondent 18: Recent data suggest that the U.S. economy  has been expanding at a modest, trend-like  pace. I expect  growth  to  continue  around  that  rate  before  gradually  picking  up  under  the impetus  of exceptionally  accommodative  monetary  policy. Smoothing  through  the  volatility in the various spending data, real PCE has been rising  at a rate of about 2% in recent quarters and I  consider a sizable pickup  unlikely given downbeat  reading  on  consumer  sentiment  and  the  increase  we  have seen  in oil prices. Forward  looking  indicators  of  business  investment  have  been  quite  negative. I see the housing  sector  as beginning  to  mend,  with house prices now rising  in  many parts of the U.S., but given  the  low  level  of activity  in this sector,  a strengthening  will  not  likely  provide  much  impetus  to aggregate  demand. Going  forward,  both  slower  global  growth  and  increasing  fiscal  drag  will  hamper growth. With  respect  to  the  labor  market,  I  see  economic  growth  as  too  slow  over  the  next  few  years

to meaningfully  lower  the  unemployment  rate. Even  with  considerable  additional  accommodation,  I still project  an  unemployment  of  7.7%  at  the  end  of  next  year.

With respect to inflation, I see it as well contained, running at or slightly below 2% over the forecast  period.

Respondent 19: I see a gradual acceleration in growth over the next two years, under the assumption  that stresses in Europe  diminish, and that there is some  resolution to the ongoing  fiscal uncertainty. As these headwinds  moderate, the underlying  improvement  in  the financial condition of firms, banks, and consumers  should begin to show through more clearly. Nonfinancial firms in particular  have  very  strong  balance  sheets,  and  by  locking  in  long-term  debt  at  record  low  levels  have set themselves  up  well  to  invest  should  demand  begin  to  pick  up. Nevertheless,  while  I  expect  some upturn  in growth,  I don't think it will be fast enough  on  its own  to get unemployment  back  in  the range  of  the  natural  rate  for  quite  some  time.

September 12-13, 2012

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: Very little change in view of the economy. The modest  changes in my  outlook mostly  due  to  changes  in  assumptions  about  monetary  policy.

Respondent 2: As  noted  above,  I have  lowered  my  forecast  for  GDP  growth  in  2012  in  response to the news  of the inter-meeting period  that has  generally been  somewhat  weaker  than  I  expected at the time of the June SEP. I have also adjusted my  view of appropriate policy to include more accommodation. With  this additional monetary  stimulus, my  forecast for GDP  growth  in  2013 is about  the same  as in the June  SEP,  and  my  forecast  of growth  in 2014 is higher than in the June SEP.  Reflecting  the  same  broad  forces,  I  have  adjusted  up  my  forecast  for  unemployment  in  2013  but made  little  change  to  my  forecast  of  unemployment  in  2014. With  recent  inflation  rates  coming  in  as expected,  I  have  made  only  small  adjustments  to  my  forecast  of  inflation.

Respondent 3: As the  economy  continues to grow at a slow pace, the ability of  more modest forms of accommodation  to  effect  the pace  becomes  attenuated. Accordingly, the persistent slow pace  of recovery  requires  greater accommodation  than  I  hard  earlier  assumed. The  need  for continued  and varied  forms  of  accommodation  effects  my  forecast.

Respondent 4: Relative to the previous SEP, three factors have led me to change my  forecast. First, I see greater  inflationary  pressures  coming  from  rising  energy  prices,  rising  agricultural  prices, and  growing  concerns  about  the  long-term  fiscal  imbalances. Second,  I  have  downgraded  my  view  on the  medium-term potential  growth  rate  of  the  economy. Data  releases  in  recent quarters  suggest  that the recovery is progressing  at a pace  consistent  with a slower rate of potential growth  for the  economy than previously  expected. As a result, I have revised down my  forecast  for real GDP growth in  2013 and 2014. Third, the labor market  recovery has  been  progressing  slower  than  previously  expected. Therefore, my forecast  now has the unemployment  rate improving  more gradually than in my previous submission. My  longer-run  projections  remain  unchanged.

Respondent 5: The  pace of the economy  and  inflation over the first half of 2012 was modestly weaker  than  my  expectations. Accordingly, the unemployment  rate  stabilized, and even inched up slightly, rather than  continuing  to  fall as I had  anticipated. I expect  the economy  to  steadily  build momentum  during  the  second  half  of  the  year. Overall, my  forecasts  of real GDP  growth  and  PCE inflation  for  2012  have  decreased  slightly,  while  my  forecasts  of  unemployment  for  2012  and  2013  have increased  slightly.

Respondent 6: Since June, the data have suggested slightly  less growth than expected in the second half of 2012. Moreover,  the  lack  of  acceleration  in  activity  reinforces  that  the  headwinds  to  recovery are abating  only slowly. As a result, in the absence of further  monetary  stimulus, my forecast  would be somewhat weaker than in June.  However, because I do now build in  considerable additional stimulus, my  overall  forecast  is  a  bit  stronger  than  in  June.

My  inflation forecast has changed  relatively little. Higher  oil and natural gas prices (and, to a lesser  extent,  expected  food  prices)  have  led  me  to  raise  my  headline  inflation  forecast  for  the  second half  of  2012. Further  out,  greater  monetary  stimulus  and  resulting  faster  growth  lead  to  slightly  faster progress  on bringing  inflation  towards  our 2 percent  objective.

Respondent 7: not  much  has  changed

Respondent 8: Not a major change in the outlook. Incoming  data have been mixed (payrolls, retail sales, durables  orders,  construction,  home  sales),  consistent  with  sluggish  but  positive  growth. The European  situation is  moderately better  so financial  conditions  are  also a bit better.

Respondent 9: Overall  economic  activity has been  softer than expected. The drought is likely to reduce  agricultural production by  more  than had been  expected. The recent backup  in  gasoline prices was  not  expected.

Respondent 10: My  forecast now includes additional balance sheet action and an extension of forward  guidance.

Respondent 11: With  recent  data  being  somewhat  weaker  than  I  anticipated,  I've  marked  down 2012  growth  slightly  from  my  June  SEP.

Respondent 12: Softer incoming  data  have  caused  me  to  reduce  my  growth  outlook  by  0.4  percentage points  this year,  and by  about  1/4 percentage point projection  for  the balance  of  the  forecast horizon.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: I've revised my  near-term, headline inflation  forecast  modestly upward in response to recent  oil-price increases,  and have revised my  near-term real growth  forecast downward in response to the unexpectedly severe drought.

Respondent 15: The  incoming  news  on  economic  activity  has been broadly consistent with our June forecast, and our forecast for GDP  growth  in 2012 is the same as in that projection. Our forecast  for total inflation in 2012  is about  1/2  percentage  point  higher  than  in  June. This  revision largely  reflects  the  increase  in  energy  prices  and  prospective  bump-up  in  food  prices;  our  outlook  for core inflation is just a  tenth higher than in  our previous projection.

We  revised  up  our  outlook  for  growth  and  inflation  in  2013  and  2014  a  good  deal  from  June. This reflects more  accommodative  monetary  policy  assumptions. In June,  we  had  assumed  a  $500  billion LSAP. Our  current projection is  conditioned  on  an open-ended LSAP program  with  a  commitment to continue  it until we see clear downward  momentum  in  the  unemployment  rate  and  an  expressed willingness  to not pull back  on  accommodation  as  long  as  inflation  does  not  rise  noticeably  above  2 percent. We have  accordingly boosted  our projection  for  average GDP  growth  over  2013  and  2014 by about 3/4 percentage  point raised our outlook for inflation over the same  period by about 1/4 percentage  point.

Respondent 16: Incoming data have been, by and large, consistent with my expectations and have thus reinforced my  view  that additional monetary  policy  stimulus  is needed. Compared  with my  previous  submission,  I  now  favor  a  greater  amount  of  policy  stimulus. The  greater  stimulus  also reflects the fact that recent data for core inflation have  been  subdued,  suggesting  little  inflationary pressures  going  forward.

Respondent 17: Data  released  over  the  intermeeting  period  have  been  mixed,  resulting  in  essentially no  change  in  our  assessment  of  the  likely  strength  of  the  economy  over  the  second  half  of  2012. Recent  data  on  consumer  spending  has  been  generally  favorable,  resulting  in  some  nudging  up  of  the expected  rate  of  growth  of  real  personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  for  the  third  quarter,  but

weak  consumer  expectations  measures  and  rising  gasoline prices  mitigate these effects  for future real PCE growth.  In addition, recent housing  market data have been a bit better than  expected.

However,  other indicators have been decidedly downbeat.  New  orders  for nondefense  capital goods excluding  aircraft  have  fallen  off  quite  sharply  in  recent  months  and  are  now  below  shipments. Similarly, the Architectural  Billings  Index,  which  provides  leading  information  on  business  investment  in new  structures,  has  been  at  a  level  suggesting  declining  activity  for  four  consecutive  months  through July. Combined,  this  information  suggests  that  business  investment  spending  is  more  likely  to  slow further  over  the  second  half  of  the  year  than  it  is  to  strengthen.

On  the production side, a variety of indicators point to sluggish activity in the manufacturing sector. The ISM  manufacturing  composite  index has been below 50 for three consecutive months through  August. Several  factors  are contributing  to  this slowdown  of  manufacturing  activity. After ramping  up  substantially  over  the  second  half of 2011, the rate of vehicle assemblies  in the US  has begun to  level off. Growth of real exports has gradually slowed over the past year, and firms appear to want  to  slow  their  rate  of  inventory  accumulation.

The  recent  labor  market  data,  in  particular  the  August  labor  market  report,  have  reinforced  our view of a sluggish  economy. Payroll employment increased an average of  87,000 per  month since April, down from  225,000 in the first quarter of the year. The diffusion index has declined in recent  months and  now  is  essentially  at  a breakeven  level. There  was  corresponding  weakness  in  hours  worked  and average hourly  earnings. Labor  force participation declined  again, reaching  its lowest  level since  1983, and  the  employment-population  ratio  languished  near  its  post-1983  low.

Total  inflation,  as  measured  by  year-over-year  changes  of  the  PCE  deflator,  has  slowed  sharply  in recent  months,  with  the  bulk  of  this  movement  due  to  energy  prices. Core  inflation,  which  had  been somewhat  firmer,  has  slowed  more  recently  and  our  forward-looking  measures  such  as  our  Underlying Inflation Gauge indicate further slowing  in the  months ahead. We suspect that this pattern is due to the effect of the steep  increases  in commodity  and  import  prices  in  2011  working  their  way  through the system  and  now  subsiding  (in  fact, nonpetroleum  import  prices  have  been  declining). This has led us to lower  our  projection  for  core  PCE  deflator  inflation  over  the  second  half  of  2012  to  1.3%.

Respondent 18: My  medium  term  outlook  is  little  changed  since  June. For  example,  I  project  an unemployment rate at  7.2%  at the end of  2014  now-identical  to my projection in June,  although I have  assumed  a  somewhat  larger  LSAP  program  this  round  than  in  June. For the remainder  of  the year,  I have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  growth  slightly,  due  in  part  to  the  drought,  and  revised  up my  estimate  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  response  to  incoming  data. My  projection  of  inflation  this year  is higher  as  a  result  of  rising  oil prices  and  the  drought.

Respondent 19: My  forecasts  for  output  and  unemployment  are  a  bit  more  optimistic  than  in  the previous  SEP.  For  example,  my  estimates  for  GDP  growth  in  2013  and  2014  are  now  3.0%  and  3.6%, respectively, as opposed to  2.6%  and  3.4% in the previous round. These changes reflect two  factors, in roughly equal  measure. First, some slightly better than  expected incoming  news, particularly  with respect  to the situation in Europe. And  second,  the  effects of the further stimulus  provided  by  the (assumed)  adoption  of  Alternative  B'.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Slightly  less  optimistic  than  Tealbook,  but  no  major  analytical  differences.

Respondent 2: My  view of appropriate policy is that  liftoff of the  federal funds rate  will occur  later than  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. In addition, my  forecasts  of GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  this year  and next year  are  modestly  more optimistic than the Tealbook's. I believe the recent  news  on the economy  and additional policy  action is  consistent  with  economic growth remaining  near 2 percent in the second half of this year and picking  up  next year to  more than 2 1/2 percent, while the Tealbook puts  growth  well  below  2  percent  in  the  second  half  of  this  year  and  below  2  1/2  percent  next  year.

Respondent 3: My  current  economic  forecast  differs  from  that  of  the  Tealbook's  baseline  forecast because  of  the  imposition  of  a  different  set  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  tools.

Respondent 4: In comparison  to  the  Tealbook  forecast,  my  outlook  differs  in  two  primary  ways. First, I see greater inflationary pressures being generated  in the medium  term  from  a  continuation of the current highly accommodative  stance  of  policy. In response  to these pressures  that threaten the  stability  of  long-term  inflation  expectations,  my  view  of  appropriate  policy  calls  for  lift-off  of  the federal  funds  rate  in  late  2013,  a  year  earlier  than  in  the  Tealbook  policy  assumption. Second,  under my  assumption  of  appropriate  policy,  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  near  the  2  percent  target,  growth to be more  moderate,  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  recover  more  gradually  than  in  the  Tealbook forecast.

Respondent 5: I anticipate much  faster real GDP  growth  for 2013 and much  slower real GDP growth  for  2015  than  the  Tealbook. For  2013  through  2015,  I  anticipate  a  much  lower  unemployment rate  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 6: My growth  and inflation projections  are broadly similar to the Tealbook; however, I have  assumed  considerably  more  monetary  stimulus. With  comparable  monetary policy  assumptions, my  outlook  for  economic  activity  would  be  weaker  than  Tealbook  for  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 7: I assume  that  we  adopt  Alternative  B  prime.

Respondent 8: Like  the  Tealbook  I  expect  growth  to  pick  up  eventually,  but  I  remain  a  bit  more pessimistic  about  the  extent  to  which  activity  will  accelerate  in  the  out  years, in light of more  than three years of slow recovery. It is not obvious that the key headwinds (Europe, fiscal)  will be resolved soon;  on  the  other  hand,  we  are  seeing  some  improvement  in  domestic  credit  conditions,  housing,  and household  balance  sheets.

Regarding inflation: It seems that the Phillips  curve  may be flatter (so  less effect of slack)  and that passthrough  to  core  from  commodity  prices  (though  limited)  may  be  greater  than  we  thought. Also, I have monetary  policy  being  a bit more  accommodative  than  the  Tealbook  does. So my  inflation projections  are  a  little  higher.

Respondent 9: The  most important difference is that I  expect inflation to be  close to our 2 percent goal  over  the  forecast  period.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: My forecast  calls  for a stronger  economy in  2013  and  tighter  monetary policy than the  Tealbook. I anticipate  a  lower  unemployment  rate  than  the  Tealbook  in  2013  and  2014.

Respondent 12: I project inflation to follow a path  closer to our longer-term  inflation objective owing  to a strong  adherence of price growth to  longer-term inflation  expectations.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: I see somewhat  faster  GDP  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2012  and  in  2013  than does the Tealbook,  with  correspondingly  faster  reductions  in  the unemployment  rate. My  inflation forecasts  converge  to  2  percent  more  rapidly  than  the  Tealbook's. These  differences  imply  that  there is less need  for  monetary-policy  accommodation.

Respondent 15: Our  forecast  would  be  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  if  we  had  conditioned  it on  its monetary  policy  assumptions. However,  we  think  resource  gaps  currently  are  somewhat  larger than  in  the  Tealbook,  and  so  we  would  project  a  bit  more  of  cyclical  bounceback  in  growth  over  the projection  period.

That said, we are  conditioning  on a much  more  accommodative  monetary policy than the assumption in the Tealbook. Accordingly, we  are projecting  stronger growth  and higher inflation.

Respondent 16: Conditional  on the same  monetary  policy  assumptions  as in the Tealbook, my forecast  and  the  Tealbook's  are  very  similar.

Respondent 17: As  stated  in  our  response  to  question  3,  we  assume  that  the  MEP  is  suspended, replaced by  an  asset purchase program. Because of the greater  size  and duration in the balance sheet over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  assume  that  term  premia  rise  to  normal  levels  more  slowly  than  in  the Tealbook.

Over 2012H2  and  2013, the Tealbook  assumes  a weaker foreign growth outlook and somewhat higher path for the foreign exchange  value of the dollar than in our projection. Consequently,  net exports  is a neutral  factor for GDP  growth  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  while  it  is a modestly  positive contributor  in  our  central projection  for  that period.

For 2013,  although real GDP growth forecasts are similar, the Tealbook expects stronger real PCE growth and weaker investment growth than our forecast. In part, this reflects somewhat  different views  of  the  effects  of  the  expected  fiscal  consolidation  that  year.

We  see  some  of  the  headwinds  restraining  economic  growth  subsiding  more  quickly  in  2014  than in the Tealbook. Thus  we  expect  the  output  gap  to  begin  to  close  more  quickly  that  year, and  our 2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast  is  above  that  of  the  Tealbook.

We see a stronger influence of  anchored inflation  expectations  on inflation dynamics than does the Tealbook. Consequently,  our  inflation forecast and the Tealbook  forecast are similar for 2012, but beyond  that  we see total and core inflation remaining  near  2%  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  inflation declining  in  2013  and  remaining  near  the  2013  level  in  2014. This  difference  also  reflects  the  differing monetary  policy  assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts.

We  expect  a greater decline in the unemployment  rate  than  is projected  in the Tealbook, even though we project a small  increase  in  the  labor  force participation  rate  in  2014. The source  of  this difference  is  a different  interpretation  of  labor  market  dynamics  as  expansions  mature;  that  is,  we  do not  place  as  much  weight  on  Okun's  Law  as  the  Board  staff  does.

Both  the  Tealbook  and  our  outlook  see  a  downside  balance  of  risks  to  real  growth. For  inflation, we agree that the risks are broadly balanced, but we see uncertainty as still higher than normal whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  a  near  normal  level. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that the  unusual  nature  of  the  current  expansion  leaves  uncertainty  about  both  real  activity  and  inflation above  normal  levels.

Respondent 18: There are no significant differences between  my  current economic  forecast and Tealbook  other  than those associated with my  substantially more  accommodative  monetary policy assumption.

Respondent 19: Conditional  on  the  policy  assumption,  they  are  quite  close.
