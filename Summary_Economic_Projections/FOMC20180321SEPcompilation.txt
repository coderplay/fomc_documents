Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  December  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  12-13,  2017. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in real  GDP,  the  unemployment  rate,  or  the  federal  funds  rate  in  conjunction  with  the  December  12-13,  2017,  meeting,  and  one  participant  did  not  submit such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  March  20-21,  2018,  meeting.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines  in  the  top  panel  show  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the percent  change  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter of the year  indicated. The  confidence  interval  around  the  median  projected  values  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  and  is based  on  root  mean  squared  errors  of  various  private  and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years;  more information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. Because  current  conditions  may  diff er  from  those  that  prevailed, on average, over the previous  20 years, the width  and  shape  of the confidence  interval estimated  on  the basis of the historical forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current  assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around their  projections;  these  current  assessments  are  summarized  in  the  lower  panels. Generally  speaking,  participants  who judge  the  uncertainty  about  their  projections  as  'broadly  similar'  to  the  average  levels  of  the  past  20  years  would  view the width  of the confidence interval shown  in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments  of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who  judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced'  would  view  the  confidence  interval  around  their  projections  as  approximately  symmetric.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines are based  on  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the  Committee's  target for the federal funds  rate at the end  of the year indicated. The  actual  values  are the midpoint  of  the target range; the median  projected values are based on either the midpoint  of the target range or the target level. The  confidence  interval around  the median  projected  values  is based  on root mean  squared  errors  of various private and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years. The  confidence  interval  is  not  strictly  consistent  with  the projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  primarily  because  these  projections  are  not  forecasts  of  the  likeliest  outcomes  for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments  of appropriate  monetary  policy. Still, historical  forecast  errors  provide  a  broad  sense  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate generated  by  the  uncertainty  about  the  macroeconomic  variables  as  well  as  additional  adjustments  to  monetary  policy that  may  be  appropriate  to  off set  the  eff ects  of  shocks  to  the  economy.

The  confidence  interval  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  except  when  it  is  truncated  at  zero-the  bottom  of  the  lowest target range  for the federal funds  rate that has been  adopted  in  the past by the Committee. This truncation  would not be intended  to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative  interest rates to provide  additional  monetary  policy accommodation  if  doing  so  was  judged  appropriate. In such  situations,  the  Committee  could  also  employ  other  tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  their  projections.

* The  confidence  interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term  interest rates in the fourth quarter  of  the  year  indicated;  more  information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2. The  shaded  area  encompasses less than  a  70  percent  confidence  interval  if  the  confidence  interval  has  been  truncated  at  zero.

Longer-run  Projections

Question  1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take SHORTER  OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate below  your  best  estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You may  also  include  below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: We  are  already  below  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  sustainable  unemployment  rate.  I  expect that  we  will  be  at  or  very  near  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  by  the  end  of  this  year,  though  the  exact  timing  is uncertain.  Unemployment  will  remain  low,  and  inflation  above  target,  during  2019  and  2020.  It  might  easily  take 3  to  5  years  beyond  that  to  converge  to  a  reasonable  approximation  of  full  employment  and  price  stability  under appropriate  policy.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  by  2019. However,  it  will  take  a  couple  more  years  to achieve  complete  convergence  to  longer-run  levels. The  effects  from  sustained  accommodative  monetary  policy will  generate  a  modest  degree  of  overshooting  of  inflation  and  an  unemployment  rate  that  remains  well  below  the natural  rate  for  a  number  of  years,  before  returning  back  to  longer-run  levels.  Recent  data  show  no  indication  of  a shift  in  longer-run  levels  of  GDP  growth  or  the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 6: Reflecting  recent  data,  we  project  a  temporary  and  slight  undershooting  of  core  inflation  for 2018.  GDPgrowthandunemploymentarealsoexpectedtodeviatefromaregimecharacterizedbylowproductivity growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features  GDP  growth  of  2.0 percent,  an  unemployment  rate  of  4.5  percent,  and  inflation  of  2.0  percent. We  project  that  the  undershooting of core  inflation  will  end  in  2019,  the  overshooting  of  GDP  growth  will  end  in  2020,  and  the  undershooting  of unemployment  will  end  in  2021.  Because  there  are  multiple  potential  medium-term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide a  single  set  of  projections  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment.  Calculating  an  average  of  these  variables  based  on multiple  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading. We  do  provide  a  2.0  percent  longer-run  inflation  projection  that  is independent  of  the  regime.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: The  economy  is  already  operating  above  full  employment,  and  the  medium-term  outlook  calls for  a further  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate. In  order  to  converge  back  to  full  employment,  the  growth  rate of  the  economy  will  need  to  slow  below  potential  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time. The  historical  record,  however, places  a  significant  probability  on  a 'growth  recession'  eventually  morphing  into  a  full-blown  recession. In  sum, while  a  purely  model-driven  forecast  would  suggest  convergence  to  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  from  below around  2024-25,  the  probability  that  the  projected  soft  landing  will  not  materialize  in  practice  is  sizable.

Respondent 9: We  still  assume  the  potential  GDP  growth  rate  is  1.8  percent. We  continue  to  judge  that the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  is  between  4  and  6  percent,  but  based  on  our  evaluation  of  recent developments  in  the  labor  market  and  inflation  we  now  place  the  mode  of  that  distribution  in  the  lower  half  of  that interval,  between  4  and  4.5  percent.  Consequently,  we  lowered  our  point  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of unemployment  from  4.6  percent  to  4.3  percent.

At  this  time,  we  tentatively  judge  that  any  supply-side  impact  from  the  recently  enacted  tax  legislation  will have  only  a  limited  effect  on  potential  GDP  growth  and  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment. We  will continue  to  monitor  the  impact  of  the  legislation  on  these  variables.

Based  on  our  scenario  analysis  of  labor  flows  and  the  historical  behavior  of  the  unemployment  rate  in  long expansions,  we  project  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  significantly  below  its  longer-run  normal  level  through 2020,  and  probably  not  return  to  that  level  until  at  least  a  couple  of  years  into  that  decade.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's longer-run  objective. Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  projected  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  normal unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  price  index  to  be  mildly above  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective  in  2019-20,  before  returning  to  that  level  early  in  the  next  decade.

Respondent 10: Having  essentially  achieved  our  objectives  for  inflation  and  unemployment,  the  current stance  of  monetary  policy  will  likely  cause  a  further  decline  of  the  unemployment  rate  below  its  longer-run  level. Policy  rates  will  need  to  adjust  gradually  over  several  years  to  bring  unemployment  back  in  line  with  the  longer-run objective  and  ensure  sustainable  economic  growth  with  price  stability.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Relative  to  my  December  submission,  I  have  slightly  raised  my  estimate  of  GDP  growth  over the  longer  run.  This  change  reflects  my  assessment  of  the  likely  economic  impact  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act.

Respondent 13: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  five  to  six  years.

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projection  within  5  years

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Question  2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: The  changes  to  the  tax  code  passed  in  December  and  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  (BBA)  passed in  February  add  uncertainty  to  the  outlook. Tax  cuts  will  boost  consumption  and  investment  and  the  BBA  will boost  government  spending  over  the  next  few  years.  However,  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  fiscal  impulse  and the  multiplier  and  crowding  out  effects  are  all  uncertain.  Similarly  the  potential  for  trade  barriers  to  intensify  adds uncertainty.  All  these  considerations  a ffect  our  projections  for  both  inflation  and  real  activity,  but  not  by  enough to move  us  out  of  the'broadly  similar'uncertainty box.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Uncertainty  about  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  next  few  years  is high.  The  adverse  economic  consequences  of  any  policy  errors  will  most  likely  be  felt  in  2020.  Over  2018  and  most of  2019,  however,  economic  uncertainty  is  about  average.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  its  average level  over  the  past  20  years.  Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation  expectations  at  the  FOMC's stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: While  the  forecasting  exercise  under  current  conditions  may  not  be  as  uncertain  as  during the  Great  Recession,  it  is  worth  noting  that  spells  with  an  economy  significantly  above  full  employment  for  a considerable  amount  of  time  -  the  kind  of  scenario  implied  by  our  forecast  -  have  been  rare  in  the  post-WWII period.  Therefore,  there  is  uncertainty  about  the  ability  of  our  forecasting  models  to  capture  adequately  some  of the  relevant  features  associated  with  the  current  state  of  the  economy.

Respondent 9: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  widths  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distributions  for  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  widths  of  these  intervals  are not substantially  different  from  those  in  our  December  SEP  submission. Indications  that  the  U.S.  economy is progressing  roughly  along  the  lines  of  our  earlier  outlook  and  relatively  low  financial  market  volatility  (even with  the  rise since the January  FOMC  meeting)  suggest  some  reduction  in  uncertainty. However,  the  fiscal stimulus  provided  by  the  tax  legislation  and  the  budget  agreement  at  a  time  when  the  economy  may  be  beyond full  employment  points  to  some  greater  uncertainty  about  its  ultimate  economic  effects  on  both  real  activity  and inflation. In  addition,  the  recent  developments  regarding  tariff  measures  and  other  trade  policies  prompt  some greater  uncertainty  around  the  economic  outlook.  Overall,  we  see  these  developments  as  approximately  o ffsetting and  thus  the  probability  intervals  for  real  activity  and  core  PCE  inflation  forecasts  remain  broadly  in  line  with  the SEP  standard-for  inflation,  this  assessment  takes  into  account  the  differences  between  forecast  errors  for  overall consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: The  current  level  of  uncertainty  lies  somewhere  between  the  low  levels  experienced  during the  Great  Moderation  and  the  high  levels  experienced  during  the  financial  crisis  and  its  immediate  aftermath.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: Uncertainty  surrounding  output  growth  and  unemployment  remains  elevated  by  heightened uncertainty  about  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  on  an  economy  that  is  near  full  employment.  Trade  policy  and  the potential  for  significant  repercussions  from  our  trading  partners  is  a  source  of  increased  uncertainty  as  well. The impact  on  inflation  uncertainty  is  small  given  how  flat  the  Phillips  curve  seems  to  be.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

Question  2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments regarding  your  judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections, you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: We  see  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  both  growth  and  inflation  as  broadly  balanced. Overall, we  see  the  odds  as  roughly  equal  that  fiscal  policy  will  result  in  a  bit  more  or  a  bit  less  stimulus  than  we  built  into our  projection. That  said,  our  forecast  does  incorporate  a  fairly  large  fiscal  boost  in  2018,  and  we  see  some  risk that  more  of  this  will  occur  in  2019  than  we  have  assumed.  The  likelihood  of  stronger  world-wide  demand  appears balanced  against  the  potential  for  some  future  weakness,  most  notably  if  trade  barriers  intensify. Recent  data suggest  inflation  is  on  a  firmer  path  toward  our  objective  than  we  thought  in  December,  and  could  reflect  more underlying  inflationary  pressures  than  we  have  built  into  our  forecast.  Also,  stronger  fiscal  policy  effects  on  growth could  put  more  upward  pressure  on  inflation  than  we  have  assumed. However,  continued  low  levels  of  inflation compensation  in  financial  markets  and  some  surveys  suggest  low  long  run  inflation  expectations  could  hold  back inflation  more  than  we  assume  in  our  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Fiscal-policychangesareunlikelytoresultinsustainedmaterialimprovementinGDPgrowth, but  will  leave  us  with  a  high  (and  rising)  ratio  of  debt  to  GDP  at  a  time  when  the  U.S.  government  is  already  highly leveraged.  The  changes  will  considerably  complicate  the  conduct  of  monetary  policy,  both  in  the  near  term-when monetary  policy  will  have  to  adjust  to  a  significant,  temporary  boost  to  demand-and  over  the  longer  term-when elevated  leverage  will  leave  the  fiscal  authorities  ill-positioned  to  help  Fed  policymakers  o ffset  future  adverse demand  shocks.  So,  near-term  risks  to  real  activity  may  be  weighted  somewhat  to  the  upside  and  longer-term  risks to  the  downside.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. There  remains  uncertainty  about  the effects  of  recent  tax  and  budget  changes  on  the  economic  outlook.  In  addition,  the  possibility  of  further  changes  to trade  and  immigration  policies  adds  additional  risk  around  the  outlook

Respondent 6: With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  regime  is  low.  A  higher  productivity growth  regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Recent  increases in productivity  growth  still  leave  productivity  in  the  low  productivity  regime. However,  as  changes  in  tax  and regulatory  policy  impact  the  economy,  we  foresee  the  possibility  of  more  rapid  GDP  growth.  Thus,  we  see  an  upside risk  for  GDP  growth.  On  the  other  hand,  we  do  see  U.S.  trade  policy  as  generating  some  downside  risk  for  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  rate  is  at  the  low  end  for  an  economic  expansion. If a  recession  were to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially. We  have  no  compelling  reason  to  predict  a  recession during  the  forecast  horizon. U.S.  trade  policy  also  raises  the  possibility  of  trade  disruptions  that  might  increase unemployment.  On  the  other  hand,  we  also  see  the  possibility  of  further  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate  if  GDP growth  surprises  on  the  upside.  Federal  stimulus  associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  might  produce such  a  surprise.  Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  broadly  balanced.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  effects.  There  is,  however, a risk  that  Phillips  Curve  effects  reassert  themselves  and  inflation  moves  higher  as  the  unemployment  rate  falls. It is also  possible  that  inflation  expectations  drift  higher  and  become  unanchored. In  addition,  federal  stimulus associated  with  recent  tax  and  spending  changes  could  push  prices  higher. Trade  policy  changes  might  also  put some  upward  pressure  on  import  prices.  Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For  PCE  inflation,  the  risks  are  the  same  as  for  core  PCE  inflation. In  addition,  this  variable  depends  on  the behavior  of  energy  prices  and  an  upward  price  shock  is  a  possibility. Overall,  we  see  the  risks  as  weighted  to  the upside.

Respondent 7: To  be  clear,  the  downside  weighting  means  that  there  is  some  additional  likelihood  that  the unemployment rate will  decline  more  rapidly  than  in  my  projection,  due  to  the  possibility  that  productivity  growth is  weaker  than  assumed.

Respondent 8: Over  the  period  2018-2020,  we  view  the  risks  around  our  projections  as  broadly  balanced.  At a  longer  horizon,  however,  our  baseline  forecast  delivers  a  soft  landing  from  a  very  low  level  of  the  unemployment rate  to  a  higher  level  consistent  with  full  employment. As  already  mentioned,  these  smooth  transitions  are  rare in practice. We  would  therefore  judge  the  risks  to  our  projection  of  real  activity  growth  beyond  2020  as  being weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 9: Ours  is  a  quantitative  judgment  based on  the  difference between  the central projection  and the expected  value  of  the  New  York  Fed  forecast  distribution.  We  see  two-sided  risks  associated  with  the  tax  legislation and  the  budget  agreement.  On  the  one  hand  they  could  have  more  positive  supply-side  and/or  demand-side  effects than  we  currently  anticipate;  on  the  other,  they  can  have  significant  regional  and  sectoral  distributional  effects and  generate  frictions  in  capital  stock  adjustment  and  labor  mobility  that  could  lead  to  adverse  supply-side  and demand-side  effects.  Similarly,  the  combined  effects  of  other  changes  in  U.S.  regulatory  and  trade  policies  on  the real  activity  risks  appear  to  be  two-sided.  Therefore,  as  in  December,  we  judge  these  risks  to  be  roughly  balanced over  the  forecast  horizon.

We  see  now  inflation  risks  tilted  to  the  upside  throughout  the  forecast  horizon. Longer-term  inflation  compensation,  the  Michigan  survey  long-run  inflation  expectations,  and  our  SCE  3-year  inflation  expectations  remain at  low  levels  on  a  historical  basis. Inflation  indicators  were  firm  in  January,  while  core  CPI  inflation  in  February was  about  as  expected,  consistent  with  transitory  factors  beginning  to  fade,  as  implied  in  our  central  projection. Measures  of  underlying  inflation  have  provided  varying  signals  since  the  December  FOMC  meeting,  with  some rising  modestly,  some  being  little  changed,  and  a  few  falling  slightly. Nevertheless,  global  disinflationary  forces appear  to  have  subsided  while  financial  conditions  have  only  modestly  tightened  from  very  easy  levels,  indicating some  upside  risks.  In  addition,  given  our  outlook  for  further  tightening  of  the  labor  market,  the  risks  of  overheating have  increased,  contributing  to  the  upside  tilt.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Risks  are  roughly  balanced. One  the  one  hand,  the  effective  lower  bound  limits  monetary policy's  ability  to  respond  to  negative  shocks. On  the  other,  the  recent  changes  in  fiscal  policy  present  increased upside  risks  to  activity.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Icontinuetoviewtherisksaroundmyforecastasbroadlybalanced,conditionalonamonetary policy  path  that  is  slightly  steeper  than  the  median  path  in  the  December  SEPs.

Themagnitude and timing oftheeffect offiscal policy (tax cuts and increased federalspendingin the Bipartisan Budget  Act)  are  uncertain  and  pose  risks  to  my  forecast. I am  estimating  that  the  combined  effect  will  provide an  additional  0.5  percentage  point  to  Q4/Q4  GDP  growth  in  2018-2020,  but  there  is  an  upside  risk  that  the  effect is larger. Beyond  the  forecast  horizon,  these  fiscal  policy  actions  pose  some  downside  risk  to  the  outlook  because higher  fiscal  deficits  could  necessitate  reduced  fiscal  spending,  an  increase  in  taxes,  and  higher  longer-term  interest rates.

Even  without  the  fiscal  policy  actions,  the  underlying  fundamentals  of  the  domestic  economy  are  healthy  and the  outlook  for  foreign  economies  continues  to  improve.  Although  I  expect  some  gradual  reduction  in  the  level  of accommodation, Ibelievemonetarypolicywillremainaccommodativeandsupportiveofgrowthinmanycountries.

Recent  readings  suggest  there  is  still  some  cyclical  improvement  in  labor  force  participation  even  though  there is a downward  secular  trend  in  participation. This  development  and  the  fact  that  price  and  wage  inflation  have remained  moderate  even  as  labor  markets  continue  to  tighten  have  led  me  to  reduce  my  estimate  of  the  long-run unemployment  rate  to  4.5  percent  from  4.75  percent. But  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  around  this  estimate and  I  see  both  upside  and  downside  risks  to  my  estimate.

I  continue  to  see  inflation  risks  as  roughly  balanced.  Incoming  data  suggest  that  inflation  is  firming.  My  modal forecast  is  that  inflation  will  gradually  return  to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  time,  with  this  goal  being  achieved  on  a sustained  basis  in  the  first  half  of  2019.

If  the  dynamics  of  inflation  have  fundamentally  changed,  then  I  may  be  underestimating  the  persistence  of  low inflation  outcomes.  But  if  labor  markets  tighten  more  than  I  expect,  or  if  nonlinear  Phillips  curve  dynamics  begin to  kick  in,  inflation  could  move  higher  than  I  anticipate, especially  if  the  withdrawal  of  monetary  accommodation  is slower  than  I've  assumed.  Even  absent  a  change  in  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve,  a  slower  withdrawal  of  monetary accommodation  than  I've  assumed  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

After  appreciating  between  mid-2014  through  2016,  the  dollar  has  depreciated  over  the  past  year. I assume that  this  downward  trend  will  reverse  given  the  strength  in  the  U.S.  economy  and  prospects  for  tighter  monetary policy.  However,  a  continuation  of  the  depreciation  poses  an  upside  risk  to  my  inflation  forecast.

ff increasing  rounds  of  retaliatory  tariffs,  which  would  entail  downside  risks  to  growth,  upside  risks  to The  recently  announced  tariffs  on  steel  and  aluminum  imports  have  not  changed  my  outlook.  Although  some businesses  will  gain  and  others  will  lose,  the  effect  on  the  macroeconomy  is  likely  to  be  small  provided  the  tariffs do  not  set  o inflation,  and  downside  risks  to  longer-run  productivity  by  disrupting  the  efficient  allocation  of  resources.

Risks  to  financial  stability  from  very  low  interest  rates  appear  to  be  contained  so  far.  There  does  not  seem  to  be excessive  leverage  and  banks  are  holding  relatively  high  levels  of  capital  and  liquid  assets.  However,  equity  prices still  appear  to  be  somewhat  high  relative  to  earnings  even  accounting  for  the  low  level  of  interest  rates,  reduced  tax rates,  and  the  tempering  of  stock  price  increases  this  year. Commercial  real  estate  valuations  also  continue  to  be lofty. These  signs,  the  relatively  low  level  of  interest  rates,  and  the  outlook  for  continued  strength  in  the  economy suggest  that  financial  stability  risks  could  rise  should  we  fail  to  remove  monetary  policy  accommodation  at  an appropriate  pace.  The  sharp  increase  in  volatility  since  the  January  FOMC  meeting  has  not  changed  my  outlook, but  it  is  a  reminder  that  we  need  to  keep  attuned  to  leveraged  trading  strategies  that  can  lead  to  sharp  moves  in prices  and  liquidity.

Respondent 14: A  widening  trade  war  is  a  key  downside  risk  to  the  economy  through  two  channels.  First,  the associatedadverseshocktoglobalconfidencecouldsetinmotiontheunwindingofthevirtuouscycleofsynchronous globalgrowthwehavebenefitedfromoverthepastyearorso.  Aconfidence-inducedreductioninglobalGDPgrowth and  the  knock-on  effects  to  US  growth  would  tend  to  boost  the  unemployment  rate.  Second,  historical  precedent suggests  a  broad  trade  war  could  lead  to  a  contraction  in  global  trade  that  could  adversely  a ffect  the  longer-run productive  capacity  of  the  US  economy. This  longer-run  channel  is  more  likely  to  a ffect  output  growth  (through productivity)  than  the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 15: I anticipate  some  stimulus  from  the  tax  reform  and  the  BBA  beginning  in  2018  that  will boost  demand,  raise  output  growth,  and  lower  the  unemployment  rate  further. However,  my  uncertainty  about the  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  remains  high.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

Question  3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your projections  for  any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate for that  year  is  close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal level and  inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your assessment  of  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year is still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value, please  describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  revised  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Weassumethreeincreasesinthefundsratein2018, withpolicythenmovinguptoourlong-run neutral  value  of  2.75  percent  in  2019  and  then  to  3.25  percent  in  2020. We  assume  balance  sheet  normalization proceeds  according  to  the  announced  plan.

ff for  a  time,  which  should  lead  to  a We  believe  this  policy  package  represents  a  balanced  approach  to  achieving  our  dual  mandate  objectives. Inflation  appears  to  be  more  firmly  on  a  trajectory  towards  our  symmetric  2  percent  objective.  Yet  with  inflation expectations  remaining  relatively  low  and  a  non-accelerationist  Phillips  curve,  we  believe  policy  normalization should  proceed  at  a  modest  pace  in  order  to  solidify  inflationary  expectations  symmetrically  around  2  percent. This  is  a  pre-requisite  for  achieving  our  inflation  objective  over  the  longer  term.  Accordingly  we  have  just  three  rate increases  in  2018.  Furthermore,  we  think  it  is  appropriate  to  delay  the  first  of  these  rate  increases  until  June.  Doing so  would  allow  us  to  confirm  that  inflation  has  indeed  moved  up  perceptibly  on  a  year-over-year  basis.  Waiting  for this  confirmation  would  send  an  important  signal  to  the  public  of  our  firm  commitment  to  a  symmetric  inflation target. The  slow  pace  of  rate  increases  thereafter  -  which  occur  against  the  backdrop  of  an  unemployment  rate more  than  a  percentage  point  below  its  natural  rate  -  should  bolster  inflation  expectations  further. Resource pressure  and  firming  inflation  expectations  should  bring  us  close  to  2  percent  inflation  by  late  2019,  at  which  time we  assume  the  funds  rate  will  be  at  its  long-run  neutral  level. This  configuration  would  likely  generate  a  small overshooting  of  our  2  percent  inflation  objective  in  2020,  which  would  warrant  modest  increases  in  the  federal funds  rate  above  its  long-run  neutral  level.  Beyond  2020  we  see  rates  leveling  o furthermodestovershootingofourinflationtarget, therebyhelpingtocementinflationexpectationssymmetrically around  2  percent.  Of  course  data  dependent  policy  would  react  more  aggressively  if  inflation  expectations  firmed more  robustly  than  we  anticipate.

Respondent 2: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a  gradual  rise in  the  short-run  equilibrium  funds  rate.

Respondent 3: As  the  economy's  momentum  carries  it  further  past  full  employment  and  eventually  past 2-percent  inflation,  it  will  be  appropriate  to  transition  to  a  mildly  restrictive  monetary  policy  stance. A  mildly restrictive  policy  maintained  over  several  years  will  give  us  our  best  chance  for  moving  the  economy  along  a  smooth glide  path  back  to  full  employment  and  price  stability. Achieving  and  maintaining  a  mildly  restrictive  monetary policy  in  the  face  of  shifting  fiscal-policy  currents  will  prove  challenging,  and  my  confidence  that  the  funds-rate path  I  have  specified  will  prove  to  be  appropriate  is  lower  than  usual.  At  issue  is  whether  we  can  slow  the  economy to  a  sustainable  rate  of  growth  without  inverting  the  yield  curve. I think  that  we  can,  but  the  margin  for  error  is small.

Risks  to  my  2018  funds-rate  projection  are  tilted  to  the  upside.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: The  labor  market  has  exceeded  full  employment  according  to  various  measures  and  I  expect it  to  continue  to  strengthen  over  the  next  couple  of  years  with  considerable  impetus  from  fiscal  policy.  I  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  fall  below  4  percent  this  year,  and  continue  to  decline  into  2019  before  eventually  returning to  its  natural  rate  of  4.7  percent.  I  anticipate  that  strong  economic  conditions  will  gradually  push  inflation  up  over the  next  few  years,  causing  it  to  modestly  overshoot  our  2  percent  objective  in  2019  and  2020.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero lower  bound  and  assume  a  low  natural  rate  of  interest  of 1 / 2 percent.

My  fed  funds  path  is  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest.  This  reflects  an  inflation  rate  that  has  been rising  only  gradually  toward  our  objective  from  below. Beyond  the  near  term,  I  envision  a  path  for  the  fed  funds rate  that  moderately  overshoots  its  long-run  level  in  2019  and  2020  as  policy  acts  to  unwind  the  overshooting  in inflation  and  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 6: A  target  of  1.63  percent  for  the  forecast  horizon  is  consistent  with  our  assessment  of  current economic  conditions  and  the  convergence  of  inflation,  GDP  growth,  and  unemployment  to  their  values  in  a  regime characterized  by  low  productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt.  In  the  event of  a  regime  change,  such  as  a  shift  from  low  productivity  growth  to  high  productivity  growth,  our  target  federal funds  rate  will  change.

Respondent 7: My  projection  assumes  that  labor  productivity  will  grow  more  rapidly  than  we  have  observed recently.  This  assumption  contributes  to  my  projection  that  the  longer-run  interest  rate  is  3.5  percent.

Respondent 8: Optimal  control  policy  simulations  prescribe  a  higher  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  than  the one  penciled  in  here. More  aggressive  policy  tightening,  however,  could  increase  the  probability  of  a  recession  in ways  that  our  linear  models  are  unable  to  capture. Our  projected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  tries  to  balance this  concern  against  the  concern  that  running  an  economy  above  full  employment  for  a  prolonged  period  of  time might  create  distortions  that,  too,  increase  the  probability  of  a  future  downturn.

Respondent 9: The  principal  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary  policy  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  outlook.  The steepness  of  the  policy  path  also  depends  on  how  overall  financial  conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

ff DSGE  model. The  real  growth  outlook  has  improved  noticeably,  financial  conditions  have  modestly  tightened,  the  near-term inflation  outlook  is  moving  up,  and  the  balance  of  risks  for  inflation  tilts  toward  the  upside. Consequently,  our projection  of  the  appropriate  policy  path  is  a  bit  steeper  relative  to  the  December  SEP  submission:  the  target  FFR ranges  at  the  end  of  2018,  2019  and  2020  are  2 1 / 4 - 2 1 / 2 percent,  3  - 3 1 / 4 percent  and  3 1 / 2 - 3 3 / , 4 respectively. We  judge  the  additional  tightening  of  the  policy  stance  relative  to  what  we  projected  in  December  as  appropriate to ensure  achievement  of  the  FOMC's  objectives  over  the  medium  term  following  the  projected  small  inflation overshoot  and  the  unemployment  undershoot.  Our  policy  path  remains  fairly  shallow  and  is  consistent  with  the gradual  rising  path  of  the  natural  interest  rate  as  projected  by  the  New  York  Fed  sta

Our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  remains  in  the  range  of  0  -  2  percent, consistentwithestimatesandforecastsfromavarietyofmodels.  Addingtheobjectiveforinflation(2percent)gives our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2  -  4  percent.  Our  modal  projection  is  now  in  the  center  of this  range,  taking  into  account  still  fairly  subdued  trend  productivity  growth,  higher  longer-term  sovereign  yields, a  diminishing  global'saving  glut,'and  demographic  factors.  Consequently,  as  reported  in  the  response  to  question 3(a)  we  have  raised  our  point  estimate  of  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  to  3.0  percent.  Our  appropriate  policy  path thus  slightly  overshoots  the  longer-run  FFR.

Respondent 10: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated  on promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. The  economy  has  reached  full  capacity  and  we  have essentially  achieved  price  stability,  yet  I  view  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate ofitslonger-runlevelin2018.  Thatthefederalfundsrateisstilllowdespitetheeconomy'sreturntofullemployment and  price  stability  reflects  the  Committee's  past  decisions,  and  I  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate  as  important topromoteeconomicandfinancialstability.  Balancingagradualpathofthefederalfundsratewithaccommodative

monetary  policy,  stronger  growth,  lower  unemployment,  and  higher  inflation,  I  believe  the  funds  rate  will  need  to rise  above  its  longer-run  level  in  2019  and  beyond.

Respondent 11: Although  inflation  appears  to  be  firming,  it  has  been  running  below  our  2  percent  target  for quite  some  time. While  the  labor  market  continues  to  strengthen,  it  is  not  clear  that  we  have  reached  maximum employment  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  employment-population  ratio  for  prime  age  persons  remain well  below  their  pre-recession  levels,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. Given  the  persistent  undershooting  of our  inflation  target,  I  believe  that  appropriate  monetary  policy  implies  a  very  gradual  path  for  the  federal  funds rate.

Respondent 12: Relative  to  my  December  submission,  my  projection  now  incorporates  a  slightly  faster  pace of  tightening  in  2018. This  change  is  meant  to  help  forestall  a  persistent  overshoot  of  our  inflation  objective. It reflects  primarily  my  expectation  that  GDP  will  grow  faster  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  decline  more  over  the next  several  years  than  I  had  previously  anticipated.

Respondent 13: I continue  to  view  a  gradual  upward  path  for  the  funds  rate  as  appropriate;  the  slope  of the  path  will  depend  on  the  evolution  of  the  economy,  medium  run  outlook,  and  the  risks  around  the  outlook,  in particular,  for  inflation  and  labor  markets.

Over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  project  growth  above  trend  and  the  unemployment  rate  below  my  estimate  of  its longer-run  level,  which  I  have  lowered  by  0.25  percentage  point  to  4.5  percent  in  this  submission.  The  subdued  rate of  wage  growth  during  the  expansion  partly  reflects  sluggish  productivity  growth. Labor  markets  are  tight,  but subdued  wage  growth  and  the  recent  increases  in  labor  force  participation  suggest  they  aren't  quite  as  tight  as  I've been  assuming. I anticipate  that  further  tightening  in  the  labor  market  will  translate  into  some  firming  in  labor compensation  measures,  in  line  with  anecdotal  reports  of  increasing  wage  pressures  across  a  range  of  skill  groups. However,  if  productivity  growth  remains  low,  wage  gains  will  likely  be  slower  than  in  past  expansions.

Incoming  data  indicate  some  firming  in  inflation. In  the  near  term,  the  year-over-year  inflation  measures  are likely  to  move  up  when  last  March's  sharp  decline  in  the  price  of  cell  phone  service  plans  falls  out  of  the  numbers. This  increase  is  not  likely  to  be  sustained,  but  my  modal  projection  is  that  inflation  will  gradually  rise  to  our  goal over  the  forecast  horizon.

Given  that  monetary  policy  a ffects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy  should  reflect both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Based  on  the  outlook  and  risks,  I  believe  it will  be  appropriate  for  the  FOMC  to  move  rates  up  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon. This  strategy  would seem  to  prudently  balance  the  risk  of  stronger-than-expected  growth  leading  to  overheating  in  labor  markets, which  would  necessitate  sharper,  and  potentially  destabilizing,  rate  increases  in  the  future  versus  the  risk  that inflation  will  continue  to  undershoot  our  goal,  causing  an  unanchoring  of  inflation  expectations  and  possible  loss of  Fed  credibility. With  above-trend  growth,  labor  markets  beyond  full  employment,  and  inflation  moving  back to  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  for  the  funds  rate  to  rise  somewhat  above my  longer-run  estimate  of  3  percent  in  order  to  promote  our  longer-run  goals  of  maximum  employment  and  price stability.

Respondent 14: Under  current  and  projected  conditions,  a  gradual  path  of  increases  in  the  federal  funds rate  is  appropriate. It  is  likely  that  underlying  trend  inflation  is  currently  running  somewhat  below  the  FOMC's 2 percent  target. In  this  situation,  raising  the  federal  funds  rate  only  gradually  despite  an  unemployment  rate that  is  below  its  longer-run  normal  rate  and  inflation  that  is  moving  closer  to  target  will  help  signal  to  the  public that  the  FOMC  is  serious  about  achieving  its  inflation  objective  and  help  to  reanchor  underlying  trend  inflation at  2  percent.  Consistent  with  the  symmetry  of  the  target,  inflation  in  my  projection  slightly  exceeds  the  FOMC's target  in  2020.

Respondent 15: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  higher  over  the  next  two years  compared  to  December. My  forecast  for  output  growth  and  inflation  are  higher  due  to  anticipated  effects of additional  fiscal  stimulus. While  I  remain  concerned  about  the  realization  of  generally  soft  inflation  over  the last  few  quarters,  the  incoming  data  suggest  that  a  firming  of  inflation  is  somewhat  more  likely  to  occur  over  the forecast  horizon.

Forecast  Narratives

Question  4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including  your assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies,  shaping  your  central economic  outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: The  fundamentals  underlying  private  domestic  final  demand  are  strong. Despite  recent weakness  in  consumer  spending  indicators,  we  see  accommodative  monetary  policy,  a  robust  labor  market,  and improved  balance  sheets  supporting  strong  gains  in  consumer  spending  and  investment  going  forward. Stronger foreign  demand  is  another  plus  for  the  outlook. We  also  expect  growth  in  2018  will  be  boosted  close  to  1  percent by  tax  cuts  and  higher  government  spending. The  gradual  removal  of  monetary  accommodation  and  a  smaller impulse  from  fiscal  policy  are  projected  to  bring  GDP  growth  down  in  2019  and  2020.  (We  assume  the  fiscal  impulse is  only  a  tenth  or  two  in  2020.)  On  the  supply  side,  we  assume  the  tax  bill  will  boost  potential  growth  a  bit  over  the forecast  period.  In  sum,  we  now  project  growth  will  run  more  than  a  full  percentage  point  above  potential  in  2018, about  a 1 / 2 percentage  point  above  in  2019,  and  then  slow  to  a  bit  below  potential  in  2020.

We  think  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  currently  is  4.6  percent  and  that  it  will  trend  down  to  4.5  percent by  2020.  So  at  4.1  percent,  the  current  unemployment  rate  is  50  basis  points  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate. We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  further,  reaching  3.4  percent  in  2019  and  rising  a  little  in  2020, leaving  a  1.0  percentage  point  gap  from  the  natural  rate  we  expect  to  prevail  at  that  time.

Weinferfromtherelativelylowreadingsonkeymeasuresofinflationexpectationsthatthepersistentcomponent in  underlying  inflation  is  currently  below  2  percent.  But  we  are  projecting  various  factors  will  help  boost  this  trend closer  to  our  inflation  target.  With  unemployment  forecast  to  undershoot  the  natural  rate  substantially,  resource pressures  should  provide  a  notable  lift  to  inflation  going  forward. That  said,  a  non-accelerationist  Phillips  curve limits  the  upside  risk  to  inflation  even  with  the  unemployment  rate  near  3-1/2  percent. Indeed  to  achieve  our inflation  objective  we  also  rely  on  our  assumed  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated commitment  to  a  symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  solidifying  inflation  expectations.  All  told,  we  see  inflation reaching  1.8  percent  this  year,  1.9  percent  in  2019,  and  modestly  overshooting  our  objective  in  2020.

The  key  factors  shaping  uncertainty  and  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  were  discussed  earlier  in  the  risks  and uncertainty  sections.

Respondent 2: My  outlook  consists  of  above  trend  growth  for  the  next  two  years,  before  converging  to  trend in  2020. A  moderate  overshoot  of  potential  is  driven  by  recent  changes  to  the  tax  code  and  the  recently  enacted Bipartisan  Budget  Act  (BBA)  that  increases  federal  discretionary  spending  significantly. The  change  in  the  tax code  accelerates  capital  investment  plans,  pulling  some  investment  spending  forward  into  the  latter  half  of  this year  and  2019.  However,  it  is  my  judgment  that  the  tax  reform  will  only  lead  to  modest  changes  in  output  growth.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  are  weighted  to  the  upside.  Recently  enacted  fiscal  measures  could  have  a  much more  transformative  effect  on  growth  that  I  currently  expect.  Although  I  do  recognize  that  there  is  some  downside risk  due  to  uncertainty  over  future  trade  policy  and  reaction  from  our  primary  trading  partners.

Consistent  with  some  of  the  stronger  readings  in  recent  months  and  given  the  absence  of  resource  slack  in  my projection,  I  see  inflation  converging  to  target  by  the  end  of  this  year.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  tilted  to  the  upside. I see the  potential  for  growth  to  overshoot  my projection,  which  would  put  upward  pressure  on  inflation.  And,  while  recent  history  suggests  that  the  response  of inflation  to  resource  slack  is  somewhat  muted,  it  may  be  more  pronounced  at  high  rates  of  resource  utilization.

Respondent 3: My  projections  assume  that  restrictions  on  international  trade  turn  out,  in  practice,  to  have narrow  application,  and  do  not  lead  to  a  destructive  cycle  of  retaliation  and  counter-retaliation.

At  the  firm  level,  pricing  power  is  being  increasingly  challenged  and  profit  margins  are  under  pressure. Companies  are  seeking  to  defend  margins  by  investing  in  technology  that  allows  them  to  replace  people  and  improve productivity. They  are  also,  increasingly,  looking  to  merger  activity  as  a  way  to  lower  costs  and  increase  scale. Nevertheless,  with  the  labor  market  tight  and  still  tightening,  cyclical  inflationary  forces  are  building.  We  should see  confirmation  of  those  building  pressures  in  coming  inflation  reports,  and  I  expect  12-month  trimmed-mean inflation  to  reach  2.0  percent  by  the  end  of  2018.

The  more  immediate  danger  is  the  economic  excesses  and  imbalances  that  can  develop  when  decision  makers come  to  believe  that  low  interest  rates  and  above-trend  growth  can  be  sustained. Unrealistic  expectations  lead

to  unwise  commitments-commitments  that  have  the  potential  to  produce  out-sized  responses  when  interest  rates normalize,  growth  moderates,  and  imbalances  must  be  unwound.  While  real  imbalances  are  not  yet  evident,  they have  the  potential  to  develop  if  we  do  not  continue  to  remove  policy  accommodation.

Financial  imbalances  are  another  threat. The  fiscal  authorities  have  put  the  U.S.  government  on  a  track toward  high  and  rising  leverage  at  a  point  in  the  business  cycle  when  we  might  have  expected  a  move  in  the  opposite direction. With  asset  valuations  still  high,  we  need  to  closely  guard  against  a  possible  build-up  of  private-sector leverage,  too,  and  be  alert  to  other  financial  strategies  that  depend  on  strong  growth  and  low  interest  rates.

Our'Statement  on  Longer-Run  Goals  and  Monetary  Policy  Strategy'recognizes  that  realized  inflation  is  not an  adequate  guide  to  policy  by  itself: It calls  for  us  to  look  at  the  size  and  likely  persistence  of  full-employment overshoot  in  addition  to  the  size  and  likely  persistence  of  inflation  undershoot. The  unemployment  rate  cannot stay  below  the  natural  rate  indefinitely,  and  a  large  full-employment  overshoot  necessarily  implies  either  a  very sharp  or  a  very  persistent  slowing  of  output  and  employment  growth  at  some  point  in  the  future-a  slowing  that  will leave  the  economy  vulnerable  to  adverse  shocks  and  policy  mistakes.  Our  best  chance  of  achieving  and  sustaining price  stability  is  to  extend  the  expansion  of  the  US  economy,  and  our  best  chance  for  extending  the  expansion  is  to moderate  it,  sooner  rather  than  later.

Respondent 4: I believe  that  the  economy  has  considerable  momentum,  helped  along  by  expansionary  fiscal policy.  Strong  growth  will  push  down  the  unemployment  rate,  but  by  a  fairly  modest  amount  as  workers  are  drawn into  the  workforce  increasing  labor  force  participation. The  bu ffering  effect  of  higher  potential  growth,  both  in response  to  policy  changes  as  well  as  increased  investment  and  labor  force  participation,  will  limit  the  spillover  of growth  into  inflation.

Respondent 5: The  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  solid  pace  relative  to  trend,  which  has  pushed  the unemployment  rate  lower. Since  the  December  SEP,  I  have  factored  in  a  sizable  amount  of  fiscal  stimulus  to  the economic  outlook. Going  forward,  ongoing  strength  in  households  disposable  income  coupled  with  past  gains  in household  wealth  should  support  continued  consumption  growth.  The  outlook  for  fixed  business  investment  also appears  strong  given  the  recent  tax  changes  and  budget  legislation. However,  there  is  uncertainty  regarding  the size  and  timing  of  these  effects.

In  this  environment,  I  expect  the  economic  expansion  to  proceed  at  a  pace  that  is  well  above  potential.  Output andunemploymentgapswereclosedin2016.  Withconsiderablefiscalstimulusandsomemonetaryaccommodation still  in  place,  I  expect  these  gaps  to  overshoot  for  the  next  few  years,  leading  to  a  gradual  pickup  in  inflation  over the  next  few  years. I continue  to  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  target  in  2019,  and  to  overshoot  slightly in  2020. Normalization  of  monetary  policy  and  a  tightening  of  fiscal  policy  will  help  bring  inflation,  growth,  and unemployment  back  to  their  long-run  sustainable  levels  by  the  following  years.

Respondent 6: Our  forecast  continues  to  use  a  regime-based  conception  of  outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy. In  our  conception,  there  are  multiple  regimes  and  we  appear  to  have  nearly  converged  to  one  of  them.  The  current regime  is  viewed  as  persistent,  and  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon. We  are,  of  course,  paying  close  attention  to  many  factors  that  might  precipitate  a  regime  change,  such as  a  change  in  tax  policy  that  might  move  the  economy  to  a  high  productivity  state. Monetary  policy  is  regimedependent  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  other regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  the  previously  mentioned  higher  productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy  transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may be  a ffected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal  regime-dependent  policy  may  require  adjustment.  However,  predicting when  these  transitions  may  occur  is  very  challenging,  so  we  forecast  that  the  economy  will  remain  in  the  current regime  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 7: In conversations  with  senior  business  executives  I  have  heard  very  optimistic  remarks  on the  broad  economic  outlook  and  on  the  outlook  for  their  own  firms. I believe  that  this  optimism  will  support above-trend  GDP  growth  this  year  and  next. In  addition,  expansive  fiscal  policy  will  also  boost  growth. While the  unemployment  rate  falls  below  its  long-run  level  in  my  projection,  I  do  not  believe  that  inflation  will  spike much.  Inflation  expectations  appear  to  be  well  anchored.  Also,  factors  such  as  improved  transparency  of  pricing, o ffshoring  of  production,  and  competition  from  foreign  sellers  will  make  it  difficult  for  domestic  firms  to  raise  prices significantly.

Respondent 8: After  solid  advances  in  2017:H2,  activity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2018  appears  to  be  growing  at  a more  modest  pace.  Fundamentals  for  spending,  however,  remain  very  favorable  and  we  expect  growth  this  year  to outstrip  potential  by  almost  a  full  percentage  point. Several  factors  contribute  to  this  outlook. Gains  in  payrolls remain  well  above  trend,  households'  net  worth  is  high  relative  to  income,  monetary  policy  is  still  accommodative, and  fiscal  policy  actions  are  highly  supportive  of  growth  in  the  near  and  medium  term.

Relative  to  the  December  forecast,  our  fiscal  policy  assumptions  have  been  updated  to  reflect  the  enactment of  the  Tax  Cuts  Jobs  Act  and  of  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act.  Overall,  these  fiscal  measures  are  expected  to  provide more  support  to  GDP  growth  than  what  we  were  envisioning  in  December.  As  a  result,  we  now  expect  the  economy to  continue  to  grow  faster  than  potential  throughout  2019,  despite  a  tightening  of  monetary  policy.  The  effects  of monetary  policy  become  more  apparent  in  2020,  when  the  pace  of  growth  in  economic  activity  decelerates  below potential  and  the  unemployment  rate  reverses  its  course,  rising  marginally  relative  to  2019.

While  the  fiscal  stimulus  contributes  importantly  to  the  economy's  underlying  momentum,  it  is  not  the  only driver. Financial  conditions  remain  favorable,  with  high  equity  valuations,  steady  house  price  appreciation,  and interest  rates  that  are  still  low  by  historical  standards. The  two  most  recent  employment  reports  have  shown remarkable  strength  in  hiring,  with  cyclical  improvements  in  labor  force  participation.  All  of  these  factors  provide solid  underpinnings  for  household  expenditures,  and  should  give  firms  incentives  to  increase  capacity. In  addition,  foreign  economies  appear  to  be  on  a  more  solid  footing,  and  the  restraint  to  foreign  demand  from  a  dollar appreciation  forecast  has  yet  to  materialize. We  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  drop  this  year  to  3.7  percent, and  to  3.4  percent  by  the  end  of  2019. This  level  is  roughly  1 1 / 4 percentage  point  below  our  assessment  of  the equilibriumunemploymentrate,whichstandsat4.7percent.  Withtheunemploymentrateprojectedtostaybelow its  equilibrium  level  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  expect  inflation  to  increase  modestly  above  2  percent.

Given  the  economy's  momentum,  monetary  policy  needs  to  assume  a  tightening  stance  to  raise  the  unemployment  rate  back  to  a  level  consistent  with  full  employment. The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  increases  in the  federal  funds  rate  that  cumulate  to  350  bp  by  the  end  of  2020. Almost  40  percent  of  the  projected  increase  is necessary  to  bring  monetary  policy  back  to  a  neutral  stance.  While  the  expected  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is much  higher  than  markets'  expectations,  by  historical  standards  it  represents  a  cautious  pace  of  policy  tightening given  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  already  below  its  estimated  equilibrium  level.  Such  an  approach  tries  to  strike a  balance  between  the  financial  stability  risks  associated  with  an  even  more  gradual  increase  in  rates,  and  the  risk that  faster  policy  tightening  may  increase  the  probability  of  the  economy  falling  into  a  recession.  It  is  nevertheless important  to  recognize  that  the  past  does  not  provide  much  guidance  in  terms  of  how  to  conduct  policy  so  as  to achieve  a  soft  landing  when  the  economy  is  beyond  full  employment.

We  view  the  risks  around  the  GDP  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced.  We  take  a  fairly  conservative  view  of the  effect  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  on  GDP  growth,  and  the  Tealbook  baseline  outlook  highlights  the  risk  that the  tax  cuts  will  stimulate  activity  by  more  than  what  we  are  currently  expecting.  At  the  same  time,  a  prolonged period  of  monetary  policy  tightening  may  weaken  real  activity  by  more  than  we  think.  For  example,  in  our  forecast the  projected  increase  in  interest  rates  elicits  only  a  small  negative  response  in  stock  market  valuations. With valuations  already  stretched,  a  more  severe  reaction  with  a  larger  spillover  effect  on  the  real  economy  is  a  relevant risk. As  concerns  prices,  it  is  possible  that  the  equilibrium  unemployment  rate  may  be  lower  than  what  we  are currently  estimating. A  countervailing  risk  is  given  by  the  possibility  of  a  nonlinear  response  of  inflation  in  the presence  of  persistently  tight  labor  market  conditions.

Respondent 9: The  enactment  of  the  tax  legislation  (TCJA)  and  the  passage  of  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act of  2018  (BBA)  are  significant  developments  a ffecting  our  outlook. While  we  expect  the  TCJA  to  begin  to  have  a noticeable  effect  on  the  economy  in  the  coming  months,  we  assume  that  much  of  the  increased  spending  on  goods and  services  from  the  BBA  will  occur  with  some  delay: we  project  little  growth  effect  in  2018H1  and  a  moderate effect  in  2018H2,  with  the  largest  boost  to  growth  taking  place  in  2019. In  contrast,  at  this  time,  our  projection does  not  incorporate  any  significant  effects  on  either  real  activity  or  inflation  from  higher  import  tariffs.

Our  projected  GDP  growth  rate  in  2018  is  now  2.8  percent  (Q4/Q4),  with  the  impact  from  fiscal  stimulus o ffsetting  a  larger  drag  to  growth  from  net  exports.  For  2019,  while  we  still  anticipate  slower  growth  than  in  2018  as a  result  of  an  aging  business  cycle  and  a  tightening  of  financial  conditions  as  monetary  policy  normalizes  further,  we boostedtheprojectedgrowthrateto2  / %(Q4/Q4), whichis0.5percentagepointabove ourDecemberprojection. 1 2 With  fiscal  stimulus  anticipated  to  fade  in  2020,  we  project  real  GDP  growth  to  slow  to  near  its  potential  rate.

Our  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  shows  a  steady  decline  over  the  forecast  horizon  reflecting  in part  the  stronger  growth  projection  for  2018  and  2019  as  well  as  a  slight  boost  to  average  weekly  hours  in  those years. This  latter  adjustment  reflects  our  assumption  that,  in  a  tight  labor  market,  a  larger-than-usual  amount

of the  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  will  manifest  itself  in  a  higher  work  week. We  now  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  reach  3.7  percent  by  the  fourth  quarter  of  2018,  rather  than  3.8  percent  as  in  our  December submission,  and  then  decline  to  3.5  percent  by  2019Q4  rather  than  rise  to  4.0  percent. By  2020  we  assume  the unemployment  rate  starts  slowly  moving  towards  the  longer-run  rate  of  4.3  percent.

Finally, we  have  changed  slightly  our  projected  inflation  path  relative  to  December. For  2018,  core  PCE inflation  is  at  2.1  percent  on  a  Q4/Q4  basis  and  headline  PCE  inflation  moves  down  from  2.1  percent  to  2.0  percent due  to  a  lower  expected  path  for  energy  prices. Consistently  with  stronger  growth  we  now  anticipate  a  slightly stronger  inflation  overshooting  than  we  had  in  December,  with  both  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  projected  at 2.3  percent  on  a  Q4/Q4  basis  for  2019  as  well  as  2020;  nonetheless,  we  anticipate  that  inflation  expectations  will remain  at  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

Respondent 10: Modal  forecast: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth from  2018  to  2020,  which  is  partly  attributable  to  an  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance.  Without  the  fiscal  stimulus, and  as  monetary  policy  accommodation  is  gradually  removed,  real  GDP  would  likely  increase  at  its  longer-run rate  from  2019  onward,  based  on  modest  increases  in  the  labor  force  and  moderate  productivity  gains. I expect headline  and  core  inflation  to  rise  above  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon  reflecting  accommodative  monetary policy,  real  GDP  above  potential,  and  tightening  labor  market  conditions.

Uncertaintyandrisks:  Iviewuncertaintysurroundingmyprojectionsasbroadlysimilartolevelsofuncertainty over  the  past  20  years,  considering  the  magnitude  of  historical  projection  errors  and  current  economic  and  policy uncertainty  at  home  and  abroad. The  risks  to  economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  appear  broadly balanced.  On the downside, possible changes in government policies appear to be a source of uncertainty, including the  risk  of  more  restrictive  trade  and  immigration  policies. Furthermore,  the  current  accommodative  stance  of monetarypolicycouldleadtheunemploymentratetosignificantlyundershootitsnaturallevel.  Inthepast,periods of  overheating  have  often  led  to  higher  inflation,  financial  imbalances,  and  ultimately  recession. Upside  risks  to my  forecast  stem  from  greater-than-expected  momentum  in  the  economy,  the  possibility  that  elevated  business confidence  translates  into  sustained  increases  in  investment  and  productivity,  and  the  possibility  that  tax  reform may  increase  inflationary  pressures.

Respondent 11: Coreinflationremainsbelowtargetandtheeconomycontinuestoaddjobswithoutincreasing wage  pressures.  This  reinforces  my  assessment  that  there  continues  to  be  slack  in  the  economy.

I expect  that  recent  fiscal  policy  changes  will  boost  both  actual  and,  to  a  lesser  degree,  potential  output.

Respondent 12: The  main  factors  shaping  my  economic  outlook  include  an  increasingly  strong  labor  market, highly  supportive  domestic  financial  conditions,  solid  growth  abroad,  accommodative  domestic  fiscal  policy,  and more  data  suggesting  that  inflation  is  rising  toward  our  2  percent  objective.

Respondent 13: The  fundamentals  supporting  the  expansion  remain  favorable,  including  accommodative financial  conditions,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  strong  labor  market conditions,  relatively  low  oil  prices,  and  accommodative  monetary  and  fiscal  policy.  The  tax  changes  imply  higher disposablepersonalincomeandafter-taxcorporateprofits,whichshouldleadtosomewhathigherspendingoverthe forecast  horizon.  The  budget  package  will  expand  federal  government  spending,  although  the  timing  is  uncertain. Consumer  and  business  sentiment  remain  positive. Consistent  with  the  data,  business  contacts  report  ongoing tightness  in labor markets,  more widespread  difficulties  in finding  qualified workers,  and  the  increasing need to  raise wages  in  order  to  retain  workers  across  a  range  of  skill  groups  and  occupations. The  global  outlook  has  improved over  the  last  year. Inflation  rates  here  and  abroad  are  fluctuating  around  a  general  upward  trajectory,  supported by  accommodative  monetary  policy.

I project  above-trend  growth  and  that  labor  market  strength  will  continue  and  move  the  economy  somewhat further  beyond  maximum  employment.

Incoming  data  indicate  that  inflation  is  firming  and  businesses  are  reporting  an  increased  ability  to  pass  on  cost increases  to  customers. In  the  near-term,  year-over-year  inflation  rates  will  likely  move  higher  when  last  year's idiosyncratic  factors,  like  the  sharp  decline  in  prices  of  cell  phone  service  plans,  drop  out  of  the  numbers. While those  levels  aren't  likely  to  be  sustained,  I  expect  inflation  to  move  up  to  our  2  percent  goal  on  a  sustained  basis over  the  forecast  horizon  based  on  my  projection  that  growth  will  be  above  trend,  labor  markets  will  continue  to strengthen,  and  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  reasonably  well-anchored.

I view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  the  historical  norms  of  the  last  20  years. As  described above,  while  there  are  a  number  of  risks  to  my  outlook,  I  view  them  as  broadly  balanced  for  both  the  real  economy and  inflation.

Respondent 14: The  recently  enacted  tax  cut  and  spending  legislation  play  an  important  role  in  my  outlook for real  GDP,  importantly  boosting  GDP  growth  this  year  and  next. In contrast  with  the  Tealbook  baseline, I assume  that  the  higher  spending  caps  of  the  BBA  are  not  extended,  which,  along  with  higher  interest  rates, contributes  to  a  growth  slowdown  in  2020.  With  real  GDP  growth  exceeding  potential  for  the  next  couple  of  years, the  unemployment  rate  continues  to  decline  and  bottoms  out  at  3-1/2  percent  next  year. The  uptick  in  inflation this  year  reflects  in  large  part  the  passing  of  temporary  factors  that  held  down  inflation  in  2017. Going  forward, an  important  factor  contributing  to  rising  inflation  is  the  FOMC's  patience  in  raising  interest  rates  despite  low unemployment  and  inflation  that  is  close  to  the  FOMC's  objective;  that  patience  helps  reanchor  underlying  trend inflation  at  target.

Respondent 15: My  forecast  calls  for  above  trend  growth  of  2.6  percent  in  2018,  edging  down  to  2  percent in  2020. My  near-term  forecast  is  slightly  higher  compared  to  December  in  part  due  to  additional  fiscal  stimulus from  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Agreement. While  I  expect  some  additional  demand  effect  from  fiscal  policy,  my uncertainty  about  the  magnitude  and  timing  of  the  effect  remains  high. This  is  especially  so  given  that  resource utilization  in  the  economy  seems  to  be  at  an  already  high  level. As  well,  uncertainty  about  trade  policy  and  the potential  for  escalating  trade  frictions  with  our  partners  is  elevated. I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  remain below  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  as  output  grows  at  a  healthy  pace  and  the  labor  force participation  rate  declines  further.  While  inflation  has  generally  been  running  a  bit  soft  over  the  past  few  quarters recent  data  show  some  improvement  for  the  inflation  outlook. I anticipate  that  inflation  will  slightly  exceed  the committee's  target  in  2019  and  2020. With  stronger  output  growth,  lower  unemployment,  and  higher  inflation compared  to  my  December  projection,  I  have  steepened  my  path  for  the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors,  potentially  including revisions  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government  policies, causing  your  forecasts  to  change  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: We  revised  our  GDP  growth  forecast  for  2018  up  0.4  percentage  point  due  to  the  boost to government  spending  in  the  BBA.  (The  tax  package  that  passed  in  December  is  not  very  different  from  the one  we  assumed  in  our  December  submission,  and  consequently  we  modified  its  effects  only  slightly  in  our  current projection.)  We  would  have  adjusted  our  forecast  for  2018  up  by  more  had  it  not  been  for  the  weaker-than-expected near  term  growth  we  see  in  the  incoming  data.  Our  forecast  for  2019  is  unchanged  despite  the  new  fiscal  stimulus and  for  2020  it  is  down  2  tenths.  This  trajectory  reflects  a  higher  policy  rate  path  than  we  assumed  in  December.  All told  we  project  a  touch  more  overshooting  of  potential  and  undershooting  of  unemployment  than  in  our  December forecast. Our  stronger  forecast  for  growth  and  incoming  inflation  data  led  us  to  revise  up  our  inflation  forecast a  tenth  this  year  but  our  somewhat  tighter  monetary  policy  leaves  our  inflation  forecast  unchanged  for  2019  and 2020.

Respondent 2: I have  marked  up  my  2018  and  2019  real  GDP  growth  projections  largely  on  additional government  spending  due  to  the  passage  of  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  of  2018.

My  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  lower  than  last  submission  throughout  the  forecast  horizon. In  light of  a  quickening  pace  of  job  gains  without  any  appreciable  change  in  wage  pressures,  I  lowered  my  estimate  of  the natural  rate  of  unemployment  by  0.2  percentage  points.

Given  a  stronger  growth  profile  and  roughly  'on-target'  near-term  inflation  readings,  I  have  marked  up  my inflation  projection  throughout  the  medium  term  horizon.

Respondent 3: The  main  difference  is  in  my  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate.  In response  to  somewhat-greater-than-expected,  debt-financed  fiscal  stimulus,  I  now  have  extra  25-basis-point  rate hikes  in  both  2019  and  2020,  and  I've  increased  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  funds  rate  by  1/8  percentage  point.

Respondent 4: I have  incorporated  additional  fiscal  spending  related  to  BBA  2018  into  my  forecast. I had previously  incorporated  the  effects  of  the  TCJA  into  my  forecast.

ff on  January  19th. Respondent 5: Since  December,  I  boosted  my  projection  for  growth  in  2018  through  2020  based  on  additional fiscal stimulus  from  the  recent  budget  agreement  and  slightly  larger  assessed  effects  of  the  tax  changes  than  I had  previously  expected. In  light  of  research  showing  that  fiscal  multipliers  are  lower  in  expansions  and  other considerations,  I  assume  a  somewhat  smaller  impact  of  the  tax  reform  than  that  described  in  the  special  memo issued  by  the  Board  sta

My  inflation  projection  is  largely  unchanged  from  September. I continue  to  expect  inflation  to  reach  the  2% target  by  2019  and  modestly  overshoot  through  2020.

Respondent 6: Recent  data  has  caused  us  to  change  our  projections  for  GDP  growth  for  2018  and  2019  and slightly  our  projection  of  core  inflation  for  2019.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: The  real  outlook  has  been  revised  upward,  and  so  the  outlook  for  inflation,  as  a  result  of  more fiscal  stimulus  than  what  we  were  expecting  in  December. Given  the  stronger  outlook,  we  are  also  projecting  a higher  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 9: As  noted  earlier,  the  passage  of  the  tax  legislation  and  the  budget  agreement  are  the  primary factors  that  led  us  to  boost  our  growth  projections  from  those  in  December,  with  continued  strong  momentum  in the  global  economy  also  a  contributing  factor.  However,  incoming  data  suggest  modestly  less  strength  in  2018H1, and  we  project  the  fiscal  stimulus  to  raise  real  GDP  growth  rate  primarily  in  2018H2  and  2019.  The  combination

of  a  stronger  growth  projection  and  stronger  labor  market  conditions  than  anticipated  have  led  us  to  lower  notably the  path  of  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  December.  We  assume  no  material  effect of the  fiscal stimulus  on  the  potential  growth  rate. We  did  lower  our  assumed  longer-run  normal  level  of  the unemployment  rate  relative  to  December,  but  that  change  reflects  our  assessment  of  the  implications  of  recent developments  in  the  labor  market,  wage  growth,  and  inflation  rather  than  any  anticipated  effects  from  the  tax legislation.

With  resource  constraints  projected  to  be  tighter,  inflation  is  expected  to  rise  a  bit  more  than  we  projected  in December,  resulting  in  a  slightly  larger  overshoot  of  the  FOMC's  longer-run  inflation  objective  in  2020.  This  overshoot  helps  to  support  inflation  expectations  and  thus  helps  to  achieve  the  Federal  Reserve's  mandated  objectives over  the  longer  run.

Asexplainedunder3(b)wejudgethataslightlysteeperpolicypathisnowappropriatetosustainourprojections. Wenowassume a littlebit more tightening in 2018and 2020 relative to December,  putting the policy rate  somewhat above  its  longer-run  normal  level-which  we  also  see  as  slightly  higher  than  in  December-in  2019-20.  This  overshoot of  the  longer-term  policy  rate  is  meant  to  ensure  that  the  overshoot  of  inflation  and  undershoot  of  unemployment remain  temporary,  and  the  longer-run  objectives  are  met  within  5  -  6  years.

Respondent 10: I revised  up  my  estimate  of  the  macroeconomic  effects  of  fiscal  stimulus  from  the  Tax  Cuts and  Jobs  Act  (TCJA)  and  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  (BBA).  Although  I  had  anticipated  a  sizeable  effect  of  the TCJA in  2018-2020  in  my  December  projection,  I  raised  my  projection  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2018  by  a  further  0.2 percentage  point  and  lowered  my  projected  unemployment  rate  in  2018  by  0.1  percentage  point  based  on  the  recent law,  which  front-loaded  tax  cuts  more  than  anticipated.  I  expect  the  BBA  will  boost  growth  primarily  in  2019  and penciled  in  a  0.3-percentage-point  increase  in  real  GDP  growth  and  a  0.1-percentage-point  lower  unemployment rate  in  2019. I see  negligible  effects  on  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  expansionary  fiscal  policy  stance reinforces  my  view  that  an  appropriate  pace  of  tightening  will  entail  four  rate  increases  in  2018,  four  in  2019,  and three  in  2020.

Respondent 11: Employment  has  continued  to  grow  robustly.

The  changes  to  fiscal  policy  were  larger  than  I  expected.

ff's  estimate  of  the  economic Respondent 12: Employment  has  grown  faster  than  I  hand  anticipated  in  December,  and  so  has  economic activity  abroad.  The  economic  impact  of  the  Tax  Cuts  and  Jobs  Act  will  likely  be  larger  and  more  frontloaded  than I had  anticipated  in  December. I have  now  incorporated  into  my  projection  the  sta impact  of  the  Bipartisan  Budget  Act  of  2018.

Respondent 13: The  narrative  of  my  forecast  is  similar  to  that  in  December.  Economic  fundamentals  remain healthy  and,  with  the  passage  of  the  budget  bill, fiscal policy  is likely to provide  a  somewhat  larger  addition to  growth  than  I  assumed  in  my  previous  projection. I have  edged  up  my  growth  forecast  and  edged  down  my unemployment  rate  forecast  over  the  projection  horizon.  My  lower  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate also  contributes  to  a  lower  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  in  this  submission. Recent  readings  on  inflation  have firmed,  and  I  continue  to  expect  inflation  to  gradually  firm  further  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Given  current  conditions,  the  medium  run  outlook,  and  risks,  I  view  an  upward  path  of  monetary  policy  as appropriate  and  a  prudent  course  that  balances  the  risks  given  that  growth  is  expected  to  be  above  trend,  the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  remain  below  its  longer-run  level,  and  inflation  is  projected  to  gradually  move to  our  goal  of  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon. My  funds  rate  path  is  slightly  steeper  than  in  my  December projection  given  the  stronger  growth  and  lower  unemployment  rate  I  am  now  projecting. To  best  promote  our goals  of  maximum  employment  and  price  stability,  I  anticipate  it  will  be  appropriate  for  the  funds  rate  to  move somewhat  above  its  longer-run  level  (which  I  estimate  at  3  percent)  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 14: The  passage  of  the  BBA  is  the  main  reason  for  the  upward  revision  in  my  GDP  outlook  this year  and  next,  and  also  to  the  lower  unemployment  rate. The  passage  of  highly  stimulative  fiscal  policies  at  a time  of  near  full  employment  has  improved  prospects  that  the  FOMC  will  be  able  to  achieve  its  inflation  objective sustainably,  as  discussed  above.

Respondent 15: I have  incorporated  additional  fiscal  stimulus  in  my  forecast. However,  I  have  significant uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  magnitude  of  effects  of  tax  reform  and  the  budget  agreement.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

Question  4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences,  potentially including  those  related  to  your  assumptions  about  changes  to  government policies,  between  your  current  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: Our  federal  funds  rate  path  is  noticeably  below  the  Tealbook  over  the  next  three  years,  ending 2020  at  3.25  percent. We  assess  the  long-run  neutral  funds  rate  to  be  2.75  percent  so  we  do  not  overshoot  the long-run  funds  rate  by  nearly  as  much  as  the  Tealbook  does.

Our  projection  for  Q4-to-Q4  GDP  growth  in  2018  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook,  but  a  bit  weaker  in  2019  and 2020. Our  forecast  is  based  on  a  touch  smaller,  but  more  front-loaded,  impulse  from  tax  cuts  and  government spending,  and  a  shallower  path  for  the  funds  rate. We  view  the  output  gap  currently  to  be  narrower  than  the Tealbook  so  that  by  the  end  of  2020  it  remains  about  1-1/2  percentage  point  smaller  than  the  Tealbook's. Like the  Tealbook  we  project  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  further  below  where  we  think  the  natural  rate  is.  However our  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate  averages  several  tenths  higher  than  the  Tealbook  while  we  assume  the natural  rate  of  unemployment  is  a  little  lower. Accordingly,  our  3.5  percent  unemployment  rate  projection  for 2020:Q4  undershoots  the  natural  rate  by  about  a 1 / 2 percentage  point  less  than  in  the  Tealbook.

We  do  not  see  quite  as  much  of  an  increase  in  inflation  over  the  next  couple  of  years  as  in  the  Tealbook,  despite our  more  accommodative  monetary  policy  path. However,  like  the  Tealbook  we  see  a  small  overshooting  of  our inflation  objective  in  2020.

Respondent 2: While I  have  notched  up my baseline  forecast  for growth due to  the  BBA  of  2018,  my  projection remains  muted  relative  to  the  Tealbook  baseline.  I  am  continuing  to  mark  in  a  smaller  impact  from  the  recent  tax changes  on  overall  growth  than  the  Tealbook,  creating  much  of  the  divergence  in  our  growth  trajectories. As  a result,  my  forecast  calls  for  much  less  of  an  undershoot  of  my  longer-run  unemployment  rate-which  is  now  roughly 1 / 2 of  a  percentage  point  below  the  Tealbook's  estimate.

ff considerably  earlier Respondent 3: There  are  three  main  differences  between  my  projections  and  the  Tealbook  forecast.  First,  I have  inflation  rising  more  and  more  quickly  than  is  forecast  in  the  Tealbook.  Inflation  has  been  held  down  by  the lagged  effects  of  declines  in  energy  and  imported-goods  prices  that  we  saw  in  2015  and  2016,  but  those  restraining effects  will  dissipate  as  we  move  into  2018. Second,  I  have  the  federal  funds  rate  leveling  o than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  and  at  a  lower  level. The  key  to  achieving  sustainable  price  stability,  in  my view,  is  to  prolong  the  economic  expansion.  Our  best  chance  for  prolonging  the  expansion  is  to  continue  to  remove accommodation,  and  then  shift  to  a  policy  stance  that  is  restrictive,  but  only  mildly  so.  Finally,  I  don't  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  fall  quite  as  fast  or  quite  as  far  as  is  forecast  in  the  Tealbook.  I  would  be  quite  concerned  to see  a  labor-market  overshoot  as  large  as  that  found  in  the  Tealbook.  An  important,  unresolved  issue  is  whether  we can  remove  accommodation  quickly  enough,  or  find  sufficient  underutilized  labor  resources,  to  avoid  the  Tealbook outcome.

ff outlook. Respondent 4: I  have  a  stronger  outlook  for  potential  growth  than  the  Tealbook.  Consequently,  I  believe  that the  economy  can  grow  faster  in  the  near-term  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook  without  much  additional  upward impetus  to  price  inflation. My  more  optimistic  outlook  for  potential  growth  is  consistent  with  a  slightly  higher long-run  neutral  interest  rate  compared  to  that  in  the  Sta

Respondent 5: The  Tealbook  projects  a  more  substantial  and  protracted  overshooting  of  full  employment, with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  to  3.1  percent  at  the  end  of  2020,  and  inflation  returning  to  the  2  percent target  very  gradually.  In  my  projection,  there  is  more  modest  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  output  through early  2019,  and  those  gaps  begin  to  close  in  2020.  I  see  the  unemployment  rate  bottoming  out  at  3.5  percent  by  the middle  of  2019.

The  ramping  down  of  the  fiscal  stimulus  and  the  gradual  removal  of  monetary  policy  accommodation  slows growth  closer  to  potential  by  the  end  of  2019. Finally,  the  persistent  overshooting  of  full  employment  pushes inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  2019  and  results  in  a  slight  overshooting  of  inflation  for  some  time  afterwards.

Respondent 6: For  GDP  growth,  our  projections  are  slightly  below  those  in  the  Tealbook.  For  inflation,  our projections  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook. Differences  arise  with  respect  to  monetary  policy  implications because  the  Tealbook  projections  incorporate  the  idea  of  a  longer-run  steady  state  to  which  the  economy  is converging.  Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately  as  the  economy  transitions  to  the  longer-run  steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping  policy  rate  path. Our  regime  conception,  in  contrast,  views  monetary policy  as  regime-dependent  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent. It  is acknowledged  that  the  economy may  visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  but  switches  to  these  regimes  are  quite  difficult  to  forecast. This  suggests  a flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  relative  to  that  contained  in  the  Tealbook.  The  Tealbook  also has  a  substantial  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate,  far  more  than  our  undershooting,  before  returning  to its  longer-run  value  of  4.7  percent.

Respondent 7: My  projection  assumes  that  labor  productivity  will  grow  more  rapidly  than  in  the  Tealbook. A  consequence  is  that  the  unemployment  rate  declines  more  slowly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8: We  view  our  forecast  as  qualitatively  similar  to  the  Tealbook. The  Tealbook  real  forecast  is stronger  than  ours,  mostly  as  a  result  of  a  more  sanguine  assessment  of  the  impact  of  the  tax  cuts  on  GDP.  Still,  in both  forecasts  monetary  policy  needs  to  tighten  noticeably  more  than  what  financial  markets  are  currently  pricing in  order  for  the  unemployment  rate  to  stop  declining  and  revert  back  to  a  level  consistent  with  full  employment.

Respondent 9: Our  growth  projections  are  fairly  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  over  2018  -  20,  but  there are  larger  differences  between  the  Tealbook  forecast  and  our  projections  for  the  other  SEP  variables.

We  project,  as  the  Tealbook,  an  undershooting  of  the  unemployment  rate,  but  our  path  is  less  steep,  with  the unemployment  rate  projected  to  bottom  out  at  3.5  percent  by  end-2019,  and  slowly  moving  up  afterwards  to  a longer-run  unemployment  rate  which  is  0.3  percentage  point  lower  than  in  our  December  submission.  By  contrast, the  Tealbook  projects  the  unemployment  rate  to  decline  to  3.1  percent  in  2019  while  maintaining  unchanged its longer-run  normal  rate  at  4.7  percent. The  stronger  undershooting  of  unemployment  in  the  Tealbook  is  the counterpart  of  a  sizable  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  which  is  larger  than  in  December.

One  other  difference  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation. In  our projection,  the  participation  rate  rises  gradually  to  63.2  percent  in  2019,  while  in  the  Tealbook  this  rate  is  steady at 62.7  percent  through  end-2019. This  difference  reflects  our  assumption  of  some  positive  cyclical  effects  on participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  continue  to  differ. We  see  overall  PCE  inflation  rising  to  2  percent  in  2018 and  to  2.3  percent  in  2019-2020,  before  returning  to  objective  early  in  the  next  decade. The  Tealbook  projects inflation  still  below  target  in  2018  and  mildly  overshooting  in  2019-20: Core  inflation  is  projected  at  2.1  percent in  2019  and  2.2  percent  in  2020,  despite  a  larger  undershooting  of  unemployment  than  in  our  projection  (it  also remains  above  objective  in  the  early  years  of  the  next  decade  according  to  the  Tealbook's  long-term  outlook).  The considerable  persistence  of  inflation  and  the  flat  Phillips  curve  in  the  Tealbook  appear  to  require  a  prolonged  period of  above-potential  growth  in  order  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  to  (and  eventually  beyond)  the  longer-run  inflation goal.  As  mentioned  previously,  the  overshoot  of  inflation  in  our  projection  occurs  to  prevent  inflation  expectations from  falling  below  levels  consistent  with  the  FOMC's  longer-run  objective.

In  terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  both  projections  see  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels  and risks  to  real  growth  broadly  balanced.  The  Tealbook  also  sees  risks  as  broadly  balanced  for  inflation,  while  we  see risks  to  inflation  as  tilted  to  the  upside.

Finally,  our  monetary  policy  path  is  below  the  Tealbook  path  for  2018  -  20. In  addition,  our  assumption  for the  longer-run  normal  policy  rate  is  now  50  basis  points  above  that  of  the  Tealbook,  which  is  unchanged  at  2.50 percent. Both  policy  paths  have  an  overshooting  of  the  longer-run  FFR  in  2019  -  20,  although  the  Tealbook's  is appreciably  larger,  which  is  a  reflection  of  the  larger  projected  positive  output  gap  in  the  Tealbook  forecast:  The inertial  Taylor  1999  rule  used  in  the  Tealbook  eventually  calls  for  much  tighter  policy  to  address  such  gaps.

Respondent 10: My  assumptions  and  projections  are  qualitatively  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook. Quantitatively,  I  anticipate  somewhat  slower  growth  in  real  GDP  and  a  higher  unemployment  rate  through  2020  than Tealbook.

Respondent 11: Relative  to  the  Tealbook,  my  forecast  for  economic  activity  is  a  bit  stronger,  but  my  forecast for  inflation  is  broadly  similar.  I  believe  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  lower  and  the  improving  labor  market will  continue  to  keep  the  labor  force  participation  rate  from  falling,  minimizing  the  downward  effects  of  healthy  job growth  on  the  unemployment  rate.  I  believe  that  it  is  appropriate  for  the  federal  funds  rate  to  rise  more  gradually than  in  the  Tealbook.  Even  with  lower  rates,  my  projection  anticipates  that  inflation  will  return  to  target  at  about the  same  time  as  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: MyprojectionsforGDPgrowth, theunemploymentrate, andinflationarebroadlyconsistent with  the  Tealbook. I have  slightly  stronger  growth  and  a  slightly  higher  path  for  the  unemployment  rate. The latter  reflects  mainly  my  assessment  that,  at  least  over  the  medium  term,  the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  be higher  than  projected  in  the  Tealbook. My  path  for  the  target  federal  funds  rate  is  substantially  lower  than  the Tealbook  path.

Respondent 13: Asin the  Tealbook  forecast  I expect that  the  economy will grow  at  an above-trend pace,  labor market  conditions  will  continue  to  strengthen,  and  inflation  will  gradually  rise  to  our  2  percent  goal. However, the  inflation  and  labor  market  dynamics  in  my  outlook  differ  from  those  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  as  I  project that  the  inflation  rate  will  rise  to  2  percent  rather  than  overshoot  it  and  I  do  not  project  as  great  a  fall  in  the unemployment  rate.  Thus,  compared  to  the  Tealbook  forecast,  I  see  inflation  somewhat  better  anchored  at  target and  see  somewhat  stronger  inflationary  pressures.  My  funds  rate  path  is  a  little  lower  than  in  the  Tealbook  forecast because  the  economy  remains  closer  to  maximum  employment  and  price  stability,  so  there  is  less  need  for  monetary policy  to  slow  the  economy.  My  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  similar  to  those  in  the  Tealbook  forecast,  but  I  am  a little  more  skeptical  about  supply-side  responses  to  the  tax  package.

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: My  path  for  appropriate  monetary  policy  remains  considerably  more  accommodative  than the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.
