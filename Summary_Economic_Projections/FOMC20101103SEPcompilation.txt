Longer-run projections represent each participant's NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The June projections were made in conjunction with the FOMC meeting on June 22-23, 2010.

Respondent  1:

Expect convergence to take somewhat longer

Respondent  2:

We anticipate that the convergence process will take about five to six years.

Respondent  3:

Convergence to the real economy's equilibrium and to the inflation objective within five years requires lower long-term interest  rates  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  baseline  outlook. As  a  result,  while  the  economy is anticipated to revert back to maximum employment within a five years horizon, inflation is likely to remain below the target.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

I  expect  the convergence process will be similar to that outlined in the long-run projection reported in  the  Tealbook,  with  the  output  and  unemployment  gaps  reaching zero in  about  five years,  and  the  PCE price inflation rate reaching its long-run value of 2 percent in six to seven years.

Respondent  6:

Respondent  7:

Respondent  8:

I  expect,  as  in  Tealbook,  that  inflation  may  take  longer  than  five  to  six  years  to  return  to  the  2%  level  I consider most consistent with our dual mandate.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

Given the recession's depth, uncertainty in the business community about government programs and regula­ tory change, higher prospective marginal tax rates, and the difficult adjustments that are needed, convergence may well require the full six years.

Respondent  11:

By  2015-16  potential  growth  is  2.4%,  down  from  our  current  estimate  of  2.5-2.7%,  as  the  baby  boomers retire. A  reasonable  estimate  for  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  is  4%  to  6%. We  would  expect,  with appropriate policy and no further adverse shocks,  unemployment to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2016.

We assume long-term inflation expectations to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's

inflation objective to be  around 2%  for the  PCE deflator and around  2.5%  for the  CPI.  Under these condi­ tions,  with the output gap around zero,  we would expect  PCE inflation of around 2%.

Respondent  12:

The convergence process may be slightly shorter than 5-6 years.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

I  anticipate that  the convergence process for real  GDP growth will be substantially shorter than 5-6 years, perhaps on the order of 3-4 years  for real growth  (with  a period of overshoot  of real  growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an  overshoot  (above  1.5%)  in the interim in  inflation  as  a consequence  of significant past  growth in the monetary base supported by longer term asset purchases that cannot  be sold off over  a very short time period.  I  anticipate that the decline in the unemployment rate will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  15:

In  light  of  the  severity  of the  recession  and  the  historical  norms  of jobless  recoveries  and  recoveries  that follow  financial  crises,  the  convergence  process  for  unemployment  will  likely  take  longer  than  five  to  six years. In  addition,  I  am  concerned  that  further  monetary  stimulus  and  delay  in  removing  extraordinary policy accommodation will lead to financial  imbalances that  could eventually destabilize  the  economy and further  prolong  the  convergence  process. These same monetary forces could  also cause long-term inflation expectations to become unanchored and lengthen the convergence process.

Respondent  16:

unemployment may take considerably longer

Respondent  17:

My view has been that,  In light of the severity  and  breadth of shocks to the  economy and  the  consequent significant  impacts on government,  firm,  and household behavior,  the convergence process may well extend beyond five or six years to something closer to a total of eight years.  At this point,  we are a couple of years into that process,  so an additional five or six years from the present now seems about right.

Respondent 4:

The  liquidity  trap  conditions  that  we  find  ourselves  in  today  add  substantial  uncertainty  to  the  outlooks for  both  growth  and  inflation. There  are  few  historical  precedents  to  inform  us  how  an  economy  evolves under such conditions, including how it responds to the unconventional policies we must use to address these conditions.  Potential changes in fiscal policies also add uncertainty to the outlook, though these are a larger issue  for the  medium and longer-term forecast than the near-term projection.

Respondent  5:

The aftereffects of the financial crisis, turmoil in Europe,  and uncertainty regarding the effects of unconven­ tional monetary policy increase uncertainty regarding the outlook  for economic growth relative to the past 20  years. The  heightened  risks  to  the  outlook  for  economic  activity,  as  well  as  the  elevated  variability  of commodity prices, increase uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation.

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

Inflation expectations would be more firmly anchored under an appropriate monetary policy, and uncertainty would therefore be lower than the trailing 20-year average.

Respondent  8:

I  judge  the  outlook  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  to  be  unusually  uncertain  due  to  the  challenges and  asymmetric  downside  risks  associated  with  the  presence  of the  zero  bound,  and  increased  reliance  on nonconventional policies with uncertain multipliers.  Fiscal contraction in many advanced economies creates risks to the outlook and the possibility of further shocks to the financial system

Respondent  12:

Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economy is  in  recovery. However,  the  soft  patch

this summer has led me to revise down my near-term forecast and contributes to some increased uncertainty in my forecast.  In  addition,  the effect  of the extraordinary monetary policy in place  and uncertainties sur­ rounding the future path of policy,  including the timing of the  exit  from accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

Respondent  15:

The uncertainty surrounding my projections remains higher than normal.  I generally agree with Tealbook's assessment of the sources of uncertainty,  but  I  would  add fiscal  policy to the  list.  Various  aspects of fiscal policy -   such  as  questions  of fiscal  sustainability,  the  expiration  of the  Bush  tax  cuts,  and  indexation  of the  AMT  -   add  considerable  uncertainty  to  the  outlook. The  public' s  uncertainty  about  the  conduct  of monetary policy is also adding to uncertainty in the economic outlook.

Respondent 4:

Even though we see the risks to GDP growth as broadly balanced,  we believe the unemployment rate out­ look risks are weighted to the upside.  Firms have displayed an unusual ability to squeeze out gains in labor productivity during the recession  and early expansion.  We see a possibility that  going forward we could be surprised  again  at  firms'   ability to  meet  increases  in demand with  further gains in output  per  worker.  We also see  an  upside  risk  to  the  unemployment  rate  forecast  from  a  faster-than-anticipated  recovery in  labor force participation,

The  potential  additional  slack  associated  with  the  upside  risk  to  the  unemployment  rate  implies  a  cor­ responding  downside  risk  to  our  inflation  outlook. In  addition,  there  is  a  downside  risk  to  inflation  if the continued low readings on actual inflation show through to some downward movement in inflation expecta­ tions.

Respondent  5:

The limited appetite for further fiscal stimulus both in the United States and abroad means that fiscal policy actions  are  unlikely to  damp  future  negative  shocks  to  the  economy.  In  addition,  the  anticipated  recovery of the  housing  market  may  take  much  longer  than  we  expect. As  a  result,  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for economic activity are weighted somewhat to the downside.  Correspondingly, the risks to the outlook for the unemployment rate are weighted to the upside.  The inflation risks appear to be roughly balanced.

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

N/A

Respondent  8:

The fact that monetary policy is constrained by the zero bound and fiscal policy is constrained by the need to address unsustainable longer-term budget deficits creates an asymmetry in the ability of policymakers to respond to upside and downside shocks,  resulting in risks to growth that  are weighted to the downside and risks to unemployment that are weighted to the upside.

Respondent  9:

The assumed pickup in growth in 2011  and beyond remains hypothetical;  there is little actual evidence that that  is  happening.  Re inflation,  the  dollar,  commodities  pose  an upside risk,  but  there is  also some  risk of more disinflation,  which is not  at  all uncommon following deep recessions.

Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  projection  and  the  expected  value  from  the FRBNY forecast distribution.

Respondent  12:

The incoming data has led me to shade down my near-term path for growth compared to my June forecast. Going  forward,  I  view  the  risks  to  growth  as  balanced  and  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside. Historical patterns  in  the  data  suggest  the  rebound  might  be  stronger  than  my  baseline  forecast. Over  the  longer term,  inflation  risk is  tilted  to  the  upside  reflecting  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy of the  Fed' s withdrawal of accommodation.

Respondent  1: Yes

Would prefer balance sheet to grow substantially less,  and its level to fall materially faster than Staff forecast

Respondent  2: No

N/A

Respondent  3: Yes

The forecast is conditioned on approximately the same short- and long-term interest rates assumptions as in the Tealbook.  But this path for the interest rates is not consistent with achieving the dual mandate's goals over a 5-year horizon.

Respondent 4: No

The Tealbook policy assumptions seem highly probable given the views expressed to date by the  Commit­ tee. For  forecasting,  it  does  not  seem  constructive  to  assume  a  markedly  different  policy  construct-such as  the  Committee  providing  a  more  explicit  numerical  inflation  guide  in  order  to  influence  private-sector expectations- even if we think such a policy would help achieve our policy mandates.

Respondent  5: No

N/A

Respondent  6: No

N/A

Respondent  7: Yes

I believe that under an appropriate monetary policy the committee would adopt a numerical inflation objec­ tive.  In accordance with that objective, the committee would want to begin to shrink the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet by sometime in 2012.

I  assume  that  the  LSAP  program  is  expanded  to  around  $1  trillion  next  year,  as  currently  assumed  by markets

Respondent  9: No

N/A

Respondent  10: Yes

Purchases of longer-term Treasuries are unlikely to have a significant economic impact apart  from whatever signal  they might  send about  the  future path of the  funds rate.  Indeed,  insofar  as they add to uncertainty about the future conduct of monetary policy and reduce the pressure to address fiscal and other imbalances, such  purchases  may  actually  adversely  affect  the  economy. The  FOMC would be  better  off clarifying  the circumstances that will lead it to start raising rates.

Respondent  11: No

N/A

Respondent  12: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the appropriate monetary policy as one that begins raising the funds rate sometime in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  13: No

N/A

Respondent  14: Yes

While  the  pattern  of recovery  from  the  recession  is  uncertain,  I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate and allow the  SOMA portfolio to run off sooner  than assumed in the  Tealbook.  In the interim,  depending on  how  the  economy evolves,  it  may be  appropriate  to  accelerate  or  slow  down  the  growth  of the  SOMA portfolio.

Respondent  15: Yes

In my view, under the appropriate path, policy would immediately begin the normalization process.  I would not  engage  in  another  round  of quantitative  easing,  I  would  remove  the  commitment  to  maintaining  the funds rate target  at exceptionally low levels  for an extended period,  and I  would allow our balance sheet to shrink  as mortgage-backed securities are redeemed.  Early next  year,  I  would raise the  funds rate  target  to 1   percent.

Respondent  16: No

If inflation  stays  around  its  current  level,  then  I  would  say  yes. If we  continue  to  see  ongoing  disinflation over  the  next  6  months  to  a  year,  we  will  need  to  view  the  'Seven  Perils'  trap  as  a  real  possibility,  and adjust policy accordingly.

Respondent  1:

Strength and duration of recovery negatively impacted by current macroeconomic policies

Respondent  2:

Fundamental  uncertainty over  the  strength  and  viability of the  recovery  restrains  consumer  spending  and makes businesses reluctant to hire and undertake large-scale investment projects.  In particular, I expect busi­ ness investment in equipment and software to slow considerably following a strong first half when businesses made necessary capital purchases that were deferred during the recession.  Business spending on structures also continues to be hampered by high vacancy rates and ongoing credit problems in commercial real estate.

The  principle  risk  to  my outlook  is  posed  by  a  small  probability that  inflation  expectations  become  dom­ inated  by  deflationary  concerns  which  leads  to  significant  disinflation. In  that  event,  further  disinflation could have adverse consequences on economic activity.

Respondent  3:

Incoming data  are  consistent  with  an  economy expanding  at  a  pace  somewhat below  potential  on  average in the second half of this year.  This represents  a setback compared to previous expectations of an economy making some modest  progress  already this  year towards reducing  the large  activity gap.  In  this  regard,  it is especially striking that final sales have grown by less than one percent  on average per quarter so far this year. While  we  continue  to  expect  the  recovery  to  remain  on  track,  expectations  for  a  sizable  pickup  in economic activity have been pushed further out into the future.

Labor  market  conditions  remain  dismal. The  long  spells  of  unemployment  that  many  workers  are  now experiencing increase the concerns about the possibility of skill depreciation and of a lower probability of a successful job  search.  Firms so  far have  been reluctant  to hire,  focusing instead on efficiency gains.  While it  is  likely that  there  is  now  considerable pent-up demand  for labor,  it  may take time before  firms become more confident about the durability of the recovery and increase the pace of hiring.  So far, the large amount of slack in  labor markets  has put  significant  downward pressure  on  wages.  Unless  firms step  up their  pace of hiring considerably,  this could  delay the transition  from public  to privately generated sources  of income that is needed to sustain the recovery.

Housing activity remains weak and is projected to contribute only modestly to the recovery in both 2011 and 2012. Too,  the  recent  mortgage  documentation  problems  are  increasing the  downside  risks  to  the  housing sector's outlook.  Consumer spending has been growing modestly so far in the recovery.  Limited increases in private sources of income and the waning fiscal stimulus, together with the lingering effects of earlier declines in  wealth,  are  likely  to  restrain  growth  in  consumer  spending  over  the  forecast  horizon. The  persistently low  readings  of consumer  confidence  are  also  a  source  of concern,  as  they  raise  the  possibility  of further retrenchments in spending if economic conditions do not improve noticeably.

Bank loans are still contracting,  and the unwinding of tight banking standards is still modest.

Overall,  credit  conditions  are  likely  to  remain  tight  over  the  forecast  horizon  for  some  consumers  and businesses. The  headwinds  to  the  recovery  from  credit  and  a  waning  fiscal  stimulus  are  compounded  by a  monetary policy stance that  is  much  less  accommodative  than  it  should be  as  a  result  of the  zero-lower bound  on  nominal  interest  rates. Optimal  control  simulations  continue  to  suggest  that  the  Federal  funds rate  should be 400  basis points below  actual,  an indication that  the drag to  activity from monetary policy is substantial.

In  all,  we  expect  the  economy to  grow  only modestly above  potential  next  year. By the end of next  year, the unemployment rate is projected to be at 9 percent.  A more vigorous pace of growth is only expected in 2012.  By the end of 2012,  however,  the unemployment rate is still above  7  2  percent.  Given the projected sizable slack in labor markets over the forecast horizon,  the rate of core inflation remains well below target.

Risks  to the  outlook  are still  tilted  to  the downside.  Moreover,  these downside  risks  are  much more  costly than the  potential  upside. Recent  inflation  data  continue  to  indicate  that  the  possibility  of deflation  over the forecast horizon is more than a tail event.

Respondent 4:

The  incoming data  and  anecdotal  evidence  suggest  that  over  the  near  term  growth  will  continue  near  the anemic pace seen in the second and third quarters of this year.  But other signals point to a pick up in growth as we head into 2011:  businesses are going forward with replacement  demand delayed during the recession; the inventory restocking cycle did not appear to overshoot medium-run targets; and the saving rate appears to have plateaued.  In  addition,  with the  exception of small business lending by banks,  capital  market  con­ ditions  are supportive of growth.  Monetary policy is  accommodative.  Over time,  increasing household and business confidence should add momentum to the recovery.

Nonetheless, relative to the depth of the recession, the recovery will be moderate by historical standards.  For some time, borrowers without access to capital markets will likely continue to have trouble convincing banks that they have positive NPV projects on a risk-adjusted basis.  The overhangs in residential and commercial real estate will take a good deal of time to work off.  And frictions in labor markets will probably contribute to sluggish growth in employment.

Respondent  5:

Labor  markets  are  improving  very gradually  and  a  modest  recovery  in  economic  activity  is  in  train. Al­ though financial  conditions  have  improved  owing  in  part  to  the  expectation  of further  monetary stimulus, financial intermediation remains impaired, which will hold back the pace of recovery.  In addition, households are repairing balance sheets that have been badly weakened by equity and housing losses and massive debt accumulation. Monetary  stimulus  and  improvements  in  banking  and  financial  market  conditions  provide key drivers  for economic expansion over the next  few years,  while fiscal stimulus wanes.  Significant slack in labor  and goods markets will keep inflation low,  but well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid significant  further disinflation.

Respondent  6:

The incoming data  and reports from business contacts remain broadly consistent  with  a  growth trajectory that  is  quite  restrained. Weakness in residential  and commercial real estate  is  ongoing.  Business  and con­ sumer  attitudes  are  still  extremely  cautious,  and  slow  spending  growth  by  businesses  and  households  is continuing to damp upward inflation.

Numerous  headwinds  are  working  against  a  broad-based  recovery. For  instance,  small  and  young  firms are still having difficulty accessing credit for growth.  Problems such as slow and uneven sales,  opportunities to reduce costs through increased productivity, structural adjustments in labor markets, and uncertainty over government policy;  labor  and  environmental rules,  tax  policy,  regulatory reform,  and  others,  are  retarding job creation.  Over the near term,  additional business spending appears likely to be geared toward activities such as expansion into foreign markets, targeted mergers and acquisition,  and further increases in efficiency.

Respondent  7:

I  believe  that  the  pace  of expansion  will  be  moderate,  led  by  consumer  spending  and  business  equipment investment;  residential  construction  and  state  and local  spending  are likely to  remain  very weak  for  some

time;  and nonresidential construction is likely to decline  further.  The stock of federal debt will grow much more rapidly than GDP under current legislation,  leading to uncertainty on the nature  and timing of fiscal policy actions that will put the stock of debt on a more sustainable path.  That uncertainty could make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans.

Respondent  8:

The recovery has slowed very significantly as the impetus from inventory investment and fiscal stimulus has waned.  Household spending remains constrained by very slow employment and sluggish wage gains,  as well as  the  continuing  need  of households  to  repair  their  balance  sheets. The  housing market  has  yet  to  show evidence of any recovery and problems relating to mortgage documentation could create additional drags and strains in financial markets more generally.  Over the medium term, I expect accommodative financial condi­ tions,  including the stimulus resulting from LSAP  purchases,  progress in balance sheet  repair,  and pent-up demand to support a somewhat stronger recovery beginning in 2011.  However,  I do not  anticipate that the recovery will be robust in comparison with other postwar expansions due, in part, to the fact that the process of financial  market  healing is likely to be  extended.  I  expect  inflation to remain  below mandate-consistent levels due to the large degree of labor market slack.  But well-anchored inflation expectations should prevent the  economy  from  slipping  into  deflation. Nevertheless,  a  decline  in  inflation  expectations  remains  a  risk going forward.

Respondent  9:

The moderate economic recovery through the  first quarter has slowed since the spring. The earliest  stage of the  recovery  depended  heavily  on  inventory  adjustment  (once  monetary  and  banking  policies  achieved stabilization),  fiscal  policy,  and  to some  extent  the  recovery of trade  and  global growth. Once these forces subsided,  the  economy's  momentum  depended  on  growth  in  private  final  demand. However,  the  speed  of recovery has been limited by moderate growth in consumer spending, depressed conditions in both residential and nonresidential construction, the trade deficit  (e.g, in Q2 and Q3 of this year), and waning fiscal stimulus. Consumption has in turn been restrained by persistent  pessimism about the economy and the job market, lower wealth,  and restrictive credit.  We learned in the NIPA revisions that household saving is higher than thought;  it seems to have stabilized at  about  6 percent.

Conditions  in  capital  markets  have  improved  since  the  European  crisis  in  the  spring  and  are  slowly  nor­ malizing,  though risk premiums remain high in the equity market and in some other areas.  (It may be that some of the risk  aversion  that  came  back  during  the  sovereign  crisis  stays  with  us  and  has  served  to keep financial  conditions  a bit  tighter  than they otherwise  would be.)  Banks  continue  to  stabilize  as  well,  with improved  capital  positions  (notwithstanding  new  risks  from  foreclosure  documentation  issues). However, credit  conditions  remain  tight  for  small  and  startup  businesses,  in  part  because  of the  weakness  of their balance sheets.

Private-sector  hiring  has  been  very  slow,  reflecting  weak  demand  growth  and  uncertainty  about  the  sus­ tainability of the recovery on the part of employers.  In the near term, economic growth may not be sufficient to bring the unemployment rate down materially.  The risk of a double-dip recession is low,  in part  because cyclical  sectors  like  housing  are  at  rock  bottom,  but  a  failure  of unemployment  to  decrease  could  increase the  risk  of a  new  period  of weakness  via  effects  on  confidence. UI  benefits  have  raised  the  unemployment rate  a bit,  but  there is not  much evidence of higher permanent structural unemployment  arising from skills mismatch or similar  factors.  However,  the  depth  of the  recession  in  the  labor  market  has  resulted in  high levels of long-term unemployment,  who could become difficult  to re-employ if weak conditions persist  for a long time.

Core inflation,  wage growth,  and growth in unit  labor costs remain very low,  reflecting the extent  of slack. Anchored inflation  expectations,  expectations  of monetary policy expansion,  and proximity to zero  (which makes downward nominal rigidity and related factors more relevant) may limit the risk of significant further disinflation. Overall  inflation  will  be  higher  than  core,  however,  as  the  weaker  dollar  has  been  associated

with higher energy and commodity prices and higher import prices.

Respondent  10:

Growth is  likely to  pick  up  as  we  head  into  2011,  but  not  enough  to  cut  quickly  into  labor-market  slack. Partly the expected acceleration reflects a re-stabilization of residential investment following the expiration of the home-buyer tax credit.  Partly it reflects previously deferred replacement demand for consumer durables and  business  equipment  and  software. However,  many of the  impediments  to  a  stronger  recovery  are  not significantly impacted by monetary policy.  In  consequence,  businesses are not  using their increased  access to cheap credit to expand their domestic operations.

Risks  to  the  outlook  are  substantial  on  both  sides. Quantitative  easing  in  the  face  of real  impediments to rapid growth risks a build up of new imbalances.  The financial sector remains vulnerable to delayed losses in residential real estate and to losses on consumer and commercial real estate loans.  Increased bank capital requirements  may slow the  recovery in  bank lending,  much  as  in the  early  1990s  when  Basel  1   was  imple­ mented.  On  the  other  hand,  growth  will  benefit  whenever  headwinds  finally begin  to  diminish,  especially if,  in  the  interim,  U.S.  industry has become more internationally competitive.  If current  markup estimates can be taken at face value-admittedly a very big  'if'-then firms will have a strong incentive to hire  and to expand production as uncertainties are resolved.

I  expect continued low core inflation in the near term.  Increases in internationally traded commodity prices may keep headline inflation somewhat above core.  Farther out,  I am concerned that monetary stimulus may be withdrawn too slowly to prevent inflation from rising above the rate I see as desirable over the long term. Large Federal Reserve purchases of longer term assets would increase these concerns.

Respondent  11:

Our modal forecast for real GDP growth has anticipated for some time a slowing in the second half of 2010. This assessment was based on the expectation that the impulse from the fiscal stimulus and from an unusu­ ally pronounced inventory cycle would peak around mid-2010 and then begin to fade before a robust recovery of private  final  demand was  in  full  swing. Data released over recent  months indicate  that  this  moderation has been more intense than expected,  with the economy losing forward momentum over 2010Q3.  We expect growth of real GDP in 2010  (Q4/Q4)  of just 2.3%,  down from 3% in late June.  For the second half of 2010 we now anticipate growth just under 2%  (annual rate),  down from 2  |  %  over the first half of the year.  As this projected second half growth  rate  is  below our estimate  of the  potential  growth rate,  some  rise  in  the unemployment rate over that  period is  quite  likely. Despite the  lower  growth  outlook,  core  PCE  inflation over the third quarter has been roughly in line with our expectations.

With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that the turmoil in financial markets associated with the flare up of the European sovereign debt crisis had a larger impact on the US economy than we expected.  In addition to the direct effects of the decline in US equity prices,  the increase in the exchange value of the dollar,  and the increase in credit spreads,  it is quite likely that these events elevated the already high degree of uncertainty among consumers  and businesses. In  addition,  while  it  was  widely  anticipated  that  there  would  be  a  lull in housing market  activity following the expiration of the home buyer tax credit,  that lull has lasted much longer than anticipated despite the lowest mortgage interest rates since the mid-1950s.  This is likely due to the fact that mortgage underwriting standards are significantly tighter than previously thought.  In addition, internal survey data indicates that household expectations of future home price appreciation have continued to decline in recent months, which is also likely contributing to the depressed level of housing market activity.

Even  though  the  growth  and  employment  outlook  for  the  second  half of 2010  is  weaker  than  anticipated last June,  growth prospects for 2011  and 2012 have not been downgraded due largely to the improvement in financial conditions that has occurred since mid-summer,  partly spurred by markets'  assessment of a change in the FOMC's policy stance.  From its recent low in early July, the S&amp;P500 stock price index is up nearly 16 percent,  nearly returning to late April levels.  Mortgage interest  rates have declined roughly 50 basis points

since  June,  to the lowest  levels since  the mid-1950s.  As  measured by the  Senior Loan  Officer  Survey,  bank lending standards have stopped tightening and have begun to ease modestly.  Finally,  the exchange value of the dollar,  as measured by a broad index of currencies, is roughly six percent lower than in June and so well below the previously assumed path.

We  expect  that  this  improvement  in  financial  conditions  along  with  slow  but  steady  improvement  in  un­ derlying fundamentals will boost real GDP growth to around 4% in 2011 and about 5% in 2012-13, with the unemployment  rate  falling  steadily to  around  7%  by the  end  of 2012. We expect  a  gradual  strengthening of consumer  spending  and  residential  investment  aided  by  an  improving  job  market,  an  easing  of under­ writing standards,  and  a  general  increase  in confidence.  Indeed,  our  micro level  analysis  suggests  that  the household deleveraging process is far along.  With an improving path for spending by the household sector, business investment is also likely to gradually strengthen.  Continued favorable growth prospects among our major  trading  partners  along  with  a  lower  exchange  value  of the  dollar  are  expected  to  lead  to  a  larger growth impulse from net exports than previously anticipated.  Finally,  with incomes rising,  tax revenues to state and local governments are anticipated to recover and help put that sector in a more solid fiscal position.

Barring  a  significant  decline  in  the  level  of the  economy's  potential  output  or  its  potential  growth  rate, our modal forecast for growth implies that a large output gap will persist over most of the forecast horizon. Accordingly,  we  expect  core  inflation  to  slow  to  around  1%  (Q4/Q4)  in  2010  from  1.7%  in  2009. But  by mid-2011  and  into  2012,  as  final  demand  firms  within  the  context  of anchored  inflation  expectations,  we expect core inflation to move up toward the  'mandate consistent'  range.

The balance of risks to our  real  activity projection remains  skewed  to the  downside.  As  mentioned  above, the US economy lost forward momentum over the summer months, and while we think this was just a pause, it  still  could  be  the  precursor  of a  more  substantial  slowdown.  Housing market  activity remains very slug­ gish  and  there  is  evidence  of renewed  downward  pressure  on  home  prices. If sustained,  a  negative  wealth effect  through  this  channel  could  induce  households  to  boost  their  desired  saving  and  thereby  result  in  a significantly lower trajectory for consumer spending.  Another downside risk is that growth prospects among major trading partners in Europe turn out to be weaker than expected as the full force of fiscal contraction begins to be felt later this year and into 2011.  US fiscal policy is also a source of risk to our forecast.  While a reduction of fiscal stimulus in 2011  is widely anticipated,  it is possible that the US could engage in a more aggressive fiscal consolidation.

An important risk over the medium term remains our assumption regarding the economy's potential growth rate. While  labor  productivity  growth  has  slowed  in  the  last  couple  of quarters  consistent  with  our  pro­ jection,  we have not  acquired  any increased confidence in our long-run assumption on productivity growth. Given the low level of overall business  investment  and the  apparent  misallocation of labor  and capital,  the economy's  potential  growth  rate  may have  slowed  significantly. On the  other  hand,  our  analysis  of recent labor  market  developments  suggests  a decline  in  the  share  of unemployment  related  to mismatch  between job seekers and job openings.

The risks around the central scenario for  inflation  are  also skewed to the  downside.  The downside  risks to the growth projection combined with the possibility of no meaningful decline in potential implies downside risks to the inflation projection.  Nevertheless,  with the  aggressive monetary policy response  and the possi­ bility of a stronger-than-expected rebound, there remains a risk of higher inflation than our modal projection.

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  the  shape  of  recoveries  from  periods  of  banking  and  finan­ cial  crisis,  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  synchronization  of global  policy  actions,  and  the  lingering uncertainties  associated  with  the  peripheral European  debt  crisis  result  in  greater  uncertainty  around  our central projection compared to typical levels over the last twenty years.

Respondent  12:

The data on the economy have been weaker than what I anticipated in my June forecast.  However, I see the recent weakness as a soft patch from which the economy is beginning to emerge.

In  my  view,  the  economy  is  in  recovery  and  I  expect  an  above-trend  pace  of 3.4  percent  growth  in  2011, about the same  as in my June forecast.  In  2012  and  2013  I  expect  growth  to moderate somewhat,  though it  remains  slightly  above  by  my  long-term  trend. The  labor  market  recovery  is  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment rate edges down to about 5.8 percent by the end of the forecast horizon,  at which time it is at  the natural rate of unemployment.  I anticipate that inflation will rise into 2012 and then pull back a bit in 2013 in response to tighter monetary policy than anticipated in the Tealbook.

In  my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk  that inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels  and  that  inflation  expectations  may  become  unan­ chored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

In  2011  through  2013  I  anticipate  that  real  growth  will  occur  at  greater  than  steady-state  rates,  reflect­ ing normal cyclical patterns reinforced by a modest  ongoing impact  of the  fiscal  stimulus package,  and the substantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been in train since late  2008.  I  expect  that  beginning in  2013  real growth will slow and subsequently approach steady-state rates.  I expect that core PCE inflation over all of 2010  to  be  close  to,  but  somewhat  below  that  of 2009  (as  it  is  year-to-date)  and  intrayear  fluctuations  in food  and  energy prices  will  approximately net  out,  so that  headline  inflation  will  be  close  to the  core  rate over  all  of 2010.  Subsequently,  under  appropriate monetary policy,  inflation should  approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent,  though I believe that it will rise above that rate in an interim period.  I do not believe that future energy shocks can be forecasted,  so with available information I expect that the core and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  15:

Overall,  the  economy  continues  to  expand  at  a  moderate  pace. In  light  of  the  major  re-balancing  still underway,  the  pace  and  solid  basis  of recovery  are  encouraging. The  economy  appears  to  be  making  the transition from a recovery driven by temporary stimulus from fiscal policy and inventory adjustment to one propelled by sustainable consumer and business demand.  Consumer spending is rising at  a moderate pace, consistent with a sustainable and modest rate of recovery.  Based on solid consumer demand,  businesses are expanding investment  in  equipment  and  software,  providing  further  impetus  to  GDP  growth. Over  time, as some of the uncertainties surrounding the outlook -  about the strength and durability of demand,  taxes, the implementation of health care and regulatory reform,  and energy policies -  diminish and consumers and businesses make further progress in de-leveraging,  the pace of growth will pick up.

Under  these  economic  conditions,  I  expect  core  consumer  price  inflation  to  remain  low  in  the  near  term but  to  eventually move  higher. Disinflationary pressure  from  the  sharp  recession  will  eventually dissipate and  be  dominated  by  the  influences  of rising  commodity  and  producer  prices,  a  depreciating  dollar,  and long-run inflation expectations that  are anchored at more than 2 percent.

The risks surrounding the outlook remain considerable,  although broadly balanced.  Fiscal policy (including the  expiration of the Bush tax cuts,  extension  of the  AMT,  and the longer-run unsustainability of policy), uncertainty about regulatory policies,  and problems in real  estate continue to pose  downside  risks to  GDP

growth.  The resiliency of the U.S.  economy and traditional business cycle dynamics-the tendency of strong recoveries to follow severe recessions-pose upside risks.

As  to  inflation,  in  the  near  term,  the  severe  recession  and  recent  consumer  price  trends  pose  some  small downside risks to core inflation.  Based in part on trends in producer prices, I see little or no risk of deflation. Longer term,  the expansion  of our balance sheet  and  federal borrowing needs  create  a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations  and,  in turn,  inflation.  Just  since  the last  FOMC  meeting,  talk of QE2 has pushed up TIPS-implied inflation compensation.  In addition,  there is a risk that  monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  16:

inflation risks seem huge.  The growth in public debt  pushes toward high inflation.  On the other hand,  the Committee's commitment to low rates and/or labor market slack,  pushes toward deflation.

Respondent  17:

Key  factors  include  observation  that  the  handoff of growth  driver  from  fiscal  stimulus  and  inventory  re­ building to a more self-sustaining increase in final demand has not gone smoothly.  Continue to believe that the continued drag from commercial real estate,  the uneven,  nature of housing market recovery,  continuing high levels  of unemployment,  and  renewed uncertainty  about  global  financial  stress  will  likely prevent  the recovery from accelerating beyond a moderate pace.

Respondent  18:

The economic recovery is proceeding at  a subpar pace.  The  labor market  remains sluggish.  Reductions  in employment, income and wealth have left many households with a need to repair severely distressed balance sheets. It  is  my  sense  that  these  households  continue  to  face  financial  strains  that  run  deeper  than  the aggregate  data  suggest  and  their  financial  repair  process  could  take  considerable  time. At  the  same  time, the  economic  effects  of mortgage documentation problems will  continue to strain the  recovery of the hous­ ing market,  whose  health is  a significant  factor  in  a recovery of real  growth. The uncertainty surrounding these  mortgage  market  developments  are  clouding  the  certainty  of  a  positive  outlook  and  pose  downside risks.  Overall,  the upturn in aggregate demand from consumption spending will be muted,  and government spending will be constrained by state and local fiscal conditions.  With economic  activity projected to grow only modestly above potential,  the unemployment rate gap is still very large by the end of next year.  Given such a sizable slack in labor markets over the forecast horizon,  the rate of core inflation remains well below target in 2011  and 2012..

Respondent  1:

Expect materially less benefit to the real economy from further balance sheet expansion.  Expect  Staff fore­ cast  of dollar trajectory to provide considerably less impetus to growth

Respondent  2:

My forecast calls for less growth in 2012 than in the Tealbook.  In my forecast,  2012 marks the beginning of a return to the historical trend in real GDP growth.  As a consequence, my unemployment rate projection is higher than the Tealbook' s.  However, my core inflation profile is very similar to the one in the Tealbook.

Respondent  3:

The forecast  for real  activity is very similar to the  Tealbook forecast.  Core inflation,  however,  is  projected to be lower than in the  Tealbook.  We model inflation  as depending,  among other factors,  on near-term in­ flation expectations.  In our outlook,  these near-term inflation expectations are drifting down,  thus lowering inflation.  In the Tealbook, instead, inflation is more dependent on long-run inflation expectations, which the Tealbook expects to remain well anchored.

Respondent 4:

We have  slightly  less  robust  growth  in  2012  and  2013  than  the  Tealbook. While  we  think  businesses  will become  more confident  as  the  recovery proves  itself to  be  solidly in  place,  we  assume  their  overall  level  of risk  aversion will remain high enough to impinge on capital spending and workforce expansion.

Respondent  5:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent  6:

I  have  assumed  a  lower  level  of potential  output,  resulting  in  an  inflation  path  that  is  more  responsive  to growth over the near-term.

Respondent  7:

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy  the  public's  inflation  expectations  would  be  well  an­ chored,  and the inflation path would be higher than in the  Tealbook.

Respondent  8:

N/A

Respondent  9:

Similar to Greenbook,  but now a bit more pessimistic  about the extent to which growth is likely to pick up in 2011  and 2012.

Respondent  10:

The Tealbook baseline forecast likely overestimates the domestic stimulus to be obtained further quantitative easing.  It  likely underestimates the drag on growth from prospective tax-rate increases and regulatory and fiscal uncertainties.  It doesn' t sufficiently recognize that the recent crisis and its aftermath have shaken the perception  that  the  US  and  European  economies  are  immune  to  economic  crises  with  elements  similar  to those seen in emerging economies.  The perceived decline in the relative risk of the emerging economies will provide firms with new incentives to shift operations there, to take advantage of relatively cheap skilled labor. As a result,  investment  and employment creation in the US economy will lose some its past dynamism.

Respondent  11:

We  assume  lower  inflation  persistence  than  does  the  Tealbook. Therefore,  under  the  assumption  of wellanchored inflation expectations,  we project that inflation returns to within the  'mandate consistent'  range in 2012-3, whereas it remains below that range in the Tealbook.  In addition, while our GDP and productivity growth rates  are  similar to those of the  Tealbook  and our labor  force participation rates higher,  we have  a significantly lower unemployment rate by the end of 2011  and through 2012.

Respondent  12:

My inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy and so I project a higher pace of inflation over 2011-2013 than does the Tealbook.  Given the strength of economic growth in my baseline forecast  and the higher inflation path,  the policy path is  less  accommodative over the  forecast horizon.

Respondent  13:

Residential investment does not begin to recover until mid 2012

Respondent  14:

Compared to the 70% confidence intervals for the Tealbook forecasts,  the differences between the point es­ timates in the  Tealbook baseline forecast  and my projections are not different in any meaningful statistical sense.  However I see higher inflation in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent  with  appropriate  monetary policy.  In  contrast  the  Tealbook  forecast  sees  an  'extended  period' of very low inflation.

Respondent  15:

The  key  difference  is  the  monetary  policy  path,  which  leads  to  some  differences  in  the  economic  outlook. In  my  view,  appropriate  policy should  follow  a  path  considerably different  than  in  Tealbook,  to  foster  the longer-run stability of the economy.  My preferred path of policy yields modestly slower GDP growth in 2011 and  2012. Nonetheless,  core  inflation  is  slightly higher  in  my  forecast  than  in  Tealbook,  because  I  expect inflation  to  move  toward  long-term  inflation  expectations  faster  than  it  does  in  Tealbook. This  difference in  forecasts  can  be  traced  to  differences  in  our  views  of  the  relative  importance  of inflation  expectations (importantly affected by monetary policy) and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

Respondent  16:

I  am less  optimistic  about the next  four years.

Respondent  17:

Staff projections  on job creation have  now come closer to my views,  so I  no longer consider differences im­ portant.  I  am not  as optimistic as the staff about equity prices over the next two years and continue to be less  confident in the projected path of energy prices

Respondent  18:

My forecast  is  broadly similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection. However,  I  am troubled  by the  uncertainty re­ garding the mortgage documentation problems which have the potential to act as a continuing drag on the resurgence of the housing market.

N/A

Respondent  2:

On the whole,  my November forecast  is quite  similar  to  the  one  prepared  last  quarter,  but  there  are  sub­ stantial  differences  between  my  current  forecast  and  the  one  last  submitted  to  the  FOMC  in  June. Near term growth  in  real  GDP is  markedly  weaker  due  to  the  downward  adjustment  to  output  as  part  of the July  benchmark revisions  and  weaker-than-expected  third  quarter  data. Also,  improvements  in  the  labor market have been slower to materialize than I had expected in June,  causing me to mark up unemployment throughout the forecast horizon.

Respondent  3:

The near-term outlook has been revised down as a result of weaker-than-expected incoming data.  For 2011 and 2012,  the  forecast  has  not  changed much,  but  is now predicated on  additional quantitative  easing and thus on a lower trajectory for long-term interest rates.

Respondent 4:

We were surprised by the weakness in overall economic  activity in the second  and third  quarters.  In part, this  signals  that  business  and  consumer  confidence  is  more  fragile  than  we  had  thought. We now  assume that such heightened risk aversion will weigh on the expansion into the projection period.  The weaker actual and projected level of GDP implies a greater degree of resource slack than we had projected earlier,  and has resulted in a markdown in our inflation outlook for 2011  and 2012.

Respondent  5:

Since  June,  the  data  on  economic  activity have  been  worse  overall  than  we  had  expected  and  the  pace  of economic recovery has slowed considerably.  We have therefore lowered our  forecast  of real GDP growth  in the second half of 2010 by about  1-1/2 percentage points  (annual rate).  We have carried some of this weak­ ness  forward  and now  expect  economic  growth  to  be  somewhat  more  subdued  in  2011  than  we  previously anticipated.  This reduction in the outlook for demand is only partially offset  by our  assumption of greater monetary stimulus.  Consistent with the more pessimistic outlook for output, we have increased our forecast for  the unemployment rate somewhat.  The inflation data have come in a little higher than we expected.  In addition,  the exchange value of the dollar has weakened  and oil  prices  have  risen since June.  We  therefore raised our forecasts for core  and overall inflation slightly.

Respondent  6:

My forecast  for real  activity in 2010 has been revised slightly lower in response to incoming data that have been a little weaker,  on balance,  than I had anticipated in June.

Respondent  7:

Data received since the last projection have been more sluggish than I had anticipated,  resulting in a lower trajectory for real GDP and higher trajectory for unemployment.  I view the indicators of weak employment growth and decelerating manufacturing activity as especially noteworthy.  Other indicators, such as those for consumer spending, housing, and state and local government, have been broadly consistent with my outlook in June.

Respondent  8:

I  have substantially lowered my 2010  GDP  forecast  and slightly lowered my 2011  GDP  forecast  in  light  of incoming data suggesting a less robust recovery.  For the same reason,  I have revised upward my projection

of unemployment.  Movements in oil and commodity prices and the dollar have led me to revise up my 2010 projection of total  PCE inflation.

Respondent  9:

The  second  'stage'  of the  expansion  was  to  be  carried  forward  by  reasonable  growth  in  private  final  de­ mand.  But consumers have been somewhat  more restrained than expected,  which is closely related to the slowdown  (also  unexpected)  in  the  labor  market. So  the  main  factor  is  the  data  flow,  which  suggests  1) less  confidence  on  the  part  of consumers  and  employers  than  we  were  seeing  earlier  in  the  year  and  2)  a household deleveraging process that  may be taking longer than expected.  Greater-than-expected weakness in residential investment is also a factor.

Respondent  10:

I  have marked down my growth forecasts for 2010 and 2011, somewhat,  and correspondingly marked up my forecasts of the unemployment rate.  Increasingly,  impediments to growth seem likely to persist.

Respondent  11:

Our  current  real  GDP  growth  forecast  for  the  second  half of 2010  is  below  that  of June,  as  the  data  re­ leases since then have,  on net,  been weaker than expected,  particularly for employment,  housing and trade. Despite lower growth in 2010H2,  growth prospects for  2011  and 2012 are essentially unchanged  from June, owing in part to the improvement in financial conditions partly induced by the expectation of a new LSAP program.  With the outlook for real growth essentially unchanged, there has not been any substantive change to the unemployment rate forecast.  Similarly,  our projected  path  for core  PCE  inflation is  also essentially unchanged.  The major change has been to our policy assumptions where we assume a LSAP of similar size to the Tealbook and a substantially longer period of the policy rate at the effective lower bound.

The  near  term  balance  of risks  for  both  real  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation  have  improved  since June. While there  has  been  little  change  in  the  medium term  assessment  we  have  interpreted  movements in inflation expectations measures as consistent with a lower risk of substantially higher inflation due to an unmooring of expectations.

Respondent  12:

The incoming data this summer were somewhat weaker than I expected.  However, I view this as a temporary slowdown from which the economy is beginning to emerge.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

Real growth in recent  months  appears  to be slower than I  had  previously forecast; consequently I  have  re­ vised downward my projection for 2010,  and I  am now projecting a slower acceleration in real growth than I  expected  in  the  past. I  have  also  revised  up  my  projection  of unemployment  and  now  project  a  slower decline in the unemployment rate.  I have also revised upward my long-term projection of the unemployment rate to incorporate some increase in structural unemployment associated with a different mix of output once labor markets fully recover.  I have not revised my projections of inflation rates.

Respondent  15:

The primary driver of the changes in my forecast is the modestly slower pace of recovery that became clear since  the  last  projection. With  this  slower  pace  of recovery  in  2010,  the  economy  enters  2011  with  less momentum,  and the decline in unemployment will be more gradual than anticipated in the last projection.

Respondent  16:

The incoming data has been weaker than I forecast in June.

Respondent  17:

Incoming data,  importantly including data with forward=-looking implications,  somewhat weaker that  an­ ticipated,  thereby shifting the  weight  I  assign relevant  factors more to those inhibiting accelerated growth. Having said that,  as noted above, I weight towards the upside risks around my GDP projection, particularly for  2011.
