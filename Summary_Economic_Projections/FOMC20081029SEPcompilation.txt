Respondent 2:

The  global  financial  crisis  and  the  potential  effects  of  the  limit  to  monetary  policy  actions  posed  by  the  zero lower  bound  on  interest  rates  raise  the  level  of  uncertainty  around  our  pro jections  for  economic  activity. The increased  volatility  in  commo dities  prices  and  the  heightened  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  raise  the  level of uncertainty  about  our  inflation  pro jections.

The  economy  is  experiencing  financial  market  stresses  that  not  typically  observed  at  turning  points. Further, the  degree  to  which  these  stresses  will  persist  and  the  extent  of  their  effect  on  the  real  economy  are  uncertain. As  a  result,  I  view  forecast  uncertainty  to  be  higher  than  usual  even  given  that  we  are  at  a  turning  point.

Respondent 8:

On  the  real  side,  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  about  the  ultimate  impact  of  financial  market  disruption on  real activity. Previous  credit  crisis  episo des  provide  little  guidance  in  present  circumstances,  given  both the extent of the crisis and the measures  taken  by  the monetary  and  fiscal authorities to stem  the crisis. On  the  inflation  side, there  is some  evidence  that  the  slope  of  the  Phillips  curve  becomes  steeper  once  the unemployment  rate  is  sufficiently  far  away  from  the  NAIRU.  If  this  is  the  case,  then  the  decline  in  inflation (and  the  risks  of  deflation)  could  be  more  severe  than  in  our  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 9:

Respondent 10:

Uncertainty  regarding  real  activity  is  greater  than  usual  over  the  next  four  quarters. Under  an  appropriate monetary  policy,  inflation  expectations  would  be  more  firmly  anchored  and  inflation  uncertainty  would  be lower  than  today.

Respondent 11:

Because the duration/intensity of financial dislocations and headwinds remains unclear, there is greater uncertainty associated with my pro jections of GDP  growth. On the other hand, uncertainty about the inflation forecast has if anything  diminished  because  the  pieces  for  a  projected  slowing  in  inflation  appear to be  falling  into  place.

Uncertainty  about  growth  and  unemployment  stems  from  the  difficulty  of  predicting  the  course  of  the  housing correction,  the  financial  crisis,  and  the  real  effects  of  the  financial  crisis.

Respondent 2:

The  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  are  weighted  to  the  downside  and  those  for  the  outlook  for  unemployment are  corresp ondingly  weighted  to  the  upside. The  interaction  of  higher  unemployment  and  rising  delinquencies raises  the  potential  for  even  greater  losses  by  banks  and  other  institutions  and  an  intensification  of  the  adverse feedback  loop  we  have  long  worried  about  and  are  now  experiencing. Given  the  sizable  downside  risks  to  the forecast  for  growth,  the  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast  are  likewise  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 4: Yes

N/A

Respondent 6: No

N/A

Respondent 7: Yes

My  forecast  assumes  a  less  accommo dative  federal  funds  rate  path  than  that  in  the  Greenbook  baseline. I view  appropriate  policy  as  keeping  the  funds  rate  at  1.5  percent  until  the  summer  of  next  year. The  funds rate  rises  to  2.75  in  2009Q4  as  output  growth  begins  to  accelerate  in  2009H2. In  2010  the  economy  is  growing at its trend  pace  and  the  funds  rate  reaches  4.25  percent  by  2010Q4

Respondent 8:

No

N/A

Respondent 9: Yes

I doubt  that  a  federal  funds  rate  target  path  this  low  through  2013  is  consistent  with  the  inflation  objectives of the  FOMC.

Respondent 10: Yes

I believe  price stability will require  us to raise rates more  rapidly  following  this  recession  than  assumed  in the  Greenbook.

Respondent 11: Yes

For  the  near  term,  my  Federal  funds  rate  target  remains  about  1/2  percentage  point  above  that  assumed  in the  Greenbook,  and  I  further  assume  that  the  target  will  begin  to  rise  early  in  2010.

Respondent 12: Yes

For  the  near  term,  we  assume  a  path  similar  to  the  Greenbook. However,  by  mid  2009,  we  assume  financial stresses  will  have  dissipated  enough  that  the  fed  funds  rate  can  begin  to  be  raised  while  continuing  to  maintain  the  same  level  of  overall  money  market  accommodation. We  assume  that  it  will  be  appropriate  to  raise rates  further  as  growth  recovers  in  2010. By  the  end  of  the  pro jection  period,  we  assume  that  the  funds  rate

will be near 3.75%, a rate that we would  consider  modestly  accommodative. Such  accommodation  seems appropriate  given  that  we  expect  to  still  have  significant  resource  slack  left  in  the  economy.

Respondent 13: Yes

Target  federal  funds  rate  lowered  to  1.0%  by  the  end  of  2008Q4. In 2009,  it  remains  at  1%  at  least  through 2009Q3,  it  then  starts  to  renormalize  back  to  3.0%  by  the  end  of  2010  and  reaches  4.25%  by  the  end  of  2011.

Similar  to  the  near-term  path  assumed  in  the  Greenbook,  higher  in  2010-11.

Implies  a  real  funds  rate  similar  to  the  Greenbook  in  near-term,  somewhat  higher  in  2010-11.

Respondent 14: Yes

Note  considerable  uncertainty. The  possibility  exists  of  a  binding  zero  bound,  quantitative  easing  etc. If the modal  forecast  obtains,  however,  would  expect  rate  to  rise  somewhat  earlier  than  in  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 15: Yes

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

The  inflation  threat  has  diminished  while  the  risks  to  real  growth  have  increased. These  shifts  would  ordinarily strengthen  the  case  for further  reductions  in  short-term  interest  rates. Rate  cuts  are likely to be of only  very  limited  effectiveness,  however,  given  that  the  monetary  transmission  mechanism  remains  impaired.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook

Respondent 1:

Fallout from the credit crisis severely impacts  real economic  activity; depressing  business investment  and production and further dampening  consumer  spending. This ultimately leads to a substantial recession. Coming  out  of  the  recession, my  outlook  accounts  for  some  loss  in potential  output  along  the  lines of the costly reallocation scenario from  previous  Greenbooks. A period  of slower productivity  growth,  while  the reallo cation is occurring, leads to a smaller output gap than would  otherwise occur. This results in less disinflation  in  my  outlook  for  2011  than  seen  in  the  Greenbook.

There is a substantial amount  of uncertainty surrounding this pro jection, as credit contractions are notoriously  difficult to analyze. The  primary  risks  remain  to  the  downside  on  near-term  growth  and  on  how the  economy  will  recover  in  the  latter  years. Zero  bound  issues  may  further  complicate  the  implementation of monetary  policy.

Respondent 2:

Financial  conditions  have  tightened  tremendously,  with  sharply  elevated  risk  spreads  and  severe  dislo cations in credit  markets. Housing  activity  has  yet  to  show  consistent  signs  of  stabilizing,  labor  market  conditions continue  to  deteriorate, consumer  and  business  spending  are  in  decline,  and  the  outlook  for  global  growth has  slowed  markedly. These  factors  contribute  to  the  projected  contraction  in  economic  activity  through  the first half of 2009.

Actions aimed  at preserving liquidity in key money  and  credit markets  and  the recapitalization of banks are crucial steps in restoring  confidence  in  and  improving  the  functioning  of  financial  markets. Over  time, risk  spreads  should  diminish  and  with  the  funds  rate  low,  the  cost  and  availability  of  credit  should  improve, contributing  to  a  gradual  recovery  in  the  economy  beginning  in  the  second  half  of  next  year.

The combination of plummeting commodity  prices, the sharp appreciation of the dollar, and mounting slack  in labor  and  goods  markets,  both  here  and  abroad,  should  bring  overall  inflation  down  to  a  level  consistent with price stability by next year. Continued  slack causes inflation to edge down  further over the forecast  period.

Respondent 3:

sharply  greater  financial  stringency  and  reduced  confidence  exert  considerable  restraint  on  spending  in  the near  term  and  their  effects  ero de  slowly  over  the  next  year  or  two  allowing  lower  policy  interest  rates  to  show through  slowly  to financial conditions  to bolster demand. Fiscal stimulus  early next year counters  only a small  part  of  the  added  restraint. In  an  environment  of  weak  global  growth  commodity  prices  stay  low,  which together  with  substantial  slack  put  inflation  on  a  clear  downward  trend;  inflation  expectations  decline,  but remain  above  projected  inflation  in  the  out  years. Downside  risks  to  output  from  the  possibility  of  even  more gradual  restoration  of more  normal  credit  market  functioning  predominate. the effect of downside  output risks on inflation risks are off set by the possibility  that  commodity  prices  could  recover  faster  than  in  the futures markets  once  global growth  stabilizes, leaving risks around  the gentle downward  drift  in inflation roughly  balanced.

Respondent 4:

Recent  data  on  consumer  and  business  spending,  housing,  labor  markets,  and  financial  markets  have  led  me to revise down  my  forecast  for  growth  in  2008  and  2009. As  a result, I now  expect  real  GDP  to  decline  in the  third  and  fourth  quarter  and  to  grow  at  about  a  1  percent  rate  in  2009. Recent  declines  in  energy  prices are expected  to  ease  the  burden  on  household  finances,  but  not  enough  to  offset  the  negative  effects  of  job

losses,  declining  incomes  and  wealth,  and  tighter  credit. With  the  federal  funds  rate  remaining  near  current levels  in  the  near  term,  and  the  drag  from  housing  and  financial  turmoil  diminishing,  I  expect  real  GDP  will grow  3  percent  in  2010-ab out  1/2  percentage  point  faster  than  potential.

The  recent decline in energy prices, along with the expected  stabilization of food and energy prices, and near-term  weakness  in  output  and  spending,  should  allow  overall  and  core  inflation  to  moderate  going  forward.

In light of continued, severe problems in housing and financial markets and heightened caution on the part  of consumers  and  businesses,  the  risks  to  GDP  growth  are  weighted  to  the  downside. However,  in  the case  of  inflation,  I  believe  the  medium-term  risks  are  weighted  to  the  upside  if  we  maintain  the  current  funds rate  for  'too  long'  or  increase  the  rate  'too  slowly.'  In  addition,  the  large  increase  in  the  size  of  our  balance sheet  and  the  monetary  base  reinforce  this  concern.

Respondent 5:

The  extraordinary  tensions  in  the  money  markets,  the  substantial  decline  in  sto ck  market  wealth  globally, and  the  sharp  reduction  in  economic  activity  worldwide  have  led  to  a  large  cut  in  my  growth  forecast  for  the next  two  years. We  seem  to  be  seeing  the  potential  for  a negative  feedback  dynamic  discussed  in  previous projection  narratives  become  a  concrete  reality  in  the  US  and  the  rest  of  the  world. The  downside  risks  to growth  and  uncertainty  about  real  activity  have  certainly  increased. The  sharp  decline  in  commodity  prices and significantly reduced  resource pressures globally have led to a substantial reduction  in my  near term inflation  forecast,  but  such  rapid  changes  also  suggest  a  high  level  of  uncertainty  about  the  forecast.

Respondent 6:

I chose  the  alternate  scenario  - more  rapid  financial  recovery  on  the  assumption  that  Govt  will  continue  to attack  on all fronts until financial markets  resume  more  normal  functioning. The  risk is that markets  are slow to respond  regardless of Govt  action. I also assumed  lending  by non Wall Street commercial  banks would  quickly  return  to  normal  levels. This  assumption  comes  from  three  factors  (1)  TARP  capital  injections (2) Consolidation  of  the  two  weakest  large  banks  with  stronger  partners  and  (3)  Portfolio  loan  problems  in these  banks  still  appear  manageable. The  risk  to  this  assumption  is  that  the  financial  health  of  the  non  Wall Street  banks  deteriorates  more  than  I  expect  or  that  business  and  consumer  conditions  are  more  reliant  than I realize on  the  remaining  large  troubled  firms,  including  AIG.  One  final  key  assumption  is  that  residential real estate  markets  bottom  by  mid  2009.

Respondent 7:

The  recent  data  on  the  economy  have  been  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  June  forecast. In  addition, financial market  stresses appear  elevated and their impact  on the economy  going  forward  remains  highly uncertain. I expect  the  economy  to  grow  at  a  significantly  below-trend  pace  through  the  first  half  of  2009 with  the  housing  sector  and  financial  market  stresses  continuing  to  act  as  a  drag  on  growth. However,  these factors are largely unwound  by  mid-2009  and  the  economy  rebounds  to  trend  growth  of  about  2.7  percent in 2009H2. Near-term,  I  anticipate  that  trend  growth  will  be  temporarily  be  lower  as  the  financial  markets restructure. Consistent  with  this  (and  my  stronger  growth  forecast),  I  do  not  expect  as  large  an  output  gap to open  up  as  in  the  Greenbook  projection. Inflation  reaches  my  long-term  goal  of  1.7  percent  in  2010  and 2011. The  economy  grows  at  its  trend  pace  in  2010  and  2011.

Respondent 8:

Real activity slowed sharply over the summer,  and  the  more  recent  intensification of the credit crisis has put additional  downward  pressure  on  an  economy  already  in  recession. Accelerating  house  price  declines, large losses in stock  market  wealth,  and  continued  deterioration  in  labor  market  conditions  have  weakened households'  fundamentals  substantially. As  a  result,  we  expect  significant  retrenchment  in  consumer  spending  for  the  rest  of  this  year  and  in  the  first  half  of  2009. Multiplier  effects  from  declining  household  spending will put significant restraint on other  components  of  demand,  too. In addition,  the  interest-sensitive  com-

ponents of demand  are negatively affected by the increase in yields and by non-price supply constraints on credit resulting from the credit crisis. Given the synchronicity in the decline of activity across U.S. trading partners, support from net exports is likely to prove limited. In the second half of 2009, activity should  begin  to  expand  slowly, but GDP  growth  is  expected  to  post  a  decline  for  the year as a whole. The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  peak  at  7.8  percent,  before  declining  to  6.6  percent  by  the  end  of  2011.

Given the considerable amount  of projected slack in labor markets  over the forecast horizon, inflation is expected  to  moderate  substantially. We  pro ject  core  inflation  to  be  0.8  percent  in  2011. The  probability  of outright  deflation  over  the  next  two  to  three  years  is  sizable,  especially  when  taking  into  account  the  upward bias  in measured  inflation.

Risks to both economic activity and inflation are tilted to the downside. The effect of the credit crisis on real economic  activity is highly uncertain, but the possibility of a more  costly and lengthy resolution of the crisis remains  a strong concern. As for inflation, the risks are to the downside  not  just because  of the  downside  risks  to  real  activity,  but  also  because  in  current  circumstances  the  inflation  response  to  labor market  slack  could  be  larger.

Respondent 9:

Ballooning  uncertainty  has  made  the  value  of  the  exercise  at  this  juncture  questionable.

Respondent 10:

Headline  inflation  is  likely to be low  in coming  months  due  to  the  recent  fall  in  commodity  prices. We  are in a recession  that  could  well  bottom  out  by  the  middle  of  next  year. Falling  commercial  construction  is  like to dampen  the  pace  of  the  subsequent  expansion.

Respondent 11:

I expect  the  real  economy  to  perform  relatively  poorly  until  (approximately)  the  middle  of  2010,  restrained  by credit  conditions,  ongoing  adjustments  in  housing,  and  relatively  broad-based  softness  in  other  components of aggregate  demand. Thereafter,  I anticipate  a resumption  of  healthy  growth  through  2011,  as  restraints diminish,  demand  recovers,  and  productivity  reaccelerates. In the  economic  and  policy  environment  I  envision  inflation  should  stay  low.

Respondent 12:

We  expect  the  intensification  of  the  financial  turmoil,  negative  wealth  effects,  and  slowing  growth  in  the  rest of the  world  will  cause  output  to  fall  in  the  second  half  of  2008  and  the  first  half  of  2009. We  are  projecting a cumulative  decline  in  output  of  about  1%. We  expect  growth  to  resume  in  the  second  half  of  2009, but to be at a somewhat  sluggish  pace. The  dissipation of financial headwinds, some  fiscal stimulus, normal cyclical dynamics  and  accommo dative  monetary  policy  should  combine  to  boost  growth  above  potential  in 2010  and  2011. However,  we  expect  an  elevated  unemployment  rate  and  a  significant  output  gap  will  remain at the  end  of  the  forecast  period. The  reduction  in  energy  prices  and  the  emergence  of  a  significant  amount of slack  should  bring  both  core  and  total  PCE  inflation  down  to  around  1.6%  by  2011.

We  assume  financial headwinds  dissipate during 2009, as the effects of the recapitalization of the banking sector take hold  and  financial  market  functioning  improves. The  speed  at  which  these  headwinds  ease presents  a  two-sided  risk  to  the  forecast. On  the  one  hand,  a  more  serious  recession  could  occur  if  the  weakening  economy  leads  to  further  defaults  and  declines  in  asset  values  that  reinforce  the  financial  disruptions. On  the  other  hand,  the  multitude  of  recently  implemented  policies  could  improve  market  functioning  more quickly  than  we've  assumed.

Respondent 13:

In our  central  scenario  pro jection  the  US  economy  entered  into  a  recession  in  mid  2008. Negative  growth  of real  GDP  is  expected  to  persist  for  three  quarters,  followed  by  roughly  a  year  of  below  potential  growth. At

the trough,  the  level of real GDP  is  about  1 1 4 %  below  the  peak. Thus,  this pro jected recession  would  be similar  in  depth  to  the  1990-91  recession  but  of  a  longer  duration. By  the  spring  of  2009  recovery  begins  to take  hold,  aided  by  the  preemptive  path  of  monetary  policy  and  various  initiatives  to  foster  financial  market stability. Growth  returns  to  just  above  its  potential  rate  by  2010  and  accelerates  in  2011  to  about  1%  above potential,  implying  only  a  narrowing  rather  than  a  complete  closing  of  the  output  gap  over  this  period. The unemployment  rate  peaks  at  around  8%. Although  we  judge a moderate  recession to be the most likely outcome,  the  risk  that  this  downturn  turns  out  to  be  more  severe  than  any  in  the  post-WWII  period  is  high.

Within  the  central  scenario  pro jection,  consumer  spending  remains  relatively  sluggish  through  2009  as  households respond  to  the decline in their net worth  by  boosting  saving  out  of current cash flow. The  housing correction  is  expected  to  be  largely  completed  by  mid-2009,  with  housing  starts  only  modestly  above  replacement  levels. At  that  point  the  large  drag  that  residential  investment  has  exerted  on  growth  for  the  past  three years  will  be  over. Thereafter,  housing  is  likely  to  be  a  modest  plus  for  growth,  but  the  surge  of  residential investment  experienced  in  the  early stages of past recoveries is not anticipated  due  to the continued  high levels of homes  coming  onto  the  market  through  the  foreclosure process. Indeed, the correction in house prices is expected  to continue  through  the  end  of 2009 with a cumulative  18%  peak- to-trough  decline  in the FHFA  purchase-only  home  price  index. With  the  downgrading  of  foreign  growth  prospects,  the  rate  of growth  of  exports  is  expected  to  slow  from  its  recent  robust  pace. Nonetheless,  in  the  near-term  net  exports remains  a  plus  for  growth  from  an  accounting  sense  as  import  growth  remains  very  sluggish  due  to  the  weakness  of domestic  demand. By  the  second  half  of  2009  and  into  2010  the  net  export  contribution  subsides  as the gradual  recovery  of domestic  demand  induces  an  increase  in  the  rate  of  growth  of imports. Lastly, as financial market  functioning  returns  to  more  normal  conditions  and  economic  prospects  begin  to  improve, business  confidence  is  restored  and  investment  spending  starts  to  provide  some  support  to  the  economy.

In this central scenario, core inflation gradually slows over the forecast horizon as the rate of increase of non-oil import  prices  subsides  and  the  effect  of increasing  slack  becomes  more  pronounced. In the very near-term  total  inflation  is  likely  to  run  well  below  core  inflation,  and  possibly  be  negative,  as  the  effects  of the  recent  sharp  declines  in  energy  and  other  commodity  prices  show  through  in  prices  paid  by  consumers. This  projected  path  for  core  inflation  is  based  on  our  assessment  of  the  FOMCs  inflation  objective  as  well  as the  assumptions  that  inflation  expectations  remain  well-contained  and  that  oil  and  other  commo dity  prices remain  near  recent  levels.

The risks to our central pro jection for real activity are substantial and are skewed to the downside. In the  near-term,  the  key  risk  is  that  the  ongoing  turmoil  in  financial  markets  results  in  a  larger  contraction  in the supply  of  credit  that  we  are  currently  expecting. This  in turn  leads  to  more  pronounced  weakness  in  a wide  array  of asset prices and  credit markets,  inducing  a  further  contraction  in  the  supply  of  credit. This adverse  feed-back  process  is clearly evident in the housing  market,  and  now  appears  to  be  spreading  into the automobile  market. A  related  risk is that  the decline  of household  net  worth  embedded  in  this  central projection  induces  a  steeper-than-expected  increase  of  the  personal  saving  rate,  keeping  consumer  spending weaker  for  longer. Finally, a risk over the medium  term  is  the  uncertainty  surrounding  our  assumption  of the  economys  potential  growth  rate.

The  balance  of  risks  is  harder  to  categorize  for  inflation. Clearly  there  is  a  significant  downside  risk  should a severe  recession  start to unfold. In contrast,  in the current  environment  of  aggressive  policy  response  to the ongoing  financial crisis, and with the prospect  of additional fiscal action, there is some  risk of higher inflation  if the  economy  proves  more  resilient  than  in  our  central  scenario. These  two  risks  roughly  balance as measured  by  the  metric  of  comparing  the  expected  value  to  the  mode  but  other  metrics  suggest  downside risks  predominate. For  total  inflation,  we  assess  near-term  downside  risk  given  recent  developments  in  energy and  other  commo dity  markets.

The  heightened  uncertainty  asso ciated  with  turning  points, the ongoing  turmoil  in financial markets,  and

the uncertainty  associated  with  the  timing,  magnitude,  and  effectiveness  of  policy  responses  have  resulted in highly  elevated  uncertainty  around  our  central  pro jection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 14:

The  intensification  of  the  financial  crisis,  the  global  spreading  of  both  financial  and  growth  risks,  the  sharp effects  of  reduced  credit  availability  on  activity,  and  disappointing  numbers  prior  to  the  intensification  of  the crisis  all  point  to  much  slower  growth. Government  measures  have  helped  to  stabilize  the  banking  system  but the  positive  effects  on  growth  will  not  immediately  be  apparent. Monetary  and  fiscal  policy  are  constrained in their  ability  to  offset  the  slowdown. The  recession  will  continue  into  2009,  and  recovery  will  be  slow.

Sharply  declining  commodity  prices,  the  stronger  dollar, and  rising output  gaps  will bring inflation down. Expect  to  see  commodity  prices  begin  to  rise  again  in  the  early  stages  of  the  recovery.

Respondent 15:

All  indicators  show  the  economy  is  currently  in  recession,  and  GDP  is  expected  to  decline  through  the  third quarter  of  2009  in  response  to  a  fall in household  and  business  spending,  and  weakness  in  foreign  demand. The  decline  in  GDP  is  mitigated  to  some  extent  by  an  assumed  expansion  in  fiscal  stimulus  in  2009. However, credit  loses  and  solvency  concerns  remain  elevated  into  2010,  and  this  slows  the  pace  of  recovery.

Lower import prices and weak domestic demand  conditions result in a moderation in inflation over the forecast  period. This  moderation  is  mitigated  by  a  temporary  reduction  in  potential  growth.

Respondent 16:

Construction  remains  a  drag  well  into  2009. Net  export  growth  falters. Consumers  remain  shell  shocked. Layoffs  increase  and  become  more  widespread. Recovery,  although  helped  along  by  fiscal  stimulus,  is  likely to be  slow,  and  will  be  contingent  on  banks  resuming  credit  expansion.

Headline  inflation  in  the  second  half  of  2008  will  be  held  down  by  commo dity-price  declines  and  less  aggressive pricing  from  intermediate  and  finished-goods  import  sources. Global  slack  is  likely  to  increase  through 2009,  putting  further  downward  pressure  on  commo dity  prices  and  foreign  and  domestic  labor  costs. Core inflation  is also  likely to ease,  first because  of  recent  dollar  strength;  second  because  the  fall  in  house  prices must  eventually  feed  through  into  core  prices,  either  through  rents  or  indirectly  through  weaker  consumption demand;  third  because  unit  labor  costs  remain  subdued  and  input  prices  are  down,  meaning  price  pressure from  corporations  is  unlikely  to  be  a  factor, especially  given  that  the  overall  strength  of  corporate  balance sheets  means  firms  can  afford  some  margin  erosion.

Respondent 17:

Typical  recession  dynamics  take  hold. Potential  growth  rates  fall  and  NAIRU  increases. Significant  uncertainty  as to timing  of  credit  market  normalization. Significant  risks  of negative  feedback  loop  beyond  that incorporated  into  pro jections

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  judgements  and  assumptions  affecting  your economic  projections  in  the  final  pro jection  year.

Respondent 1:

In my  pro jection  for  2011,  we  will  still  not  have  converged  to  the  level  of  potential  GDP  or  the  equilibrium unemployment  rate.

Respondent 2:

In  2011,  the  forecasted  inflation  rate  is  1.2  percent,  below  my  long-run  inflation  objective  of  1.8  percent. The unemployment  rate  ends  the  year  at  6.1  percent,  still  above  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  4.8  percent. The  stance  of  monetary  policy  remains  accommodative-with  a  real  funds  rate  of  about  1  percent  at  the  end of 2011-in  order  to  foster  a  reduction  in  the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 3:

given  the  size  of  the  shock,  the  economy  is  still  adjusting  in  2011. The  long-run  growth  rate  of  GDP  potential is 2.5 percent;  the  NAIRU  is  4.75;  and  the  rate  of  inflation  consistent  with  pursuit  of  our  output  and  price stability  objectives  is  1.75  percent.

Respondent 4:

With  monetary  policy  remaining  especially  accommo dative  in  the  near-term,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth  will be  above  potential  in  2010,  approach  potential  in  2011,  and  be  at  potential  in  2012. I also  expect  core  PCE inflation  will  be  at  desired  levels  in  2011.

Respondent 5:

My  judgments  and  assumptions  are  largely  consistent  with  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

By  2011 real GDP  is  growing  at its trend pace of 2.7 percent as the current housing  sector troubles and financial  market  stresses  are  well  behind  us. The  unemployment  rate  is  at  its  natural  rate  of  5  percent  and inflation  has  settled  at  my  long-term  goal  of  1.7  percent.

Respondent 8:

Potential  GDP  growth  is  2.5  percent. The  NAIRU  is  4.75  percent. Desired  core  PCE  inflation  is  2  percent. The  federal  funds  rate  is  kept  near  zero  over  the  forecast  horizon. Despite  this  stance  of  monetary  policy,  by the  end  of  2011  inflation  remains  lower  than  the  desired  target  and  the  unemployment  rate  is  still  substantially above  the  NAIRU.  While  the  enactment  of  a  new  fiscal  stimulus  package  is  likely,  it  has  not  been  factored into  the  projection.

Respondent 9:

Growth  at  its  steady  state  value  and  inflation  at  target,  but  unemployment  still  adjusting  to  its  steady  state value.

Respondent 10:

Trend  real  GDP  growth  is  around  2.7  percent,  and  growth  is  likely  to  be  above  trend  as  'slack'  gradually diminishes. The expected value of PCE  inflation in 2001, conditional on current information, under an appropriate  monetary  policy  is  1.5  percent.

Respondent 11:

The  economy  will  be in the process of recovering from the recession of 2008-2009. Thus, 2011 should be characterized  by  substantial  growth  and  low  inflation.

Respondent 12:

We  assume  that  inflation  and  inflation  expectations  will  be  in  a  range  broadly  consistent  with  price  stability. However,  we  expect  the  level  of  output  to  still  be  below  potential. Thus,  appropriate  policy  will  maintain  a modest  degree  of  accommodation  in  order  to  close  this  gap  over  coming  years.

Respondent 13:

We assume that long-term inflation expectations are between 2-2.5% on a CPI basis and the FOMC's inflation  objective  to  be  1.5-2.0%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  2-2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Potential  growth  is  2.7%  (we now  expect  some  further  delay  in  the  retirement  of  baby  boomers  relative  to  earlier  generations),  and  that the output  gap  opens  in 2008  and  narrows  in 2010-11. Our  extended  forecast  also includes some  implicit judgments  about  the  likely ranges for the NAIRU  and  the  neutral  policy  rate. Those  judgments  put  the neutral  policy  rate  in  the  region  of  3.75%  to  4.75%  absent  the  current  disruptions  in  financial  markets  and the  NAIRU  between  4.5%  to  5%.

Respondent 14:

Given  how  far  we  are from  equilibrium,  final  year  pro jections do not show  steady  state  values. Growth  is above  potential  but  unemployment  is  above  the  natural  rate,  reflecting  early  stage  of  expansion. Inflation  is a bit below  my  preferred  range,  reflecting  lagged  effects  of  weak  economy.

Respondent 15:

Year-over-year growth  does not return to trend of 2.5 percent until 2011. This results in relatively high unemployment  for  some  time. The  sectoral  reallo cations  reflected  in  this  forecast  also  results  in  a  somewhat higher  level  for  the  long-run  natural  unemployment.rate. PCE  inflation  is  assumed  to  be  stable  at  1.8  percent in 2011.

Respondent 16:

Key  to the pace of recovery  will be the degree of thawing  of credit and  the tempo  for the beginning  of a resumption  of  confidence.

Respondent 17:

Credit  markets  normalize  during  4q  2008,  limiting  harm  to  real  economy  and  employment  in  2009  and  beyond

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook

Respondent 1:

While  broadly  similar  to  the  Greenbook  in  the  near-term,  my  forecast  differs  in  the  out-years. I see  a costly sectoral  reallo cation  temporarily  dampening  potential  GDP  growth,  leading  to  less  slack  than  in  the  Greenbook  projection. Therefore,  output  growth,  in  my  forecast,  follows  a  slightly  lower  growth  path  out  of  the near-term  recession, while my  path  for inflation remains  higher  than  the  Greenbook's  near  the  end  of  the projection.

Respondent 2:

The  broad  contours  of  my  forecast  are  similar  to  the  Greenbooks. The  most  important  differences  are  that I assume  a  new  fiscal  stimulus  package  will  boost  growth  somewhat  in  2009  and  that  the  recovery  in  2010 and  beyond  will  be  somewhat  more  rapid  than  projected  in  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 3:

I assumed  fiscal  stimulus  similar  to  the  first  fiscal  alt  sim.

Respondent 4:

Compared  to  my  forecast, Greenbook's  decline  in  real GDP  is  both  deeper  and  more  prolonged; I expect real  GDP  growth  to  be  stronger  than  Greenbook  in  2009  and  2010. In  particular,  I  expect  real  GDP  growth will be  above  trend  in  2010  whereas  Greenbook  expects  growth  will  be  below  trend. I also  expect  growth  to be  lower  in  2011  than  Greenbook.

While  I also expect overall and core PCE  inflation to moderate  in 2009 and beyond, I do not expect as large  a drop-off  in  inflation  as does  Greenbook. I believe  the  extent  and  impact  of  slack  in  the  economy  to be smaller  than  does  Greenbook. In addition,  in my  view,  long-term  inflation  expectations  of  two  percent or more  are  unlikely  to  allow  inflation  to  fall  as  low  as  in  Greenbook.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

I do  not  believe  the  economy  will  be  as  weak  in  2009  as  is  predicted  by  the  Greenbook  nor  do  I  believe  that as large  of  an  output  gap  will  open  up. The  economy  rebounds  to  trend  growth  in  2009H2. Consistent  with this growth  forecast,  my  path  for  the  funds  rate  is  considerably  less  accommodative  than  in  the  Greenbook baseline. I expect  the  Committee  will  need  to  begin  bringing  the  funds  rate  up  in  2009H2  and  that  the  funds rate  will need  to  be  at  its long-term  equilibrium  level  of  4.25  percent  by  the  end  of  2010.

Respondent 8:

In our  forecast,  inflation  is  more  responsive  to  the  unemployment  rate  gap  than  in  the  Greenbook.

Respondent 9:

I have  a  somewhat  sharper  near-term  deterioration  and  a  more  rapid  rebound  in  2009  and  beyond.

Respondent 10:

I do not forecast  as rapid  a decline  in inflation as the Greenbook,  and  I  believe  negative  real  GDP  growth will end  sooner.

Respondent 11:

There appear to be two differences of note. 1) I expect a resumption of relatively rapid growth earlier (second  quarter  2010)  than  the  Greenbook. And  the  Greenbook  has  lower  core  inflation  in  2010  and  2011, presumably  because  it  gives  greater  weight  to  NAIRU  or  other  measures  of  slack.

Respondent 12:

We  assume  that  the  financial  stress  will  be  relieved  somewhat  sooner  than  in  the  Greenbook. Our  monetary policy  assumptions  also  differ  as  noted  above. In addition,  we  assume  the  enactment  of  some  fiscal  stimulus that  will  boost  growth  in  2009.

Respondent 13:

We  pro ject  slightly  higher  trend  growth  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline in the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  occur  later  and  more  slowly  than  in  the  GB.  In  terms  of  difference for the  outlook  in  2009  this  implies  we  project  a  higher  peak  to  the  unemployment  rate  than  the  GB  as  the labor  force  participation  rate  does  not  decline  as  sharply  as  in  the  GB.  We  assume  lower  inflation  persistence than does the GB.  Thus, for our longer-term  inflation outlook we pro ject inflation within the 'mandateconsistent'  range  in  2010-11.

Respondent 14:

Qualitatively  similar.

Respondent 15:

The  near  term  economic  outlook  is  more  negative  and  the  recovery  more  protracted  than  in  the  Greenbook baseline -similar to the 'more  financial fallout' alternative. The  impact of the weakness  on inflation is less than  assumed  in  the  Greenbook  baseline  because  of  costly  sectoral  reallocation  that  temporarily  lowers potential  growth.

Respondent 16:

My  forecast incorp orates a somewhat  sharper  downturn  than  does  the  Greenbook  baseline, and a slower recovery. I am projecting little growth in real consumer  spending over the next two years, whereas the Greenbook  predicts  significant  growth  by  2010.

Respondent 17:

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

The  deterioration  in  credit markets  along  with  incoming  data  has  led  me  to  dramatically  revise  down  my forecast. Notably,  I  am  assuming  that  credit  factors  will  cause  BFI  to  contract  sharply  through  2009. Also, recent data in the housing  market  has  caused  me  to  further  lower my  path  for housing  starts. Given  the international nature of the credit crisis, along with incoming  data and anecdotal reports, I have also revised  down  my  pro jection  for  foreign  sector  growth. Inflation  responds  to  a  further  decrease  in  energy  and commodity  prices,  and  a  widening  output  gap. However,  the  breadth  of  that  gap  is  tempered  by  a  sectoral reallo cation  that  temporarily  dampens  potential  output  and  offsets  some  of  the  disinflationary  effects  of  the gap.

Respondent 2:

Recent  economic  data,  both  for  the  U.S.  and  foreign  economies,  have  been  much  worse  than  expected  and the  global  financial  crisis  has  intensified. This  has  caused  me  to  lower  my  forecast  for  economic  activity. The fall in oil and  other  commodity  prices,  the  appreciation  of  the  exchange  value  of  the  dollar,  and  the  increase in the  forecast  for  labor  market  slack  has  caused  me  to  lower  my  forecast  for  inflation.

Respondent 3:

Weaker-than-expected  incoming  data  on  activity  along  with  the  unanticipated  sharp  intensification  of  financial stress and  associated  tightening  of  financial  conditions  caused  a  substantial  write  down  in  the  path  of projected  economic  activity. A  much  wider  output  gap,  decline  in  energy  prices,  strengthening  of  the  dollar, and  decrease  in  forecasts  of  foreign  inflation  led  to  a  decrease  in  projected  inflation.

Respondent 4:

Incoming  data  has  been  weaker  than  expected,  partly  due  to  an  intensification  of  financial  turmoil,  heightened  problems  with  credit  availability,  and  greater  caution  on  the  part  of  consumers  and  businesses. Inflation data  have  been  better  than  expected  partly  due  to  sharp  declines  in  energy  prices. As  a  result,  I  have  revised down  my  forecasts  for  GDP  growth  and  near-term  inflation.

Respondent 5:

The  significant  deterioration  in  the  functioning  of  credit  markets,  the  large  decline  in  sto ck  market  wealth around  the  world,  the  sharp  decline  in  economic  activity  worldwide  have  led  me  to  reduce  substantially  my growth  forecasts  and  the  uncertainty  around  them. The  sharp  decline  in  commodity  prices  and  significantly reduced  resource  pressures  globally  have  led  to  a  substantial  reduction  in  my  near  term  total  PCE  forecast.

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

The  key  factors  that  have  caused  me  to  revise  down  my  forecast  are  the  generally  weaker-than-expected  data that  have  been  coming  in  over  the  last  few  months,  the  heightened  level  of  stress  in  financial  markets,  and a downward  revision  to  my  forecast  for  growth  abroad.

Respondent 8:

Economic  and  financial  conditions  have  deteriorated  dramatically  since  June.

Respondent 9:

Substantially  weaker  economic  data  through  the  summer,  plus  intensified  financial  market  turmoil.

Respondent 10:

Unfavorable  data  on  real  activity,  including  consumer  spending,  personal  income,  employment  and  new  home sales, have  led  me  to  believe  that  this  time  period  will  be  designated  a  recession. Growth  and  inflation  are likely to be  lower  than  I  anticipated  in  the  last  projections,  and  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be  lower  as  well.

Respondent 11:

This could take a monograph, if not a book. For the sake of brevity: financial strains have intensified; negatives  identified  last  quarter  have  in  fact  contributed  to  contraction  in  the  economy  over  the  second  half of this year  and  into  next;  and  the  downside  risk  to  consumer  spending  in  fact  materialized.

Respondent 12:

The  disruptions  to  the  financial system  have  become  much  more  intense  and  widespread  than  we  had  anticipated. In addition, household  wealth  has fallen significantly, and growth  in the rest of the world has slowed. A recessionary  psychology  appears  to  have  taken  hold  of  households  and  businesses. On  the  plus side, energy  and  other  commodity  prices  have  come  down  dramatically.

Respondent 13:

In June  we  judged  it  likely  that  the  US  economy  would  just  skirt  a  recession. June  data  releases  supported this assessment  but  recent  data  on employment,  consumption,  manufacturing  and  business  and  consumer confidence  has  produced  a  large  revision  in  our  forecast. The  intensification  of financial turmoil  and  large declines in household  net  worth  have  put  further  downward  pressure  on  the  outlook  for  real activity. We view the decline in energy and other commodity  prices as primarily a result of lowered expectations for global  growth,  partially  offsetting  the  net  boost  to  real  disposable  income.

Core inflation data surprised to the upside relative to our June forecast for three months  in a row with some  evidence of a broad-based  increase in inflation. Many  of our coincident measures  of underlying inflation moved  up  to uncomfortably  high  levels in August. With  the low reading of core CPI  inflation in September,  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar, large declines in energy  and  other  commodity  prices  and  increasing  slack  in the labor  market,  we  are  placing  less  weight  on  the  apparently  lagging  signals  from  most measures  of  underlying  inflation.

The  downside  risks to our central scenario pro jection have increased dramatically since June. The  main source  of  this  increase  has  been  the  combination  of  intensified  financial  market  stress  with  the  weakening  in the  real  economy.

In June the policy assumption underlying our central pro jection was a relatively quick renormalization of the policy rate in 2009-10. The large change in our forecast for real activity and decline in inflation pressures  has  produce  a  big  downward  shift  in  our  policy  assumption.

Respondent 14:

Incoming  data on consumption  in particular, intensification of financial crisis, global reach of crisis, and evidence  of  sharp  slowdown  in  recent  weeks.

Respondent 15:

Economic  and  financial  developments  have  been  substantially  weaker  than  expected.

Respondent 16:

The ongoing credit and overall financial-market turmoil, exacerbated by unintended  consequences of the Freddie/Fannie and Lehman  failures, has shifted the economic growth outlook downward, has vaporized short-term  inflationary  pressures,  and  increased  overall  uncertainty.

Respondent 17:

Significantly  increased  financial  market  turmoil
