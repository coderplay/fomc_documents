Respondent  3:

The convergence process may be slightly shorter than 5-6 years.

Respondent 4:

By  2015-16  potential  growth  is  2.4%,  down  from  our  current  estimate  of  2.5-2.7%,  as  the  baby  boomers retire.  A reasonable estimate  for the long-run unemployment  rate is 4.5%  to 5.5%.  We would expect,  with appropriate policy and no further adverse shocks,  unemployment to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-16.

We assume long-term inflation expectations  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's inflation objective to be  around 2%  for the  PCE deflator and around 2.5% for the  CPI.  Under these condi­ tions,  with the output gap around zero,  we would expect  PCE inflation of around 2%.

Respondent  5:

Expect convergence process to take somewhat longer

Respondent  6:

I  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  be  substantially  shorter than 5-6 years, perhaps on the order of three years for real growth  (with a period of overshoot of real growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an overshoot in the interim in inflation as  a consequence of significant past  growth in the monetary base supported by longer term asset purchases that cannot be sold off over a very short time period.  I  anticipate that the decline in the unemployment rate will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  7:

Given  the  depth  of the  recession,  the  damage  inflicted  on  the  financial  sector,  widespread  uncertainty  in the business community about government programs and regulatory change,  and the difficult domestic and global adjustments that are needed,  convergence may well require the full five-to-six years.

Respondent  10:

the  unemployment  gap  at  the  end of 2012  is  so  large  and  inflation  so  far  below the  long-run  value  that  it may well take more than 5 years to reach steady state for both variables.

Respondent  11:

Convergence to the real economy's equilibrium and to the inflation objective within five years requires lower long-term interest  rates  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  baseline  outlook. As  a  result,  while  the  economy is anticipated to revert back to maximum employment within a five years horizon, inflation is likely to remain below the target.

Respondent  12:

In  light  of  the  severity  and  breadth  of  shocks  to  the  economy  and  the  consequent  significant  impacts  on government, firm, and household behavior, the convergence process may well extend beyond five or six years to something closer to eight years.

Respondent  13:

Respondent  14:

unemployment may take six or seven years

Respondent  15:

N/A

Respondent  16:

I expect  the convergence  process will be  similar to that  outlined in the long-run projection reported in the Tealbook, with the output and unemployment gaps reaching zero in three or four years,  and the PCE price inflation rate reaching its long-run value of 2 percent in six to seven years.

Respondent  17:

In light of the severity of the recession and historical norms of recoveries following financial crises, the con­ vergence  process  for  unemployment  may  take  longer  than  five  to  six  years. In  addition,  I  am  concerned that  delaying the  removal  of policy accommodation  will  lead  to financial  imbalances  that  could  eventually destabilize  the  economy and  further  prolong the  convergence  process.  In  addition,  delay in the  removal of policy  accommodation  and  shrinkage  of our  balance  sheet  could cause  long-term  inflation  expectations  to become unanchored and affect the duration of the convergence process.

Financial  market  conditions  continue  to  improve  and  the  economy  is  in  recovery. However,  the  events  in the Euro area have contributed to some increased uncertainty in my forecast.  In addition,  the effect  of the extraordinary monetary policy accommodation in place  and the uncertainty about  the timing of when we will exit  from that  accommodation contribute to uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

The sensitivity of financial markets to unexpected developments over the intermeeting period suggests that financial  conditions  are  likely  to  be  more  variable  than  usual  with  implications  for  uncertainty  about  the path of output.  In light of the experience of the past few years, the uncertainties about productivity and the relationship between economic growth  and employment  remain unusually high.  In  addition,  with inflation remaining very low, the unusually large gap between actual and expected inflation persists in my projection, adding to uncertainty about inflation.

Respondent  13:

Recent  developments  in Europe  and  the  unevenness in the  improvements in labor  markets  and  household consumption have increased the uncertainty attached to the forecast since last round.  Nonetheless, in abso-

lute terms,  we still think that the uncertainty over the forecast is only modestly higher than usual.

Respondent  14:

Volatility was unusually low during the past twenty years.

Respondent  15:

I believe that uncertainty regarding projections for GDP and unemployment are now about average.  Inflation projections would be more firmly anchored under an appropriate monetary policy, and therefore uncertainty would be lower than the trailing 20-year average.

Respondent  16:

The fiscal  and financial  turmoil  in  Europe  and the  unusual  fiscal  and monetary policies  all  increase uncer­ tainty regarding the outlook for economic growth relative to the past 20 years.  In addition, the unusual jump in the unemployment rate last year raises questions about the evolution of the labor market going forward. The heightened risks to the  outlook  for economic activity,  as well  as  the  elevated variability of commodity prices,  raise uncertainty regarding the outlook for inflation.

Respondent  17:

While forecasts are always subject to considerable uncertainty,  the uncertainty surrounding my projections remain even higher than normal.  I generally agree with Tealbook's assessment of the sources of uncertainty, but  I  would  add  fiscal  policy  to  the  list. Various  aspects  of fiscal  policy-such  as  questions  of fiscal  sus­ tainability,  the expiration of the Bush tax cuts, indexation of the AMT,  and the potential for a VAT-create considerable uncertainty about the outlook.  Together, the uncertainty surrounding the recovery and inflation exceed the norms of the past  20 years.

In response to the increased risks  associated with the deterioration in European financial conditions I have shifted my risk weighting around the outlook from  'weighted to upside'  to  'broadly balanced'.

Respondent  3:

The  incoming data  and events in Europe  shade  down slightly my near-term path  for  growth  compared to my April forecast.  I view the risks to growth as balanced and inflation as weighted to the upside.  Historical patterns  in  the  data  suggest  the  rebound  might  be  stronger  than  my  baseline  forecast. Over  the  longer term,  inflation  risk is  tilted  to  the  upside  reflecting uncertainty about  the  timing  and  efficacy of the  Fed' s withdrawal of accommodation.

Going forward into 2010 as the economy recovers from the recent recession and experiences the fiscal stimulus program  as  well  as  a  substantial  persistent  increase  in  the  monetary base,  I  believe  that  the  risks  to  real growth and inflation will become weighted to the upside.

Market  sensitivity  suggests  downside  output  risks,  especially  around  Europe  and  the  fiscal  and  financial reaction  to  recent  developments. In  addition,  tightening capital,  liquidity,  and  activity regulations  around banking  could  constrain  the  recovery in  bank  credit  availability. Downside  risks  to  inflation  expectations, see below,  indicate downside risks to output  since real rates would tend to rise if expectations  fell.  Unem­ ployment risks weighted to the upside by the possibility of a faster recovery in participation.  Inflation risks weighted to the downside by the possibility that inflation expectations begin to adjust to persistent low levels of actual inflation.

Respondent  13:

While the effects of recent developments in Europe on U.S. growth will likely be modest, there is a downside risk  of  a  larger  impact. The  events  of most  concern  would  be  associated  with  a  marked  increase  in  risk aversion by the financial sector -  one well beyond that indicated by the movements we have seen to date in risk spreads and other financial indicators.

Respondent  14:

The risks to inflation are balanced -  but large.

Respondent  15:

N/A

Respondent  16:

The turmoil in Europe  and the risk of further  contagion  across  Europe poses  significant  downside  risks  to the  outlook  for  economic  growth  in  the  United  States. Correspondingly,  the  risk  to  the  outlook  for  the unemployment rate are weighted to the upside.  The inflation risks appear to be roughly balanced.

Respondent  17:

Important risks remain.  Problems in commercial real estate continue to pose downside risks to GDP growth. In  addition,  fiscal  policy-here  and  abroad-poses  a downside  risk to the  outlook.  Earlier  in the  year,  ques­ tions  about  the  expiration  of the  Bush  tax cuts  and indexation of the  AMT  led to greater  overall  risks  to the  outlook. While these  questions  remain,  greater  concern  about  fiscal  sustainability suggests  that  fiscal policy is more likely to be tighter than easier.  Finally,  while the European sovereign debt crisis poses some downside risk to the outlook, I believe the risk is relatively small and likely to remain contained.  However, I would also argue that the resiliency of the U.S.  economy and traditional business cycle dynamics-especially following a deep recession-pose upside risks in the medium run.  In addition, if monetary policy remains too accommodative for too long,  there is  a risk that growth will be stronger than expected and sustainable.

As to inflation,  in the near term,  the weakness of the economy and recent  price trends pose some downside risks  to  core  and  overall  inflation. However,  in  the  medium  or  long  term,  the  expansion  of  our  balance sheet  and increased concerns about  federal borrowing and fiscal sustainability create  a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations,  and therefore create upside risks to inflation.  In addition,  there is a risk that monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  3: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the appropriate monetary policy as one that raises the  funds rate to about  1   percent  by the end of 2010  and  3 percent by the end of 2011.  By the end of 2012,  I see the funds rate at  about 4.5 percent.

Respondent 4: Yes

For  2010 identical.  We  assume the normalization of the policy rate starts in summer 2011  and continues at a faster rate in 2012.  Because of differences in our inflation forecasts, the difference in the real policy rate is less  substantial.  Further,  if one takes into account  the downside risks to our  forecast,  the expected path of the policy rate is very close to the  Tealbook assumption.

Our  views  on  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  are  similar  to  the  Tealbook  -   we  expect  an  active  strategy of reducing the balance sheet starting around 6 months after the first rate increase.

Respondent  5: Yes

Expect policy rates to move sooner and with greater force than staff forecast

Respondent  6: Yes

While the pattern of recovery from the recent recession is uncertain, I believe that under appropriate mone­ tary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate sooner than assumed in the Greenbook forecast.

Respondent  7: No

We  first  need  to  normalize  the  spread  between  the  discount  rate  and  the  base  policy  rate  by  restoring  it to  the  full  100  basis  points. I  anticipate  normalization  sometime  this  year. As  regards  the  base  rate,  the uncertainty attached to the economic outlook is such that we must be careful not to lock ourselves in to a particular rate or rate path.

Respondent  8: Yes

Anticipate  a  modest  move  toward  normalization  around  the  turn  of the  year  or  in  2011:Q1,  further  slow increases in 2011.

Respondent  9: Yes

Because my inflation profile is somewhat stronger than the Greenbook's in 2011  and 2012, the federal funds rate begins to increase gradually in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  10: Yes

funds rate begins to rise in second half of 2011.  no asset sales until  after increase in funds rate.

Respondent  11: Yes

The  forecast  is  conditioned  on  approximately the  same  short-  and  long-term interest  rates  assumptions  as in the  Greenbook.  But  this  path  for  the interest  rates  is  not  consistent  with  achieving the  dual  mandate' s goals over a five years horizon.

Respondent  12: No

N/A

Respondent  13: Yes

We  are  assuming  a  rate  path  somewhere  between  that  embedded  in  market  expectations  and  the  Greenbook's  assumptions.  The implications of these differences  for growth  and inflation over  the  forecast  period are small.

Respondent  14: Yes

In  the  Tealbook,  the staff assumes that  the target  interest  rate will stay near zero  for  another two years.  I believe that the optimal path will involve an earlier increase in the target rate.

Respondent  15: Yes

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary policy the  committee  would  announce  a numerical  inflation objective.  To achieve that objective,  rates would most likely increase well before the summer of 2012.

Respondent  16: No

N/A

Respondent  17: Yes

I  believe  the  appropriate path  for monetary policy requires raising the target  federal  funds rate in 2010,  in contrast  to the  Tealbook  assumption  that  the  current  target  rate  is  maintained  until  the  summer  of 2012. Keeping rates  so  extraordinarily low  for  so  long  invites  future  financial  imbalances  and  risks  economic  in­ stability.  I  also believe  that  appropriate policy will involve taking steps-some this year-to gradually reduce the size of our balance sheet  and normalize its composition.  I believe that it would be  appropriate to begin selling agency debt  and MBS later this year,  rather than waiting until  2013,  as conditions permit.

Forecast  Narratives

Respondent  1:

Respondent  2:

The incoming data and reports from business contacts have been mixed and broadly consistent with my pre­ vious forecast of a sustained growth trajectory that is quite restrained.  Business attitudes remain extremely cautious,  and  there  appears  to  be  considerable  economic  slack  in  many  industries  that  is  keeping  overall downward pressure on inflation.  Business spending increases appear to be driven primarily by precautionary rather  than expansionary motives,  and this  is  reflected  in  considerable  hesitancy to increase  payrolls. Nu­ merous factors,  including tight credit,  the weak housing sector,  and the European debt situation are  acting as headwinds for the economic recovery,  and I expect that these headwinds will persist  for a while.

Respondent  3:

The recent data on the economy has been broadly in line with what I anticipated in my April forecast.

In  my  view,  the  economy  is  now  is  in  recovery  and  I  expect  an  above-trend  pace  of  3.5  percent  growth in 2010,  down a shade from my previous forecast.  In 2011, I expect growth of about 3.5 percent and slightly above-trend growth in 2012.  The labor market recovery is gradual - I expect the unemployment rate edges down to about  6.8 percent  by the  end of the  forecast  horizon,  at  which  time  it  remains  above  the  natural rate of unemployment by about  1.3 percentage point.  I anticipate that inflation will rise into 2011 then pull back in 2012 in response to tighter monetary policy than anticipated in the Tealbook.

Developments in Europe have raised uncertainty around my forecast.  However,  in my view,  the substantial liquidity that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to imply  a  risk that  inflation will  rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored.  To ward off these develop­ ments,  the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in 2010.

Respondent 4:

Our modal forecast  for real GDP growth is based on the assessment that we are unlikely to experience the robust growth that has followed previous severe recessions in the post-WWII era.  This assessment is based to  a  large  extent  on  the  belief  that  the  excessive  leverage  and  excessive  investment  in  real  estate  assets, major  factors underlying the global financial crisis,  will  take  time  to unwind. Accordingly,  growth in  2010 is  likely to  be  only modestly  above  the  economy's  potential  growth rate,  implying that  the  unemployment rate  is  likely  to  remain  stubbornly high  and  the  sizable  slack  in  resource  utilization  will  be  absorbed  only gradually.  This in  turn suggests that  core  inflation is  likely to remain below the  mandate  consistent  range over much of the forecast horizon.

A  major  factor  behind  the  muted  near-term  recovery  in  our  central  forecast  is  our  expectation  that  the substantial  headwinds  still  faced  by households  will  temper  consumer  spending  growth. Household  sector wealth has rebounded only modestly from the steep declines in 2007-09 and income growth has been subdued; further,  the recent  burst of financial market volatility could lead households to question the permanence of the wealth rebound and of the economic recovery.  The impetus to disposable income from the stimulus bill has begun to wane.  Finally, with households still facing a debt overhang and credit  availability expected to remain tight,  debt financing of consumer spending probably will be constrained.

A  second  key feature  of our  modal  forecast  is  that  the  US  probably  will  not  experience  the  surge  of resi-

dential  investment  typical  of the  early stages  of post-WWII  recoveries.  We  estimate  that  there  are  nearly 3  million excess  vacant  housing units,  with more  coming  onto  the  market  over  the  forecast  horizon due to the  unusually high  volume  of homes  in the  foreclosure  process. At  the  same  time,  mortgage  underwriting standards have been significantly tightened,  with even high credit quality borrowers being required to make substantial  down payments.  As the  boost  from the home buyer tax credit  wanes over the coming months, we expect home construction to be relatively lackluster; the decline in single family building permits in April and May point in that direction.

With  muted  growth  of consumption  and  residential  investment,  a  low  manufacturing  capacity  utilization rate,  and  rising  retail  and  office  vacancy  rates,  a  full  of recovery  of business  fixed  investment  is  likely  to be  delayed  despite  the  recent  strength  in  equipment  and  software  expenditure. Also  contributing  to  the expectation of a tepid recovery is the ongoing structural adjustment taking place in state  and local govern­ ments.  Finally,  we do not  expect  a large  growth contribution  from net  exports,  especially given the  recent appreciation of the dollar and down grading of growth prospects for the Euro Area.

Going  forward,  we  expect  that  the  underlying  fundamentals  improve  sufficiently  for  real  GDP  growth  to be around 4% in 2011  and about 5% in 2012, with the unemployment rate falling steadily to around 7% by the end of 2012.  Underlying this projection is our expectation of a return to normal financial market  func­ tioning, improved consumer and business confidence, a recovery in risk appetite, and an end to the structural adjustments in the state  and  local government  sector  and  the  commercial  real  estate  sector.  Furthermore, with household income and balance sheets improving and credit flowing more normally, the substantial pentup demand for consumer durables, housing,  and business equipment and software will start to be satisfied.

Barring  a  significant  decline  in  the  level  of the  economy's  potential  output  or  its  potential  growth  rate, our modal forecast for growth implies that a large output gap will persist over most of the forecast horizon. Accordingly,  we  expect  core  inflation  to  slow  to  around  1%   (Q4/Q4)  in  2010. But  by  late  2011  and  into 2012,  as final  demand firms within the  context  of anchored inflation expectations,  we  expect  core inflation to move up to within the  'mandate consistent'  range.

The  developments  over  the  inter  meeting  period  have  led  us  to  shift  the  balance  of risks  to  our  real  ac­ tivity projection  back to  the  downside. One emerging downside  risk is  that  spillovers  from  the  peripheral European  sovereign  debt  crisis  to  the  US  economy  and  financial  markets  could  be  larger  than  expected. Another  key  downside  risk  is  that  because  of  wealth  declines,  sluggish  employment  and  income  growth, and increased uncertainty  (in part  from the European crisis),  households attempt to raise their saving rate, thereby damping consumer spending, to a greater extent than expected.  The sharp decrease in the prime age employment to population ratio during the current cycle, combined with the large share of workers nearing retirement age,  makes this risk particularly acute.  Fiscal policy is  also an independent source of risk to our forecast.  While a diminution of fiscal stimulus in 2011  is widely anticipated,  it is possible that the US could face its own fiscal crisis and thus have to engage in a more aggressive fiscal consolidation.

An important risk over the medium term concerns our assumption of the economy's potential growth rate. On the one hand,  given the weakness of overall business investment and the apparent misallocation of labor and capital,  the economy' s potential growth rate may have slowed significantly.  On the other hand,  current estimates of labor productivity continue to surprise to the upside,  suggesting that the potential growth rate could be higher than our current estimate.

The  risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  also  have  shifted  back  to  the  downside. The  down­ side  risks  to  the  growth  projection  combined  with  the  possibility  of  no  meaningful  decline  in  potential implies downside risks to the  inflation projection.  Moreover,  we  see  some  possibility that  excessively quick moves towards fiscal consolidation across Europe could reinforce deflationary forces.  Given the low current level  of inflation  and the  relative  weakness of the  economy there is  little margin  for error  to the  downside.

Nevertheless,  with the  aggressive global monetary policy response to the financial crisis  and the possibility of a stronger-than-expected rebound, there remains notable risk of higher inflation than our modal projection

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  the  shape  of  recoveries  from  periods  of  banking  and  finan­ cial  crisis,  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  timing  and  synchronization  of the  removal  of global  policy accommodation,  and the uncertainties associated with the peripheral European debt crisis result  in greater uncertainty around our central projection compared to typical levels over the last twenty years.

Respondent  5:

Cyclical recovery could be undermined by continued higher volatility in financial markets.  Strength of expan­ sion diminished by less growth-friendly public policies and underperformance by advanced foreign economies.

Respondent  6:

In  2010  and  2011  I  anticipate that  real growth will  occur  at  greater  than steady-state rates,  reflecting nor­ mal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by  a  modest  impact  of the  fiscal  stimulus  package  and  the  impact  of the substantial monetary stimulus that has been in train since late 2008.  I expect that subsequently growth will slow  and  approach  steady-state  rates. I  expect  core  PCE  inflation  over  all  of 2010  to  be  close  to  that  of 2009,  and  intrayear  fluctuations  in  energy prices will  approximately net  out,  so that  the  headline  rate  will be close to the core rate over all of 2010.  Subsequently, under appropriate monetary policy,  inflation should approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent,  though I  believe  that  it  will  rise  above that  rate in  an interim period.  I do not believe that future energy shocks can be forecasted, so with available information I expect that core and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  7:

We've seen breakdowns in both Okun's Law and the Beveridge Curve during this recession.  The pessimist's interpretation  is  that  the  natural  rate  of unemployment  has  increased  and  will  remain  high  for  some  time as  a  result  of  an  unusually  large  mismatch  between  the  skills  possessed  by the  unemployed  and  the  skills sought  by firms  with job  vacancies.  Firms have  laid off workers  with  no intention or  expectation of hiring them back as the economy improves.  They have  a substantial incentive to invest  abroad rather than build 'head count'  at home.

The  optimist's  interpretation  of the  breakdowns  in  Okun's  Law  and  the  Beveridge  Curve  is  that  restric­ tions  on  credit  forced  firms  to  slash  payrolls  to  an  unusual  degree  as  they attempted  to  maintain  positive cash  flow. This  story  is  consistent  with  the  coincidence  between  the  intensification  of the  financial  crisis in  September  2008  and  the  breakdown  in  the  Beveridge  Curve. If true,  then  as  credit-market  conditions normalize we can expect  to see unusually rapid employment gains relative to output growth.  Realistically, credit  markets will be slow to mend,  so that even under this scenario the unemployment rate remains high for  a prolonged period.

Both of these  labor market  stories contain elements of truth,  and my forecast splits  the difference  between them.

On  the  demand  side,  the  economy  is  not  firing  on  all  cylinders-a  fact  that  will  become  increasingly  ob­ vious  as the  growth contribution  from inventory investment  fades.  It  is  hard to imagine  that  we' ll see  any significant  offsetting  growth  in  government  purchases. Residential  investment  is  likely to  remain  weak  for years.  Equipment and software investment looks solid over the near term, but must ultimately be supported by  growth  in  net  exports  and/or  consumption. Fiscal  austerity  and  financial  uncertainty  in  Europe  have dimmed prospects for the former.  I expect real consumption growth to be unremarkable, as households face tight  (albeit  no longer tightening)  credit  and weak income growth,  and remain leery of debt  and concerned about future tax policy.  The aggregate doesn't add up to anything like robust growth.

With negligible  demand-pull  and only a gradual  reduction in slack,  inflation  is  likely to remain contained.

Respondent  8:

Moderate economic recovery with weak job creation continues.  Consumer spending has been supported by rising  disposable  income  and  greater  optimism  about  the  labor  market  and  house  prices. Equipment  and software  investment  is  being  driven  by  the  replacement  cycle,  low  cost  of  capital,  and  some  increases  in demand,  especially  in  export  industries. Federal  fiscal  policy  is  still  supportive,  partially  offset  by  weak­ ness  at  the  state  and  local  level. Residential  and  nonresidential  structures  investment  remain  very  weak, the  inventory cycle is still  a positive  but  is fading,  and  net  exports  are  neutral to negative.  Strong growth is likely to continue in many trading partners, especially EMEs, but Europe will be a drag on global recovery.

Financial  conditions  have  tightened  somewhat,  due  largely  to  developments  in  Europe  and  perhaps  also to  uncertainties  about  US financial  reform  legislation.  The  stronger  dollar,  lower stock  market,  and  wider spreads  are  negatives  for  growth,  partially  offset  by  lower  oil  and  commodity  prices. Banks  continue  to deleverage and to manage credit losses; credit terms appear to have stabilized but tight credit must certainly be a problem for many bank-dependent borrowers with weakened balance sheets, including small businesses.

In  the  labor  market,  hours  and  labor  income  are  up,  but  employment  gains  net  of the  Census  are  quite modest.  High UI claims are puzzling but suggest that the labor market  may be sluggish for a time.  Firms are  evidently  still  uncertain  of recovery  and  are  not  hiring  much  (preferring  more  hours  to  more  bodies). Long-term unemployment is high but it seems unlikely at this point that the NAIRU has risen significantly.

Inflation  and  inflation  pressures  are  at  the  lowest  point  in  some  time. Core,  median  and  similar  infla­ tion measures are declining with slack and falling unit labor costs.  Oil and commodity prices are down, the dollar is up,  and inflation expectations are stable to down.  Inflation seems likely to be subdued for the next few quarters at least.

Respondent  9:

The  unexpected  strength  in  first  quarter  consumption  expenditures  notwithstanding,  households  continue to be weighed down by a weak labor market  and tight credit conditions.  Uncertainty over the strength and viability  of the  recovery,  especially  in  light  of the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis,  also  restrains  consumer spending  and  makes  businesses  reluctant  to  hire  and  undertake  large-scale  investment  projects. Business spending on  structures  continues  to  contract  in  2010  hampered  by high  vacancy  rates  and  ongoing  credit problems in commercial real estate.

Currently elevated productivity growth will not be sustained.  My forecast assumes lower-than-average pro­ ductivity growth due primarily to enormous worker dislocation in the labor market.  Although compensation growth remains weak,  muted productivity growth pushes core PCE inflation higher in 2011  and 2012.  My outlook also assumes that inflation expectations will remain  'anchored'  near current  levels  of roughly 2%. Considerable uncertainty surrounds this assumption.  In my view,  the incoming data indicating further core price deceleration (though not deflation) outweighs inflationary risks posed by the level of excess reserves in the banking system.

With  respect  to  the  sovereign  debt  crisis  in  Southern  Europe,  my  outlook  assumes  that  Eurozone  policy makers will prevent the crisis from escalating-at least until the global recovery is more firmly rooted and is better  able to withstand the shockwaves of a wider event.  For the time,  effects of the crisis on my outlook are modest,  and result only from diminished export demand and a weaker euro.

Respondent  10:

The growth rate of final demand strengthens gradually, supported by accommodative monetary policy,  fur­ ther improvement in financial conditions (including easing access to bank credit), and a rebound on spending

on houses,  consumer durables,  and business capital equipment  from unsustainably low levels  as the expan­ sion  proceeds  and  confidence  strengthens. Expansion is held back,  especially in  the  next  few  quarters,  by still-tight  credit  for  some  borrowers;  the  concerns  about  risk  manifest  in  the  rise  in  the  dollar  and  decline in  equity  prices;  and  by  caution  and  uncertainty  resulting  from  the  recent  events  and  the  still-uncertain regulatory response to the crisis and the broader governmental response to an unsustainable fiscal path.

Respondent  11:

The  ongoing  expansion  in  real  activity  has  been,  so  far,  broadly  in  line  with  expectations. The  modest improvement in labor markets has been accompanied by some increase in private sources of personal income. Nevertheless,  private personal  income remains well  below pre-recession levels,  and  a transition  from public to  privately  generated  sources  of income  of sufficient  magnitude  to  sustain  a  moderate  pace  of growth  in private  consumption  expenditures  has  yet  to  take  place. In  this  regard,  the  large  amount  of slack  in  la­ bor  markets  is  putting  significant  downward  pressure  on  wages. Firms  so  far  have  been  reluctant  to  hire, focussing  instead  on  efficiency gains.  While  it  is  likely that  there  is  now  considerable  pent-up  demand  for labor,  it  may  take  time  before  firms  become  more  confident  about  the  durability  of the  recovery  and  in­ crease  the  pace  of hiring. Concerns  about  the  outlook  for  the  global  recovery  as  a  result  of the  European fiscal  crisis  are  adding  to  an  already  uncertain  environment,  and  possibly delaying  firms'   hiring  decisions. In  sum,  the  waning  fiscal  stimulus  and  limited  increases  in  private  sources  of income,  together  with  the recent  unfavorable  developments  in  households  net  worth  and  the  possibility  that  taxes  will  increase  for some  households  in  2011,  are  likely  restrain  the  growth  of consumer  spending  over  the  forecast  horizon. Housing activity,  too,  is  projected to  contribute  only modestly to the  recovery. The homebuyer tax credit has  provided  a  temporary  stimulus  to  the  sector,  but  limited  credit  availability  and  still  falling  housing prices imply that the sector will improve only slowly.  As concerns firms,  the recent dollar appreciation and slower  projected  foreign  growth  will  moderate  the  pace  of growth  in  exports. Heightened  concerns  about the global economy may lead some firms to reduce their capital spending plans.  Overall,  the upturn in pri­ vate demand this year and next is projected to be muted,  and government spending will be constrained by state and local's fiscal conditions.  With economic activity projected to grow only modestly above potential, the unemployment rate gap is still  very large by the end of next  year.  Given the projected sizable slack in labor markets over the forecast horizon, the rate of core inflation remains well below target in 2011 and 2012.

The risks  to the  forecast  are  again  tilted to the  downside. Moreover,  these  downside  risks  are  much  more costly than  the  potential  upside. Doubts  persists  about  the  political  will  to  make  the  necessary fiscal  ad­ justment in some European countries.  These concerns raise the possibility of adverse financial events with significant  global  repercussions. In  addition,  the  risks  to  inflation  continue  to  be  to  the  downside. The possibility of deflation over the forecast horizon is,  at this point,  more than a tail event.

Respondent  12:

Key  factors  include  expectation  that  recovery  will,  in  the  absence  of significant  external  shock,  make  the shift  from reliance on stimulus  and inventory rebuilding to a more self-sustaining increase in final demand. However,  the  continued  drag  from  commercial  real  estate,  the  uneven,  nature  of housing  market  recovery, continuing high levels of unemployment,  and renewed uncertainty about global financial stress will prevent the recovery from accelerating beyond a moderate pace.

Respondent  13:

The incoming data, as summarized by aggregate statistics such as the CFNAI, are consistent with the near­ term projection  for  moderate  growth.  Even  with  the  recent  increases in risk spreads  and  liquidity premia, credit  market  conditions  are  still  favorable  for  growth;  accommodative  monetary policy  and  some  contin­ ued,  albeit  diminishing,  fiscal  stimulus  also support  growth.  Over time,  increasing household  and business confidence should  add  momentum to the recovery.  Nonetheless,  relative  to the  depth  of the  recession,  the recovery will be moderate by historical standards, reflecting the degree of repair still needed on financial and nonfinancial balance sheets and the persistent effects on labor markets of depreciated worker skills.  Contin­ ued sluggishness in labor markets  and some less robust consumption and housing data have moderated our

outlook for growth in household spending a bit.  But we do not see this as a signal of a fundamental change in households'  perceptions of their spending capacity from permanent income or wealth.

Respondent  14:

European uncertainties are creating volatility in US financial markets.  Nonetheless,  large corporations have ready access  to  outside  sources  of finance. Bank lending does  remain  stressed  by  asset  quality  issues  and tremendous uncertainty about regulations.  The bank lending problems create problems in credit  access for small business,  which in turn hamper job growth.  Inflation risks are high because of the US fiscal situation and huge uncertainties in the level of potential output.

Respondent  15:

I  believe  that  the  pace  of expansion  will  be  moderate,  led  by  consumer  spending  and  business  equipment investment;  residential  construction  and  state  and  local  spending  are  likely to  remain  very weak  for  some time; and nonresidential construction is likely to decline further this year.  The stock of federal debt will grow much more rapidly than GDP under current legislation, leading to uncertainty on the nature and timing of fiscal  policy actions what would put  the stock of debt  on  a more sustainable path.  That  uncertainty could make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans.

Respondent  16:

Labor  markets  are  improving  slowly  and  a  moderate  recovery  in  economic  activity  is  in  train. Financial conditions,  which  had  been  improving,  have  weakened  in  the  past  two  months  reflecting  developments  in Europe.  Financial intermediation remains impaired,  which will hold back the pace of recovery.  In addition, households  are  repairing  balance  sheets  that  have  been  weakened  by  equity  and  housing  losses  and  debt accumulation.  Fiscal  and monetary stimulus provide key drivers for recovery this year.  Significant slack in labor  and goods markets will keep inflation low,  but well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid much further disinflation.

Respondent  17:

Recent data releases have continued to point  to a broadening and sustainable recovery.  Growth in the first half has been supported, in part, by fiscal stimulus and inventory adjustments.  However, recent data suggest the  transition  to self-sustaining growth  is  underway.  Readings  on  consumer  spending have  been solid,  and measures of business activity have been even stronger.  And while the recent labor market report was weaker than expected,  the  labor  market  continues  its  improving  trend. The  recent  readings  on  construction  have been mixed, but fundamentals in the sector remain weak.

With  the  economy  recovering  only  gradually,  I  expect  core  inflation  to  remain  at  low  levels  in  the  near term but to eventually drift higher.  At this point,  the disinflationary pressure on consumer prices from the weakness in the economy is  mitigated by stable long-term inflation expectations.  Over time,  inflation  will naturally gravitate toward long-term expectations.

Important risks remain.  Problems in commercial real estate continue to pose downside risks to GDP growth. In  addition,  fiscal  policy-here  and  abroad-poses  a downside  risk to the  outlook.  Earlier  in the  year,  ques­ tions  about  the  expiration  of the  Bush  tax cuts  and indexation of the  AMT  led to greater  overall  risks  to the  outlook. While these  questions  remain,  greater  concern  about  fiscal  sustainability suggests  that  fiscal policy is more likely to be tighter than easier.  Finally,  while the European sovereign debt crisis poses some downside risk to the outlook, I believe the risk is relatively small and likely to remain contained.  However, I would also argue that the resiliency of the U.S.  economy and traditional business cycle dynamics-especially following a deep recession-pose upside risks in the medium run.  In addition, if monetary policy remains too accommodative for too long,  there is  a risk that growth will be stronger than expected and sustainable.

As to inflation,  in the near term,  the weakness of the economy and recent  price trends pose some downside risks  to  core  and  overall  inflation. However,  in  the  medium  or  long  term,  the  expansion  of  our  balance

sheet  and increased concerns about  federal borrowing and fiscal sustainability create  a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations,  and therefore create upside risks to inflation.  In addition,  there is a risk that monetary policy will remain too accommodative for too long, creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  1:

N/A

Respondent  2:

My forecast  for  GDP  growth remains noticeably below the  Tealbook baseline for 2012,  whereas the unem­ ployment rate trajectory is broadly similar-  implying differences in labor productivity assumptions.

Respondent  3:

My inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy and so I project a higher pace of inflation over 2010-2012 than does the Tealbook.  Given the strength of economic growth in my baseline forecast  and the higher inflation path,  the policy path is  less  accommodative over the  forecast horizon.

Respondent 4:

We  assume lower inflation  persistence  than  does  the  TB.  Thus,  for  our  medium-term inflation  outlook  we project inflation within the  'mandate-consistent'  range in late 2011  under the assumption of well  anchored inflation expectations.

Respondent  5:

N/A

Respondent  6:

Compared to the 70% confidence intervals indicated for the Tealbook forecasts, the differences between the point  estimates  in  the  Tealbook  baseline  forecasts  and  my  forecasts  are  not  different  in  any  meaningful statistical  sense. However the time  path of my projections does differ  from the  Tealbook baseline,  in  that I  see  stronger  near-term growth than that  in the  Tealbook baseline  in  2010,  stronger real growth than  the Tealbook in 2011,  slower real  growth that  the  Tealbook in  2012  and real  growth subsequently tapering off. In the long run I see real growth at  approximately the same rate  as the long-horizon growth of 'potential' indicated in the Tealbook.  I see inflation higher in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent with appropriate monetary policy.  In contrast, the Tealbook forecast sees low inflation persisting for  'an extended period'.

Respondent  7:

The  Tealbook baseline  forecast  underestimates  the  drag  on  the  labor  market  arising  from  the  uncertainty created  by new economic  and regulatory initiatives.  It  smooths  through the inventory swing,  understating its implications for output growth in the second half.  It does not  adequately take into account inducements deriving from regulatory and taxation initiatives for corporations and investors to invest in more promising markets abroad at the expense of job creation and CAPEX at home.

Respondent  8:

Similar to the Greenbook.

Respondent  9:

My growth forecast is broadly consistent with the Greenbook forecast in 2010 and 2011,  but calls for weaker growth in 2012 due to slower growth in structural productivity.  Despite weaker growth,  my outlook entails more core PCE inflation in 2011  and 2012 stemming from the weaker productivity growth.  My assumption of stable inflation expectations (at roughly 2%) reinforces the productivity effect and helps draw the inflation rate upward as the economy recovers.

Respondent  10:

slightly stronger growth over the near term as I didn' t take as much off for European related effects.  A little weaker in the out years as I  assumed a shallower slope to the rise in equity prices and decline in the dollar. also  slightly  stronger  productivity  growth  means  that  the  unemployment  rate  is  similar  despite  stronger GDP.

Respondent  11:

The forecast  for real activity is somewhat more pessimistic than the  Greenbook forecast,  reflecting a larger estimated  impact  of deteriorating  global  financial  conditions  on  the  U.S.  economy. Core  inflation  is  pro­ jected  to be  lower than  in  the  Greenbook,  as  a result  of a more  meaningful  tradeoff between  inflation  and unemployment.

Respondent  12:

I  continue to be  somewhat  more pessimistic on job creation (though the latest  staff projections have  come a bit closer to my views) and somewhat less confident in the projected path of energy prices

Respondent  13:

We have revised down less than the Greenbook has in response to international developments and concomi­ tant movements in domestic financial conditions.  We continue to believe that anchored inflation expectations will retard disinflationary forces more than the Greenbook does.

Respondent  14:

The Tealbook considerably overstates the trade impact of a European crisis.

Respondent  15:

I  believe  that  under  an  appropriate  monetary  policy  the  public' s  inflation  expectations  would  be  well  an­ chored,  and the inflation path would be higher than in the Tealbook.  An appropriate monetary policy would put policy rates on an upward trajectory well before the summer of 2012.

Respondent  16:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent  17:

The key difference is the monetary policy path, which leads to some differences in the outlook.  My forecast for  real  GDP is similar to Tealbook in 2010  and 2011,  but lower in 2012.

My outlook  for  inflation  also  differs  from  Tealbook' s. I  expect  overall  and  core  inflation  to  move  toward long-term expectations  faster than it  does in the  Tealbook projection,  reflecting differences in our views of the relative importance of inflation expectations and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

4(d).  P lease  describe  th e   key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to   change  since  th e previous  q u a rte r's  p ro jectio n s.

Respondent  1:

N/A

Respondent  2:

My forecast for real activity in 2010 has been revised slightly higher in response to incoming data that have been a bit stronger on balance than I had anticipated.

Respondent  3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

The  changes  in  our  modal  forecast  are  minor  since  April. We  have  shaved  0.1-0.2pp  off our  2011-2  core PCE  forecast. The  main  factor  here  was  that  although  core  PCE  is  coming  in  very close  to  our  forecast, this is mainly due to the non-market components.  The market-based core PCE and CPI have been running slightly below our forecasts and the appreciation of the dollar was unexpected.  We also lowered the near-term growth projection slightly due to the developments that have already taken place as a result of problems in peripheral Europe.

The  largest  change  to  our  outlook  is  in  the  risks. The  concerns  about  peripheral  Europe  were  transmit­ ted to US financial markets in the inter-meeting period.  Given the weakness of the direct trade transmission we viewed the market response as placing additional weight on bad tail outcomes.  We view one possible bad tail  as  a deflationary outcome hence we have substantially increased the risk of deflation in the US over the projection period.

Respondent  5:

Concerns about European economies manifested themselves in financial markets.

Respondent  6:

With  the  downward  revision  in  the  estimated  real  growth  for  2010  Q1,  activity  in  the  first  half  of  2010 appears to be slightly slower than I previously expected.  Hence I have revised my forecast  for the first half of 2010 and for the full year down slightly.  I have not revised my projected path of real output for 2011  and beyond.  At this point  I do not expect  that financial stress caused by fiscal problems in Europe will have  a negative  significant  impact  on  U.S.  growth. Indeed,  lower  interest  rates  generated  by  a  'flight  to  quality' may even have positive effects  for the U.S.  My forecasts  for  the  unemployment  rate  are unchanged,  as  are my inflation forecasts  (headline and  Core  PCE)  for 2011  and beyond.  I have lowered my headline inflation forecasts for  2010 somewhat to reflect the observed volatility in energy prices,  though I have not revised by core inflation forecast.

Respondent  7:

Key factors include  the  lack of any evidence  of an  acceleration  in  final demand,  indications that  inventory reductions are nearing an end, ongoing declines in trimmed-mean inflation, and recent weakness in commod­ ity prices.  Also, the impact of the Euro crisis on net exports and financial risk premia,  and continued, if not increased,  business uncertainty have tempered the prospects for a strong recovery,  and are acting to contain price pressures.

Respondent  8:

Developments in Europe and their effects on financial markets and the dollar are the main change.  Incoming data  are  consistent  with  the  moderate  growth  scenario  but  perhaps  slightly  weaker  than  expected  (retail

sales,  labor markets,  housing).   Europe presents downside tail risks to output though I expect them to mud­ dle through.

Respondent  9:

Real GDP growth is essentially unchanged,  but  the unemployment  rate  path was pushed modestly higher in  response  to  an  unexpected  upward  movement  in  the  April  unemployment  rate. My inflation  forecast has been marked down in response to softer-than-expected inflation data and a downward revision to labor compensation.

Respondent  10:

Although incoming data have been consistent with my previous  forecast,  the tightening of financial  condi­ tions lad to a slight mark down of activity growth rates.  With respect to inflation,  the strengthening of the dollar and drop in energy and other commodity prices led to slower projected inflation.

Respondent  11:

While the pace of activity during the first half of this year is in line with previous expectations, going forward the  forecast  for  real  GDP growth  has  been  revised down.  This  downward revision reflects  lower  projected households net worth,  a higher value of the dollar,  a slower pace of growth in global demand,  and increased uncertainty.

Respondent  12:

Failure of job creation to accelerate in line with projections,  wealth declines and renewed uncertainty owing the European sovereign debt situation caused me to adjust my growth projections down and unemployment projections up.

Respondent  13:

Our revisions largely reflect  netting the lower path  for policy and longer-run low-risk interest  rates  against the lower stock market,  stronger dollar,  and assumed weaker path for foreign growth.

Respondent  14:

My forecast has not changed greatly.  However,  the uncertainty about my forecast has gone up greatly.

Respondent  15:

My assessment  of likely GDP growth  for  the  next  decade  is  lower,  due  to  slowing  labor  force  growth  and less  contribution  of labor  composition  to  multifactor  productivity  growth. The  short-term  GDP  forecast is  also  lower,  reflecting  recent  data  and  the  change  to  the  longer-run  trend. My estimate  of the  long-run unemployment rate is slightly higher.  Inflation this year and next is lower in the current  forecast,  reflecting recent  aggregate inflation data and gasoline price movements.

Respondent  16:

Since  April,  financial  conditions  have  deteriorated overall. In particular,  equity values  have  fallen  and  the dollar has appreciated against foreign currencies.  These developments are only partially offset by the decline in Treasury yields and mortgage rates.  I lowered my forecast for real GDP growth in the second half of 2010 and in 2011  by about  1/4  and  1/2  percentage  point,  respectively.  In response  to the  lower  projected path for real GDP and recent higher-than-expected readings of the unemployment rate, I raised my medium-term forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate. The  stronger  dollar  and  the  greater  degree  of economic  slack  in  my forecast caused me to lower my medium-term inflation forecast a touch.

Respondent  17:

My forecast is essentially unchanged from my previous forecast.
