Note: Projections  of  change  in  real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  from  the  fourth  quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE  inflation and core PCE  inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index  for personal consumption expenditures (PCE)  and the price index  for PCE excluding food  and energy. Projections  for the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  December projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  17-18,  2013.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

No  comment

Respondent 4: We anticipate a quicker  convergence  - real GDP will  converge to its long  run value in 2017, the unemployment  rate in  2017, and PCE inflation in  2016. As part of this process, we anticipate that inflation will temporarily  overshoot  the  FOMC's  2  percent  target  and  that  the  unemployment rate  will reach  levels  below  its  natural  rate.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: Convergence  to  the  longer-run  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  occur in three years. Convergence  to  the  longer-run  rate  of  inflation  rate  is  slower,  and  should  take  roughly five years.

Respondent 8: Our assessment of the  economy's potential growth rate  remains  within the 2% to 2 1 2 / %  range,  with  a  point  estimate  of  about  2 1 4 / %  (rounded  to  2.3%  above). Our  interpretation  of the recent literature and  some  additional  in-house  analysis  indicates  that  a  reasonable  range  for an estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  is  4 1 2 / % to 6%,  with a point estimate of about 5 1 4 / % (rounded  to  5.3%  above). Assuming  appropriate  policy  and  no  further  significant  shocks,  we  expect the unemployment  rate  to  reach  its longer-run  level and the output  gap to be fairly small in early 2016. However,  our  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  suggests  there  is  a  significant  probability  that the  unemployment  rate  could  fall  modestly  below  5 1 4 / %  for  a  period  within  the  5-6  year  timeframe.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about  2.5%  for  the  CPI  based  on  the  longer-term  average  of  the  difference  between  CPI  and  PCE inflation). Under  these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to shrink over the coming years,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2016.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  2016.

Respondent 9: I expect  inflation  to  reach  its  mandate-consistent  level  as  early  as  2015,  and  output and employment to reach  or exceed their respective long-run sustainable paths before the end of  2016. It is likely to prove  challenging,  at  that  point,  to  prevent  the  economy  from  overshooting  the  desired equilibrium.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: The  convergence process  may  be somewhat shorter than  5-6 years

Respondent 12: I anticipate  that  convergence  will  take  less  than  5 years. Except  for  the federal funds  rate,  the  December  SEP  shows  we  are  near  equilibrium  in  2016. Given  my  view  of  appropriate policy, I would  expect  the  federal  funds  rate will be near its longer run value by the second  half of 2017.

Respondent 13: Shorter  than  five  years  under  appropriate  policy.

The fall in labor force participation and the low inflation rate have led me to a slightly lower estimate  of  the  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: At  this point, uncertainty  looks  to  be  broadly  similar  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20 years. The  weather  has  increased  uncertainty-in  that  we  might  be  blaming  it  for  what  is  ultimately broad-based  softness,  or  it  might  be  masking  stronger  underlying  momentum  in  the  economy-but  not in a dramatic  fashion.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: No  comments.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: Real GDP is likely to grow  more slowly than it has in previous cyclical  expansions, more  in line with  growth  in  the last few years. I do not believe that fluctuations  in growth  around this  lower  trend  are  likely  to be  larger  than  in  the past. Inflation  expectations probably have become more  firmly  anchored  as  a  result  of  the  FOMC's  consensus  statements,  and  uncertainty  is  accordingly lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 6: Uncertainty about  my projection for  economic  activity is similar to its average level over the past 20 years. Of  course, that period  was characterized by  considerable turmoil, including the Great  Recession,  the  European  (and  earlier,  Asian)  financial  crises,  the  Iraq  war,  9/11,  the  dot.com boom  and  bust,  and  so  on.

Inflation is anchored by quite  stable inflation expectations. The  stability of these expectations has been reinforced by the release in 2012 of an explicit 2 percent objective for inflation. Hence, uncertainty  about  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Quantitative  judgment  based  on the width of the probability intervals from the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. These intervals have widened some from those at the time of the December SEP. Part of the  widening  reflects uncertainty  engendered from the possibility that weather effects  may  be  obscuring  the  true  underlying  state  of  the  U.S.  economy. The  probability  intervals  for the forecasts of these variables remain  wide  in part because  of  the still-extraordinary  economic  and financial  environment,  including  the  policy  rate  remaining  constrained  by  its  effective  lower  bound.

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11: It remains  the  case  that  the  effect  of  the  extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16: Because  the  experience  of  the  past  5  years  is now  such  a  large part of the comparison period, we,  like the Tealbook, think the uncertainty  over the GDP growth and  unemployment rate forecasts  are  broadly  similar  to  the  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years. If not  for those years,  we'd  say  the  level  of  uncertainty  was  higher  than  usual.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: I believe the risks to my projections are broadly balanced. The real economy faces a number  of downside  risks, including ongoing  fiscal challenges, geopolitical events, potential slowdowns  in  key  foreign  economies,  and  the  possibility  that  financial  markets  and  housing  markets may  respond adversely to the eventual normalization of interest rates. But the economy  has also shown  considerable  resilience during this recovery. As fiscal drag eases, the housing  recovery  picks up steam,  and  the  labor  market  improves,  upside  surprises  are  certainly  plausible. The  risks to my inflation  outlook  also  appear  to  be  broadly  balanced. A  continuation  of  the  recent  low  readings  would push inflation below my  forecast, but I already expect that it will take some  time for inflation to return  to our 2 percent  longer-run  objective; similarly, a slowdown  in key  emerging  market  trading partners  could weigh  on commodity  prices  and  goods  import  prices. Alternatively, faster economic growth  or  an  unanchoring  of  inflation  expectations  from  our  large  balance  sheet  pose  upside  risks  to the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 2: The  risks to the U.S. economy  taken  on its own  seem  to me to remain  broadly balanced. However,  the  external  risks  -  from  both  economic  and  geopolitical  sources  -  have  tuned  to the  downside  since  December

Respondent 3: I see the possibility  that labor  market  slack  is greater  than  what  I  assume  in  my baseline,  slowing  the  return  of  inflation  to  2%.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Risks to economic  activity  appear  balanced. The  economy  has  so  far weathered the  run-up  since  last  spring  in  mortgage  and  other  interest  rates. In addition,  as  headwinds  continue to abate, upside scenarios involving  a virtuous cycle of  economic  activity  become  more plausible.

The  zero lower bound does somewhat  constrain our ability  to respond  to adverse shocks. However, this constraint has become  less of  an issue over  time, in  light of the effectiveness of  forward guidance and  LSAPs. As  a result, I do  not  view  the  zero  lower  bound  as  a  quantitatively  significant  source  of downside  skew  at  this  point.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection  and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced, as has been the  case in the previous six SEPs. As was  the  case  in  December,  the  risks  to  the  real  activity  outlook  are  roughly  balanced  over  near-term horizons,  as  indicated  in  the  summary  of  our  judgment;  however,  at  the  longer  horizons  of  the  SEP, the risks are still modestly  skewed  to  the  downside. In part, the balanced  risks  reflect  two  opposing interpretations  of  the  recent  data. On  the  one  hand,  some  of  the  recent  data  have  held  up  relatively well  taking  into  account  various  estimates  of  the  weather  effects,  which  would  imply  that  the  economy

may  have  greater  underlying  strength  than  our  current  assessment. On  the  other  hand,  it  is  possible that we and  most forecasters are  attributing  too much of the weakness in the recent data to transitory factors  (including  the  weather),  and  that  the  underlying  strength  of  the  economy  is  less  than  in  our central assessment. In addition, the intermittent fluctuations in financial and commodity  markets, partly  attributable to EME developments and the Ukraine situation,  could be a sign of significant risks to the  U.S.  economy. Other  concerns include the low inflation data in  many parts of the world, which could  leave  the  U.S.  and  world  economy  more  susceptible  to  negative  shocks,  and  the  constraints  that monetary  policy  faces  under  the  zero  lower  bound.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: I remained concerned about our ability to respond effectively to a decline in inflation  or  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 14: Although I see the distribution of shocks to aggregate demand  as reasonably balanced,  I  still  view  the  balance  of  risks  to  GDP  growth  as  somewhat  weighted  to  the  downside  due to the  constraints that  limit the ability  of  monetary policy to offset negative shocks to demand  at the zero  lower  bound. I see the  risks  to unemployment  as  balanced,  with  the  risk  of  high  unemployment, due to the constraints imposed  by the zero lower bound, offset by the risk that productivity may continue to grow  more slowly than anticipated, as it has done over the past few years. For some  time now,  inflation  has  been  running  below  the  level  I  had  anticipated. While  I  expect  some  of  the  factors that have held inflation down to be transitory, low inflation may prove  more persistent, creating  risks to inflation  I consider  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: We  think  the  risks  to  the  forecasts  for  growth  and  unemployment  are  roughly  in balance. The  bad  winter  weather  makes  it  more  difficult  to  read  the  incoming  data,  but  we  do  not  see this  as  tilting  the  risks  to  the  outlook  in  one  way  or  the  other. More  fundamenatlly,  on  the  downside, we still have  not seen the steady, consistent  job growth  that  would  make  us  more  comfortable  with our projected  acceleration  in consumer  spending. We  also have been  surprised  a bit by  the degree to which  the increase in long-term  interest rates has weighed  on housing markets. It also appears that  many  households  are  still  shut  out  of  credit  markets. On  the  up  side,  improved  household  sector fundamentals-notably,  gains  in  wealth  and  lower  unemployment-bode  well  for  household  spending. The  downside  risks from weaker growth  abroad  have diminished  a bit (though  European  concerns have been replaced by EME  jitters) and the U.S. fiscal situation appears to be in better balance. Furthermore,  as  household  and  business  sentiment  seems  to  have  been  largely  unaffected  by  the  soft patch in the data, we  could be poised for an  earlier and  more pronounced 'virtuous cyclical' dynamic then we  are projecting.

We continue to see downside risks to the inflation outlook predominating over the projection period. We  don't see any obvious forces pushing inflation much  higher in the near term: Neither

the data  nor  our  business  contacts  suggest  any  meaningful  cost  pressures,  demand  still  is  not  strong enough for firms to increase  margins, and there are no inflationary pressures  coming from abroad. Our projection  of inflation picking  up  steadily  over the projection  period  depends  heavily  on  an  upward pull  on prices  from  inflation  expectations  and  credible FOMC  communications  about  its  commitment to a symmetric  2  percent  inflation target. For some  time  we have noted  the risk that this upward force  may  not  be  as  strong  as  we  have  assumed.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: In my current outlook, low inflationary pressures will justify delaying the first increase  in the federal funds  rate  target  until the second  quarter  of  2015. By  that  point, the unemployment  rate  will have declined further and  be near my  estimate  of its long-run  natural  rate, and my  projection for inflation between  one and two years ahead will have increased to our 2 percent longer-run  objective. Consistent  with  our  current  guidance,  once  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate target  occurs,  I  also  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  to  raise  the  funds  rate  gradually.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: My  outlook  has liftoff for the federal funds rate in December  2015  and  25  basis point  increases  at  each  meeting  in  2016.

Respondent 4: We  marked  down  our  GDP  growth  forecast  for  2014  due  to  weaker  data  over  the winter  months. This  caused us to move our date of  lift-off  to Q1/2015 from Q4/2014.

Respondent 5: I believe that in March  2015  labor  markets  will  have  improved  significantly, and inflation  will be above 1.5 percent and increasing. Accordingly, I believe we  will want to begin raising the  funds  rate  to  keep  inflation  from  rising  too  rapidly.

Respondent 6: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  remain  large  and  persistent,  and  my  outlook  for inflation over the medium  term  is persistently below our 2 percent objective. This situation calls for very accommodative monetary policy. Even with continuing LSAPs, appropriate policy calls for delaying liftoff from the zero lower bound until the third quarter of 2015. My judgment on appropriate  policy  is informed  by  looking  at simple rules that adjust for the zero lower bound  and by my  expectations  of, and uncertainty  about, the costs and benefits  of continuing  unconventional actions.

Respondent 7: Liftoff  of  the  federal  funds rate  from  the  zero-lower-bound  is  expected  to occur  late in 2015,  once  the  unemployment  rate  drops  below  6  percent. With  inflation  well  below  target  and  a relatively  modest  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  GDP  growth,  monetary  policy  can  afford  to  be  patient in the  process  of  removing  accomodation.

Respondent 8: The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path  for monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance  of  risks  around  the  central  outlook. Overall,  even  though  the  uncertainty  is  somewhat  greater than in December, there have not been  any  significant  changes in these three dimensions, which points to no significant  changes  in  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  policy  path. Furthermore,  we  believe that the accommodative  policy  stance of the major advanced  economy  central banks has been an important  factor  behind  the  extent  of  improvement  in  U.S.  and  global  economic  data  over  the  past year. Finally,  even  though  our  risk  assessments  for  real  activity  and  inflation  are  again  balanced,  the downside risks to both real  activity  and inflation probably are  more  costly in the current  environment.

In these circumstances  and noting that the economic  developments  since September  2012  have been in rough  accord  with our projection at that  time (when we had proposed the introduction of an outcome-based purchase program and policy stance), we see appropriate  monetary policy as remaining accommodative  to  strengthen the economic  expansion. Under  this policy, it will be the economic outcomes  and  outlook  that  will  dictate the path  of the policy stance, a point that should  be made clear  to the  public. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  anticipate  that  the  target  FFR  will  remain  near zero  until mid-2015. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over  this period. The  pace  of  renormalization  of  the  target  FFR  following  the  period  of  near  zero  policy  rates will then  depend  upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions  and  the  outlook,  longer-term  inflation expectations,  and  overall financial  conditions. At this point, we  expect that the increase in the FFR will be gradual such that it  will still be below our estimate of its longer-run level at the end of  2016, as a commitment  to  remain  'low  for  long'  is  important  for  providing  accommodation  at  this  time  when the  FFR  is  constrained  by  the  zero  lower  bound.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate  is  in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0  - 5.0%. Given the behavior of nominal and  real Treasury yields and productivity growth  since  the  end  of  the  recession,  we  currently  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to be in the lower  half  of the indicated  range,  which  results  in  the  point  estimate  given  in  the  response to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  our  assessment  of  economic  and  financial  conditions,  our judgement of the current 'neutral' FFR is below our estimate of the  longer-run FFR  and is expected to remain so for some  time.

Although we do not expect that additional tools  will need to be implemented to provide  accommodation in  our  modal  outlook, we believe it is still important  for the FOMC to be prepared to  employ all of its tools  in case  some  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  are  realized.

Respondent 9: The  most  important  thing  we  can now do,  to promote a healthy  economic recovery, is to clarify our post-liftoff policy reaction  function. This  reaction  function  is not well conveyed  by the funds-rate path implied by  the modal  economic scenario, or by  threshold-based forward guidance.

For purposes of this  exercise, I  rely heavily  on the prescriptions of the  1999 Taylor rule  with inertia, as that rule seems  to perform  reasonably  well  in a wide  range  of circumstances. In calculating the rule-prescribed  funds  rate,  I  assume  that  liftoff  is  delayed  until  2015,  after  the  current  asset-purchase program  ends.

Respondent 10: Under  the  modal  forecast  for  the  evolution  of  the  economy, I  assume  that  the  asset purchase  program  wraps  up  in October  2014, and that per our guidance  regarding 'a  considerable time  after the asset purchase  program  ends'  we  lift  off in either March  or  June  of  2015. From  that point  forward,  I  have  in  mind  that  we  raise  the  funds  rate  only  gradually. As  a  practical  matter,  this is likely to translate  into  a  25  basis  point  increase  every  other  meeting,  or  100  basis  points  per  year.

Respondent 11: I expect  the asset purchase  program  to  end  in  2014Q3  and  the  Committee  will need  to  start  raising  the  funds  rate  in  2014Q4  as  the  economy  continues  to  strengthen. The  economy returns to steady  state by the end of  2015,  with inflation returning  to 2 percent, growth at 2.4 percent, and  the  unemployment  rate  at  5.8  percent. My  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over the  forecast  horizon  to  reach  its  long-run  level  of  4  percent  by  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 12: Key  factors  informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy are achieving  an inflation objective of 2.0 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that reduces unemployment. Once we begin to raise the funds rate, I believe we  can be gradual-raising

the  funds  rate  by  25  bps  per  meeting. I also  believe  we  should  continue  reducing  our  asset  purchases by  $10  billion  per  meeting.

Respondent 13: Under  appropriate  monetary  policy, the FOMC  should  keep  the  fed  funds  rate extraordinarily  low  until  we  are  near  full  employment,  as  long  as  the  medium-term  outlook  for  inflation remains  below  2%.

Respondent 14: My  path  for the federal funds rate, both before and after liftoff from the zero bound, is shaped by  my  expectation that the headwinds that have been  holding back  recovery  since the  financial  crisis  will  continue  to  exert  a  restraining,  albeit  abating,  influence  on  aggregate  demand for several years to  come. In addition, inflation is running  well below our 2% longer-run objective. To promote  the  attainment  of  our  maximum  employment  and price  stability  objectives  over  the  medium term  I  see  it as necessary  to  pursue  a  highly  accommodative  policy  throughout  the  forecast  period. I would assess the equilibrium real funds rate at present and  over the  forecast to be substantially below my  estimate  of  its  longer  run  normal  level  of  around 1.5%. This  reflects  factors  such  as  abnormally  tight fiscal policy, lingering  credit  effects from  the  financial  crisis, and  business  and  household  pessimism. My  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  level  of  the  nominal  (and  real)  federal  funds  rate  of  3.5%  (and 1.5%)  are  consistent  with  estimates  from  the  staff's  three  factor  model. This  estimate  likely  reflects some pessimism about the prospects for longer-run growth, consistent, for example, with current Laubach-Williams  estimates  of  trend  GDP  growth.

Respondent 15: I forecast  that  the  federal  funds  rate  will  rise  a  bit  more  slowly  than  the  Baseline forecast.

Respondent 16: Our forecast assumes that we  will steadily reduce the pace of asset purchases,  with the program being completed this  fall. With regard to forward guidance, we believe it is appropriate for the  Committee's policy statement to maintain the current 6-1/2 percent  unemployment  rate threshold and language about the probable path for rates after that threshold is crossed until the time the unemployment  rate  actually  reaches  6-1/2 percent. Once  the  threshold  is  crossed,  we  assume  forward guidance  will  be  modified  in  a  way  that  does  not  change  market  perceptions  regarding  the  FOMC's commitment to highly  accommodative policy and  a symmetric 2 percent inflation target. Our preferred way  of doing  so is for the guidance  to  be  clear that, as long as the one- to  two-year-ahead  inflation outlook was below 2 percent, we would delay  liftoff until  labor  markets have regained their full health as measured  by  a  broad  array  of  indicators.

In our  forecast,  the  unemployment  rate  reaches  6-1/2  percent  in  the  second  half  of  2014-close  to the time  when  asset  purchases  are  completed. However,  for  quite  a  considerable  time  after  that,  we expect  inflation  to  exhibit  only  modest  upward  momentum. Accordingly,  policy  can  afford  to  remain on hold. Our  baseline  assumption  is  that  the  pre-conditions  for  funds  rate  lift-off  will  not be firmly in place  until  sometime  in  early  2016.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

As in the Tealbook,  we  expect  the  pace of purchases  to be reduced  in measured  steps, and  for the purchase  program  to  conclude  before  the  end  of  the  year. We  anticipate  the  cumulative  amount  of purchases  to  be around  $1.5  trillion, close to that of the Tealbook. We  would  note  that  within  our overall strategy for appropriate  monetary policy, we believe that a  continued  collective emphasis on an accommodative  stance  based  on  a portfolio of tools would  enhance  the efficacy of policy under current  circumstances.

Respondent 9: No

I would have liked the asset-purchase program end  sooner than is  called for in the Tealbook, but I  am willing to see purchases  wind down  at  the  current pace  provided  longer-term  inflation  expectations remain  well  anchored  and  signs  of  financial  excess  do  not  markedly  increase.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Adverse  weather  has  weighed  down  economic  activity  to  start  2014,  but  a  return to more  typical  weather  patterns  should  help  the  economy  to  pick  up  the  pace  of  growth. Economic fundamentals  remain  encouraging: monetary  policy  is  highly accommodative,  fiscal  drag  is  waning, household balance sheets are strengthening, labor markets continue to improve, and most of the countries affected by the euro zone crisis are gradually returning to growth. Barring a set-back, I continue to be  cautiously optimistic that the  economy is poised for moderately stronger growth in the years  ahead  compared  with  what  we  have  experienced  over  the  last  few  years.

Recent inflation readings have continued to be subdued. A number  of energy and agricultural commodity  prices have been rising of late, but the persistence of these increases is uncertain so I anticipate  limited  pass-through  to  broad  consumer  prices. Reflecting  inflationary  momentum,  I  have modestly  pushed  out the point at which inflation starts to turn up in my  outlook. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and  an  improving  economy  should  help  pull  inflation  up  toward  the  2  percent long-run objective over the next  few years.

As  I discussed  above,  I  view  overall  uncertainty  as  roughly  comparable  to  historical  norms  of  the last 20 years. Risks to my  outlook appear  to be broadly balanced for both the real  economy  and inflation.

Respondent 2: I have lowered by  a  few  tenths of a percentage point  my projection  for GDP growth in 2014. Otherwise  I have made  only  modest  changes  to  my  projections. However,  even  assuming (as I do) that some  of the disappointing  data  of the last few months  reflects something  more  than distortions caused by bad weather, my expectation is for a somewhat  reduced pace of growth in the next few quarters  rather than  a basic change  in the pattern  of continued  moderate  recovery  as household  deleveraging  continues  (slowly)  and  as fiscal contraction  loosens. I look for an uptick in growth  later this year and  into next as consumer  spending  becomes  more  supported  by  cumulative increases  in  income  owing  to  steady  job  creation  and,  eventually,  some  more  widespread  increases  in compensation. In contrast to December,  when  I  felt that the major  change  in  the outlook  was  the diminution in downside risks, the past three  months has seen the reemergence of significant  such  risks, especially  international  risks. The  case  for  a significant  slide in Chinese  growth  seems  stronger  than just a few months  ago  and, obviously, the situation in Ukraine holds  the potential  for geopolitical tensions  and  possible  military  conflict  that  could  lead  to  risk-off  behavior  around  the  world. There  is also  some  chance  of  disruption  in  energy  supplies  that  could  increase  headline  inflation.

Respondent 3: A  modest  acceleration  in  aggregate spending  occurs  in  2014  amid dissipating headwinds and ongoing policy accommodation. GDP  growth  rises somewhat  above  potential over the medium  term,  gradually  closing  the  'gap'  and  aiding  in  a  further  firming  up  in  labor  markets.

My  outlook  calls  for  a  strengthening  in  consumer  spending  as  disposable  income  grows  at  a  more robust  pace,  and  household  balance  sheets  continue  to  improve  amid  gradually  improving  credit  conditions. Also, a combination  of  high profit levels, liquid corporate  balance  sheets, and low interest rates  promote  a  stronger  capital  expansion.

Headwinds in the  form of fiscal drag and  uncertainty, and  spillovers from abroad dissipate gradually throughout the  forecast horizon. Absent these restraints  on spending  and investment, the pace of the expansion  improves.

As the growth trajectory firms through the medium  term and  excess slack is reduced, downward pressure on wages and prices will lessen, allowing anchored inflation expectations to pull inflation toward  the  explicit  objective.

I see the  risks to the  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. I view  much  of  the  recent  weakness  in the incoming data  as weather-related, but given the recent history of  'false-starts,' I  am  concerned that weakness is more fundamental and less transitory. Risks related to structural imbalances in many  emerging  market  economies  and  geo-political  risks  emanating  from  Eastern  Europe  weigh  on my mind  as well. Balancing those downside risks, I also see the possibility that we are underestimating latent  economic  strength  that  has  been  restrained  by  significant  headwinds  and  idiosyncratic  shocks. Bolstered by improving  household balance sheets, rising wealth, and a firming in the employment trajectory,  consumer  demand grows at a rate greater than I  expect in my  baseline outlook.

With  the  current  inflation  trend  already  low  and  with  soft  wage  growth,  it  is  possible  that  I am underestimating  the  amount  of  slack  in  the  economy.

Respondent 4: We  marked  down  our  GDP  growth  forecast  for  2014  due  to  weaker  data  over  the winter  months.

Respondent 5: Population growth in the  16-64 age group  will only be 0.3 percent per year over the forecast period. Real GDP per employee has risen slightly less than 1 percent per year over the last 3 years. These  fundamentals  are  not  likely  to  change  dramatically,  although  employment  growth  could excede  population  growth  by  as  much  as  a  percentage  point,  and  productivity  growth  could  improve modestly. Thus  my  forecast  is  slightly  above  my  estimate  of  longer-run  real  GDP  growth.

Respondent 6: The  economy is still recovering from the severe housing collapse  and financial  crisis. Recoveries from these types of episodes  are  associated  with  sustained weakness in  aggregate demand through a variety of channels, which policy has  only partially offset. Many of the  associated headwinds are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  appears  poised  to  continue  its  recovery  despite  the  pickup  in  mortgage  rates  since  the middle  of  last  year  and  some  uneven  recent  data;
- · Consumer  balance  sheets  as  well  as  banking  and  credit  conditions  are  improving;
- · Fiscal  policy  has  been  a  notable  drag  on  the  economy,  but  that  drag  is  steadily  diminishing;
- · Though slowly  improving,  the weakness  of  the  global  economy  remains a  concern. In particular, Europe  is  still  a  source  of  downside  risk,  but  a  severe  crisis  looks  less  likely  over  time. Similarly, while the financial stress in many  emerging  markets  economies  (EMEs)  earlier this year has eased,  the  risk  of  financial  disruption  and  a  slowdown  in  EME  growth  remains  a  risk;
- · Policy uncertainty, relative to last year, is now back  to  more normal levels and  should be less of a headwind  going  forward.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us to continue  making  progress  on  closing output  and  unemployment  gaps  over  the  next  few years. Even  with substantial  monetary  stimulus, it  will  take a sustained period of above-trend growth to return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity  and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2  percent inflation target for the next few years. Well-anchored inflation  expectations  and diminishing  slack  eventually pull inflation back  to  our objective.

Respondent 7: The pace of  economic  activity in the second half of  2013 was somewhat stronger than what was  anticipated  at  the  time  of  the December projections. Recent data  releases, however, have been  relatively disappointing  and  indicate  that  the  acceleration  in the underlying  pace  of economic activity  is still modest. We  attribute  only  a  small  portion  of  the  weakness  in  recent  data  to  adverse weather conditions. Labor  market  developments  since December  have  been  mixed  at best, with a slowdown  in  the  pace  of payroll gains and  a stable unemployment  rate. On  the  positive  side, while consumption data over the  winter has been revised down, household income has not  and the dynamics

of households' net worth through the end of  2013 has been positive.  Too, surveys of  consumer sentiment have remained relatively upbeat.  Overall, the premises  for  an  acceleration in  consumer spending  - and in activity more  generally  - are  largely intact. At this point, however,  the  acceleration  is mainly  in the  outlook. We  expect  GDP  to  grow  at  roughly  3  percent  this  year,  after  growing  by  2.5  percent  in 2013. With  a  more  self-sustained  pace  of  growth  in  place,  further  modest  improvements  in  the  pace of growth should occur in  2015  and  2016  as firms increase their productive capacity. By the end of 2016,  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  reach  its  equilibrium  level.

The  expectation  of  a  faster  pace  of growth  this  year  and  next  continues  to  be  predicated  on  the waning effects of fiscal policy and the stimulative stance of  monetary policy. The outlook is  conditioned on  the  current  asset  purchase  program  to  total  $1.5  trillion. Moreover,  the  liftoff  of  the  federal  funds rate from the  zero-lower-bound  occurs only once the unemployment  rate drops below 6 percent, as the modest projected  acceleration in growth in a low inflation  environment  allows  for a patient removal of accomodation.

While the risks to the real outlook have become  somewhat  more balanced, on the inflation  side the risk is that the recent low readings  of core inflation may  prove  more  long-lasting  than  what  we are  assuming  in  our  forecast

Respondent 8: Other  conditioning assumptions: We expect the lower degree of inflation persistence evident since the  early  1990s  to continue. Inflation expectations remain  well anchored. We project foreign  real  GDP  growth  (GDP  weighted)  at  2.8%  (down  from  3.0%  in  December)  in  2014,  and  3.0% (down  from  3.1%  in December)  in  2015. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  dollar  exchange rate  are similar  to  those  in  the Tealbook. Reflecting  net  movements  in  futures quotes since December, which  have  been  volatile  over  the  time,  our  assumed  path  of  WTI  oil  prices  has  moved  up  to  $96.00 (from  $92.00  in December)  for  2014Q4,  and  to  $87.50  (from  $86.50  in  December)  for  2015Q4. Our federal fiscal assumptions are similar to those in the Tealbook, taking  on board the  lifting  of the debt ceiling  in  February  and  the  agreement  on  overall  spending  levels  for  FY  2015. We  adopt  the  Tealbook assumptions  regarding  equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: The flow of data over the past couple of months  has been difficult to interpret and, as one might  expect, has led to the development  of  two  camps. One  view  is that the economy  has lost a lot of the forward  momentum that had been  evident up through November. Since then, real PCE  (excluding  utilities and health care) has declined, a three-month  moving  average of monthly gains in nonfarm payroll employment has  fallen from  225,000 to  129,000,  and the three-month change of manufacturing output has gone from 4.2% (annual rate) to -1.2%. The opposing view is that even  though  the  U.S.  economy has become  more  fundamentally robust  than  it has been  throughout this expansion, some  slowing  of growth  in 2014Q1  was  likely as a payback  for the outsized growth contributions  from  inventory investment  and  net  exports  in  2013Q4,  compounded  by the  effects  of  the unusually  harsh  winter  weather  in  January  and  February  that  likely  lowered  the  2014Q1  growth  rate by  as much  as  a  full  percentage  point.

We  are more  in the latter camp,  continuing  to believe  that the underlying  fundamentals  of  the U.S. and global  economies have improved to the point where it is reasonable to expect that a firming of growth is underway. Indeed, despite the reduction in  our projection  for  2014Q1  real GDP growth from  2 1 4 / %  (annual  rate) in December  to  1 1 2 / %  now, we expect  growth  of final sales to domestic purchasers  to  be  2.5%  (annual  rate)  in  the  quarter,  modestly  above  the  average  of  the  second  half  of 2013. The  improving  underlying  fundamentals  are  well  known  at  this  point. Both  the  asset  and  the liability side of household  balance  sheets  are  effectively  repaired,  with  aggregate  household  liabilities finally  beginning  to  expand. The  excess  housing  stock  built  up  over  the  boom  of  the  previous  decade has been  worked  off, and home  prices  continue  to  rise rapidly due  to a shortage  of homes  for sale. Fiscal  consolidation  at  both  the  federal  and  the  state  and  local  levels  is  largely  over,  particularly  for the  state  and local  sector,  with  employment  at  the  state  and local  level  up 0.3%  over  the  twelve  months ending  in February. In addition, credit standards  continue  to ease, and  overall financial conditions

remain  fairly  supportive. In addition,  growth  prospects  among  many  of  our  major  trading  partners have  improved.

Therefore, we continue to believe that the most likely scenario for the US economy  is for real GDP  to grow at around 3% (Q4/Q4)  in 2014, and then rise to around 3 1 2 / % in 2015. All else equal, the stronger  growth  of  output  should  translate  into  stronger  growth  of  employment,  with  the unemployment  rate  declining to around 6 1 4 / % by the end of 2014, just below 5 1 2 / % at the end of 2015, and then 5 1 4 / %, our estimate for the longer-run natural rate of unemployment,  in  2016. However, there is considerable uncertainty around this projected path of the unemployment  rate due  to uncertainty  over  the  future  path  of  the  participation  rate. The  labor  force  participation  rate averaged  63.0% in January  and February, up  from  62.9% in the fourth quarter. We expect it to begin trending  upward  in  the  near  future,  reaching  63.4%  by  2015Q4. With  little  remaining  resource  slack by the first part of  2016, we expect real GDP growth to slow to near our estimate of potential growth.

We  expect inflation to rise gradually over the  forecast horizon,  and  to be near the FOMC objective by the end of 2015, at which time we expect inflation to stabilize. This forecast is based on the projected gradual increase in the  levels of resource utilization, which  would  ease downward pressure on firms'  marginal  costs and prices, a firming in global demand, and the upward pull on  actual inflation from stable inflation  expectations. Underpinning  the  latter  assumption is the broad stability  of  longterm inflation expectations across different financial and survey measures, combined  with ongoing moderate  growth  of  wages  and  unit labor costs, all observations  consistent with anchored  inflation expectations.

Respondent 9: Sustained  low  real  interest  rates,  easy  credit,  improved  household  and  strong  corporate  finances, and  pent-up  demand  for  durable  goods  provide  the  basis  for  an  acceleration  in  the pace  of  the  recovery. The  advanced  foreign  economies  are  now  expanding. The  substantial  drag  from restrictive  U.S.  fiscal  policy  seems  likely  to  diminish. New  oil  and  gas  extraction  technologies  reduce the  danger  that  higher  energy  prices  will  damp  the  recovery. On  the  other  hand,  corporations  so  far remain focused on squeezing  out  efficiencies, buying back  shares, and paying dividends rather than on expanding  their  operations  in  ways  that  lead  to  robust  employment  growth.

Inflation has stabilized and will likely return fairly quickly to mandate-consistent  levels as the recovery  accelerates.

Respondent 10: Some of the potential positives I  see include: (i) relatively strong  consumer spending, helped along by wealth effects and healthier household balance  sheets; (ii) the potential for a pickup  in  capital spending,  which has been  lagging behind  fundamentals, but  which I  think  could pull back  into  line  if business  confidence  picks  up;  (iii)  fading  fiscal  drag,  and  a  year  without  debt-ceiling drama; (iv) economic  conditions among  our major trading partners somewhere  between  benign  to mildly  helpful.

By  contrast, I suspect  that housing  will not be as much  of a positive this year as it was in the first part of  last year, in part simply because house prices have  made up  a  considerable fraction of the ground  they  lost  in  the  crisis.

In terms of risks, I continue to worry that the  exit from  our highly  accomodative policies  may be  somewhat  bumpy,  and  may  at  some  point  involve  an  unintended  tightening  of  financial  conditions that  could set back the recovery. I am particularly  concerned about the potential  for a sharp  market correction  in  the  the  pricing  of  various  forms  of  credit  risk.

Respondent 11: I expect output growth to  accelerate to 3 percent in  2014. The pace of growth then runs near my longer-term trend  rate of 2.4 percent in  2015 and  2016. With a moderate pace of growth over the forecast horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the unemployment rate to move down to about 5.8 percent by the end of  2015, at which  time it reaches my  estimate of the natural  rate  of unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will rise gradually  to  1.8 percent

in 2014  and  2 percent  in 2015  and  2016. Inflation stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary policy by  ending  asset purchases in  2014Q3  and then beginning  to raise rates in  2014Q4.

Respondent 12: I have revised down  my outlook for the first quarter by 1 2 / percentage point, reflecting slightly more  drag  from  inventory  investment  and  payback  for  the  stronger-than-expected growth  in nonresidential  fixed investment  in the fourth quarter. Research  by  my  staff suggests the weather-induced  shifts  in  real  activity  during  the  winter  months  will  have  little  impact  on  growth  in the current  and the next quarter. As a result, I have  left the rest of my  outlook unchanged. I continue to expect  above-trend  growth  of  2.6  percent  this  year  and  then  rising  to  3  percent  for  the  rest  of  the forecast  horizon.

I also expect  private  domestic  final  sales  to  be  about 1 2 / percentage  point  stronger  this  year  and next. The  pickup  in  growth  reflects  a  significant  reduction  in  fiscal  drag,  an  improving  labor  market along  with  higher  wage  inflation,  and  improved  household  balance  sheets. Finally,  while  the  housing recovery  has  slowed  somewhat,  it  remains  on  track.

I continue  to see sustained  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions. A broad  measure  of labor market conditions shows substantial improvement  since September 2012 supported by historically high levels of momentum. Over the last year, the unemployment  rate  fell 1 percentage point and U6  fell 1.7 percentage  points-the  largest  year-over-year  decline  in  its  history. I would  note  there  was some  slowing  in  momentum  in  February,  though  still  above  its  longer-run  historical  average,  largely reflecting a reduction in the growth  of aggregate weekly hours, most likely due to weather-related absences  in  February.

Turning  to  inflation,  with  measures  of  inflation  expectations  holding  steady  and  the  labor  market continuing  to  gradually  normalize,  I  expect  inflation  to  firm  this  year  and  move  toward  two  percent over  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 13: 1. As noted above: I  continue to be  concerned about possible declines in inflation expectations.

- 2. As in December: the  main risk  to the outlook is  monetary policy itself. We seem to be  cautious in our pursuit of our long-run price stability  and employment goals. That  caution  will leave households and  firms  concerned  about  our  ability/willingness  to  insulate  the  economy  against  tail  risks,  and push down  on  current  spending.

Respondent 14: My  forecast  envisions  that,  after  a  weather-induced  pothole  this  quarter,  growth picks up notably  over  the  next  several  years, the unemployment  rate  continues  to  decline  and  inflation moves slowly back  toward  the  Committee's  2 percent  longer-run  objective. An  accommodative monetary  policy  and  easing  credit  constraints  will  serve  as  important  factors  propelling  a  more  rapid recovery. A  significant  factor  shaping  the  outlook  is  diminishing  fiscal  drag  this  year. After  accounting for the effects of severe winter  weather,  private  demand  seems  to  be  strengthening,  although  at a slightly less robust pace than previously estimated. Going forward, I expect PCE  to accelerate further. Facotrs propelling  this pickup  in  PCE  include  the  waning  impact  of  tax  increases  last year,  a strengthening  of  household  balance  sheets  due  to  rising  house  and  equity  prices,  improving  prospects for the labor market  and  robust  auto  sales  driven  by  low  interest  rates, readily available credit and an  aging  fleet,  generating  substantial  replacement  demand. Residential  investment  has  slowed  signifcantly  since  last  fall,  likely  due  to  the  effects  of  rising  mortgage  rates  and  also  reflecting  severe  winter weather, but I expect  a pickup  in housing  starts and considerable  growth  in residential investment later this year. Investment in equipment  and intangibles has  also advanced at a slow pace,  on balance,

in recent  quarters,  but  I anticipate  that  stronger  growth  in  sales  this  year  will lead to a meaningful pickup. With  respect  to the labor market,  I have  been  surprised  that with growth  running  around 2-1/2 percent, payroll employyment has been rising  at a pace of  180,000 jobs per  month over the past year-a  pattern  that  is  causing  me  to  adjust  down  slightly  my  assumptions  concerning  the  likely  pace of productivity  growth  over  the  next  few  years. Unemployment  has  also  declined  by  more  than  I'd anticipated  due  in part to a decline in labor force participation, which  I view  as partly cyclical. In part  for  this  reason,  I  see  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  as  understating  the  extent  of  slack  in the labor  market. I anticipate some rebound, or at  least a flattening  out of the participation rate, and a slower decline  in unemployment  going  forward. Inflation has been  running below  the  Committee's 2% objective in spite of the  fact that inflation  expectations  are well-anchored. In part, I believe this reflects significant remaining  slack  in  labor  and  product  markets. My  forecast  envisions  a  return  to 2%  inflation  beyond  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: The key  factors shaping  our forecast  are the same as they have been for some  time. Accommodative  monetary  policy,  continued  improvement  in  household  and  business  balance  sheets, and  the  diminution  of  fiscal  restraint  should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move through  the projection period. Furthermore,  over  time, fewer households  and  small businesses  will find themselves  with  limited  access  to  traditional  credit  markets. Pent-up  demand  for  capital  goods and  consumer  durables should provide further impetus to growth. Demand from abroad is projected to firm  as the recovery  in  Europe  gains  traction  and  emerging  market  economies  work  through  their difficulties. Our forecast also assumes that there will not be any unusual changes in financial  conditions beyond  those  warranted  by  an  improved  economic  outlook  and  further  relaxation  of  constraints  on household  and  small  business  credit.

Together, these  factors are assumed to produce growth a bit above potential in  2014 and  more noticeably above it in  2015 and  2016. We expect growth to nearly  close resource gaps by the end of  2016, at which  time we project that the unemployment rate  will  only be about 1/4 percentage point above its long-run  neutral  level. Resource  slack  thus  is  expected  to  exert  a  diminishing  downward  influence on inflation  as we  move through the projection period. And, importantly, we  assume inflation  will be pulled up  by  inflation  expectations. In order to  maintain a strong  enough pull from expectations, we assume  the  FOMC  will  not  begin  to  remove  accommodation  until  the  one- to  two-year-ahead  inflation outlook is  clearly headed back  towards  target; given the normal inertia in the inflation process, such  a path  could well be  consistent  with some modest overshooting of  target beyond the projection horizon. (Our  extended  inflation  forecast  has  PCE  prices  rising  2.0  percent  in  2017  and  2.2  percent  in  2018).

The  main  sources  of  uncertainty  and  risks  to  our  forecast  are  described  in  2(b)  above.

Respondent 1: Aside  from  some  minor  adjustments,  my  outlook  for  GDP  growth  is  little  changed since December.  The biggest  revision has been to my forecast  for the unemployment  rate. For the  last several  SEP  submissions,  unemployment  has  declined  more  rapidly  than  I  had  anticipated. Carrying these  dynamics  forward,  I  have  lowered  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  next  few  years, with the result that I  now expect the unemployment  rate at the end of  2016  will be nearly 1 2 / percentage point lower than in my  December  forecast. With  this downward  revision, I see the unemployment rate falling below  my  estimate  of  its  long-run  natural  rate. I have  also  slightly reduced  my  inflation projection for 2014, as inflation has not yet begun to turn up as I had expected. Nevertheless, I continue to expect inflation  will approach  our 2 percent long-run objective by  the end of  2016, helped in part  by  the  stronger  labor  market  recovery  in  my  forecast.

Respondent 2: Seen  answer  to  4(a)

Respondent 3: I have not made any material changes to my forecast since the December submission.

Respondent 4: Our  forecasts have changed  only slightly. We now  foresee somewhat  less  momentum for GDP growth in the  economy  and  lift-off in Q1/2015  rather than Q4/2014. We see GDP growth accelerating in the second half of  2014 relative to the first half. We also revised up  our expected GDP growth  rate  for  2015. As  a  result,  our  forecast  is  for  more  overshooting  of  inflation  as  well  as  a  longer period  in  which  the  unemployment  rate  is  below  its  natural  rate.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: Since December,  I  have  made  only  modest  changes  to  the  broad  contours  of my forecast, and the data remain  consistent with a recovery that gains traction over the coming  year. Weather  has  been  a  drag on growth  in the first quarter of 2014. I expect  the reversal of this drag to contribute to growth in the remainder  of the year. Thus, on net my  GDP  forecast for 2014 is only slightly weaker than in December. These  disruptions have no substantial longer-term impact on the forecast. The overall pace of the recovery remains strong enough  to continue to bring the unemployment  rate  down.

In fact, the unemployment rate  is running below what I had expected,  leading  me to lower  its projected path. I currently expect the unemployment rate to reach  6-1/2 percent in the first half of 2014.

Finally,  incoming  data  on  core  and  overall  prices  have  been  in  line  with  my  expectations. Consequently,  my  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  since  December.

Respondent 7: While  activity in the second half  of 2013  was  somewhat  stronger  than  expected, going  forward  the  outlook  for  economic  activity  is  largely  unchanged. The  unemployment  rate  is  on  a lower  trajectory than previously  forecast,  and  we interpret this lower  level  as reflecting  a smaller  output gap than previously thought. As a result, by  the end of  2016 the projected level of the unemployment rate  is  lower  than  in  the  December  forecast,  despite  the  fact  that  the  outlook  for  GDP  growth  has  not changed  materially.

Respondent 8: The changes to our medium-term  forecast have been relatively modest on net, mostly  entailing  a small  upward  revision  to the projected  real GDP growth path, a small downward revision to the inflation path, and a modest  downward  revision  to the unemployment  path. Most of the revision to the medium-term  real  activity  forecast  came  between  the  December  and  January FOMC  meetings, reflecting the solid data during that period. The revision of the medium-term inflation  forecast  also  came during  that same period  as  the  inflation data pointed  to a somewhat  more prolonged  period  of  modest  inflation.

Over the near  term, the data indicate that real growth in  2014Q1  will be lower than we  anticipated in December, reflecting the weak data that have  come  in the past  couple of  months. As we  mentioned previously, we see this weaker  growth  as  transitory  and  have  made  little  revision  to  the projections for subsequent  quarters.

The  modest  upgrade  in  the  medium-term  real  activity forecast  reflects  small  upgrades  in  consumption  and  investment.

As we stated in our answer to question  2(a), our assessment of the uncertainty has increased modestly such  that  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  forecast  is  again  somewhat  higher  than  the  SEP standard. Uncertainty  around  the  real  activity  forecast  also  remains  higher  than  the  SEP  standard. This rise in uncertainty shift in part reflects the possibility that weather effects are obscuring our assessment  of  the  true  underlying  state  of  the  U.S.  economy.

Respondent 9: Inventory investment  was stronger in the second half of  2013 than I had anticipated, negatively  impacting  GDP  growth  prospects  in  the  first  half  of  2014.

I've given greater  weight, in this exercise, to the notion  that  growth  in  potential  GDP  has  been and will be weaker  than  historical averages  would  suggest. (This is the easiest explanation  for the declines  in  unemployment  we've  seen  in  the  face  of  2-percent  real  GDP  growth,  and  is  consistent  with the  notion  that  much  of  the  decline  we've  seen  in  labor  force  participation  is  structural-the  result  of the aging  of the baby boomers.) As a result,  the unemployment rate  falls  more quickly  than  in my December submission despite slightly weaker projected  real GDP growth,  and  I've  cut my  long-run projected GDP growth rate down a notch to  2.3 percent.

Finally,  I've  moved  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  unemployment  rate  upward  to  match  the  longrun  average  of  the  CBO's  'natural  rate'  of  unemployment.

Respondent 10: My  forecast  is  little  changed,  except  for  the  fact  that  I  have  knocked  the  path  of the  unemployment  rate  down  by  two-tenths,  in  light  of  the  decline  we  have  seen  in  the  unemployment rate  since  the  last  round.

Respondent 11: NA

Respondent 12: My  forecast  has  not  significantly  changed  since  the  last  SEP.  I  have  reduced  my unemployment  rate  forecast by about 1 4 / percentage point  in  2014  and 2015  compared  to  the December SEP.

Respondent 13: There has been  little change in my forecast, except that I have lowered my  estimate of the  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation.

Respondent 14: My forecast has changed  only  marginally since December.  My projected paths  for growth  and  for the unemployment  rate  are slightly lower over the  forecast horizon, in  light of incoming data suggesting  continued slow productivity growth  and  my projecton  for inflation is  little  changed.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Our  assumptions  for appropriate policy have changed somewhat since the December SEP.  Our  appropriate  policy  had  included  forward  guidance  broadly  similar  to  what  the Committee  adopted  at  that  meeting;  we  have,  however,  made  our  post-threshold  policy  forward  guidance assumption  more  explicit.

Our  outlook  for  2014  has  been  revised  down  1/4  percentage  point. This  entirely  reflects  a  weaker first quarter,  as  we  continue  to  see  growth  returning  to  about  a  3  percent  'run  rate'  for  the  remainder of the year. The unemployment rate, however, has  declined  more than  we  expected  given  our assumptions  regarding potential  output  growth. That,  and  some  reevaluation  of  trends  in  labor  force participation, have  caused us to revise down our assumptions for potential output growth in  2013 and over  the  projection  period. We  have  marked  down  our  forecasts  for  actual  GDP  growth  in  2014-2016 commensurately.

Not only has the unemployment  rate declined somewhat  more than we anticipated in December, we also have finally seen some signal that labor force participation may be at  least  stabilizing. Accordingly, for  2014 we have now built in a somewhat slower decline in the unemployment  rate than what would be indicated by  a straight reading of Okun's Law to reflect a somewhat  faster  closing of the participation rate  towards  its  trend.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook. I expect that GDP growth  will pick up  and proceed at above-trend  rates from  2014 through  2016, which  will  cause the unemployment  rate to modestly  fall  below  its  natural  rate  by  the  end  of  2016  and  pull  inflation  up  toward  our  2  percent long-term  objective.

Respondent 2: No  signficant  differences  this  time  around

Respondent 3: My  growth,  unemployment,  and  inflation  projections  are  essentially  the  same  as the  Tealbook  for  all  forecast  horizons.

Respondent 4: The major differences involve the unemployment rate. The Tealbook forecast indicates  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  decline  to  5.1  percent  in  2016  and  that  its  long  run  value will be 5.2 percent, while our forecast is that the unemployment  rate  will  move  below  its  long run value  in  2015  and  2016  (5.6  percent),  before  increasing  to  its  long  run  value  of  6.0  percent.

Respondent 5: The Tealbook projects a strong  surge in personal  consumption  expenditure that I view  as  unlikely. I also  believe  that  the  path  for  inventory  accumulation  will  be  below  the  one  shown in the  Tealbook.

Respondent 6: My  forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent 7: The  two  forecasts  are  similar  both  in  terms  of  real  activity  and  inflation. However, our  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  more  patient  removal  of  policy  accomodation  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 8: Our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2015  is  modestly  above  that  of  the  Tealbook, but  the  difference  is not  particularly  significant. More  substantively,  the  composition  of  growth  over 2014-15 differs between  the two  forecasts. The Tealbook projects higher  consumption  growth  than  in our forecast; the difference appears to reflect a stronger wealth effect and possibly higher  compensation growth than we have in our forecast. However, our forecast for the saving  rate has moved  closer to that of the Tealbook. The Tealbook projects  slower growth in business fixed investment in  2014-15 than in our forecast; the reason for this difference appears to be that the Tealbook has a  more moderate pace  of business  output  growth  than  we  have. In contrast,  the  Tealbook  forecasts  modestly  stronger growth  in residential investment, as it assumes  that  stronger income  growth  and  higher  confidence will overcome  higher  mortgage  rates  to  a  greater  extent  than  we  assume.

For  2016, real GDP growth in our projection is about one-half percentage point below the Tealbook forecast. This  difference  reflects  that  in  our  forecast,  unemployment  is  close  to  the  longer-run  natural rate  at  the  end  of  2015  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  a  somewhat  larger  gap. Furthermore,  the  Tealbook projects unemployment to  fall modestly below its longer-run natural rate in  2016, whereas we project unemployment  to  remain  near  its  longer-run  natural  rate. This  difference  appears  to  reflect  that  with inflation still below objective in the Tealbook  forecast, the  economy  can run somewhat above potential for a  time. With inflation near objective in  2016 in  our  forecast, we do not  expect such  a development.

Until  2016, the projected path of the unemployment rate in the Tealbook is somewhat above  our forecast. The  Tealbook  also  sees  the  labor  force participation  rate  as flat over the forecast horizon, whereas  we  anticipate  a  small  increase. In part, these  differences  seem  to  reflect  somewhat  differing assessments of the labor  market flows and dynamics that would be typical for this stage of an expansion.

A more fundamental  difference between the forecasts concerns the potential growth rate. The Tealbook  has  reduced  the level of potential GDP  and  its growth  rate over the past few cycles. In contrast, we have maintained our estimate of the potential growth rate. This difference seems to reflect the recent reduction  in unemployment  and  what  the  Tealbook  sees  as  an  inconsistency  with Okun's Law-to resolve that inconsistency, the Tealbook has  made these changes to  its potential GDP assumption. Based  on  our  analysis  of  unemployment  dynamics  during  the  middle  of  long  expansions (at  more  than 4 1 2 / years, the  current expansion now qualifies  as  long), the decline in the unemployment rate in this expansion relative  to Okun's  Law  implications has not been  unusual,  and  thus we have not  seen  the  need  to  adjust  our  potential  growth  assumptions.

Although  we  have  marked  down  our  inflation  forecast  modestly,  we  still  see  a  stronger  influence of anchored  inflation  expectations  on  inflation dynamics  than does  the Tealbook. Consequently,  our inflation forecast and  the Tealbook  forecast  are  similar  over  the near term, but beyond  that  we  see total  and  core  inflation  rising  more  quickly  to  near  2%  than  does  the  Tealbook.

On  the  real  side, the uncertainty  and  risk  assessments  differ  a  bit  between  the  Tealbook  and  our projection. We  continue to see uncertainty around the real GDP  and  unemployment  forecasts  as higher than normal  whereas  the Tealbook  sees uncertainty  at near normal  levels. This assessment reflects  our view that the unusual nature of the  current  expansion  as well  as a policy  environment that is constrained  by  the  effective  lower  bound  leaves  uncertainty  about  real  activity  above  normal  levels (even the  more  elevated normal levels now associated with the 20-year window of forecast  errors). Over the near  term, we  see the risks to real activity as balanced  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  them  skewed a little to the downside: the difference  seems  to  reflect  that  we  place  somewhat  more  probability  on headwinds  receding  faster  than  anticipated. Our  views  on  the  risk  assessment  for  inflation  is  similar to that in the Tealbook, but we ascribe a  little  more uncertainty  around  our projection than does the Tealbook.

Respondent 9: I see a somewhat  faster  rise in inflation than is called for in the Tealbook. The higher inflation path and  an  earlier  liftoff  combine to generate a slightly steeper increase in the federal funds  rate.

Respondent 10: I am  very  close  to  the  Tealbook  through  2015. By  2016,  my  unemployment  rate is a touch higher,  and  my growth  forecast is a bit lower than those in the Tealbook. This is because I have  in  mind  a  somewhat  higher  value  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  so  in  my  forecast,  the economy  is  closer  to  full  employment-and  growth  is  correspondingly  nearer  to  a  long-run  steady  state value-by  2016.

Respondent 11: My forecast  calls  for higher inflation  and  tighter  monetary policy over the  forecast horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 12: I see growth in real GDP about 1/4 percentage points slower in  2014 and 2015 than does Tealbook. This reflects significantly slower growth  in consumption  (about  1  percentage  point per year) and  residential investment. On  the  other hand,  I see growth  in business  fixed investment about  1  percentage  point  faster  than  Tealbook. Finally, I expect  inflation  to rise more  quickly  than Tealbook  and  will  average  2  percent  in  2015  and  2016.

Respondent 13: I see appropriate  monetary  policy  as  being  more  accommodative  than  the  TB's assumed policy  stance. As  a  result,  I'm  forecasting  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  more  rapidly than  does  the  TB  and  the  inflation  rate  will  rise  more  rapidly.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  early  in  2016,  three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of  increase  after  liftoff  is similar. Accordingly,  at  the  end of the projection period  our  assumed  level of the funds rate  only reaches  1.25 percent.

We  assume  that the economy  entered  2014 with somewhat  less momentum  than  the  Tealbook, and  our  outlook  for  growth  over  2014:Q2-2014:Q4  is  a  bit  more  subdued. Our  outlook  for  growth  in 2015-2016 is a bit stronger than the Tealbook, reflecting  our somewhat  faster assumed pace of growth of potential output. On net, while the Tealbook  closes resource gaps by  the end of  2016, we still see a small  gap  remaining  at  that  time. Our  inflation  forecast  is  a touch  below  the  Tealbook,  although  in contrast  to  the  Tealbook's  balanced  assessment,  we  see  the  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast  as  being  to the  downside.
