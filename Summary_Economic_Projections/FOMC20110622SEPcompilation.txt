NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The April projections were made in conjunction with the FOMC meeting on April 26-27, 2011.

- 1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c).  If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  shorter  or  longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estim ate  of the duration  of the  convergence  process.  You  may  also  include  below  any  other explanatory  com m ents  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent  1:

In my baseline projection,  the economy converges to the long-run trend by the end of 2016.

Respondent  2:

I  anticipate that  the convergence process  for real  GDP  growth  will be slightly shorter  than  5-6  years,  per­ haps on the order of 4 years for real growth  (with a period of overshoot of real growth in the interim during recovery),  and  an  overshoot  (above  1.5%)  in  the  interim  in  inflation  as  a  consequence  of significant  past growth in the monetary base supported by longer term asset purchases that cannot  be sold off over a very short  time  period. I  anticipate  that  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  will  lag  behind  the  recovery of real  growth.

Respondent  3:

Respondent  5:

Our current  estimate of the  economy's  potential growth rate  is in the  2.5%  to  2.7%  range.  By 2015-16  we anticipate  potential  growth  to  slow  to  2.4%,  reflecting  slower  trend  growth  of hours  worked  as  the  baby boomers retire.  A reasonable estimate  for the long-run unemployment rate is 4%  to 6%.  Assuming appro­ priate policy and no further significant shocks, we expect the unemployment rate to be in this range and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-2016.

We assume that long-term inflation expectations will continue to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a CPI  basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective is and will be about 2% for the PCE deflator and around 2.5% for the CPI. Under these conditions and with the output gap anticipated to be near zero, we expect inflation as measured by the PCE deflator to be around 2% in 2015-16.

Respondent  6:

N/A

Respondent  7:

In general,  I expect the convergence process to take five to six years.  However,  I am concerned that a delay in the removal of the extraordinary level of monetary policy accommodation could cause long-term inflation expectations to become unanchored and lead to financial imbalances, both of which could eventually desta­ bilize the economy and further prolong the convergence process.

Respondent  8:

I  expect  the  convergence  process will be  similar to that  outlined in the long-run projection reported in the Tealbook.  In five to six years,  unemployment  and output gaps close,  with PCE price inflation  approaching its long-run value of 2 percent soon thereafter.

Real activity is anticipated to reach maximum employment within a five-year horizon.  Inflation, however, is likely to remain below target.

Respondent  17:

Convergence may well take the full five-to-six years.  Inflation is likely to overshoot  the level I think is con­ sistent  with price stability.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Respondent  7:

The uncertainty surrounding my projections remains higher than normal.  In addition to Tealbook's assess­ ment  of the  uncertainty,  I  would  add  fiscal  policy to the  list.  The  unsustainable  fiscal  policy,  and  policies that may or may not be adopted by Congress or forced by the market,  adds considerable uncertainty to the outlook.

Respondent  8:

This is  a close call,  but  uncertainty appears to be broadly similar to its average over the past  20 years.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

There is substantial uncertainty over how much of the slowing of growth so far this year was due to transitory factors such higher energy prices and supply disruptions associated with Japanese natural disasters and how much reflects more fundamental headwinds that will persist  for some time.

Respondent  11:

The US has not had a comparable recession (following a severe financial crisis) in the postwar period.  Finan­ cial risks  (e.g.,  Europe)  remain.  The  aftermath of a housing bubble is also hard to predict.  Lack of previous experience  with  this  type  of recession  increases  the  uncertainty  about  growth  and  unemployment. Uncer­ tainty about core inflation is moderated because of high levels of persistence and stability in a low-inflation era.  However,  volatility in commodity prices  and exchange rates lead to higher uncertainty about headline inflation.

Respondent  14:

The incoming data has been somewhat weaker than my April projection.  However, I view this recent weak­ ness as temporary.  Financial market conditions continue to improve and the economic recovery will continue to  gain  momentum.  It  remains  the  case  that  the  effect  of the  extraordinary monetary policy in place  and uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of policy,  including  the  timing  of the  exit  from  accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty around my inflation forecast.

It  has  become harder  to rule  out  the  possibility that  the  cumulative  effect  of regulations  that  significantly raise business costs and reduce hiring and output,  and the uncertainty concerning the exact nature of future taxes and regulations will materially reduce growth over the medium term.  More specifically, my concern is we may not return to the historic trend,  but  that  the growth rate  will  remain stuck  around the  trend rate of growth and activity will track a new lower trend line,  regardless of the stance of monetary policy.

While energy and commodity prices have recently declined, there is a risk they will once again resume their upward march as the global economic recovery continues.  I am also concerned that the pass-through to core inflation from the recent run-up in commodity prices and from import prices could be larger than expected.

Respondent  8:

We continue to view the risks to the forecast  as broadly balanced-albeit  around  a much lower growth pro­ jection and a slightly higher inflation outlook than last time.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

We have assumed that much of the recent weakness in real activity was due to transitory factors.  However, given the recent weakening in labor markets and what appears to be some deterioration in sentiment, we see the risks to the forecast  as tilted toward the downside on growth.

Historical  patterns  in  the  data  suggest  the  growth  rebound  might  be  stronger  than  my  baseline  forecast. However, recent negative shocks including higher oil prices, bad weather, and the Japan disaster appear more persistent than I  anticipated.  These downside risks have led me shift my risk weighting for GDP  growth to balanced.  I  view the risks  to inflation  as  weighted to the  upside in both the  short  run  and over the  longer term.  Longer-term inflation risks reflect  uncertainty about  the timing  and efficacy of the  Fed' s withdrawal of accommodation.

Appropriate  M onetary  Policy

3. Does  your  view  of the  appropriate  path  for  m onetary  policy  differ  m aterially from  that  assum ed  by  the  staff in  th e  Tealbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent  1: No

N/A

Respondent  2: Yes

While  the  pattern  of recovery  from  the  recession  is  uncertain,  I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate and allow the  SOMA portfolio to run off sooner  than assumed in the  Tealbook.  In the interim,  depending on  how  the  economy evolves,  it  may be  appropriate  to  accelerate  or  slow  down  the  growth  of the  SOMA portfolio.

Respondent  3: Yes

I  believe  that  in order  to achieve an inflation rate of 1   1/2 percent  we would want  to begin reducing policy accommodation by year-end.

Respondent  4: Yes

I  believe  that  it  will  be  appropriate  to  reduce  monetary  accommodation  sooner  than  is  estimated  by  the Tealbook.

Respondent  5: No

N/A

Respondent  6: No

N/A

Respondent  7: Yes

In my view,  under the  appropriate path,  monetary policy would immediately begin the normalization pro­ cess.  I  would change the forward guidance at this meeting so we can lift the funds rate off zero and bring it up to  1   percent  later  this  year.  I  would  also  cease the  reinvestment  of principal  payments  from our  agency debt,  MBS holdings,  and Treasury securities.

Respondent  8: Yes

The path  for  the  funds  rate  in  Tealbook  is quite  reasonable.  However,  I  think the Federal Reserve  should continue to reinvest principal payments  from its securities holdings beyond the first  quarter of 2012,  which is contrary to the assumption in Tealbook.

Respondent  9: No

N/A

Respondent  10: No

We condition our  forecast on market expectations  for the  funds rate which are currently similar to what is assumed in the Tealbook.

Respondent  11: No

Like the  Tealbook,  my concerns  about  inflation/inflation expectations have moderated and concerns  about growth have increased, making me more comfortable with the Tealbook's later exit.  I think the risks remain

toward an earlier exit than assumed by the  Tealbook.

Respondent  12: No

N/A

Respondent  13: No

N/A

Respondent  14: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the appropriate  monetary  policy  as  one  that  begins  raising  the  funds  rate  and/or  shrinking  the  balance  sheet sometime in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  15: No

N/A

Respondent  16: Yes

With  a large amount  of slack still present  at  the end of 2012  and  inflation  below  target,  the  Federal  funds rate' s  lift  off from  the  zero  lower  bound  occurs somewhat  later in the  forecast  horizon relative  to the  Tealbook's  assumption.

Respondent  17: Yes

I  am more concerned than the Tealbook that high recent and prospective rates of headline inflation will have corrosive effects on our credibility.  Much will depend on how firmly we communicate our resolve regarding price  stability  and on  how  well  we  are  able  to  explain our  strategy for  achieving it. In  any case,  my longterm inflation objective is lower than the 2-percent Tealbook rate.  Accordingly, I believe it will be necessary to  begin  removing monetary-policy  accommodation  earlier  than  is  assumed  by Board  staff,  and  to  pursue normalization  more  vigorously. Separately,  I  see  no  reason  we  cannot  begin  to  shed  MBS  as  market  con­ ditions allow.  The appropriate composition of our balance sheet and its appropriate size are distinct issues.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  econom ic  outlook and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent  1:

Weakness in the incoming data highlights the still tenuous  nature of the recovery,  reinforcing my prior ex­ pectation of a weaker-than-normal expansion.  Consumption spending is likely to lag behind historical norms as  households  struggle  with  an  exceptionally  poor  labor  market,  low  net  worth,  and  sluggish  real  income growth.  Considerable  uncertainty continues to surround  my growth projection.  In light  of the  unexpected near-term weakness, ongoing worries over Eurozone austerity measures, political unrest in the Middle East, and volatile  movements in  commodities prices,  I judge  the  risks  to my growth  outlook to be tilted  toward the downside.

On a year-over-year basis I expect core PCE inflation to gradually move up to 2% by the end of the forecast horizon.  I  also expect  the  growth rate  of headline  PCE prices to fall  below that  of core  PCE  prices  in  the near-term (as  the  recent  run-up  in  gasoline  prices  unwind) before  beginning  its  gradual  ascent  to  roughly 2% by the end of the forecast horizon.

My inflation  outlook  is  conditional  on  continued  stability in  inflation  expectations  and  a  measured  reduc­ tion  in  economic  slack. Still,  the  recent  unexpected  pickup  in  underlying  inflation  measures  in  the  face of abundant  slack,  commodity price  volatility,  and  extremely  accommodative  monetary  policy elevate  the uncertainty surrounding my inflation outlook,  with the balance of risks tilted toward the upside.

Respondent  2:

In  2011  through  2013  I  anticipate  that  real  growth will  occur  at  greater  than steady-state  rates,  reflecting normal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced  by the  substantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been  in  train  since  late 2008.  I expect that beginning in 2013 real growth will slow and subsequently approach steady-state rates.  I expect  that  core  PCE inflation over  all  of 2011  to be higher  that  of 2010  and increases in  food  and energy prices  to  drive  headline  inflation  above  the  core  rate  for  2011. Subsequently,  under  appropriate  monetary policy,  inflation should approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5 percent,  though I believe that it will rise above that  rate in an interim period.  I do not  believe that  future energy shocks can be  forecasted,  so with available information I expect  that the core  and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  3:

I  believe the recovery is firmly in place but is facing significant headwinds.  Supply-chain disruptions follow­ ing the Japanese earthquake have reduced growth in the current quarter but will be reversed in the second half. Higher  energy  prices  have  lowered  consumer  spending  in  the  first  half;  if energy  prices  stabilize  or decline  slightly,  consumer  spending  will  gradually  improve. Residential  investment  is  likely  to  contribute little  to  growth  in  overall  activity  this  year. Business equipment  investment  and  exports  are projected  to be  robust. The  stock  of  federal  debt  will  grow  much  more  rapidly  than  GDP  under  current  legislation, leading to uncertainty on the nature and timing of policy actions that  will put the stock of debt  on  a more sustainable path.  That uncertainty could make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans. A broad  range  of new  regulations  has  likely  dampened  growth. Core  inflation  has  risen  significantly  this year,  is unlikely to decline very much under current policy,  and could even rise further.

Respondent  4:

My thinking  about  the  behavior  of inflation  has  two  conflicting  elements  to  it. First,  I  believe  that  the changes  over  the  past  four  years  (to  the  financial  sector,  anticipated  taxes/regulations,  and  the  nature  of jobs at firms) have had a significant and adverse impact on the ability of the economy to exploit its available resources.  For that reason, I believe that the output gap is larger (less negative) than the Tealbook estimates

it  to be.  That force that should lead to upward pressures on underlying inflation.  We' re seeing those forces play  out  -  and  indeed  they  seem  to  be  stronger  than  I  expected. Second,  my outlook  for  real  GDP  has softened.  In part,  that softening is  attributable to temporary bad news on the supply side  ...  but I  also see the recovery in consumer demand as being less potent than I had expected it to be.  On balance, my forecast for  core inflation has emphasized the first effect,  but I cannot  fully discount the second.

Respondent  5:

We  have  again  lowered  our  growth  forecasts  for  2011  and  2012. For  2011,  we  now  expect  real  GDP  to increase  3%  (Q4/Q4)  versus  3.7%  in the  April  SEP.  Much  of this reduction  for  2011  reflects the impact  of events than have  already happened.  Growth of real  GDP in the first  half of 2011  will  likely be  around  2% (annual rate),  almost  a full percentage point below our projection in April.  We view this slowing of growth as primarily a temporary phenomenon resulting from external shocks.  While these shocks are now beginning to reverse,  they will  nevertheless  have  some  lasting  effects  which we  believe  have lowered the  trajectory of the recovery.  Thus,  we have lowered the growth forecast for the second half of the year to around 4%  from 4  ½ %.  For 2012 real GDP is projected to increase 3  ¾ %,  down from around 4% in April.

The  main  source  of this  'soft  patch'  is  a  pronounced  slowing  of the  rate  of growth  of real  personal  con­ sumption  expenditures. This  largely  stems  from  a  larger  than  anticipated  commodity  price  shock  which has  resulted  in  a  pronounced  slowing  of growth  of real  disposable  income. In  addition  to  the  commodity price  shock,  the  level  of personal  income  has  been  revised  down  while  the  level  of personal  current  taxes has  been  revised  up. Real  PCE  has  not  slowed  to  the  same  extent  as  disposable  income;  as  a  result,  the saving rate declined to 4.9%  in April,  compared to over 6%  a year ago.  Even though the ratio of household net  worth to disposable income increased somewhat in the first  quarter,  we  view this  decline  of the  saving rate  as  an undesired response to higher prices of goods with very inelastic demand in the short  run.  As we expect  households to  forestall  any  further  decline  of the  personal  saving  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  we have reduced our real PCE growth forecast through the end of 2012.

Despite  the  marking  down  of projected  real  PCE  growth,  we  have  seen  improvement  in  some  of the  un­ derlying  fundamentals  of consumer  spending,  which  mitigated  the  reduction  in  our  central  forecast. The annualized rate of growth of hours worked over the  four months ending in May was 4  ¼  %,  the strongest in quite  some  time. Based  on  the  Flow  of Funds  data,  households  made  further  progress  in  deleveraging  in 2011Q1.  Total household liabilities  declined  2.1%  (annual  rate),  the  fastest  since  2010Q1,  and the  ratio of financial  assets  to  liabilities  moved  higher  and  is now reasonably close  to its  longer  term trend.  According to the Senior Loan Officer survey, banks willingness to make nonmortgage consumer loans increased further in  the  second  quarter  and  there  was  another  increase  in  the  net  percentage  of banks  indicating  that  their standards for such loans had eased.

Aside  from the damping down of real PCE growth and its effects on imports,  the remainder of the forecast for growth of total expenditures is essentially unchanged from April.  Growth prospects of our major trading partners remain favorable,  suggesting sustained strong growth of exports.  Indeed,  recent  data suggest that growth of real exports in  2011Q2  will be stronger than in the preceding two quarters.  Business investment in equipment  and software surprised to the upside in 2011Q1,  and that strength was broad based.  Surveys of business leaders suggest that this form of investment will remain strong over the remainder of 2011,  aided by the full expensing tax provision enacted at the end of 2010.  Leading indicators of business investment in nonresidential  structures,  such  as the  Architecture Billings Index,  suggest  some improvement  in this sector over the forecast  horizon.  The fiscal condition of state and local governments has improved in recent quar­ ters,  with  2011Q1  state  and  local  total  tax receipts  up  11%  from their  2009Q2  low. As  a  result,  the  drag from this sector is expected to gradually subside.  Even residential investment is likely to improve modestly, as  current  levels  of housing production  are  far  below  what  is  needed to keep up  with  the  demographically driven rate of household formations.  We anticipate that this improvement will be mainly in the production of new multi-family housing.

With  the  downgrading  of real  GDP  growth,  the  projected  path  of the  unemployment  rate  is  somewhat higher.  We now expect the unemployment rate to be around 8  ½ % by the end of 2011  and 7  ½  % by the end of 2012,  up  from 8%  and 7%,  respectively,  in the  April SEP.  The projected growth of employment is lower, with average monthly gains of nonfarm payroll employment of around 220,000 in 2011  and 300,000 in 2012. In  addition  to slower  growth of output,  the  average workweek has increased somewhat  more than  we were expecting.  In contrast,  the labor  force participation rate has only stabilized;  based on past  business cycles we would have expected to see some increase by this point.  Analysis indicates that the current participation rate  is  well  below  trend,  and  so  we  continue  to  believe  there  is  a  case  for  the  participation  rate  to  move up some  as  the  economy continues to  recover.  However,  we  have  pushed  further  into  the  future  when  the recovery of participation to trend will occur.

The decline in energy commodity prices over the intermeeting period and the May fall of the energy compo­ nent of the CPI have led us to reduce our forecast for the change in the total PCE deflator for 2011  (Q4/Q4) from a little over 3% in April to about  2  ½ %.  On a monthly basis,  year over year changes of the total  PCE deflator  are now likely to top out  in the  2  ½   %   to  2  ¾ %   range  in  2011Q3.  Reflecting the  higher  readings on core  inflation  so  far  in  the  current  quarter,  we  have  raised  our  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  in  2011 (Q4/Q4) modestly from a little under 1   ½ % in April to a little over  1   ½ %.  We see the bulk of the increase in core inflation in the first half of this year as reflecting transitory factors.  Consequently,  we have made little change to our core inflation forecast for the second half of this year and for 2012.  We continue to expect that core PCE inflation in 2012  (Q4/Q4)  will be about  1   ½  %.  Meanwhile,  as futures prices suggest energy prices will  rise  somewhat  faster  in  2012  than prices  for  other  goods  and services,  total  PCE  inflation  is  expected to be around  1   ¾ %  for that year.

Respondent  6:

Broadly disappointing high-frequency data over the past  few months reinforce the  case  for the  proposition that  the  recovery  will  be  gradual  and  somewhat  halting  for  some  time  to  come. It  seems  quite  unlikely that residential construction will make a major positive contribution during the forecast period,  even as the double-dip in housing prices has again retarded the reacquisition of the levels of pre-crisis household wealth. Combined with diminished expectations that labor markets will experience a prolonged burst of high levels of job  creation,  housing  price  declines  could  thus  also  exert  a  continuing  drag  on  personal  consumption expenditures. While  it  does  appear  that  the  recovery  is  still  strong  enough  to  be  self-sustaining,  there  is some risk of a stall-speed phenomenon, particularly with the potential for a blow to confidence from one or more of the downside risks noted in the next paragraph.

Major  downside  risks  continue  to  be  largely  external,  in  the  sense  that  they  are  being  generated  either abroad or through the domestic  political  process. Risk of significant  negative  Eurozone  developments  has increased.  Risk of a greater slowdown in China  (and thus,  effectively most emerging markets)  seems greater to  me  than  consensus  would  suggest. Finally,  it  seems  increasingly likely that  the  conditions  for  Congres­ sional  approval  of an  increase  in  the  debt  limit  will  include  non-trivial  reductions  in  short  term spending, which if large  enough  could  amplify the  already negative  effects  of government  fiscal  policy  (federal,  state and local)  on near-term growth.

Respondent  7:

Overall,  I  expect  growth  over  the  next  several  years  to  be  moderate,  reflecting  the  fact  that  the  economy is going through a difficult rebalancing due to deleveraging by households,  businesses,  financial institutions, and governments.  Turning to the near  term outlook,  high energy prices  and  the  events in Japan  have  re­ duced  growth  in  the  first  half of this  year. However,  it  appears  as  though  this  is  a  temporary  setback. While  labor  market  developments  in  May  were  disappointing,  continued  gains  in  employment,  hours,  and wages should support growth going forward.  In addition,  while energy and commodity prices have declined recently,  they still  remain  high  and  the  lingering effects  are  likely to  restrain  growth  in  the  second  half of

this year and next year.  I expect growth in the next two years to be above trend, about 3 1/2 percent per year.

We are already seeing an increase in overall and core inflation,  with price increases increasingly widespread. Recent  declines in  energy  prices  should  lead  to  lower  inflation  in  the  near  term,  but  greater  pass  through may lead to further increase in core inflation.  With a rebounding economy,  a depreciating dollar,  and stable inflation expectations,  I expect inflation will be a little under 2 percent over the  forecast horizon.

The  risks  to  the  outlook  remain  considerable. In  the  near-term,  fiscal  policy,  continued  problems  in  the construction sector,  and high energy and commodity prices all pose downside risks to the economic outlook.

As  for  inflation,  higher  energy  and  commodity  prices,  along  with  a  greater  pass  through  of  costs,  pose upside risk to  near-term  and  medium-term headline  and core inflation.  Longer term,  the  expansion of our balance sheet  and  federal borrowing needs create a risk to the stability of long-term inflation expectations, and,  in turn,  inflation.  In  addition,  there is  a risk that  monetary policy will remain too accommodative  for too long,  creating further upside risks to inflation.

Respondent  8:

The economic recovery appears to have lost some momentum but  fundamentally remains intact.  Monetary stimulus  and  improvements  in  banking  and  financial  market  conditions  provide  key  drivers  for  economic expansion over the next  few  years,  even  as  firms  and households  adjust  to  higher  food  and gasoline  prices and  fiscal  policy  at  all  levels  turns  increasingly  contractionary. Still,  it  will  take  several  years  of robust growth  to  return  the  economy  to  full  employment. Inflation  has  been  boosted  by jumps  in  energy  and commodity prices;  however,  significant  slack in labor  and goods markets will keep underlying inflation low. Well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid significant pass-through of higher inflation to wages.

Respondent  9:

Economic  performance  during  the  intermeeting  period  has  been  disappointing  and  broad  based  weakness is  evident  in  recent  data. Two factors,  both temporary,  are surely contributing to this  softness-the supply chain  disruptions  resulting  from  the  Japanese  earthquake  and  tsunami  and  increases  in  energy  and  food prices, which are weighing on household real income and consumer sentiment.  Japanese supply chain disrup­ tions  are  easing more rapidly than expected,  which should cause growth to rebound strongly next  quarter. And assuming that energy prices stabilize-a prospect that  seems likely based on futures prices-the drag of higher  prices  on  consumption  growth  should  diminish  over  time. However,  the  weakness  in  the  economy apparent  in  recent  data  may  well  reflect  deeper  negative  forces  holding  back  the  recovery. Moreover,  the growing uncertainty about the outlook appears to be causing firms to place investment and hiring decisions on hold-a response that creates the  potential  for  a  negative  feedback  loop  to develop.  In response,  I  have downgraded my forecast  for  growth  in  2011  and  revised  upward  my  forecast  of the  unemployment  rate  in 2011  Q4.  In  addition to lowering my modal  forecast  for growth,  I  now  also see the risks  as being weighted to the  downside.  I  expect  a modest  pickup in growth in  2012  due to the stabilization of energy prices  and the  favorable impact  on spending of our highly accommodative monetary policy and improving credit con­ ditions  as  well  as  strong growth in the global economy.  However,  considerable drags will continue to weigh on  growth  over  the  next  several  years,  including  a  continued  need  for  households  to  deleverage,  declining house prices, ongoing weakness in residential and nonresidential construction and the need for state and local governments to curtail spending.  In  addition  there  is  the  prospect  of growing fiscal  drag  from the  Federal budget.  Due, in large part, to these continuing headwinds in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I anticipate that growth over the next several years will be slow by the standards of postwar business cycle recoveries and unemployment will decline toward its longer-tun normal level only slowly.  Risks to the forecast are unusually high at present.  Key risks include the prospect of financial market turmoil and spillovers resulting from the European debt situation and grid lock relating to the U.S. debt ceiling.  With respect to inflation,  I see the recent uptick in inflation as a transitory phenomenon reflecting the large increases in energy and food prices. In addition to boosting headline inflation,  there has also been limited spillover from energy prices into core

inflation in recent months.  Over the next several months,  however,  I anticipate that both headline and core inflation will subside to levels  at,  or more likely below,  the level of 2%  that I  consider most  consistent over the  medium  term  with  the  Committee's  dual  mandate. Importantly,  inflation  expectations  appear  to  be quite stable  and underlying labor cost pressures are minimal due to very sluggish growth in nominal wages and  continued  productivity  growth. The  risks  around  my inflation  forecast  are  large  but  balanced. I  see both up and downside potential for commodity prices-an important inflation risk factor-and some downside potential that could materialize if the recovery falters.

Respondent  10:

Our forecast assumes that much of the slower growth evident in the first half was due to transitory factors such  as the increase in energy prices  and supply disruptions  associated with natural disasters in Japan.  In the  third  quarter  output  will  be  boosted  significantly  by  the  easing  of  auto  industry  supply  constraints. Going  forward,  pent-up  demand  for  consumer  durables  and  replacement  demand  for  business  equipment, particularly in the manufacturing sector,  should justify higher levels of production.  In addition,  lower inter­ est  rates  and some further easing of credit conditions should contribute to a pickup in growth.

However, the recent weakening of the labor market and broad-based slowing in consumption growth suggest that the economy continues to face significant headwinds.  Thus we expect growth in the second half of this year and early 2012 to be only a little more than a percentage point  above potential.  Later in the  forecast period we expect a further pickup in growth as a more positive dynamic of strengthening income growth and demand takes hold.

Still high oil prices,  fragile business and consumer confidence,  further headwinds for housing,  and the possi­ bility of more significant fiscal drag pose downside risks to this assessment.

Core  inflation  has  risen  from  the  very  low  levels  recorded  in  the  second  half of last  year,  and  food  and energy prices have pushed headline inflation  up  a  good  deal.  We  do not,  however,  see  these  developments as dictating  a major change to the  inflation  forecast  much  beyond the  near term.  Accordingly,  we  still  see both total and core PCE inflation running about  1-1/2 percent in 2013.

A  number  of  factors  underlie  this  judgment. Some  of  the  recent  increases  in  core  were  to  be  expected as  a  bounce  back  from  special  factors  that  had  lowered  core  inflation  late  last  year. We  also  continue  to think  that  the  pass-through  of higher  costs  for  energy  and  other  commodities  will  be  modest,  especially given  what  appears  to  be  a  moderation  in  those  costs. One reason  is  the  disinflationary  influence  of sig­ nificant  resource  slack. Another  is  that  outside  of a  few  hot  sectors,  we  are  not  seeing  (or  hearing  of)  a marked pickup in wage growth  .  This is consistent with well anchored inflationary expectations on the part of households and firms.  Our assessment of the inflation outlook is also informed by a variety of econometric analyses.  On  the structural side,  our  DSGE model attributes  much  of the  pickup in  core  inflation in early 2011  to  transitory shocks  that  largely dissipate  by  2012. This  interpretation  is  supported  by models  that embed  inflation  forecasts  in  no  arbitrage  models  of the  term  structure  of interest  rates. And on the  sta­ tistical front, a battery of Stock-Watson style models continue to forecast very low inflation in 2012 and 2013.

Respondent  11:

Both the data (payrolls, UI claims, GDP, housing statistics, retail sales)  and prospective indicators (regional and ISM manufacturing surveys,  confidence)  indicate that  the economy has slowed.  Financial markets also are  suggesting  greater  pessimism  on  growth  (and  less  concern  about  inflation). No doubt,  much of this is temporary.  Notably,  the easing of supply chain problems,  as reflected in  auto production schedules,  should lead to  a pop in  Q3.  The  cooling of oil  prices will  certainly help consumers  while keeping expectations  for Fed  tightening  in  check. UI  claims  are  a  little  better  and  we  should  not  read  too  much  into  one  month' s payroll numbers.

That  said,  I  noted  some  loss  of momentum  even  at  the  April  meeting. Like  last  year,  Europe  has  been a concern, but financial markets are discounting a longer-term US slowdown as well.  Consumption, housing, and the labor market  remain weaker than hoped.  Fiscal factors will largely be negative going forward.  De­ spite  recent  declines,  energy and  food  prices  remain higher  than we expected  at  the  beginning of the year. Tightening monetary policy could slow growth in emerging markets.  For these reasons I  have treated some of the  slowing  as  longer-lasting  and  marked  down  my growth  forecast  over  the  horizon. I  assume  that  an approximate Okun's Law relationship will link unemployment and growth.

Core inflation has picked  up recently but  I  have  not  extrapolated  that  beyond  2011.  Effects  of the  Japanrelated supply chain disruptions on  auto prices  and the  passthrough  in some  areas of commodity prices to the  prices  of  core  goods  and  services  should  dissipate. Rents  and  OER  still  seem  likely  to  move  higher, which will raise core; but,  on the other hand,  the output gap will also be larger,  restraining core.  Declining oil  prices  will  lead  to  low  headline  inflation  in  the  second  half of 2011;  I  assume  that  modest  increases  in commodity prices will resume later this year or early next year.

Respondent  12:

N/A

Respondent  13:

The  economy  has  slowed  its  expansion. Although  some  of this  slowing  may  be  due  to  a  greater-thananticipated supply chain slow-down from Japan, I believe that a housing market characterized by low equity values, poor servicing, supply overhang and deteriorating quality, and the greater duration of unemployment, are  weighing  heavily  on  home  equity  values  and  consumer  sentiment,  slowing  the  growth  of consumption and aggregate demand.

Consumer sentiment remains low.  Its tumble  in March was primarily driven by higher prices  at  the pump as well  as higher  food prices,  but some of these effects have subsided and consumer sentiment remains low. The  effect  of stagnant  wages,  anemic  job  creation  and  reduced  home  equity  values  is  hindering  growth  in consumer demand.

Labor markets remain far from recovery.  Downward pressure on wages remains significant.  Federal workers, who comprise the largest employee group, remain under frozen wages.  Labor force participation is at historic lows.  The numbers of part-time-of-necessity,  marginally attached and discouraged workers are pushing the number of unemployed in the US to upwards of 29.3 million.  Until there is more momentum in re-absorbing this number into sustainable jobs,  it  appears unlikely that growth will quickly accelerate.

Respondent  14:

The  recent  economic  data  has  been  somewhat  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  April  forecast. The persistence of negative shocks such  as higher oil prices,  bad weather,  sovereign debt  developments,  and the supply chain  disruptions  associated  with  the  Japan  disaster  has  been  greater  than  I  anticipated. I  expect this  recent  weakness  to  be  temporary though  and  that  the  economy  is  poised  for  moderately  above-trend growth in the second half of 2011  and 2012.

As  the  recovery  strengthens,  I  expect  a  modest  pace  of  2.8  percent  growth  in  2011,  down  slightly  from my April forecast and at about my longer run trend rate.

I  expect  growth  in  2012  to  run  at  about  a  3.4  percent  pace  and  then  fall  to  a  3  percent  pace  in  2013, which  remains  slightly  above  my  long-run  trend. The  labor  market  recovery  is  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment  rate to move  down to  about  6.5  percent  by the  end  of the  forecast  horizon,  at  which  time it  remains  above my estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  I  anticipate that inflation will run  at  a strong pace in the first  half of 2011  and then pull back a bit over the forecast horizon as temporary factors

wane and in response to tighter monetary policy than that anticipated in the Tealbook.

In  my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk  that inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels  and  that  inflation  expectations  may  become  unan­ chored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  15:

Balance sheet  adjustments by households,  businesses,  and  financial  institutions  are  likely to  play out  over the  next  several  years. In  this  environment,  consumer  spending  is  likely to  be  considerably  more  modest than more ordinary cyclical  dynamics would suggest.  Recovery is  also likely to be muted by ongoing fiscal uncertainties that  are unlikely to be resolved in the near-term.

I  am  of the  view  that  the  worst  of the  commodity-induced  increases  in  inflation  are  behind  us. I  expect that this development,  along with stability of inflation expectations and restrained pace of wage growth, will bring some relief to headline and underlying inflation.

The  broadly  weaker  data  since  April  suggests  that  the  down-side  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  have  in­ tensified. In  addition to the  impact  of high  food  and oil  prices,  the  weakening in labor  market  conditions, combined with  falling  equity prices,  flat  home  values,  and  persistently soft  consumer  sentiment,  is  placing more pressure on consumer spending.  If consumer spending does not pickup over the next few months I am concerned that business investment plans  are likely to be cut substantially.

Regarding inflation,  I think there is a chance that the influence of commodity prices and other pressures on the core inflation numbers could play out  for a longer time than I have  assumed and inflationary sentiment could be adversely affected as a result.

Respondent  16:

Information received since the time of the April projections indicates that the economic recovery is proceed­ ing at  a slower pace than previously anticipated.  Since the beginning of this year,  the real outlook has been progressively  downgraded:  The  cumulative  downward  revision  to  GDP  growth  over  the  period  2011-2012 now amounts to  1.6 percentage points.  As a result,  the unemployment rate is currently expected to remain above  8  percent  by  the  end  of  2012. A  meaningful  and  sustained  acceleration  of growth  above  potential continues to be pushed further out into the forecast horizon.

While  temporary  factors  have  contributed  to  this  year's  first-half setbacks,  other  more  persistent  factors are weighing down the underlying pace of the recovery.  The large amount of labor market slack is depress­ ing wage growth  and disposable personal  income is suffering  as  a result.  Retrenchments  in  state  and local spending have been so far larger than anticipated,  and residential investment is moribund.  While the modal forecast calls for an acceleration of growth from the current lackluster pace,  the recovery is likely to remain slow by historical standards.  Fiscal policy is turning contractionary, thus limiting gains in disposable income. The  evolution  of households'  net  worth  is  constrained  by  continued  weakness  in  the  housing  market,  and there is little so far suggesting a rapid turnaround in residential investment.  The outlook for state and local spending remains  grim,  and  the  potential  for  more  aggressive  budget  cuts  both  at  the  federal  and  at  the state and local level over the course of the forecast horizon cannot be ruled out.  Credit availability for some sectors of the economy remains impaired.  A key assumption in the forecast is that European problems  are contained and do not have a large impact on the US.

Overall,  the  ongoing  recovery  is  undesirably  slow  relative  to  the  depth  of  the  recession. GDP  growth this  year  is  not  expected  to  be  faster  than  potential. A more vigorous  pace of growth is expected only in

2012  and  2013. The potential downside risks to the real  outlook remain costlier  than the  potential  upside risks.  The labor market is a source of significant  concern.  The slow pace of the recovery is generating very long duration spells  of unemployment,  and these  long unemployment spells  could severely cripple  workers' chances of becoming re-employed.

Recent increases in core inflation likely reflect some pass-through from higher commodity prices and supplychain  effects  from  the  Japanese  earthquake. These  effects  should  be  transitory. The  increase  in  owners' equivalent  rent  could  prove  more  persistent. However,  given  the  ongoing  declines  in  house  prices,  it  is unclear  whether  the  recent  evolution  of this  price  category  accurately reflects  a  fundamental  source  of in­ flationary pressures in the flow of housing services.  Wage compensation growth remains very subdued,  and economic slack should continue to put  downward pressure  on  inflation.  In  all,  core inflation is expected to step down to about  1   ¼   percent  over the course of 2012-13.

Respondent  17:

We continue to suffer from an overhang of housing and an overhang of debt.  The sharp deterioration in the fiscal outlook that has occurred as a result of the recession has increased concerns about  future taxes.  Con­ sumers are discouraged and fatigued by the slow and uneven pace of the recovery,  and have been squeezed by high energy prices.  Business contacts complain of the rising cost of a wide variety of imported goods-not just  raw  commodities. Still,  the  main  focus  of firms'   expansion  plans  is  overseas. There  is  significant  and growing risk that the marketplace will misjudge our resolve to maintain price stability.

Forecast  N arratives  (continued)

4(c).  Please  describe  any  im portant  differences  betw een  your  current  econom ic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent  1:

Compared to Tealbook, my forecast calls for less growth in 2012  and 2013.  But due to a sharper downward revision  in  the  Tealbook,  the  two  forecasts  are  now  much  closer  than  they  were  in  April. My projections for  both  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  remain  similar  to  the  Tealbook  in  the  near-term. However,  my forecast path has both inflation measures returning to 2.0% by the end of 2013.

Respondent  2:

Compared to the 70% confidence intervals  for the Tealbook forecasts,  the differences between the point es­ timates in the  Tealbook baseline forecast  and my projections are not different in any meaningful statistical sense.  However I see higher inflation in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent  with  appropriate  monetary policy.  In  contrast  the  Tealbook  forecast  sees  an  'extended  period' of low inflation.

Respondent  3:

Our projections of overall  activity do not  differ materially from those contained in the  Tealbook.  Our pro­ jection of inflation is higher,  since we put less weight on slack as a determinant of inflation.  Combined with my view that we should target a  1   1/2 percent inflation rate,  that higher projection would lead us to begin to remove policy accommodation by year-end.

Respondent  4:

I  do not  see inflation falling from 2011  to 2012.

Respondent  5:

We continue to assume lower inflation persistence than does the  Tealbook.  Given changes in both our fore­ cast  and the  Tealbook forecast,  this differing assumption has little impact  for the  2011  and  2012  forecasts. However,  at  longer horizons,  under the  assumption of well  anchored inflation expectations,  we project that core  and overall inflation will move more quickly toward the  2%  objective than does the Tealbook forecast.

Based  on  our  assumptions  of modest  increases  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and  average  weekly hours,  we expect  a somewhat greater decline in the unemployment rate than is projected in the Tealbook.

Respondent  6:

I  continue to be less confident that oil prices will remain subdued over the  forecast period.

Respondent  7:

The key difference is  the  monetary policy path.  In  my view,  appropriate  monetary policy should  follow  a path considerably different than in Tealbook, to foster the longer-run stability of the economy.  As a result, I expect slower growth in 2013.  In addition, I expect inflation to be higher in 2012 and 2013.  The difference in inflation forecasts reflects different  views on the relative importance of inflation expectations  and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

Respondent  8:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

We have  attributed  more  of the  recent  weakness  to transitory  factors  and  thus  have  a  forecast  for  output growth that is somewhat above that of the Tealbook.

Respondent  11:

Continue to be somewhat more pessimistic about growth and employment in 2012 and beyond.  Although I think it  is  reasonable  to expect  growth to  pick up  at  some  point,  we  have  seen relatively little  evidence  of such  a pickup so far.  Indeed,  there seems to have been  a net  loss of momentum since the  beginning of the year.  Inflation forecasts  are similar.

Respondent  16:

The forecast for real  activity is very similar to the  Tealbook forecast.  Core inflation is projected to remain somewhat lower than in the Tealbook.

Respondent  17:

Despite upward revisions to its forecasts, the Tealbook remains considerably more optimistic about the infla­ tion outlook than I am.  I believe that the Tealbook mistakes the pace at which policy stimulus will need to be withdrawn in order to keep inflation under control, and I have a more stringent definition of price stability.

Forecast  N arratives  (continued)

4(d).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since  the previous  quarter's  projections.

Respondent  1:

Overall,  I view the recent weak data as reflecting mostly,  although not  entirely,  transitory factors.  Accord­ ingly,  I have revised down my GDP forecast for the first half of 2011  from 2.5 percent in April to 1.9 percent, and nudged down my projections for 2012 and 2013.

Despite  low  levels  of  resource  utilization,  underlying  inflation  has  picked  up  in  recent  months. While  I attribute  some  of the May jump  up  in  the  core CPI  to  transitory factors,  the  median CPI  has  risen  at  an annualized  rate  of 2.0  percent  over  the  past  6  months,  compared  to just  1.0  percent  over  the  six  months prior. Accordingly,  I  have  marked  up  my  forecast  for  both  core  and  overall  PCE  inflation  relative  to  my April projection.

Respondent  2:

My forecasts  for  near-term  real  growth  have  been  revised  downward  reflecting  slower  growth  to  date  this year than I  had previously expected.  My forecast  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  has been revised  up to reflect the recent weaker than expected growth this year.  I have revised my near-term projections of inflation upward  to  reflect  the  unanticipated  rise  in  oil  prices  on  headline  inflation,  and  higher  than  expected  core PCE inflation since the beginning of 2011.

Respondent  3:

The data flow on overall  activity has softened since the last projection.  Consumer spending has been weak in 5 of the last  6 months.  Supply-chain disruptions following the Japanese earthquake have reduced growth in the current quarter.  High energy prices have reduced real incomes and boosted inflation.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

As stated earlier,  the soft  data on consumer expenditures,  the downward revisions to the income data,  the recent weakness in labor market conditions,  continued tepid data on consumer confidence,  and expectations that  energy prices  will  remain elevated (which  will  impact  discretionary income  and  consumer  confidence) have led us to mark down our real PCE growth forecast  through 2012.  Primarily because of these factors, our projected real GDP growth path is lower throughout this period.

The unemployment rate has ticked up in the last two months.  Combined with the weak May labor market report and the elevated level of initial claims for unemployment insurance, we have raised our projected path for  the unemployment rate throughout the forecast horizon.

Because  of the  recent  declines  in  energy  prices  and  in  the  CPI  energy  index,  we  have  lowered  our  near term total  PCE inflation  forecast. The recent  data  on  core  PCE  inflation has  been  higher  than we  antici­ pated,  and so we have  raised our near-term projection  for core inflation.  For both total  and core inflation, these developments have had little impact on our medium-term inflation central outlook.

In  regard  to  our  risk  assessment  for  real  economic  activity,  the  recent  weakness  in  the  consumer  spend­ ing  data,  the  softness  in  labor  market  conditions,  and  the  general  soft  tone  of the  recent  data  raise  the probability of a more prolonged stagnation than is  anticipated in our central outlook.  In  addition,  the Eu­ ropean sovereign  debt  crisis  appears  to have  escalated  and  there  remains  the  possibility of a  greater  fiscal consolidation (either through an  agreement by the political parties  or  forced through  a debt  ceiling crisis),

which suggests some more immediate downside risks to the real outlook.  Consequently,  our risk assessment for real activity is more skewed to the downside than it was in April, reflecting both an increase in downside risks and a reduction in upside risks.

For  the  inflation  risk  assessment,  the  decline  in  the  5-10  year  TIPS-implied  inflation  compensation  over the  intermeeting  period  suggests  a  modestly  smaller  probability  that  inflation  expectations  are  becoming unmoored.  This has  led  to  a  modest  reduction  in  the  longer-term  upside  inflation  risks,  although  we  still characterize the inflation risk assessment  as broadly balanced.

Respondent  6:

Significantly less favorable than expected data reports over the last  few months.

Respondent  7:

The main change in my forecast is lower growth in 2011, reflecting the slower growth in the first half due to events in Japan and higher energy and commodity prices.

Respondent  8:

The disappointing data since  April have  been  a major  factor  driving my  forecast  revisions  to real  activity and inflation.  Indicators of real economic activity have,  on balance,  surprised to the downside,  but  parsing out how much of the slowdown in growth is temporary and how much is more lasting is the key issue.  As the downside surprises to real activity have accumulated, it now appears that the recovery lost some momentum. Still, the price effects of the projected slower growth have not been enough to offset the recent higher readings on inflation,  which suggest some greater pressures to underlying inflation.

Respondent  9:

Most changes in my forecast reflect weak incoming data.

Respondent  10:

The incoming data point to less robust  GDP growth in the first half of 2011  than we had assumed in April. We have also reduced our estimate of the strength of demand in the remainder of this year and early 2012 on the basis of what seems to be a less favorable dynamic between labor market recovery and consumer spending.

Core and total inflation also have risen  a bit  faster than we projected.  However,  as described above,  we do not think these increases will have much influence on inflation beyond the near term.

Respondent  11:

Mostly the incoming data:  Growth, employment, consumption, manufacturing surveys have all been weaker than  expected,  and  financial  markets  are  signalling  growth  concerns. The  supply  chain  disruptions  were perhaps  a  bit  worse  than  expected  as  of the  April  projections  (though  they  are  clearing  up  now)  but  the effects  are roughly offset  by declines in oil  prices.  So on net  the data point  to  a  further loss  of momentum relative  to  April. While  it  is  hard  to  pinpoint  the  underlying  cause,  the  slowdowns  in  consumption,  jobs, housing etc. are  interrelated  in  the  obvious  ways,  e.g.,  if greater  consumer  caution  implies  less  spending, that  affects employment,  which affects housing demand and consumer spending,  etc.

Respondent  12:

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

Recent weaker-than-expected data has led me to revise down my near-term projection.

Respondent  15:

I  have  revised  down my 2011  growth  forecast  in light  of the  weaker  than expected  incoming  data through May.  I  am still  inclined  to  interpret  these  data,  and  the  numbers  for  household spending  in  particular,  as a  temporary  setback  produced  by  higher  gasoline  prices  and  supply  disruptions  related  to  the  Tsunami. My near-term inflation  outlook  has  been  revised  slightly higher  as  a  result  of the  stronger  recent  inflation indicators.

Respondent  16:

Weakness  in the  private  sources  of personal  income,  lower  household's  net  worth,  a  weaker  labor  market, and  continued  setbacks  in  construction  are  all  factors  contributing  to  the  downward  revision  to  the  nearand medium-term outlook  for  the  real  economy. Temporary adverse  shocks  are  also  playing  a role. Some of the  temporary elevation  in  core  inflation  carries  over  to  the  medium term  because  of persistence  in  the inflation process.

Respondent  17:

Recent data have caused me to revise downward my estimate of first-half GDP growth.  However,  I believe that temporary factors-including disruptions associated with the Japanese earthquake and tsunami-are be­ hind much of this weakness, so I have made only a marginal downward adjustment to Q4/Q4 GDP growth and left my forecasted path for the unemployment rate unchanged.  I've revised my out-year  'core'  inflation forecasts upward to show a stronger tendency for headline and core inflation measures to converge.  I believe that ex-food-and-energy measures can distort  inflation trends over substantial periods,  so I report  forecasts of trimmed-mean inflation,  instead.
