Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate that  the  convergence  process  will take  shorter or longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estimate  of  the duration of  the  convergence  process. You may  also include below  any  other explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1:

In light of the severity and  breadth  of  shocks  to the economy  and  the  continuing,  though  reduced,  risk  of more  to  come,  the  convergence process  may  well extend beyond  five  or six years  to something  closer  to  eight years.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

I anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  substantially  shorter  than 5-6 years,  perhaps  on  the  order  of  three  years  for  real  growth  (with  a  period  of  overshoot  of  real  growth  in the interim during recovery.) and  an overshoot in the interim in inflation as a consequence of significant  near term  growth in the monetary  base  supported by longer  term  asset  purchases  that  cannot be  sold  off over a very  short  time  period. I anticipate  that  the  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  will  lag  behind  the  recovery of real growth.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

Convergence to the real economy's equilibrium and  to the inflation objective  within five years requires  considerably  lower  long-term  interest  rates  in  the  near-term  than  what  is  assumed  in  the  baseline  outlook. Absent such  a  reduction  in  long-term  rates,  it  is  unlikely  that  the  dual  mandate's  objectives  will  be  achieved  within a five-year  horizon.

Respondent 6:

If appropriate  policy  is followed, I would  expect  convergence  to  occur  within  5  to  6  years. However,  I  am concerned that  delaying the removal of policy  accommodation and shrinkage of our balance sheet could  result in higher  inflation  and  correspondingly  take  a  longer  time  to  reach  a  desired  inflation  rate  of  1.8 percent.

Respondent 7:

Between 4 and 6 years, and possibly longer given the  damage to the financial  sector, the depth of the  recession,  and  the  difficult  domestic  and  global  adjustments  required.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

By  2015  potential  growth  is  2.4%,  down  from  our  current  estimate  of  2.5-2.7%,  as  the  babyboomers  retire and  there  are  some  lingering  effects  from  the  present  contraction  of  the  capital  stock. A  reasonable  estimate for the long-run unemployment  rate  is 4.5% to 5.5%. We  would  expect, with appropriate policy and no further  adverse  shocks,  unemployment  to  be  in  this  range  and  the  output  gap  to  be  around  zero  by  2015.

We  assume  long-term  inflation  expectations  to  be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis  and  the  FOMC's inflation  objective  to be  around  2% for  the  PCE deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI.  Under  these  conditions,  with  the  output  gap  around  zero,  we  would  expect  PCE  inflation  of  around  2%.

Respondent 10:

N/A

Respondent 11:

I expect that the economy  will  take about  seven years to converge  fully because  of the magnitude  of  the forecasted degree of slack and the  limits on  monetary  stimulus resulting from the zero lower bound  on interest rates.

Respondent 15:

At a 5-6 year horizon, the economy  has yet to fully converge for output and unemployment. Given the substantial  weakness  in  my  near-term  projection,  the  convergence  process  will  likely  take  7-8  years.

The  uncertainty  associated  with  my projections  of  growth  and  unemployment  is  high  relative  to  the past  20 years  because  reduced  household  wealth,  strained  credit  conditions,  and  the  severity  of  the  recession  make anticipating the nature of the recovery more difficult than usual. On  the other hand, given appropriate monetary  policy,  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  relatively  low.

Respondent 9:

Quantitative judgment  based  on  standard  deviation  of  FRBNY forecast  distribution  for  GDP  growth  and core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  forecast  errors  over  the  last  20  years.

Respondent 10:

Despite  continuing  improvements,  it  is  uncertain  how  long  the  drag  from  credit  markets  will  last. Adding  to this  uncertainty  is  how  much  an  extremely  weak  labor  market,  low  levels  of  wealth  and  volatile  energy  prices will impact  consumption. The  ultimate  impact  of  the  Federal  fiscal  stimulus  is  also  a  source  of  uncertainty. Exactly  how  states  and  localities address their  unusually  stressed budgets  increases  the  fiscal  uncertainty. The  different  potential  sources  for  the  increase  in  long-term  yields-improved  sentiment;  worries  over  future deficits;  or higher  inflation  expectations-also  add  a  range  of  uncertainties  to  the  outlook.

Respondent 11:

The global financial and economic  crisis and  uncertainty about the  effects of fiscal policy and unconventional monetary  policies  increase  uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook  for  economic  activity. Heightened  risks  to  the outlook for economic  activity and employment,  as  well as elevated variability of commodity  prices, raise uncertainty  regarding  the  outlook  for  inflation.

Respondent 12:

N/A

Respondent 13:

My  judgment  of  uncertainty  around  inflation projections being low relative to levels over the last twenty years  is based  on  expectations  being  well  anchored  under  appropriate  policy.

Respondent 14:

Though  financial  market  conditions  are  improving,  stresses  remain  that  lead  to  greater  uncertainty  about the pace of economic  recovery. In addition, traditional monetary  policy  is likely to be constrained  by  the zero bound  for  some  time  and  the  precise  impact  of  quantitative  easing  on  the  economy  is  uncertain. For these  reasons,  I  view  forecast  uncertainty  as  higher  than  usual.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

With  conditions in the economy and financial markets-both here and abroad-still without previous precedent in the past-war period, uncertainty about the outlook for asset prices, economic  activity and inflation is quite  elevated. Among the  elements  contributing  to  heightened  uncertainty  are  the  speed  of  financial  market repair, the response  of spending-especially household spending- to previous  declines in wealth and  changing financial  conditions,  and  the  effect  of persistent  elevated  output  gaps  on  inflation  and inflation  expectations.

Going  forward into  2010  as  the  economy  recovers from the current  recession  and  experiences the  fiscal  stimulus program  as well as substantial persistent increases in the  monetary  base, I believe  that the risks to real growth  will  become  weighted  to  the  upside. In  the  near  term  I  see  the  risks  to  inflation  as  broadly  balanced.

Respondent 5:

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9:

Quantitative judgment  based  on the difference  between projection and  expected value from FRBNY forecast distribution. For  inflation,  risks  are  to  the  downside  in  the  near  term  and  to  the  upside  in  the  medium  term.

Respondent 10:

The  dire  scenarios  that  previously  were  a  source  of  downside  risk  to  growth  now  seem  less  likely. However, there  is a new  downside  risk  that  the  increases  in  long-term  interest  rates  reflect  crowding  out  of  credit  to the private sector due to high budget  deficits  as opposed to improved expectations of higher future growth. There is an upside risk that aggressive inventory control and pent-up demand  will generate a more  pronounced  cyclical  recovery.

The  downside  risks  to  inflation  in  the  near  term  seem  to  have  abated  somewhat,  but  are  still  present  due  to the substantial  slack  in the economy. Rising  energy  prices  are  a source  of upside  risk to inflation over the near  term. Over  the  longer  term,  there  is  a  risk  that  actual  or  perceived  difficulties  in  unwinding  the  large expansion  of  the  Fed's  balance  sheet  will  boost  inflationary  expectations.

Respondent 11:

The continuing possibility of further financial  market  disruptions represents a significant downside risk  to the outlook  for  growth. For example,  the looming  problem in  commercial real estate poses additional downside risks to financial  stability  and  the  outlook  for  economic  activity. The  sizable  downside  risks  to  the  outlook for economic  activity  imply  greater  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  for  inflation. In addition,  the  large  degree of slack  in  labor  and  product  markets  could  put  more  downward  pressure  on  inflation  than  currently  anticipated.

Respondent 14:

Incoming  data  have  led  me  to  revise  down  my  near-term  path  for  growth  and  raise  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  compared  to  my  April  forecast. I view the risks to growth  and  the unemployment  rate  as roughly  balanced. Over  the  longer  term,  inflation  risk  is  tilted  to  the  upside  reflecting  uncertainty  about  the Fed's  ability  to  reduce  the  size  of  its  balance  sheet  at  the  appropriate  time.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

The persistent  stability of  consumer spending  and  housing demand along with  the abatement of  risk aversion suggest  that  the  risks  around  the  central  tendency  for  activity  are  now  roughly  balanced,  after  having  been skewed  to the downside  for some  time. That  is, the possibility of a faster return to more  normal  market functioning  and  a positive feedback into economic  growth now balances  the  still  significant  odds  on a  financial or economic  accident  that  significantly  slows  or  forestalls  the  recovery  . The  risks  of inflation  falling faster in response  to  very  high  output  gaps  globally  is  balanced  by  the  risk  of  inflation  expectations  staying  stable or even  rising a bit with  the recent  rise in commodity  prices  and  concerns  about  long-term  interactions  of fiscal and  monetary policies.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy

- 3. Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  interest  rates  differ  materially from  the  interest  rate  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Greenbook?

Respondent 1: No

N/A

Respondent 2: No

N/A

Respondent 3: Yes

While the  exact  timing  and pattern of  recovery  from the current  recession is highly  uncertain, I believe  that under  appropriate  monetary  policy  to  maintain  price  stability  we  will  have  to  move  away  from  the  current target range  for  the funds  rate  as  part of the  process of withdrawing from  quantitative  easing  much  sooner than  assumed  in  the  Greenbook  forecast.

Respondent 4: No

N/A

Respondent 5: No

The  forecast  is conditioned  on  roughly  the  same  short- and  long-term  interest  rates  assumptions  as  in  the Greenbook.  But  this  path  for  the  interest  rates  is  not  consistent  with  optimal  monetary  policy.

Respondent 6: Yes

Like Greenbook, I  assume the funds rate target  will be  maintained in the range of 0  to 1/4 percent  through at least  the  middle  of  2010. However,  I  expect  it  will  be  necessary  to  start  raising  the  funds  rate  in  late  2010 or early  2011.

In my judgement, appropriate policy  also involves  reducing the size of  our  balance  sheet in a timely manner.

Respondent 7: No

N/A

Respondent 8: Yes

I continue  to  expect  the  Federal  funds  rate  to  begin  to  increase  sometime  in  the  second  half  of  2010  or  early 2011.

Respondent 9: Yes

Through  2009-10  identical. We  assume  the  normalization  of  interest  rates  starts  in  2011. Because  of  differences in  our inflation  forecast,  real policy  rates remain  similar in  2011. Our  views  on the size of the balance sheet  are  close  to  the  Greenbook  assumption.

Respondent 10: Yes

We assume the funds  rate will follow a path near that expected by futures markets. We also assume that the Fed will take active measures  to reduce  the size of our  balance sheet and  not just let it run down passively as assets  mature.

Respondent 11: No

N/A

Respondent 12: No

N/A

Respondent 13: Yes

I believe that  under  an appropriate  monetary policy the  committee  would  announce a numerical inflation objective. Further,  the  committee  would  need  to  communicate  its  strategy  for  shrinking  the  Fed's  balance sheet  in a timely  manner  to  meet  that  objective. I also believe  that  it is likely to be necessary  to  raise  the funds  rate  well  before  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 14: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  federal  funds  rate  than  in  the  Greenbook  baseline. I view  the  appropriate  policy  as  rasing  the  funds  rate  toward  the  end  of  2009  or  early  2010  to  0.5  percent. The  funds  rate  rises  gradually  through  the  forecast  horizon  reaching  2.5  percent  at  the  end  of  2010  and  3.5 percent  at  the  end  of  2011.

Respondent 15: Yes

Yes. In my  projection,  the  federal  funds  rate  begins  to  increase  gradually  in  the  second  half  of  2010,  due  to a stronger  inflation  profile  in  my  forecast.

Respondent 16: No

Respondent 17: Yes

Expect  policy  to  normalize  materially  sooner  than  under  Greenbook  base  case

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook.

Respondent 1:

The  pace  of  deterioration  of  most  important  economic  indicators  has  clearly  decelerated  and,  in  some  cases, stabilized. Thus a bottom  is  now  at  least  in sight, even  if  not yet realized. However, I  continue  to believe that important  parts of  capital  markets will  remain unusually encumbered for  some time to come, that the housing  sector  will  take  a  considerable  time  to  recover,  and  that  structural  changes  in  important  economic sectors  will  retard  employment  growth  well  beyond  the  end  of  the  recession.

Respondent 2:

I chose  the  slower  recovery  scenario  from  the  greenbook. This  assumption  is  based  on  a  concern  that  credit availability will be constrained  for  some  time. Given  my  choice  of  a fairly pessimistic  scenario, I view  the risks as roughly  balanced.

Respondent 3:

The unfolding path of economic  activity  in the  first half of  2009 is consistent  with my  earlier expectation of slowing  contraction in the first  half  with  output bottoming  out in  the middle of the year  and  recovery in the second  half. Hence  I  have  not  revised  my  previous  forecast  for  real  growth. In 2010  and  2011  I  anticipate that  real  growth  will  occur  at  greater  than  steady-state  rates,  reflecting  normal  cyclical  patterns  reinforced by  a  modest  impact  of  the  fiscal  stimulus package  and  the  impact  of  the  substantial  monetary  stimulus  that has been  in  train  since  last  fall. Core PCE  inflation  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  last year  through  the  most recently  released data  is  in  the  range  of  2.0 percent  at  an  annual  rate  - higher  than I previously  expected. I do  not  see this rate  of inflation  abating  in  the  near  future. While  headline  PCE  inflation  since  the  fourth quarter  of last year  through the  most  recently  released  data  is  essentially  zero, the  recent  increases  in  energy prices leads me to expect  that the headline  rate  will approach the core rate as  2009 progresses. Subsequently, under appropriate  monetary policy, inflation  should approach  my preferred  long-run rate of  1.5 percent. I do  not  believe  that  future  energy  shocks  can  be  forecasted,  so  with  available  information  I  expect  that  core and  headline  inflation  will  be  roughly  equal  in  the  out  years  of  the  projection  period.

Respondent 4:

The  data  suggest  either  stabilization  or  a  much  slower  rate  of  decline  in  final  sales  both  here  and  abroad. As a result, further progress  in  the  inventory  cycle  should lead  to positive  growth  later  this year,  strengthening next year as the recovery  begins to gather steam  and  the fiscal package  kicks in. Financial  markets  have improved  notably, including markets for short-term and long-term credit, and the successful stress tests have increased  confidence  in  the  banking  system. Higher  interest  rates and  oil prices are risks but I view  these mostly  as endogenous  responses  to  the  improved  outlook. Despite  the improving  picture, final demand  is unlikely  to  grow  quickly: consumers  are  dealing  with  wealth  loss  and  rising  unemployment,  housing  will  be hit by  higher  mortgage  rates,  capital  investment  (both  equipment  and  structures)  is  still  declining,  and  net exports  are  unlikely  to  strengthen  much. Unemployment  has  risen  surprisingly  quickly  and  seems  likely  to remain  high  for a while, though  any  increase  in  the natural  rate is likely to be modest. Energy  and  commodity prices,  some increase in inflation expectations  will prevent  increasing slack from  generating too great a decline in inflation. Risks around  growth  and  inflation  are more  balanced,  as the likelihood of a major financial crisis has receded  and  the possibility of a more  vigorous  rebound, similar to that seen in earlier recessions,  cannot  be  discounted. Imbalances,  including  those  related  to  bank  and  household  balance  sheets, fiscal policy, labor  allocation,  and the  current  account  will  continue to  complicate  the  return to sustainable growth.

Respondent 5:

Incoming  data  continue  to  be consistent with the view that the deterioration  in economic  activity  is now

levelling  off. We expect the economy  to  return to mild positive growth in the second half of this year. There is considerable uncertainty  about the ultimate  strength of the recovery, but several factors point to a subpar recovery. In the near term, continued  deterioration in the labor market  will make  for subdued  consumer spending. The  high level of the unemployment  rate  will  raise  the number  of  foreclosures and  put further downward  pressure  on  house  prices. The  decline in households'  net worth  requires consumers  to  increase their savings out of disposable  income, and the  need  to  repair balance sheets  will restrain spending this year and  next. Continued  disruptions  to  credit  supply  should  also  play  an  important  role,  as  credit-constrained consumers will have to postpone the purchase of  big-ticket  items. The recent increase in  mortgage  rates  will reduce  even  further  residential  investment's  contribution  to  the  recovery. Credit  supply  constraints  will  also hamper  a  faster turnaround  in  capital spending. The  foreign sector, too, should  provide  little support  as several of our  foreign partners  will experience, at best, very modest growth as a result of  limited  support from  monetary  and  fiscal  policy  and  continued  difficulties  in  their  financial  sectors.

In all, these factors point to a shallow recovery in the second half of this year and in 2010. The  unemployment  rate  is  still  very  high  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon  despite  an  acceleration  in  growth  in  2011 as credit  constraints  wane. Given  the  sizable  slack  in  the  labor  market  over  the  forecast  horizon,  the  rate  of core  inflation  hovers  around  zero  percent  in  2011.

The risks to real activity are tilted to the downside. Conditions  at many  financial institutions will continue to worsen  as a result of the sharp  increase in the unemployment  rate,  thus  raising  the  likelihood  of further  restrictions  to  credit  supply. As  concerns  inflation,  the  risks  are  to  the  downside,  too. The  downside risks  are  not just due  to  real-side uncertainty,  but  are  also the result  of  our limited  experience  with  near-zero inflation. Given  the unemployment  rate  forecast, our models  would  predict outright deflation starting in 2010. We  tempered  this  deflationary  outlook  by  taking  into  account  the  fact  that  downward  nominal  rigidities could  attenuate  the  inflation-unemployment  trade-off. Still, the  risks  of deflation  are  significant.

Respondent 6:

My  outlook  for  economic  activity  has  not  changed  materially  since  our  last  meeting. While  the  economy  is likely  to contract  in  the  second  quarter,  we  are  seeing  signs  that  the  pace  of  decline  is  slowing  and  financial stress is diminishing. As a  result, I  am  more  confident that we  are closer to a bottom  and that we  are  likely to see positive growth  in the second  half of this year. Overall, I expect accommodative  monetary  policy, stimulative  fiscal  policy,  and  less  financial  stress  will lead  to a slow  recovery  in  the  second  half  of  this  year and  stronger  growth  in  2010  and  2011. The  recent  increase  in  energy  prices  and  longer-term  interest  rates may  limit  the  strength  of  the  recovery,  but  are  unlikely  to  derail  it.

While some downside risks to the outlook remain, they have diminished. A continued deterioration in commercial  real estate and C&amp;I  loans at banks could lead to a reduction in credit extension and credit availability,  which poses a downside risk to the economy. However, an improvement in real economic activity and  a  reduction  in  financial  stress  has  somewhat  reduced  the  downside  risks.

The  recent  increase  in  core  inflation  appears  largely  due  to  special  factors,  and  economic  weakness  will  likely keep core rates low for some  time. Downside  inflation risks in the near-term  have diminished. However, over  the  longer-term,  there  are  significant  upside  risks  to  inflation  if  we  maintain  an  overly  accommodative monetary  policy  for  an  extended  period  of  time.

Respondent 7:

Despite  encouraging  developments,  we  are  very  far  from  being  out  of  the  woods. Wage  and  salary  income  is now  falling  (for the first time  in 50 years), putting  intense  strain  on  household  finances. The  deteriorating performance  of  consumer  and  commercial  real  estate  loans  could  put  new  pressure  on  the  financial  system if the economy  does not gain meaningful traction soon. Fiscal stimulus and a slowing rate of inventory liquidation  will carry us only so far. The  banking  outlook,  especially  for  global  banks  that  are too big to fail, is the  wild  card  impacting  the  transmission  of  monetary  policy. And  the  plethora  of  new  economic  and

regulatory  initiatives  is  creating  uncertainty  among  business  decision  makers-uncertainty  that  might  retard commitments  to  expansion  of  employment  and  CAPEX.

Respondent 8:

Monetary and  fiscal policy  remain basically  stimulative. Credit conditions continue  to  improve, the inventory correction  ends,  and  housing  stabilizes  and  begins  to  move  up. The  dollar  declines  on  net, contributing  to growth  in  exports  and  risking  an  acceleration  in  inflation.

Respondent 9:

In our  central  projection,  the  US  economy  remains  in  recession  through  mid  2009,  making  this  the  longest recession of the post WWII period. At the trough, the level of  real GDP is 2 1 2 % below the NBER peak, only modestly  less  than  the  most  severe  recessions  of  that  period. By  the  second  half  of  2009  a  tepid  recovery  is expected  to take hold, aided by the preemptive path of  monetary policy, various initiatives to  foster financial market  stability, and aggressive fiscal stimulus measures. Growth  returns  to just above  its potential rate by  the  second  half  of  2010  and  then  accelerates  to  about  2 1 2 %  above  its  potential  rate  in  2011. Barring  a significant decline in the economy's potential growth rate, this point  forecast  implies that a large output gap will persist over this entire period. At the trough, the unemployment  rate is expected to be  around 10%, an increase of 5 percentage points above the level  at the peak. The unemployment rate is expected to  continue rising over the first year of recovery, with a peak  of around  10.5%,  as  growth  remains  relatively  sluggish. Thereafter,  the  unemployment  rate  moves  down  only  gradually. The  risks  to  this  modal  forecast  are  skewed to the downside  with  an  uncomfortably  high  probability  that  the  current  downturn  will  end  up  of  similar depth  and  duration  to  pre-World  War  II  contractions.

The  broad  outlines  of  this  central  projection  are  as  follows. Consumer  spending  remains  sluggish,  as  households boost saving in response to a massive decline in their net worth and credit conditions that while gradually easing, remain  relatively tight. The  correction in housing production  is expected  to be largely completed  by mid-2009, bringing to an end the large drag that was exerted on growth  for the past four years. Thereafter,  housing  production  is  likely  to improve,  but  the  surge of residential investment  experienced  in the early stages of most  post  WWII  recoveries  is  unlikely. Mortgage  underwriting  standards  are expected  to  remain  relatively  tight. Moreover,  high  volumes  of  existing  homes  will  continue  to  come  onto the market  through  the  foreclosure  process. Indeed,  the  correction  in  house  prices  is expected  to  continue through  the  end of 2010, with a cumulative  peak- to-trough  decline  in  the  Case-Shiller  10 city composite home price index of around 40 percent. Through  2009Q1 that index was down 31% from its  2006Q2 peak. Business  investment  in new  equipment  and  software  and  new  structures  is expected  to decline sharply in 2009,  as  capacity  utilization  rates  remain  at  historic  lows  and  retail  and  office  vacancy  rates  rise. In typical business cycle fashion, these components  of  final demand  do  not  begin  to  recover  until the second  half of 2010. In addition, with persistent weak  demand,  businesses  pare  inventories  over  the course of 2009, but the rate of decline slows such  that inventories  provide  a  modest  boost  to  growth  in  the  second  half  of the year. In 2010, as growth of  final  demand becomes somewhat better  established, businesses begin to build inventories  once  again. Exports,  which  plunged  from  2008Q4  through  mid  2009,  are  expected  to  rise  modestly  in the  second  half  of  2009  and  then  grow  more  rapidly  in  2010  as  global  growth  recovers. Imports  also begin  increasing  again  in  the  second  half  of  2009,  and  are  likely  to  increase  considerably  faster  than  exports, reflecting the high income elasticity  of  demand for imports  and  the  fact  that the business  cycle in the US is proceeding  somewhat  ahead  of  that  of  many  of  our  major  trading  partners. Accordingly,  net  exports  exert a drag  on  growth  in  the  second  half  of  2009  and  in  2010. Finally,  the  growth  contribution  of  the  government sector begins  to rebound  in  the  second  half of 2009  as the effects of the stimulus  legislation begin  to take hold. Underlying  this  projected  path  of  final demand  is  the  expectation  that  financial  market  functioning returns  to more  normal  conditions,  that  consumer  and  business  confidence  is  gradually  restored,  and  that the  appetite  for  risk  gradually  improves.

In this central scenario, total consumer  price inflation is close to zero over the first half of 2009 as the effects  of the  sharp  declines  in  energy  and  other  commodity  prices

during  2008Q4  work  their  way  through  the  system. Core  inflation, which  was  somewhat  volatile  over  the second  half  of  2008  and  first  half  of  2009,  is  expect  to  remain  relatively  low  over  the  second  half  of  2009  and first half of 2010, reflecting the significant slack in the US  economy. But  by the second  half of 2010 core inflation gradually increases as final demand  firms  within the context of anchored  inflation expectations. However,  it  will  likely take  until 2011  before  inflation  returns  to  the  mandate  consistent  range. We  expect continued  volatility  in  total  inflation  driven  by  large  fluctuations  in  energy  prices.

The risks to our central projection for real activity are substantial and are skewed to the downside. In the  near-term,  the  key  risk  is  that  financial  market  conditions  and  consumer  and  business  confidence  do  not improve  as  assumed. This  in turn  leads to lower  than  expected  asset  prices,  less  recovery  in  the supply  of credit  and,  therefore,  an  even  weaker  path  for  final  demand. A  related  risk  is  that,  even  if  financial  markets and  asset  prices  behave  as  assumed,  the  decline  of  household  net  worth  embedded  in  this  central  projection induces a  steeper-than-expected increase  of  the personal  saving  rate, keeping  consumer spending  weaker  for longer. The sharp increase in the prime age male unemployment  rate during the  current  cycle,  combined  with the large share  of workers  nearing  retirement  age,  make  this  risk  particularly  acute. Finally, an important risk  over the medium  term is the uncertainty  surrounding  our assumption of the  economy's potential growth rate. There is  considerable  concern  that  with the weakness of business investment  and  the reallocation of labor and capital that needs to occur, the economy's potential  growth  rate  has  slowed  significantly. Yet, over the past year productivity growth has been well  maintained at roughly 2 percent. Moreover, in  recent months the  labor  force participation  rate has moved significantly higher, suggesting  more  labor supply  going forward  than previous  estimates. These  trends  indicate  that  the economy's potential  growth  rate  has  not declined,  and  may  in  fact  have  moved  higher.

The  risks around  the central scenario for inflation are relatively balanced. Clearly, the significant downside  risk  to  the  growth  projection combined  with  the possibility  of  no meaningful  decline  in potential implies downside  risk  to  the  inflation  projection. In contrast,  with  the  aggressive  global  monetary  and  fiscal  policy response  to the ongoing  financial crisis, there is some  risk of higher inflation if the economy  proves  more resilient  than  in  our  central  scenario  while  potential  does  indeed  slow.

The heightened uncertainty associated with periods of banking and financial crisis as well as the uncertainty associated  with  the  timing,  magnitude,  and  effectiveness  of  policy  responses  have  resulted  in  highly elevated  uncertainty  around  our  central  projection  compared  to  typical  levels.

Respondent 10:

Monetary  accommodation,  fiscal  policy  stimulus, private sector financial adjustments, and the economy's natural cyclical adjustment dynamics  will result in a  resumption of growth in the  second half of  2009. Growth will remain below potential  for  some  time, reflecting  financial  headwinds, weak  foreign demand,  and  a  hesitancy  of  households  and  businesses  to  spend  in  the  current  environment. As  these  factors  diminish,  growth should  increase  above  potential  in  late 2010  and  2011. However,  the  growth  will  not  be  sufficient to close resource  gaps  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period.

Our  inflation  forecast  balances  the  forces  of  domestic  resource  gaps  against  the  possibility  that  persistently large  fiscal  deficits  and  the  Fed's  balance  sheet  will  have  upside  consequences  for  inflation  expectations. Our forecast  assumes  that  these  forces  will  roughly  cancel  so  that  inflation  will  settle  into  a  range  consistent  with our  dual  mandate.

Respondent 11:

Signs of  stabilization of the economy have emerged. In particular, consumer spending and housing may have reached  a  bottom  and  business  inventory  investment  is  poised  to  rebound  strongly. However,  labor  markets

continue  to  deteriorate,  business  spending  is  falling  sharply,  and  other  major  economies  are  contracting.

Financial conditions have improved overall, although recent increases in some longer-term interest rates could  impede  recovery. The  process  of  healing  the  banking  and  financial  sectors  will  proceed  slowly  and  impaired  financial  intermediation  will interfere  with  the pace  of  recovery for  some  time. In  addition,  households are in the midst  of  a lengthy  process  of  repairing  their  balance  sheets  that  have  been  weakened  by  massive stock  and  housing  market  losses.

Fiscal and monetary  stimulus  provide key drivers for recovery over the next few years. Significant slack in labor  and  goods  markets  should  keep  inflation  low,  but  well-anchored  inflation  expectations  should  help avoid  sustained  deflation.

Respondent 12:

Ongoing  financial market  dysfunction, rising household  savings rates, and lingering economic  uncertainty are likely to significantly inhibit the  recovery process. I have  incorporated only  a modest boost from  fiscal and  monetary  policy.

While the downside risks to my growth outlook have lessened some, the potential for an adverse shock to the financial system, an accelerated decline in foreign growth, or a further deterioration in consumer confidence  continue  to  tilt  the  balance  of  risk  around  my  growth  projection  to  the  downside.

I assume  that forces adversely affecting economic  growth  are  also weighing  on the economy's  growth  potential.

Respondent 13:

I believe  that  the  recession  will  end  in the next  few  months  and  that  the  economy  will  then  begin  to  grow slowly. I believe that business investment is likely  to be quite weak this year and that  fiscal policy effects  will be smaller  than  generally  expected,  as  appears  to  have  been  the  case  last  year. My  outlook  is  not  heavily dependent  on  the  amount  and  timing  of  fiscal  actions.

Respondent 14:

The  recent  data  on  labor  markets  have  been  weaker  than  what  I  anticipated  in  my  April  forecast. I expect continued  weakness  in  the  housing  sector, the poor  state of household  balance  sheets, tight credit market conditions  and  weak  economic  conditions  in  the  rest  of  the  world  to  hold  down  economic  growth  to  a  significantly below-trend  pace  through  the  first  half  of 2009. As these factors begin  to unwind,  the  economy rebounds to  an  above-trend  pace  of 3 percent  in  2010 before  edging  back  down  to  trend  at  2.7 percent  in 2011. In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  raises  the  risk  that  inflation will rapidly accelerate to unacceptable  levels  and  that inflation expectations  will become  unanchored. To ward off these developments, the FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady tightening  of  monetary policy  that begins  toward  the  end  of  2009  or  beginning  of  2010.

Respondent 15:

The  rapid  and  uneven  deterioration  in  employment  and job  openings  suggests  that  unemployment  will  continue to rise into early 2010. The extensive  reallocation of workers and other resources  required in the wake of the  recession  points  to  a  lengthy  period  of  high  unemployment.

My  forecast assumes that inflation expectations will be 'anchored' near current levels of roughly 2% throughout the forecast period. Despite worries of both rising inflation and lingering fears of deflation, available measures  of  inflation expectations  have  stayed  remarkably  stable. However,  considerable  uncertainty  continues  to  surround  the  level  of  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 16:

The  near-term  stability  of key components  of  private  final demand  and  increases  in  government  spending along with inventories of goods and houses coming  into better balance with sales spark a turnaround  in production  that  sets  in  motion  a  rise  in economic  activity. Demand  is  further  enhanced  over  time  by  past and  continued  improvements  in  financial  markets  that  better  allow  the  effects  of  monetary  policy  stimulus to show through to a lower cost of capital. the pace of recovery continues to be held back by cautious households  rebuilding wealth  and  coping  with weak  labor markets,  and by  the  slow pace of  financial  market normalization  as  bank  capital  builds  and  a  significant  amount  of  previously  securitized  borrowing  finds  new channels  of  intermediation.

Respondent 17:

Expect  less medium-term benefit from fiscal stimulus. Expect higher  NAIRU, lower productivity  and lower growth  rates  throughout  forecast  period. Finding  new  equilibrium  will  take  somewhat  longer  than  a  typical recovery.

Forecast  Narratives (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Greenbook

Respondent 1:

I am  influenced  by  several,  though  not  all,  the  factors  mentioned  in  the  Greenbook  in  connection  with  the alternative  'false  dawn'  and  'labor  market  damage'  scenarios.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

Relative  to  the  Greenbook  my  projection  is  for  slightly  slower  real  growth  in  2009H1;  about  the  same  rate of growth  for 2009H2  and  a  faster recovery  in 2010 with growth  slowing  in 2011  such that my  projection for the average  growth  rate  over  the  two  years  2010-2011  is  essentially  the  same  as  that  of  the  Greenbook. I project  higher  headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  than  the  Greenbook  in  2009H2  and  in  2010-2011. Finally my  projection  is  for  unemployment  to  peak  at  the  level  forecast  in  the  Greenbook,  but  to  decline  at  a  more steady  rate  than  the  Greenbook  forecast  over  2010  and  2011.

Respondent 4:

Slightly  more  worried  about  final  demand,  including  consumption,  investment,  and  housing,  none  of  which has stabilized in a convincing  fashion. See some  upside  risk  in global commodity  prices,  which  could  slow US  growth  and  increase  US  inflation.

Respondent 5:

The  differences  to  the  real  outlook  are  relatively  minor. As  concerns  inflation,  we  expect  core  inflation  to  be lower than in  the Greenbook,  as a result of a  more meaningful  trade-off between inflation  and  unemployment.

Respondent 6:

My  outlook  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  similar  to  the  Greenbook  outlook. However,  our  assumed policy paths  are  quite  different. Whereas  Greenbook  assumes  the  funds  rate  remains  in  the  current  range  of 0 to 1/4 percent  through  2011, I  assume  we  will begin  raising  the  funds rate in  late  2010  or early  2011  at the  latest.

Respondent 7:

The  Greenbook  baseline  forecast  underestimates  the  continuing  drag  on  the  economy  from  damage  to  the financial  sector, uncertainty  created  by  new  economic  and  regulatory  initiatives,  and,  increasingly,  deteriorating  household  cash  flow. It also  assumes  a  too-rapid  response  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  reductions  in the  output  gap  when  these  reductions  finally  do  take  hold. By  2011,  the  world  economy  recovers  sufficiently to begin  putting  upward  pressure  on  commodity  prices.

Respondent 8:

The  forecasts  are  reasonably  congruent  at  this  point.

Respondent 9:

We  project  slightly  higher  trend  growth  of  hours  worked  mainly  because  we  assume  that  the  secular  decline in the  labor force  participation  rate  will  occur  later  and  more slowly than in the  GB. In  terms of differences for the outlook in  2009-10 this implies a higher peak to the unemployment  rate  than the GB. We also project an overall drag from  net exports  over  2009- 10. We  assume  lower  inflation persistence than does  the  GB. Thus,  for  our  medium-term  inflation  outlook  we  project  inflation  within  the  'mandate-consistent'  range  in 2011  under  the  assumption  of  well-anchored  inflation  expectations

Respondent 10:

We  think  inflation expectations  will run higher than in the Greenbook  baseline. Resource  gaps  could  reduce inflation expectations  somewhat  in  the  near  term. But, over a longer horizon we think some  active adjustment  of  our  balance  sheet  will be necessary  to keep  longer  run expectations  from  rising  above  rates consistent  with  our  dual  mandate.

Respondent 11:

My  forecast  for  core  inflation  is  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook,  reflecting  persistent  under-forecasts  of  inflation  and  my  view  that  inflation  expectations  will  remain  well  anchored.

Respondent 12:

I am  continuing to project considerably slower real growth in 2010 and 2011 relative to the Greenbook. I expect the recovery of the financial sector will proceed very slowly, and the weakened  balance  sheet of households  will restrain consumer  spending  well  into  2010. These  factors, combined  with  other  structural adjustments  are  likely  to  keep  the  rate  of  unemployment  elevated  several  years  into  the  recovery.

Respondent 13:

I believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary  policy,  inflation  expectations  would  be  well  anchored  and  the  inflation  path  would  be  higher  than  in  the  Greenbook. I do  not  share  the  Greenbook's  view  that  core  inflation would  fall significantly while  energy  prices  are rising. I expect  the  initial stage of the recovery  to  be a bit weaker  than  in  the  Greenbook,  due  in  part  to  weaker  investment  in  residential  and  nonresidential  structures.

Respondent 14:

My  inflation forecast  is  less  influenced by  the degree  of  resource  utilization  in  the  economy  and so I project a higher  pace  of  inflation  in  2010  and  2011  than  does  the  Greenbook. Given  the  strength  of  economic  growth in my  forecast and the higher inflation path, the monetary  path  is less accommodative  beginning  in  late 2009  or  early  2010.

Respondent 15:

My  outlook has more core PCE  inflation in 2010 and 2011. Because the current recession is generating a substantial  amount of worker dislocation,  the quantity of unemployment  that is considered  'natural' is necessarily larger than some months  ago. Moreover, my  forecast is likely to imply a smaller reaction of inflation  to  changes  in  the  unemployment  gap. My  inflation  outlook  also  assumes  that  inflation  expectations remain  anchored  near  current  levels  in  the  neighborhood  of  2%  which  helps  to  keep  core  PCE  inflation  near my  longer  term  objective. Furthermore,  a  much  anticipated  deceleration  in  core  consumer  prices  has  yet  to materialize. As a consequence  of  the  stronger  inflation profile, the federal funds  rate begins  to rise in the second  half  of  2010  in  my  forecast,  whereas  the  Greenbook  forecast  maintains  a  near-zero  federal  funds  rate throughout  the  forecast  period.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(d). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous quarter's projections.

Respondent 1:

Shifts  in  2009  inflation  expectations  influenced  by  factors  mentioned  in  the  Greenbook. Greenbook  has  now shifted unemployment  expectations  for 2009 and 2010 close to my  April forecast. Factors mentioned  by Greenbook add to my  already  more pessimistic  outlook  on jobs.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3:

Real economic  activity appears to be evolving in  2009 as I had expected in my projections from last quarter, hence I have not  revised  my projected path of real output. The most recent data on the unemployment rate is slightly higher  than  I expected,  so  I have  shifted  my  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  up  by  a small amount  over  the  projection  period. The  data  on  inflation since the fourth  quarter  of 2008  has  been somewhat  stronger  than  I  had  previously  projected, hence  I have raised my  projection  on  near term  core inflation. Recent  data  on  energy  prices  has  been  stronger  than  I  anticipated,  so  I  have  raised  my  near-term projection  of  headline  inflation  relative  to  my  projection  for  core  inflation.

Respondent 4:

Main  outlines  have  not  changed: consumption  stabilization,  tentative  improvement  in  housing,  progress  in the inventory adjustment. Most important is continuing significant progress in financial markets and in confidence  in  banks,  although  this  is  to  some  extent  contingent  on  macroeconomic  conditions  continuing  to improve. Higher  oil prices and  interest rates are both  a drag on the economy  and  an  indicator  of  greater confidence  in  the  outlook,  so  on  net  their  effect  on  the  projection  is  modest.

Respondent 5:

The  current  forecast  is  conditioned  on  a  higher  path  for  the  unemployment  rate. The  higher  unemployment rate, together  with  higher  mortgage  rates  and  oil  prices, would  call for a weaker  forecast. These  negative factors  are  offset to some  extent  by  higher  stock  market  wealth  and  a  lower  dollar,  and  as  a  result  the  real forecast  has  not  changed  materially. As  concerns  prices,  the  higher  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  would call for lower  inflation  over  the  forecast  horizon. However,  the  starting  point  for  inflation  is  somewhat  more elevated  than  what  we  were  previously  projecting. As  a result,  the  inflation  outlook  remains  the  same.

Respondent 6:

My forecast for growth and  inflation over the  longer term is not  materially  different from the previous  quarter's projection. However, recent data releases caused me to revise up my  near-term  outlook for growth and  inflation. In addition,  the  surprising  increase  in  unemployment  has  led  me  to  revise  up  my  forecast  for unemployment  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 7:

Unwinding of flight-to-quality  on a  global  basis has set the stage for  improved  macro  performance possibly sooner  than previously  thought, but  the  many initiatives being  put forth by Congress  and the  administration, however  meritorious,  are  palpably  impacting  business  confidence.

Respondent 8:

The  unemployment  rate  has  risen  more  rapidly  than  expected,  and  the  forecast  has  been  adjusted  for  this development. The  near-term  inflation forecast is higher than formerly as the probability of deflation has diminished.

Respondent 9:

In April we judged it likely that the US economy  would start a sluggish recovery in the second half of 2009. Incoming data  and  improved functioning  in  financial  markets has been  broadly  consistent  with  this projection. While  there are some  tentative signs of stabilization in the labor market  both  the April and May  unemployment  rates  surprised  to the upside as labor force participation rebounded  contrary  to our assumption  in  April. We  have  assumed  that  little  of  this  rebound  in  participation  is  transitory. Thus,  our profile for the unemployment  rate is about 1 percentage point higher than in April. We have also  reduced our GDP growth forecast for  2010 to reflect a  larger projected drag from  net exports  after  re-estimating  our trade  model.

Core  inflation  data  surprised  to  the  upside  again  in  April,  raising  our  2009Q2  projection  but  we  continue  to view  recent  upside  surprises  as  transitory  and  have  not  carried  them  forward  into  future  quarters.

The  downside  risks to our central scenario projection have decreased  since April. The  source of this risk mitigation  is  continued  evidence  that  the  wide  range  of  policy  actions  are  starting  to  gain  traction. On  the other  hand,  we  have  added  some  upside  risk  to  our  inflation  forecast  in  2010-11  to  reflect  concerns  over  the size of the  fiscal deficit  and  its possible  effects  on  inflation  expectations.

In April the policy assumption  underlying  our  central  projection  was  a  renormalization  of  the  policy  rate starting  in  2011  along  with  no  substantive  changes  in  the  balance  sheet  or  LSAP.  We  have  made  no  changes to these  assumptions.

Respondent 10:

Our  forecast  has  not  changed  substantially  since  the  data  have  come  in  about  as  expected.

Respondent 11:

Since April, economic  data have come  in somewhat better  than  anticipated,  and  financial  conditions  have eased  overall,  causing  me  to  raise  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2009  and  2010. Recent  inflation  data have  been  somewhat  higher  than  expected,  some  measures  of  inflation  expectations  edged  up,  and  commodity prices have risen,  causing  me to  raise my forecast of inflation, especially this year, despite the higher path for the  unemployment  rate.

Respondent 12:

Incoming  data have indicated more  stability in the economy  and  I have marginally boosted my  2009:H2 growth  projection.  However,  the  rate  of  unemployment  has  been  tracking  higher  than  my  April  projection and  I  have  marked  up  my  estimate  of  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon  accordingly.  We  have also  increased  our  PCE  inflation  forecast  in  2009  to  reflect  the  recent  run-up  in  oil  prices.

Respondent 13:

We have  raised  our forecast  for  real  growth in response to positive  news  on  consumer spending, housing starts and  home  sales,leading  indicators  of  manufacturing  activity,  initial  unemployment  claims,  equity prices,  foreign  economic  activity,  and  corporate  bond  yields.

Respondent 14:

The  key factors that have caused  me  to revise down  my  near-term  forecast  are  the weaker-than-expected labor  market  data  over  the  past  few  months.

Respondent 15:

The  incoming data  indicate a nascent bottoming-out process, bumping up my  near-term  growth projections slightly. Also,  the  anticipated deceleration in  core consumer prices has yet  to  materialize,  leading  me to  raise

the  inflation profile throughout the forecast period. Furthermore, a reconsideration of the dynamics between the  unemployment  gap  and  inflation  dynamics  also  led  me  to  raise  my  inflation  projection.

Respondent 16:

The  outlook  for  activity  is  a  little  stronger  and  the  pace  of  disinflation  a  little  slower  owing  to  incoming  data suggesting  slightly  stronger  final  demand  and  faster inventory correction  and  somewhat  less  disinflation than expected.
