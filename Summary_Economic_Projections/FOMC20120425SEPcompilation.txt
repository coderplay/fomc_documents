NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.  Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The January projections were made in conjunction with the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on January 24-25, 2012.

- 1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

You  may  also  include  below  any other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 6:

Our  current  estimate  of the economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  in the 2%  to 2 1 2 %  range. By  2017-18  we anticipate potential growth of  around 2 1 4 %. A  reasonable  estimate of the long-run unemployment rate is 4% to 6%. Assuming appropriate policy  and  no further significant shocks, we expect the unemployment rate to be in this range and  the output gap to be around  zero by  2017-18;  analysis of recent long  expansions (1980s and  1990s)  suggests  the  unemployment  rate  could  be  somewhat  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a  CPI  basis and  that  the FOMC's  inflation  objective  will  remain  at  2%  for  the  PCE  deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the CPI.  Under  these  conditions  and with the output  gap  anticipated  to be near zero, we expect inflation as measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  close  to  2%  in  2017-18.

Uncertainty and Risks

Respondent 1:

The  size of the recession and its unusual  origins (financial crisis, housing)  make  the  pace of recovery unusually hard to forecast. The labor  market is undergoing  an unusual  amount  of  structural change (e.g., in labor force participation) and fiscal policy is very uncertain. We  do not know  whether  Okun's  Law  will reassert itself going  forward. Europe  poses  uncertain  downside  risks. In all, uncertainty  regarding  output and  unemployment is higher than normal, though perhaps slightly  less elevated than  earlier in the recovery. Core inflation  seems  stable, in part because of highly  stable inflation expectations. Uncertainty  about overall inflation is mostly  linked  to  uncertainty  about  global  commodity  prices,  which  depend  on  idiosyncratic supply and demand factors  as  well  as  global growth; although  on the whole  commodity prices  have been somewhat  more  stable  lately,  their  volatility  relative  to  the  past  makes  overall  inflation  relatively  uncertain.

Respondent 7:

Several  factors contribute  to heightened  uncertainty,  including  the  European  debt  crisis, U.S. fiscal policy (near-term  and  medium-term),  and ongoing  changes  in  the  regulatory  environment. In  addition,  the  Federal Reserve's  unconventional  policies  are  a  source  of  uncertainty  because  they  have  no  historical  precedent.

Respondent 8:

It is not clear whether  real  output  will  grow  appreciably  and  persistently  faster  than  its  longer-term  trend in this recovery. Inflation  expectations  are  probably  more  firmly  anchored  following  the  FOMC's  consensus statement,  and  uncertainty  is  correspondingly  lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 9:

N/A

Respondent 10:

The possibility  that the European debt  crisis is not resolved in an orderly fashion  continues to be a risk to the forecast. It remains  the  case  that  the  effect  of  the  extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place  and  uncertainties surrounding  the future path of policy, including  the timing of the  exit from  accommodative policy,  contribute to uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 11:

I have based  my  assessment  of the uncertainty  surrounding  my forecast  partly  on judgment  and partly  on some research by my staff on the current level of uncertainty compared  to historical norms. My  staff's analysis,  based  on  a  vector  autoregressive  forecasting  model  that  allows  the  variability  of  shocks  to  change over  time,  showed  the  uncertainty  surrounding  the  GDP  growth  forecast  now  falls  within  historical  norms, while  the  uncertainty  around  inflation  remains  higher  than  normal.

Respondent 13:

Respondent 14:

This is a close call, but uncertainty  about my projection for economic  activity  still appears to be  somewhat elevated relative to its average over  the past 20 years. The new  normal for  macroeconomic relationships going  forward  remains  unclear. For  example,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  financial  crisis,  there  is  greater  uncertainty  than  usual  about  the  ability  of  the  financial  system  to  withstand  shocks. In addition,  there  is  limited ability for monetary  and  fiscal  policy  to  damp  the  effects  of adverse  shocks. A key downside  risk  includes ongoing  developments  in Europe, where  fiscal austerity, economic  contraction, and a flare-up of financial market stress remain quite likely. Other downside risks include a jump in  crude oil prices  or a U.S. political stalemate  that  leads  to  abruptly  contractionary  fiscal  policy. There  are  upside  risks  to  the  outlook  as  well. The  housing  market  may  be  poised  to  improve  faster  than  expected  and  a  virtuous  cycle  of  improving  confidence,  fundamentals,  and  financial  conditions  may  be  developing.

In contrast, underlying  inflation is anchored  by  quite stable inflation expectations. The  stability of these expectations is reinforced by the announcement  of  a 2 percent numerical objective for inflation,. Hence, uncertainty  about  core  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades. Uncertainty  about  headline  inflation is broadly  similar  to  the  past  two  decades,  reflecting  the  lower  uncertainty  about  underlying  inflation  that is offset by  greater-than-usual  uncertainty  about  oil  prices.

Our baseline  scenario is a modal projection that  assumes that there will  not be a major financial dislocation in Europe  that  would  have  a  large  impact  on  U.S.  activity  and  that  there  will  not  be  an  abrupt  fiscal  consolidation in the U.S. over the projection period. Clearly, both of these  assumptions pose  important  major downside  risks to our projection. We  see risks to our inflation projection emanating  from  energy  prices, uncertainty  over  the  degree  of  slack  in  the  economy,  and  the  evolution  of  inflationary  expectations;  however individually  each  of  these  inflationary  risks  appears  broadly  balanced  on  the  up  and  downsides.

Respondent 6:

Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between  the  central projection  and the  expected value from the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution.

Respondent 7:

The risks to GDP growth  and  unemployment appear broadly balanced.  Downside risks to growth (and upside risks to unemployment)  include  the  European  debt  crisis,  a  slowdown  in  emerging  market  growth,  political tensions  in the Middle  East  leading  to  higher  oil  prices, and  the  fiscal cliff in the United  States. However, the  resilience  of  the  U.S.  economy  and  signs  of  improvement  in  labor  markets  and  consumer  sentiment  pose upside risks to growth (downside risks to  unemployment).  The risks to inflation  are skewed to the upside due to the highly  accommodative  stance  of  monetary policy  and  short-term  and  medium-term  fiscal imbalances.

Respondent 8:

In the near term, there is an appreciable  downside  risk  to growth  in Europe  that  could  lead to lower US exports to Europe  and  emerging  economies. In the medium term, impediments to growth  may be serious  and persistent enough to pull GDP growth below the path given above.  Also, the likelihood of a large surprise in energy prices is  more likely  to be  on the high  side  of the path given by  current prices in the futures  markets.

Respondent 10:

I view  the  risks  to  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside  in  the  medium  run  and  over  the  longer  term.

Risks to growth appear skewed to the downside  and, consequently, to the upside for unemployment. In particular, it is easy to identify potential negative shocks including from Europe; the looming  fiscal cliff; and  tensions in the Middle East. In addition, negative shocks  could have particularly  severe  effects, because of the continuing  vulnerability  of  the  financial  system  as  well as the limited  ability of fiscal and  monetary policy  to  respond. Inflation  risks,  in  contrast,  are  more  typically  balanced.

Key Factors Informing Your Judgements Regarding the Appropriate Path of the Federal Funds Rate

3(c). Please describe the key factors informing your judgements regarding the appropriate path of the federal funds rate. You may include other comments on appropriate monetary policy here as well.

Respondent 1:

My  reaction function is slightly  more hawkish than Taylor (1999), in part because of the additional  stimulus embodied  in  asset  purchases.. I tack  on  a quarter  or  two  of  additional  ease  to  compensate  for  the  effects  of the  ZLB.

Respondent 2:

The  first increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  is  conditioned  on  an  unemployment  rate  falling  below  7  percent and  underlying  inflation  below  2.5  percent. In the modal  outlook,  inflation  remains  well  contained  and  the pace of  economic growth picks up  sufficiently  to lower the unemployment rate below the 7 percent threshold only  in 2015. This  approach  to  setting  the  federal  funds  rate  is  consistent  with  optimal  policy  calculations based  on FRB/US that place equal weights  on deviations of inflation from a 2 percent target  and  the unemployment  rate  from  the  natural  rate.

Respondent 3:

My  assessment  of economic  conditions  is very close to that in Tealbook, but my  preferred policy path is significantly  more  accommodative  than  the  outcome-based  rule  incorporated  into  the  Tealbook  baseline. I would  only  begin  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  in  mid  2015,  when  the  unemployment  rate  has  declined  to around  6.5,  reaching  100  basis  points  by  the  end  of  the  year. This  proposed  path  is  marginally  less  stimulative than  the  optimal  control  with  commitment  path  corresponding  to  the  Tealbook  baseline  forecast. In contrast to Taylor (1999), which I  consider a useful benchmark, I  would hold  the funds rate lower for longer, following  a strategy  similar to that proposed by  Reifschneider  and Williams, to  account for the  constraint that  the  zero  bound  has  long  placed  on  monetary  policy. The  consequence  of  this  more  aggressive  policy  is a path for the unemployment rate that declines  more rapidly  than Tealbook (I  estimate this policy would lower  unemployment  to  6.3%  at  the  end  of  2015  versus  6.8%  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. In addition,  my  preferred policy path  results in inflation running  very  close to 2% throughout the forecast horizon. In contrast, inflation in the Tealbook  baseline  is  below  2%  over  the  same  horizon. My  preferred  policy  path  also  takes into  account  risk  management  considerations. There  is  considerable  uncertainty  about  the  economic  outlook with  very significant downside risks relating  to European developments, fiscal policy  and  other headwinds to the  recovery. Should  downside  shocks  materialize,  the  Committee's  ability  to  respond  will  be  limited  by  the zero  bound. In  contrast,  should  upside  shocks  to  the  outlook  materialize,  there  is  ample  room  to  respond  by tightening  monetary policy sooner and  more aggressively. In addition, I  think  there are asymmetric downside risks associated  with  an exceptionally  slow  decline in unemployment  to  normal  levels. There  is a distinct possibility  that  cyclical  unemployment  will  be  transformed  into  structural  unemployment  if  individuals  are sidelined  from  employment  for  an  exceptionally  long  time,  losing  their  attachment  to  the  labor  market.

Respondent 4:

My  judgments  regarding appropriate policy are based on a loss function that equally weights deviations of inflation and  unemployment  from  their  longer-run  goals. Currently, we are close to target on inflation, but  have  a  substantial  miss  on  unemployment. Accordingly,  policy  should  be  more  accommodative  in  order to speed  progress  towards  our  employment  goal,  and  should  accept  the  risk  that  inflation  might  modestly overshoot  its  target  over  the  medium  term. By  my  loss  function,  such  a  calibration  would  result  in  a  lower overall  expected  policy  loss  than  would  the  outcomes  associated  with  the  policy  path  in  the  Tealbook.

I believe the best way to deliver this accommodation  would  be  to condition our future policy moves on a set of economic  outcomes,  delaying  the  first  lift-off  in  the  funds  rate  at  least  until  the  unemployment  rate

reaches 7 percent  or the  medium-term forecast for inflation rises to 3 percent. According  to my  forecast, we would  hit  this  unemployment  rate  trigger  some  time  in  the  first  half  of  2015. I would  also  communicate  that after lift-off, policy rates initially  would  move up  broadly  in line with  the  more gradual increases  prescribed by  the Tealbook's optimal  control simulations or Taylor (1999). Furthermore, if  such forward guidance did not  succeed  in  generating  adequate  progress  towards  our  goals,  I  would  supplement  it  with  additional  asset purchases.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path for monetary  policy  and the FFR  are the  current  state  of  the  economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks  around  the  central outlook. Indicators  of economic  and  financial  conditions  generally  have  improved  since  January, although progress on the financial front is slow and unsteady. We  see previous policy  accommodation as a  contributing factor  to  the  improvement  of  both  economic  and  financial  conditions. Nevertheless,  we  still  see  the  combination  of continuing  substantial  resource  underutilization;  a  forecast  of  slow  growth,  high  unemployment,  and near- or below-objective  inflation; and  downside  risks to the real activity outlook  as calling for continued policy accommodation. In the current  environment  where  the  policy  rate  is  constrained  by  the  zero  lower bound  and  the  financial system  remains  somewhat  impaired,  such  accommodation  will  lead  to  the  target FFR  remaining  near  zero  until  late  2014. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over this period. The  pace  of renormalization  of  the target FFR  following  the  period  of near zero policy rates will depend  upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions  and  inflation  expectations  as  well  as upon  credit  spreads  and  overall  financial  conditions.

An important factor informing  our  assessment of the appropriate path for the target FFR is  our estimate of the  equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In  normal  times,  we  assume  that  the  equilibrium  real  rate  is  in the range of 1%  - 3%; adding  the objective for inflation (2%) then gives our  estimated range for longer-run rate  as 3.0 -5.0%. Given  the  recent  behavior  of  nominal  and  real  Treasury  yields  and  productivity  growth, we currently  see the longer-run rate  as  more likely  to be in the lower half of the indicated range, which  results in the point  estimate given in the response to question 3(a). Moreover, given the weak state of the  economy and  our expectations  of  continued  strained  financial  conditions, our assessment  of  the current  equilibrium real rate, and  thus the 'neutral' FFR, is below our  estimate of the longer-run FFR  and is expected to remain so for some  time.

As discussed in  our  answer to question 3(e),  our policy path is predicated  on the FOMC initiating  a program by mid-year  that would  increase the duration  of the Federal Reserve's balance  sheet as insurance  against the  still-notable  downside  risks  to  real  activity. Further  improvements  over  the  coming  months  in  economic and financial  conditions,  our  modal forecasts,  and  our risk  assessment  would lead us to drop this  assumption.

Respondent 7:

Key  factors informing my  judgment  regarding the appropriate path of monetary  policy are achieving an inflation objective  of 2 percent  and  ensuring  a  sustainable  economic  recovery  that  reduces  unemployment. With  projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  lower  and  inflation  slightly  higher  than  in  January,  along  with the need  to preempt  the  potential  for  rising  inflationary  pressures  and  the  buildup  of  risks  in  the  financial system  that  could  impede  the  achievement  of  these  goals,  I  currently  anticipate  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin the process of normalizing  monetary policy in  early  2013. After raising  the federal funds  rate to 1.0 percent, I would  maintain  it  for  a period  of time  and  allow  the  economy  and  markets  to  adjust  to  a  non-crisis  rate environment.

Respondent 8:

I believe that in order  to achieve  an  inflation rate of 2 percent  we  would  want  to  begin  raising  the  federal funds  rate  in  the  second  quarter  of  2013.

Respondent 9:

If the  inflation  trend  remains  in  the  neighborhood  of  2  percent  then  I  expect  the  lift-off  date  for  the  federal funds rate will occur after the unemployment  rate  has  fallen  into  the range of 7 to 7-1/2 percent. In my current  forecast  I  have  lift-off  in  early  2014.

Respondent 10:

Inflation and  inflation expectations  will be the main  drivers  of the removal  of accommodation. Economic growth  will  be slightly above  trend  in  2012  and  beyond  and  unemployment  will  decline  slowly. The  Committee  will  find  it necessary  to  adjust  policies  to  prevent  inflation  from  rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 11:

While  unemployment  is  likely  to  remain  elevated,  I  expect  that  it  will  be appropriate  to  begin  raising  the target  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  early  to  mid-2014  to  prevent  inflation  from  rising  above  levels  consistent with  price  stability. Despite  today's  weak  economy,  the  underlying  inflation  rate  is  very  near  2  percent. By 2014, the economy  will  have  recovered  enough  that  preserving  the  stability  of  long-term  inflation  expectations and,  in turn, inflation  will warrant  some  tightening  of  monetary  policy. This  view  of  the  appropriate path  of  policy  reflects  the  importance  I  place  on  keeping  the  underlying  inflation  rate  close  to  2  percent,  to preserve  our  credibility  and  to  maintain  price  stability.

Respondent 12:

Assuming appropriate policy  and  my  forecast of above-trend growth in the near  term, my judgment is that the federal funds rate should be increased in late (i.e., fourth quarter)  2013.

Respondent 13:

I used  the  TealBook  baseline  with  a  somewhat  stronger  forecast  supported  by  higher  house  prices.

Respondent 14:

Large and persistent output and unemployment  gaps  coupled  with  moderate  inflation  call for continuing very  accommodative  monetary  policy  well  into  2014.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

My judgements about the appropriate  course of policy  are shaped by  the  1999 Taylor Rule, adjusted for the level of accommodation  being  provided  by  the  LSAPs. Relative  to  my  January  submission,  the  appropriate path of FFRs is higher, because my projections for u is lower  and pi is higher. I have adjusted the path by  somewhat less  than Taylor 99 would  recommend, to  allow the for the possibility  that the  NAIRU is also falling  over  time.

It is worth emphasizing that my 'projections' are based on monetary policy's being appropriate. The Committee  is  highly  likely  to  follow  a  policy  that  is  more  accommodative  than  I  view  as  appropriate. This will result in slightly  better  employment  outcomes  and  worse inflation  outcomes (in the  sense that inflation will rise further  above  2%). My  views  about  appropriate  policy  are  shaped  by  the  assumption  that  market participants'  beliefs  are  influenced  by  my  preferred  reaction  function,  not  the  Committee's.

My  judgements about the appropriate path of the federal funds rate are based only on economics, and so ignores  the reputational  risk  associated  with  the  Fed's  raising the rate well in advance  of  the late 2014 deadline. That  reputational  risk might  lead me  to delay raising rates relative to the path  that I describe

above. Hence,  I  see  the  'forward  guidance'  in  the  statement  as  a  form  of  commitment.

Respondent 17:

My policy projection is guided by  the  1993 version of the Taylor Rule, with  some smoothing  and  a temporary downward  adjustment  to  the  neutral  real  rate.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  - Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e).

Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Tealbook?

If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or  if  you  prefer, quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: No

The  maturity  distribution of the SOMA  has  been  altered  by  MEP.  Still, like the Tealbook, I assume  the evolution  of the balance  sheet  follows the broad  outlines  of the exit plan agreed  upon  last  June. I do not assume  additional  LSAPs  in  my  baseline,  but  the  tool  should  remain  available  in  case  growth  is  weaker  than expected  or  there  are  signs  of  significant  disinflation.

Respondent 2: Yes

Current  portfolio-related  policies  are  maintained  until  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  in  2015.

Respondent 3: No

I have  not  incorporated  into  my  outlook  further  balance  sheet  actions. That  said,  I think  a good  case  can be  made  to  continue  the  MEP  after  our  announced  purchases  conclude  in  June.

Respondent 4: Yes

Under appropriate policy, I  anticipate the lift-off in the funds rate will  occur  sometime in  2015;  accordingly, actions  to  normalize  the  balance  sheet  would  be  delayed  relative  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 5: Yes

Following  the  Committee's  exit  principles  adopted  last  year,  I  would  commence  balance  sheet  adjustments 2-3  quarters  later  than  contemplated  in  the  Tealbook,  commensurate  with  my  later  anticipated  liftoff

Respondent 6: Yes

First, because we have a later lift-off of the FFR, based on the June  2011 exit strategy principles, the renormalization  of the balance  sheet  occurs later than in the Tealbook. Second, we  still  see a downside balance of risks to real activity  unlike  the  Board  staff,  even  with  our  later  lift-off. To  insure  against  these  downside risks, we believe that additional  monetary  accommodation is necessary  to  ensure that  outcomes for  economic growth, unemployment,  and inflation  are fairly  close to  our projections. To provide that  accommodation, we assume  a  balance  sheet  program  that  increases  further  the  duration  of  the  Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet, beginning  by mid-year  and  running  through  mid-2013. However,  this balance sheet change  is a marginal call as it was  in  January: improvement  in  economic  and  financial  conditions  over  the  next  couple  of  months beyond  that  in  our  outlook, a further  upgrade  in  our  modal  forecast, and  most  importantly  indications  of more  reduction  in  the  downside  risks  would  lead  us  to  drop  this  call  for  additional  balance  sheet  actions.

Respondent 7: Yes

Because  my  view  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  includes  an  earlier  lift-off  from  zero  for  the  federal  funds rate, I  would also start the normalization process  for the balance sheet  earlier than in the Tealbook, in line with  the  exit  strategy  principles  agreed  upon  by  the  FOMC  in  June  2011.

Respondent 8: Yes

I would  initiate our balance  sheet exit strategy commensurately  sooner,  in  accord  with  my  forecast  of  an earlier  lift-off.

Respondent 9: No

N/A

Respondent 10: Yes

Because  my  funds  rate  path  is  steeper  than  in  the  Tealbook,  I  would  anticipate  that  following  the  Committee's exit strategy  principles  would  mean  that  we  would  reduce  the  size  of  the  balance  sheet  more  quickly than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 11:

No

N/A

Respondent 12: Yes

According  to  the  Committee's  exit  strategy  and  my  date  of  lift-off, the FOMC  should  begin  reducing  the SOMA  portfolio  in  early 2014. The  pace of the subsequent  reduction  likely exceeds that assumed  in the Tealbook.

Respondent 13:

No

N/A

Respondent 14: Yes

I assume  lift-off  of  the  funds  rate  in  the  latter  part  of  2014,  and  my  balance  sheet  assumptions  are  adjusted accordingly.

Respondent 15:

No

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

My  optimal  path  of  monetary  policy,  under  my  current  outlook,  involves  stopping  re-investment  toward  the end  of  2012  or  early  2013,  and  initiating  asset  sales  in  early  2014.

Respondent 17: Yes

I remain  skeptical  of  the  usefulness  of  additional  purchases  of  Treasury  securities  and  of  ongoing  changes  to the  maturity distribution of our Treasury portfolio. As I  think it desirable to begin raising short-term interest rates substantially  earlier  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  I  also  think  it  desirable  to  begin  shrinking  the balance  sheet  earlier  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Forecast Narratives

4(a). Please describe the key factors shaping your central economic outlook and the uncertainty around that outlook.

Respondent 1:

Although  there  are  signs  that  the  economy  is  improving,  some  of  the  recent  gains  in  GDP  reflect  temporary factors,  including  inventory  accumulation,  the  surge  in  auto  sales,  and  the  recent  rise  in  government  spending. Looking forward, household  and business fundamentals plus tightening fiscal  conditions (and  substantial fiscal  uncertainty) do  not  seem  consistent  with  growth  much  above  trend. Financial  stresses  emanating  from Europe  and  elsewhere,  tight  mortgage  and  small  business  lending,  and  continuing  problems  in  housing  are further potential drags. Thus, barring  the  emergence of a strong  virtuous circle of income  gains,  confidence, and spending, GDP growth does not  seem  sufficient to reduce unemployment by  much (although phasing  out of EEB  will  have  some  effect  on  unemployment  and  participation). Europe  and  oil  prices  are the primary downside  risks, with some  risk attached  also to the fiscal cliff. Fiscal factors pose a downside  risk to the 2013  growth  forecast.

Core inflation has firmed a bit more than expected but appears to be stable around 2 percent or a bit lower. Declines in commodity  prices, slow increases in nominal wages, and stable inflation expectations suggest that stability will continue. Commodity  prices  seem  to  be  on a generally flat or declining trend, which  will  keep  overall  inflation  close  to  or  perhaps  slightly  below  core  inflation  after  the  effects  of  the  rise in oil prices  earlier  this  year  begin  to  wash  out..

Respondent 2:

Incoming  data  point  to  somewhat  faster  GDP  growth  in  the  first  half  of  this  year  than  previously  thought. The  pace  of the recovery, however,  remains  slow  by  historical  standards. Some  of  the  recent gains in consumption  could be reversed in coming  months  as disposable personal income  growth  remains disappointing. The  acceleration in payroll  employment is a welcome  development but as the  most recent initial claims data suggest,  temporary  factors  may  have  played  a  role  in  the  acceleration. The  situation  in  the  Euro  area  continues  to  be  volatile,  and  while  so  far  Europe  has  muddled  through  the  crisis,  the  renewed  financial  tensions are an indication that the risks of a  more  severe European  downturn and financial crisis are still present. Domestic  uncertainty  is  also  likely  to  intensify  over  the  rest  of  this  year  as  the  election  and  important  fiscal deadlines  near. This  heightened  fiscal  uncertainty  could  yield  some  businesses  and  consumers  to  postpone large  spending  decisions  until  next  year.

In all, I expect that some of the recent spending gains will be reversed in the second half of the year, as consumers  bring  spending  more  in  line  with  disposable  income  and  an  uncertain  fiscal  environment  holds durable  and  capital  expenditures  back. For  this reason,  an  acceleration  in  the  pace  of  economic  activity  is expected  to occur only in 2013. Then,  however,  the  drag  from  fiscal policy is likely to be significant and should hold  the pace of GDP growth below 3 percent.  Only  in  2014, as the restraint from fiscal policy  eases, activity  is expected  to  increase,  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  decline,  more  meaningfully. The  unemployment  rate  is  projected  to  reach  about  7.4  percent  by  the  end  of  2014. With  considerable  slack  in  the  labor market,  inflation  remains  subdued  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Risks to the projection for real activity are now  somewhat  more  balanced. Recent errors in Okun's  law showing  more  of  a  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  than  what  would  be  predicted  by  GDP  growth  could indicate  more  underlying  momentum  in  economic  activity  than  the  real-time  GDP  data  are  currently  showing. Similarly, the relative strength in  consumption  could be due to  more disposable income than is currently being  estimated. More  exogenous  factors,  however,  continue  to  point  to  significant  downside  risks. A  worsening  of the financial crisis in Europe  and  more  U.S.  fiscal  tightening  than  are  currently  embedded  in  my

modal  forecast  are  two  scenarios  that  represent  more  than  a  tail  risk. The  same  holds  true  for  disruptions  in oil markets  that  would  threaten  the  stable  outlook  for  oil  prices  that  underpins  the  modal  forecast. In all, I remain  more  concerned  about  the  downside  risks  to  real  activity,  as  any  worsening  of  the  economy  in  the current  situation  would  be  aggravated  by  the  limited  scope  for  further  policy  actions.

Respondent 3:

Incoming  data  have  contained  some  upside  surprises  including  encouraging  readings  on  consumer  spending, housing  and  the  labor  market. Unemployment  has  declined  more  than  I  had  anticipated  in  January. In  spite of a disappointing  March  employment  report,  the  pace  of  private  job  gains  have  clearly picked up during 2012  and  labor  market  conditions  have  improved. However,  a  key  puzzle  in  the  data  that  complicates  the forecast is the fact that unemployment has  declined much  more than  would have been  anticipated given that  growth  appears  to  have  been  only  moderate  and  trend-like  growth. I have  responded  to  these  surprises by lowering  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment  rate  over  the  entire  forecast  horizon,  largely  reflecting  past unemployment  surprises;  but  I  have  raised  my  growth  projections  only  marginally  and  have  assumed  that the  Okun's  law  puzzle  will  abate  going  forward,  so  further  progress  in  lowering  unemployment  will  be  quite gradual. In effect, my  forecast embodies  an  assumption  that  the  recent decline in unemployment  reflects 'catch  up'-that  is  that  firms  have  been  hiring  partly  to  relieve  unsustainable  pressure  on  their  workforces that  developed  during  the  downturn,  when  labor  input  was  reduced  drastically  and  unemployment  rose  by substantially  more  than  was  consistent  with  Okun's  law. I recognize  that  an  alternative  explanation  for  the puzzle  is that GDP  growth  may,  in  fact,  be  expanding  more  robustly  than  current  data  suggest. Another factor  that  has  caused  me  to  react  cautiously  to  incoming  data  in  this  forecast  round  is  uncertainty  concerning  the  boost  that  unseasonably  warm  weather  over  the  last  several  months  may  have  given  to  employment. Weather  could also have impacted  consumer spending  and indicators of  activity in the housing  market. Over the  medium term, I  continue to  see the recovery  as restrained by  significant headwinds including  a depressed housing  sector that  will be  slow to recover, forthcoming  shifts in  fiscal policy that  will  create increased drags on growth, and slower growth  in the global economy. Therefore the broad contours of my  forecast show trendlike growth  in GDP,  strengthening  somewhat  in  2013  and  2014  under  the  impetus  of  highly accommodative  monetary policy  and  a very gradual decline in unemployment over the forecast horizon toward  the 5.3%  level  I consider  to  be  normal  in  the  longer  run. With  respect  to  inflation,  I  anticipate  that  the  recent increase in inflation reflecting oil prices will be transitory. Incoming data on  core inflation have been slightly more rapid than I had anticipated and I now anticipate that, with the highly accommodative  monetary policy  I consider  appropriate,  inflation  will  run  in  the  vicinity  of  2%  through  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 4:

The pickup  in  economic  activity  and improvement in labor  markets have been welcome  developments. However,  they  fall  well  short  of  the  kind  of  breakout  in  household  or  business  spending  that  would  be  consistent with an economy  growing  much  faster than potential. Indeed, while there has been some ebbing in the headwinds that have restrained the recovery, they still pose a significant  offset to the cyclical dynamics that would  otherwise  generate  a  more  meaningful  bounce  in  spending.

Still, the  financial repair process is proceeding,  and  monetary policy is  accommodative. These  factors  should support  a  steady  ramp  up  in  growth  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period. However,  we  expect  that fiscal consolidation will be  an important  offset to this  momentum in  2013 (although we  are not  expecting  a huge  retrenchment  such  as  would  accompany  current  law).

We  are forecasting that resource slack will remain  significant throughout  the projection period: The  unemployment  rate  will be 7.1 percent by the end of 2014, and by that time structural factors temporarily elevating  the  NAIRU likely will either be  gone (in the  case of EUI)  or greatly diminished (in the  case of labor market  mismatch). Even  with  a  fairly  flat Phillips  curve,  this  slack  is large enough  to  put  some  downward pressure  on inflation. Furthermore,  some  of the recent increase  in inflation likely  will prove to be transitory, reflecting the passthough  of  higher  energy  prices  and  typical  statistical  volatility. That  said,  under  my  assumption  for  appropriate  policy, inflation expectations  will remain  well anchored  and  provide  an  offset to

resource  slack. On  net,  I  see little change  in  year-on-year  inflation  over  the  projection  period.

Respondent 5:

No  fundamental  change  in  the patter of a slow-moving  recovery, with enough  momentum  to  ward  off  recessionary risks (at least in the absence of a major external or fiscal shock), but not enough to achieve significantly above-trend  growth. Uncertainty  among  businesses  and, to a lesser extent, households  as to the outcome  of  the  major  fiscal  policy  decisions  to  made  late  this  year  will  likely  have  a  retarding  effect  in the  second half of the year  on the propensity  to  make  major investments  or large purchases. Downside risks from  Eurozone,  which  appeared  to  abate  for  a  couple  of  months,  still  seem  significant,  though  perhaps  not so high  as  last  fall.

Respondent 6:

The first quarter data pertaining to the both the supply and the demand  sides of the economy  took  on a stronger tone since the January FOMC  meeting. As a result, we have boosted the projected growth rate of real GDP for  2012Q1 to  2.9% (annual rate) from the January  estimate  of  1.9%. Growth  of payroll employment  as  well  as  hours  worked  by  private  sector  employees  was  robust  in  2012Q1  relative  to  that  experienced in  most of this expansion. Manufacturing output increased at a 10.5% annual rate over the quarter.

The  recent  expenditure  data  have  been  more  mixed. Real  personal  consumption  expenditures  likely  rose  at around  a  2 1 weight  motor vehicles. Real residential investment also likely had a  solid gain in  2012Q1,  as there appears to  be  a  very  gradual  uptrend  in  total  housing  starts  as  well  as  renewed  strength  in  additions  and  alterations. The unusually  warm weather experienced over  2012Q1 likely played a role in the strengthening  of  consumer spending  and housing, but  we believe that the  somewhat better labor  market  and  the improvement in overall financial  conditions  contributed  as  well. 2 % annual rate in  2012Q1, led by  strong growth of spending  on durable goods, particularly light-

In contrast, it appears that the growth rate of business fixed investment was quite sluggish in 2012Q1 after slowing  sharply  in 2011Q4. For now  we  see  this slowing  as mostly  typical  short-term  volatility: new orders for nondefense  capital goods, which have risen solidly recently, are well above shipments, and the architecture  billings  index  has  been  modestly  above  50  for  five  months  ending  in  March.

Real  exports  appear  to  have  grown  6 1 2 % (annual  rate)  in  2012Q1,  a  significant  increase  over  their  growth rate in  2011H2, which has  contributed to the strength of  manufacturing. But growth of real imports has also increased,  such  that the growth  contribution from net  exports in  2012Q1 is likely  to be just +0.2 percentage point. Consumption  and gross  investment by  state  and local governments appeared to decline in  2012Q1, though at a slower rate than in 2011. While on a declining trend, federal government  expenditures are expected  to  have  risen  moderately  in  2012Q1.

The largest change in our adding up of 2012Q1  GDP  is  in inventories. In 2011Q4  inventory investment contributed  1.8 percentage  points to GDP  growth. Historical patterns suggest that inventory investment would be a drag on 2012Q1  GDP  growth,  which  was  a  feature in our January  projection. Now, the inventory  growth  contribution  is  likely  to  be  around  + 1 2 percentage  point,  with  much  of  the  surprise  in  the motor vehicle  sector as dealers try to get inventories back to historical norms in an environment of rising sales.

We suspect that this stronger than expected growth over 2012Q1 is due in part to temporary factors, particularly  the  unusually  warm  weather  and  the  ongoing  normalization  of  motor  vehicle  inventories. The recent bounceback in initial claims  and slow growth in real disposable income also point to temporary factors contributing  to the relative strength in  2012Q1. Therefore, we have not  carried this stronger pace of growth through the  entire forecast  horizon: projected  2012 (Q4/Q4) real GDP growth has been  raised  only from 1 3 around  2 %  to 2 %. Conditions  do  not  yet  appear  to  be  in place for a really robust  recovery. Analysis 2 4

of our Equifax  consumer  credit  panel  indicates  that  aggregate  household  credit  continues  to  decline, with the supply of credit constrained for all but the most  credit worthy  borrowers. Even  borrowers  with well above  average  credit  scores  report  difficulty  in  obtaining  mortgages. With  underwriting  standards  tight  and vacancy  rates  well  above  trend,  any  recovery  of  housing  production  is  likely  to  remain  muted. For  2013  our projected  growth  rate  is  little changed  at  around  3%. The  gradual  healing  of  the  economy  will  be  further along  at that point, but federal fiscal policy is likely  to exert a  more substantial drag on growth: we  assume that the payroll tax cut and  extended  unemployment  benefits  will  not  be  renewed  at  the  end  of  2012  and that at least  some of the spending  restraint prescribed by  the Budget Control Act of  2011 will  occur. Defense spending  also  is  expected  to  decline  gradually  as  the  drawdown  of  overseas  troop  levels  continues.

Total and  core inflation also have been  higher in  2012Q1 than we  anticipated in January. The total PCE deflator likely  increased  around  2.4% (annual rate) in  2012Q1  versus 1.1% in  our January projection. Similarly, the projection for  core PCE inflation in  2012Q1 has been raised to 2.2% (annual rate) from the January projection  of 1.2%. This upside  surprise is due in part to the upswing  in  gasoline prices during  February and March that we had not anticipated. Fortunately, the  gasoline price rise appears to be over, at least for now. But the bigger surprise has been the increase  in  core inflation, which  reflects firmness in prices of both nonenergy  services  as  well  as  of  core  goods. Several  of  our  forward  looking  inflation  indicators  suggest  that trend  inflation  will  slow,  and  measures  of  inflation  expectations  remained  anchored. Therefore,  although  we have  raised  the  path  of  core  inflation  to  reflect a higher  starting  point,  we  expect  core  PCE  inflation  to  be just below the FOMC  objective  at  1.8% (Q4/Q4) in  2012  and  1.9% in  2013.

After  falling  from  9%  to  8.5%  between  September  and  December,  the  unemployment  rate  declined  to  8.2% in March. This has been a more rapid decline than previously expected, and certainly more rapid that would  be  suggested  by  an  Okun's  Law  relationship. The  path  of the unemployment  rate  has  been  shifted lower  to reflect this development. But  we  continue  to  believe  that  as  the  labor  market  improves,  the  labor force  participation  rate  will  stop  declining. As  a result,  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  decline  more gradually  than it has over the past six  months even though we expect growth  to be  somewhat stronger. We now  envision  an  unemployment  rate  of  around  7 3 %  for  2012Q4  and  a  little  over  7%  by  2013Q4. 4

Respondent 7:

I continue to expect a moderate pace of growth going  forward. The unemployment rate over the last  several months  has  fallen more  rapidly than previously expected, causing me  to revise down  my  path  for unemployment. I expect  future improvements  in  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  more  closely  tied  to economic growth. Recovering  demand,  accommodative  monetary  policy,  and  improving  labor  markets  will  support economic  growth  over  the  forecast horizon. High  household  debt  levels, reductions  in federal government spending,  and  the  slow  healing  of  the  housing  market  will  weigh  on  growth. Considerable  uncertainty  about the European  sovereign  debt  crisis and U.S. fiscal policy remains  unresolved. Barring  a financial crisis, I expect slowdowns  abroad  will have only a moderate  impact  on  U.S.  exports. The  U.S. fiscal situation is more  problematic,  thereby  posing  larger  uncertainty  and  potential  risks  to  the  outlook.

Turning to inflation, I expect that a gradually improving  economy  and  stable inflation expectations will keep inflation near 2 percent over the forecast horizon. Over  the medium  term,  a  highly accommodative monetary  policy  and  large  long-run  fiscal  imbalances  pose  upside  risks  to  inflation  expectations  and,  hence, inflation. In addition, the current extraordinary level of monetary policy  accommodation  raises  the possibility of distortions in financial markets  and  the mispricing of risk that could eventually destabilize the economy.

Respondent 8:

Growth  has been better than  expected so far this year. The firming  we have  seen  in the labor  market, along with improving consumer confidence, will support a gradual improvement  in consumer spending. Busi-

ness fixed investment should continue to expand. Although excess inventories continue to weigh on the single-family  housing  market,  modest  expansion  is  occurring  in  multi-family  construction  and  in  home  improvements. Government  consumption  and  investment  will  be held down  by the dismal budget outlook. Demand  for  US  exports  is  likely  to  strengthen  further.

Respondent 9:

The  economy  remains  on  a  gradual  recovery  path, but I don't see anything  that will push  growth  into a higher  gear. Deleveraging is continuing  and holding down the  economy's performance,  and  uncertainty about the outlook  and  other  concerns  are  weighing  on  household  and  business  confidence. Many  of  these  factors reflect persistent  structural  fiscal, housing,  and  external  sector imbalances. These forces  are producing headwinds  that  restrain  growth  over  the  medium  term  relative  to  a  more  typical  cyclical  pattern-in  particular, the demand  for  labor  and  capital  expansion. In addition,  the  slowdown  in  Europe  combined  with  shifts  in the growth  and composition of  emerging  economies is restraining demand for U.S. exports over the near-term.

Relatively slow labor demand growth is keeping  wage growth  subdued  and inflation  expectations appear reasonably  well  anchored. As a result, my  outlook  for inflation remains  steady  around  2  percent  over  the forecast  horizon.

Factors that  enter into my  assessment of the risks to the  outlook include the potential for a financial spillover coming  from  a  weakening  European  economy,  a  substantial  rise  in  oil  prices,  and  a  sharp  slowing  in  the  demand for workers.  Balanced  against these is the chance that the recent  strength in GDP  and  employment  are an  indication  of  a  significant  abatement  of  the  headwinds  that  figure  prominently  into  my  current  baseline.

Respondent 10:

Incoming data  on  economic  activity have been  largely  consistent  with  my January forecast. The  economy has rebounded from the negative shocks  earlier in  2011  such  as higher oil prices, bad weather,  and  the  supply chain disruptions  associated with  the Japan disaster and  the  economy is now growing  at an above-trend pace.

I expect 3 percent growth over the forecast horizon, slightly above my  longer-term trend. With  a moderate pace  of growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor  market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6.3  percent  by  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon, at which  time it remains  above  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will pull back  to a 2 percent  pace  in  2012  and  remain  at  that  level  in 2013  and  2014. Inflation stays anchored around  my  target of 2 percent in response to tighter  monetary policy than that anticipated in the Tealbook.

In my view, the substantial liquidity that is now in the financial system continues to imply a risk that inflation will rapidly accelerate to unacceptable  levels and that inflation expectations may  become  unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening  of  monetary policy  that  begins  some  time  in  2012.

Respondent 11:

I continue to expect the  economy  to recover at a moderate rate from  2012 through  2014, reflecting  a range of forces. The  positive  forces  include  considerable  monetary  stimulus  and  the  economy's  usual  self-correcting forces. The negative forces include  consumer de-leveraging, fiscal restraint, and  uncertainty about  conditions in Europe.

In this environment, I expect inflation to remain  at about  2 percent from 2012 through  2014. This projection  reflects recent  PCE  price  trends,  stable  inflation  expectations,  and  slow  growth  in  wages. With  the job market  still weak,  there  is unlikely to be much  pressure  on  inflation  coming  from  wages  over  the  next

couple  of  years.

In the  case of GDP growth, I  now believe that the uncertainty  surrounding  the forecast has narrowed to levels consistent  with  the  norms  of  the  last  20  years. However,  I  continue  to  see  the  outlook  for  unemployment  as more uncertain than normal, because of the questions  surrounding  the durability  of the recent decline in the unemployment  rate. For  both  growth  and  unemployment,  the  risks  now  seem  to  be  balanced. On  the  down side, a severe  recession  in  Europe  and  the  additional  financial  stress  the  recession  could  cause  would  significantly slow growth  and  raise unemployment in the United States.  On the up side, the apparent pickup in the pace of growth in the first quarter  could be  setting the stage for  continued  acceleration in the pace of recovery.

For inflation, I continue to believe that uncertainty remains higher than normal, due in part to the elevated volatility of commodity  prices  and,  in  turn, inflation. The  risks to inflation appear  to be balanced. The  upside  and  downside  risks  to  economic  activity  described  in  the  previous  paragraph  would  create,  respectively, upward  and  downward  pressure  on  inflation. Other  inflation  risks include  the potential  for the weakness of the economy  to create more disinflation than I currently expect or for renewed volatility of commodity prices  and  extremely  accommodative  monetary policy to increase  upward pressures  on inflation.

Respondent 12:

The improvement in the labor  market  - job growth and  reduced unemployment  - is the key to my  view that the  economy  has  momentum  and  that  the  convergence  to  steady  state  is  well  underway.

Respondent 13:

I believe that house prices will recover a bit faster than the in the TealBook baseline. Also I  expect  somewhat higher  consumer  spending. Risks  are  financial  instability  arising  from  Europe  and  the  fiscal  cliff  at  the  end of this year.

Respondent 14:

The  economic recovery appears to be proceeding at a moderate pace. Some  headwinds are slowly  easing, including  those  related  to  banking  and  financial  market  conditions. Other  headwinds  are  not  abating. For example, fiscal policy at all levels is turning increasingly  contractionary. In the  context of these broad forces, continuing  monetary  stimulus  should  support  a  moderate  expansion  over  the  next  few  years. Still, it will take years of above-trend growth  to return the  economy  to full employment. In terms of inflation, significant slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets  should  keep  underlying  cost  and  inflation  pressures  low. In addition,  wellanchored  inflation expectations  should  help  avoid  significant pass-through  from  recent  increases  in energy prices  to  wage  and  prices  inflation  more  generally.

Respondent 15:

While  labor  market  data  sets  indicate  improvement,  other  data  indicates  that  growth  remains  moderate. I do not believe that growth in  consumption is  supported by  the fundamentals of higher disposable real income or significant wealth  effects. Consumption  will  remain dampened by  the  creation  of  mostly low wage jobs, high  levels  of student  debt,  uncertainty  about  resolution  of  significant  fiscal  issues  and  a  generally  low  level of fiscal impetus.

I also  remain  concerned  about  a  renewed  worsening  of  European  issues  which  further  exacerbate  the  risks  of a prolonged European  recession.

Respondent 16:

Growth  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  both  demand  and  supply  forces. On  the  demand  side,  household spend  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  the  significant  loss  of wealth  and  net  worth. On  the  supply  side,

there have been significant changes relative to four years  ago. Firms are finding it harder to find appropriate workers. Entrepreneurs  lack  resources  to  initiate  start-ups,  which  robs  the  economy  of  an  important  source of employment  growth. The  high level of corporate  profits suggests that firms enjoy more  market  power, which  reduces  labor demand. Finally, of course, there is considerable  uncertainty  about  future  taxes  and regulations.

Both demand  and supply forces push up -temporarily -on the unemployment  rate. They operate in opposite directions on inflation, and the upward  impact  of the supply considerations on inflation can be amplified  by  downward  real  wage  rigidities. If low  demand  were  responsible  for  the  elevated  unemployment rate, I believe that current and past inflation rates would  have been considerably  lower than what  we've seen. Hence,  I  tend  to  put  more  weight  on  the  supply  effects  that  I've  listed  above  than  does  the  Tealbook. As  a result,  my  forecast  for  inflation  is  higher  than  that  in  the  Tealbook.

Several of the supply side forces that I mention will result in a permanently  lower level of the E/P  ratio.

Respondent 17:

The  recovery  appears  to be on a firmer footing, now, as drags from excess housing  and  excess household debt  gradually  ease. However,  looming  cuts  in  federal  government  purchases,  prospective  tax  increases,  and regulatory  uncertainty  continue  to  limit  the  pace  of  the  expansion. Downside  risks  stemming  from  economic and  financial problems  in  Europe  remain  significant  and  there  are  tail  risks on the downside  presented  by concerns over the potential for war in the Middle East  and  a sloppier than previously  expected transition in China. Businesses  are  flush  with  cash, and  their confidence  is increasing,  but  they  continue  to  be  inclined to hold  higher  levels  of  cash  than  normal  both  offshore  and  domestically  as  a  hedge  against  fiscal  and  regulatory  uncertainty in the U.S.. Many of  our  potential job-creating  larger businesses  remain  more interested in foreign  than  in  domestic  expansion,  though  wage  and  regulatory  inflation  in  China  is  increasing  interest in 'on-shoring' some manufacturing  (or bringing it closer to home  in Mexico); small and medium  sized business  feel  especially  stymied  by  uncertainty  over  fiscal  and  regulatory  policy. The  pace  of  the  recovery  is unlikely  to  accelerate  until  next  year,  when  some  of  the  uncertainties  currently  restraining  growth  will  have been  resolved.

Forecast Narratives (continued)

4(b). Please describe the key factors causing your forecast to change since the previous SEP.

Respondent 1:

Recent data have  again been  a bit stronger than  expected,  particularly in the labor  market (where unemployment  has  fallen  more  than  expected)  and  in  retail  sales. There  are  signs  that  the  recovery  is  broadening, including  some improvements in household and business  confidence, but I  am not yet persuaded that abovetrend growth  can be  sustained. Principal risks  are to the downside (Europe, oil)  but there is  some  upside risk also if the  economy  can build  on the  momentum we have  seen  recently. Core inflation has been  a little higher  than  expected,  and  I  did  not  anticipate  the  increase  in  gasoline  prices  seen  since  January.

Respondent 2:

Bottom-line  numbers  for  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  have  not  changed  materially  since  the January  forecast, but the  current forecast is implicitly  stronger than previously  envisioned  as it is not based on additional  rounds  of  quantitative  easing  anymore. The  inflation  forecast  has  been  revised  up  somewhat as incoming  inflation data have been higher than we had  anticipated in January.

Respondent 3:

Unemployment  has  declined  substantially  more  than  I  anticipated  in January  in spite of modest  demand growth. I responded by lowering  my projected unemployment path.  I have  slightly  upgraded my  forecast for GDP  growth  in  response  to  upside  surprises  in  consumer  spending. And  I  have  boosted  slightly  my  forecast of headline  and  core  inflation  in  response  to  recent,  higher-than-expected  readings.

Respondent 4:

The incoming data  on spending  and labor  markets have been  somewhat more positive than we had  expected in January,  but  we  do  not  think  they  represent  a  fundamental  change  in  the  underlying  momentum  of  the expansion. Accordingly, we  marked up  our projection for  activity in  2012 a bit, but did  not change  our views about  GDP  growth  in  2013  or  2014;  we  also  adjusted  down  our  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate by the surprise  in early-2012. Inflation  has  come  in  higher  than  we  expected;  some  of  the  miss  was  due  to higher  energy  prices,  though  core  inflation  also  has  run  above  our  previous  projection. As  noted  in  4a),  we think  some,  though  not  all,  of  these  increases  will  prove  transitory. Accordingly,  while  we  have  marked  up our projections  for top-line and  core inflation in 2012  by  1/2  and  1/4  percent, respectively, we  have  made only  a  small  upward  adjustment  to  our  projection  in  the  out-years  of  the  forecast

Respondent 5:

First quarter  data  was  considerably  better  than  I  had  anticipated,  which  moves  up  the  baseline  for  subsequent  projections,  but  I  don't  think  the  basic  dynamic  of  the  next  couple  of  years  has  changed  much

Respondent 6:

As stated in  our response to question 4(a), indicators of real PCE, real residential investment, and inventory investment have been  stronger than we  anticipated in January. We raised  our  2012Q1  real GDP projection, but  these  factors  are  anticipated  to  have  little  effect  in  subsequent  quarters.

Headline  and  core  PCE  inflation  over  the  intermeeting  period  were  above  what  we  anticipated  at  the  time of the  January  FOMC  meeting. Alternative  measures  of  underlying  inflation  also  were  a  bit  higher. Consequently,  we  have  raised  our  near- and  medium-term  inflation  projections.

The  unemployment  rate  in  March  was  somewhat  below  our  anticipation  at  the  time  of  the  January  meeting. We  expect the unemployment rate will fall  relatively quickly  over the forecast horizon, reflecting  the impact of the  unemployment  outflow  rate  that  is  a  primary  factor  behind  unemployment  rate  dynamics  during  expansions,  leading  to  a  somewhat  lower  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  than  in  January. What  prevents  it

from  being  even  lower  is  our  assumption  that  the  labor  force  participation  rate  will  increase  modestly  over the  projection  period.

In regard to our risk assessment, we now  see less downside  risks and somewhat  more  upside  risks  to real activity  and  inflation  than  we  did  in  January. Most  of  these  shifts  occurred  during  the  March  intermeeting period. As a consequence, our risk assessment  for inflation has shifted from a downside  skew  to roughly balanced. For  real  activity,  the  balance  of  risks  are  still  to  the  downside,  although  less  so  than  in  January.

A major factor in the reduction of downside  risks is the effect of official actions, particularly the 3-year LTRO,  in  alleviating  some  of  the  strains  on financial conditions  arising  from  the  European  sovereign  debt crisis. Consequently, we have reduced  the probability of financial market  impairment  leading  to  a global credit crunch  as  well as the probability  of  a severe  global  recession. The  increase  in  upside  risks  primarily reflects that the generally  stronger  data  received  since January  raise  the probability  that more  typical  recovery dynamics are finally  being  established. Because of the greater political tensions  associated with Iran, we  also  have  raised  modestly  the  probability  of  an  oil  supply  shock  hitting  the  U.S.  economy.

Respondent 7:

My  forecast for real GDP  growth  is little changed  from  the previous SEP. Regarding  the unemployment rate, my  trajectory  is  broadly  similar  to  the  previous  SEP,  but  the  overall  path  for  the  unemployment  rate is about  1/2  percentage  point  lower,  reflecting  the  recent  declines  we  have  seen. With  less  slack  and  higher readings  on inflation, I have  also revised up  my forecast  for inflation (headline  and  core) by  about a tenth of a percentage  point,  so  I  now  expect  inflation  will  be  2.0  percent  in  2014.

Respondent 8:

Data  on  employment  and  consumer spending have been  stronger than was  anticipated  early  this year. I have been  especially  encouraged  by  the  health  of  consumer  spending  in  the  face  of  the  runup  in  gasoline  prices. In addition,  output in Europe has not been  as weak  as  anticipated.

Respondent 9:

I have  not  revised  my  growth  or  inflation  forecast  in  a  significant  way  since  the  January  submission.

Respondent 10:

NA

Respondent 11:

The  changes  in my  forecast are primarily driven by data received between  meetings. Unemployment  has fallen, headline and  core CPI inflation have picked  up, and forecasts of first quarter GDP growth have risen. I have  also  been  encouraged  by  the  improvement  in  the  tone  of  reports  from  my  business  contacts.

Respondent 12:

My  forecasts have changed  little. Reflecting additional information  on PCE  inflation, I have reduced  my forecast of this variable for the first half of the year and  adjusted  slightly the forecasts for 2012  and  2013 accordingly.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

Since  January,  output  data  have,  on  balance,  suggested  more  near-term  strength  in  the  economy. Overall, labor  and production data have  exceeded  expectations,  and spending data have also picked up. Equity prices and  risk  spreads  have  generally  improved. Our  projections  for  the  global  economy  are  notably  better,  with

policy  actions  in Europe  helping  to  stabilize  the  outlook  there. At  the same  time,  the  situation  in  Europe remains  fluid,  and policy  steps to date have not yet  addressed the fundamental problems. Uncertainty  about whether  the European  situation could intensify continues to weigh on financial markets and the broader economy. My  baseline  fiscal  policy  assumptions  are  largely  unchanged  from  January. The  recent  data  have led me  to  lower  the  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate.

Data  on  core  inflation  have  come  in  somewhat  above  expectations  in  recent  months,  and  I  have  bumped  up my  forecasts  for  core  and  overall  inflation  somewhat  over  the  forecast  period.

Respondent 15:

There  has  been  more  positive  news  in  the  labor  markets  which  should  not  be  ignored.

Respondent 16:

Unemployment  fell  in  the  first quarter. That  has  pushed  down  my  forecast  for  unemployment  in  the  last quarters  of  both  2012  and  2013.

Respondent 17:

Revisions  have  been  minor. An  unusually  warm  winter  has  led  me  to  shift  real  GDP  growth  forward  into the first half of 2012. Recent favorable movements  in  the unemployment  rate-payback,  perhaps, for unusually sharp job cuts during  the recession-have led me to revise downward  my  2012  and  2013 forecasts of that  variable. Inflation  has  been  running  a  bit  higher  than  I  had  expected,  and  my  2012:H1  forecasts  have accordingly  been  revised  modestly  upward.

Forecast  Narratives (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1:

Broadly  similar. A little more  worried about fiscal restraint in 2013 and don't see the basis for a sharp increase  in  growth  in  2014,  so  I  have  a  slightly  slower  pace  of  improvement.

Respondent 2:

The  factors  shaping  both  the  real  and  the  inflation  outlook  are  similar  to  the  Tealbook's  baseline  forecast. I view  the  risks  to  economic  activity  as  more  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 3:

My  forecast  for  economic  growth  is  stronger  than  Tealbook;,  my  unemployment  path  declines  more  quickly and  my  inflation  path  is  a  bit  higher  than  Tealbook. These  differences  reflect  that  fact  that  I  have  assumed a more  accommodative  stance  of  monetary  policy  with  later  lift-off  of  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 4:

Under appropriate policy, we  assume that the lift-off in the federal funds rate (and attending  balance sheet actions)  occur  about  1  year  later  than  in  the  Tealbook. We  also  assume  somewhat  less  fiscal  consolidation in 2013. Furthermore, we did not  mark down  our view of potential  output (either historically  or over the projection  period)  as  much  as  the  Tealbook. All three  of these  factor  contribute  to  our  forecast  for  growth averaging  about  0.4  percentage  point  per  year  higher  than  the  Tealbook  over  the  projection  period.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

We  assume a  somewhat later lift-off of the FFR (2014Q4) than in the Tealbook (2014Q1);  consequently, the FFR  at the end of  2014 is notably  lower than in our forecast (0.5% vs. 1.25%). Because our projected inflation path is above the Tealbook's, the real FFR difference is a bit larger. Based on our  common  assumption that the FOMC  follows  the  June  2011  exit  strategy  principles,  the  later  lift-off of the FFR  implies  a  later normalization  of the balance sheet. In addition, as stated in our response to question 3(e), we assume  a balance  sheet program to provide  additional  monetary  accommodation  as insurance  against the  still-notable downside risks. Because the balance sheet is  expected to proceed along  a higher path-whether  or not there is a balance sheet program-we  assume that term premia rise to normal levels  more slowly  than in the Tealbook.

We  see some of the headwinds  restraining economic growth subsiding more quickly in 2014 than in the Tealbook. Thus, combining  this with a more  accommodative  stance  of  policy, we expect the output  gap to begin  to  close more  quickly  that  year,  and  thus  our  2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast  is  above  that  of  the Tealbook.

We  continue  to  assume  lower  inflation  persistence  than  does  the  Tealbook. Furthermore,  we  see  a  stronger influence  of  anchored  inflation  expectations  on  inflation  dynamics. Consequently,  our  inflation  forecast  and the Tealbook  forecast  are  similar  for  2012, but  beyond  that  we  see  total  and  core  inflation  remaining  near 2%  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  inflation  declining  in  2012H2  and  then  only  returning  slowly  toward  the  2% objective.

Even though our labor force participation rate path is higher than that of the Tealbook, we expect a greater  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  than  is  projected  in  the  Tealbook,  particularly  in  2013  and  2014. The  source  of this difference is a different interpretation  of labor market  dynamics  as  expansions  mature; that  is, we  do  not  place  as  much  weight  on  Okun's  Law  as  the  Board  staff  do.

The  Tealbook  now  considers  the  risks  around  the  real  activity  forecast  as  roughly  balanced. In contrast,  we see a downside balance of risks around  our real  activity  outlook, although less so than in January. For us, the downside  risks  from  a  possible  escalation  of  the  European  sovereign  debt  crisis  and  associated  impairment of financial conditions  as well  as the possibility of a larger than  expected fiscal  consolidation appear  to be more  severe than any of the upside real risk scenarios. In part, this assessment  reflects that with policy rates  constrained by  the  zero lower bound, policy has less  scope to  address downside  risks, particularly  those associated  with  financial  impairment,  than  it  does  for  upside  risks.

Respondent 7:

While  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  broadly  similar  to  Tealbook's,  my  forecast  for  the  unemployment rate  is significantly  less  than  Tealbook's  and  my  forecast  for  inflation  is  higher  than  Tealbook's.

Respondent 8:

My  inflation  forecast  is  higher,  since  the  Phillips  Curve  used  for  the  Tealbook  has  been  consistently  underestimating  inflation.

Respondent 9:

I have  slightly  stronger  2012  H1  GDP  growth  and  a  somewhat  steeper  decline  in  the  rate  of  unemployment than  the  Tealbook  baseline. Otherwise,  I  believe  my  current  forecast  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook  baseline.

Respondent 10:

My  forecast calls for a stronger economy  over the next two years and tighter monetary  policy than the Tealbook.

Respondent 11:

Broadly,  my  forecast  for  2012-2014  is  similar  to  Tealbook's. At  a more  detailed  level,  there  are  some  slight differences between  our  growth  and  unemployment  profiles. In addition, while Tealbook  projects  a small decline in core inflation, I expect  inflation to remain  near  target throughout  the  forecast  horizon. I see a subdued  rate  of  increase  in labor costs helping  to keep  core inflation from  rising, but I don't  expect  labor costs  to  push  core  inflation  down  in  the  next  couple  of  years.

Respondent 12:

For 2012, 2013, and  2014, I anticipate  relatively faster near-term  GDP  growth,  lower  unemployment,  and higher  inflation.

Respondent 13:

N/A

Respondent 14:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection, though with slightly  stronger GDP growth in  2012 but  slightly  slower  growth  in  2013  and  2014.

Respondent 15:

I am generally  in line with  the tealbook baseline but  am reflecting  a partial fiscal cliff, which will be heightened by  the public's attention to the  economy in an election year. These political issues will  create significant household  and  business  confidence  issues.

I also  believe  the  baseline  is  too  positive  in  terms  of  the  sustainability  of  consumption  spending.

Respondent 16:

I expect unemployment  to  be lower at the end of 2014 (around 6.7% under what I view as appropriate monetary policy). I expect inflation to be higher (around 2% under appropriate  monetary policy).

I expect E/P  to stay below 59%  through  the end of 2014, both under appropriate monetary  policy and the  more  accommodative  policy  that  I  expect  that  the  Committee  to  actually  follow..

Respondent 17:

The  Tealbook  baseline  forecasts  for  real  activity  and  inflation  in  2012  are  reasonable,  but  I  see  a  somewhat faster  pace  of  recovery  in  2013  and  2014  than  does  the  Tealbook,  and  no  drop  off  in  inflation. A  more  rapid removal  of  monetary  stimulus  is  appropriate  given  these  forecasts.
