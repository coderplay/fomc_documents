<!-- missing-text -->

NOTE:  Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated.  PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy.  Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated.   Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy.   Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The November projections were made in conjunction with the FOMC meeting on November 2-3, 2010.

- 1.  The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2.  The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3.  Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Longer-run Projections

- 1(c).  If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  shorter  or  longer than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best  estimate  of the duration  of the  convergence  process.  You  may  also  include  below  any  other explanatory  comments  that  you  think would  be  helpful.

Respondent  10:

I  expect  the  convergence  process  will  be  similar  to that  outlined in  the  long-run  projection  reported in  the Tealbook,  with  the  output  and  unemployment  gaps  reaching  zero  in  about  five  years,  and  the  PCE  price inflation rate reaching its long-run value of 2 percent  sometime thereafter.

Respondent  11:

For  several  reasons,  I  expect  the  convergence  process  for  unemployment  will  likely  take  longer  than  five to  six  years. These  factors  include  the  severity  of the  recession,  the  historical  norms  of jobless  recoveries and recoveries  that  follow  financial  crises,  and  structural  adjustments  that  need  to  take  place  such  as  the deleveraging of consumers, businesses,  and financial institutions.  In addition,  I am concerned that a delay in the  removal of the extraordinary level of monetary policy accommodation will lead to financial  imbalances that  could  eventually  destabilize  the  economy  and  further  prolong  the  convergence  process. These  same monetary forces  could  also cause long-term inflation  expectations  to  become  unanchored  and  lengthen  the convergence process.

Respondent  12:

A number of unpredictable developments -  here in the mortgage market and abroad in Europe -  continue to complicate this recovery's depth and duration.  Accordingly,  it may take longer than five or six years to conÂ­ verge to some equilibrium.  In addition,  the pacing in which the exit strategy is executed and communicated

may lengthen  the  convergence  process  to  seven  or  eight  years. In  other  words  the  necessity  of unwinding accommodative policy faster than would be warranted by the unemployment rate alone could end up slowing the downdrift  in the unemployment rate.

Respondent  13:

N/A

Respondent  14:

Our  current  estimate  of the  economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  in  the  2.5%  to  2.7%  range.  By  2015-16  we anticipate  potential  growth  to  slow  to  2.4%,  reflecting slower growth of hours  worked as  the baby boomers retire.  A reasonable estimate for the long-run unemployment rate is 4% to 6%.  We expect, with appropriate policy and no  further  adverse shocks,  the unemployment  rate to be in this range  and the output gap to be around zero by 2015-2016.

We assume that long-term inflation expectations will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on  a CPI  basis and that  the FOMC's inflation objective is and will be about 2%  for the PCE deflator and around 2.5%  for the  CPI.  Under  these  conditions,  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  be  near  zero,  we  expect  inflation  as measured by the PCE deflator to be around 2% in 2015-16.

Respondent  15:

I  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  for  real  GDP  growth  will  be  substantially shorter  than  5-6  years, perhaps on the  order of 3-4  years  for real growth  (with  a  period  of overshoot  of real  growth  in the  interim during recovery),  and  an  overshoot  (above  1.5%)  in  the  interim  in  inflation  as  a  consequence  of significant past  growth in the  monetary base supported by longer term asset  purchases  that  cannot  be sold off over  a very short time period.  I  anticipate  that  the decline  in the unemployment  rate  will lag behind the recovery of real growth.

Respondent  16:

Expect convergence to take somewhat longer

Respondent  17:

Convergence  within  5-to-6  years  now  appears  likely. The  danger  is  that  the  economy  will  overshoot  the sustainable unemployment rate  and that inflation will overshoot  the desired level.

Respondent  18:

While the economy is anticipated to revert back to maximum employment within a five-year horizon, inflation is  likely to remain below the target.

Uncertainty and Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding your judgment  of the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels  of uncertainty  over the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent  1:

The liquidity trap conditions we find ourselves in today add considerable uncertainty to the outlooks for both growth and inflation.  Notably,  there is substantial uncertainty over the ability of unconventional policies to buoy expected inflation and reduce real interest rates.  Also,  our forecast is premised on the assumption that household  and  business  caution  will  diminish  with  the  aging  and  firming  of economic  recovery. Forecasts of how  such  sentiment  will  evolve  and  translate  into  higher  activity  are,  by  their  very  nature,  subject  to extreme uncertainty.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

Uncertainty about output and unemployment is increased by uncertainties related to 1)  the extent to which a post-financial  crisis  recovery differs  from  a normal  recovery 2)  the  effects  on  recovery  and  employment  of structural  change,  permanent  discharges,  and  high  rates  of long-term  unemployment  3)  the  dependence  of US recovery on global growth and economic policies.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

Uncertainty was surprisingly low over the past  20 years.

Respondent  6:

The incoming data has generally been consistent with my October projection.  Financial market conditions continue to improve and the economic recovery has gained momentum.  It remains the case that the effect of the extraordinary monetary policy in place and uncertainties surrounding the future path of policy, including the  timing  of the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent  7:

N/A

Respondent  8:

With the recovery process more firmly in place, uncertainty for GDP and unemployment projections is below average.  Inflation expectations  would be more firmly anchored under  an  appropriate monetary policy,  and uncertainty would therefore be lower than the historical  average.

Respondent  9:

N/A

Respondent  10:

This is  a close call,  but  uncertainty appears to have  fallen to more  average levels.  Importantly,  our forecast errors have been relatively small since the recovery began a year and half ago,  which is consistent with less, not  more,  uncertainty.

Respondent  11:

The uncertainty surrounding my projections remains higher than normal.  I generally agree with Tealbook's assessment  of the  sources  of uncertainty,  but  I  would  add  fiscal  policy to  the  list. Various  aspects  of fiscal policy -  such as questions of fiscal sustainability -  add considerable uncertainty to the outlook.  The public's uncertainty about the conduct of monetary policy is also adding to uncertainty in the economic outlook.

Uncertainty and Risks

2(b).  (Optional)  If you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding your judgment  of the  risk  weighting around  your  projections,  you  may  enter  them below.

Respondent  1:

Even  though our  forecast  for  growth  is  balanced,  we  still  feel  that  the  risks  to  the  unemployment  rate  are somewhat weighted to the upside.  Businesses continue to be very hesitant to expand work forces until they are more certain of the staying power of final demand.  They can only push productivity so far and eventually will  have  to  hire,  but  the  timing  of this  is  uncertain.  In  addition,  we  may have  underestimated  the  degree (and persistence)  to which reduced  matching efficiency is influencing labor markets.  Note that we see both of these  factors  as modest  risks  and are most relevant  for the earlier part  of the  forecast  period.

Respondent  2:

N/A

Respondent  3:

(Risks  to  output  and  unemployment)  The  strong  projected  rates  of  output  growth  are  dependent  on  a steadily improving labor market and an absence of further shocks, including financial shocks.  Either of these assumptions could prove wrong.  On the other hand, recent data suggest a recovery that is more durable and broader based than was apparent  at  the time of the last projection,  mitigating downside risk.  (Risks to inÂ­ flation)  Upward pressures from commodity prices,  the dollar,  and strengthening global growth counterweigh disinflationary risks  from slack  and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

By weighted to the downside, I mean that I put some weight on the possibility that unemployment may fall more rapidly than I expect.  Here,  a big issue is LFP.  Will it continue to fall surprisingly quickly?

Respondent  6:

I  view  the  risks  to  growth  and  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside. Historical  patterns  in  the  data  suggest the rebound might be stronger than my baseline forecast.  Over the longer term, inflation risk is tilted to the upside reflecting uncertainty about the timing and efficacy of the Fed's withdrawal of accommodation.

Respondent  7:

N/A

Respondent  8:

N/A

Respondent  9:

I  have  adjusted  my  weighting  of risks  around  the  inflation  projection  from  'weighted  to  the  downside'  to 'broadly balanced' .  The likelihood of further unwanted disinflation has lessened.

Respondent  10:

The risks to our projections for real activity and inflation appear to be broadly balanced.  Of course, despite a symmetric  forecast  distribution,  the costs  of downside  outcomes  (slower growth or lower inflation)  would be relatively more severe.

Respondent  11:

When easing into a recovery,  one is more likely to see growth and inflation surprise to the upside.  Thus far, the recovery has been moderate.  But  as headwinds dissipate,  I  expect  the normal  business cycle dynamics to  take  hold  at  some  point. The  timing  of this  phenomenon  is  uncertain,  but  as  the  economic  recovery continues to strengthen,  there is  a greater chance  of an upside  surprise  and less  of a chance  of another  soft patch going forward.

Appropriate  Monetary Policy

3. Does your view of the appropriate path  for  monetary policy  differ  materially from that  assumed  by  the  staff in  the  Tealbook?

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent  1: Yes

For the purpose of our baseline forecast,  we have chosen to condition on the futures markets' expected path for the funds rate.  Similarly, we condition on the implied market expectations for the evolution of the 10-year Treasury rate,  which  are  a  touch  higher  than  the  Tealbook's  and  may by premised  on  a  somewhat  earlier start to redemption of SOMA securities.  However, these differences are small, and we would not be surprised if the economy were to evolve in a manner such that the appropriate policy outcome is more in line with the Tealbook assumptions.

Respondent  2: Yes

My economic projection is consistent with a target  federal funds rate that  rises above the 0 to 0.25 percent range  in  the  middle  of  2012. We  assume  no  further  LSAP  purchases  beyond  those  already  announced  in November.

Respondent  3: No

N/A

Respondent  4: No

N/A

Respondent  5: Yes

I  believe that  we  are likely to tighten earlier than first  quarter 2013.  We will be led to do so by increases in the rate of inflation.

Respondent  6: Yes

My  forecast  continues  to  assume  a  less  accommodative  policy  than  in  the  Tealbook  baseline. I  view  the appropriate monetary policy as one that  begins raising the  funds rate sometime in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  7: No

N/A

Respondent  8: Yes

I believe that under an appropriate monetary policy the committee would adopt a numerical inflation objecÂ­ tive.  In accordance with that objective, the committee would want to begin to shrink the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet  and raise the  federal  funds rate sooner than the Tealbook projects.

Respondent  9: No

N/A

Respondent  10: No

N/A

Respondent  11: Yes

In my view, under the appropriate path, policy would immediately begin the normalization process.  I would stop the purchases of longer-term Treasury securities and remove the commitment to maintaining the funds

rate  target  at  exceptionally low levels  for  an extended period.  I  would  allow our  balance sheet to shrink as mortgage-backed securities are redeemed.

Respondent  12: No

N/A

Respondent  13: Yes

Earlier resumption of run-off of securities holdings than  assumed by Tealbook

Respondent  14: No

N/A

Respondent  15: Yes

While  the  pattern  of recovery  from  the  recession  is  uncertain,  I  believe  that  under  appropriate  monetary policy to maintain price stability we will have to move away from the current target range for the funds rate and allow the  SOMA portfolio to run off sooner  than  assumed  in the  Tealbook.  In the interim,  depending on  how  the  economy evolves,  it  may be  appropriate  to  accelerate  or  slow  down  the  growth  of the  SOMA portfolio.

Respondent  16: Yes

Would prefer  that  Fed  balance  sheet  grow  substantially  less,  and  its  level  fall  materially  faster  than  Staff forecast.  Would also prefer that  policy rates  move up sooner  and with more  force than staff forecast

Respondent  17: Yes

Yes,  it  differs  both  with  respect  to  timing  and  with  respect  to  the  order  in  which  stimulus  measures  are reversed.  My long-term inflation objective is lower than the  2-percent rate  assumed in the  Tealbook's proÂ­ jections.  Accordingly,  I  expect  to begin removing monetary-policy accommodation earlier than is called  for in those  projections.  Also,  I  doubt  that  recent  moves  to expand our balance  sheet have been as  effective  as is  assumed in the Tealbook and,  so,  see little reason not to allow our security holdings to begin to run off in advance of short-term interest  rate increases.  It  seems  only logical  that  we  would begin  to reverse  first the stimulus measures that were applied last.

Respondent  18: Yes

With  inflation  still  well  below  target  in  2013,  the  Federal  funds  rate's  lift  off  from  the  zero  lower  bound occurs later in the forecast  horizon.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping your  central  economic  outlook and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent  1:

The incoming data and anecdotal evidence suggest that growth late last year was somewhere in the range of 4 percent  and that  activity currently appears to be rising at  a similar pace.  Over time,  increasing household and business  confidence  should  add  momentum  to  the  recovery. Importantly,  household  spending  already has picked up  and more businesses seem to be planning for  an increase in  activity.  Inventories  appear well aligned with sales,  and so production should move up in line with demand.  In addition,  banks appear more ready to lend,  capital  market  conditions  are supportive of growth,  and monetary policy is accommodative.

Some  continued  business  caution  could  hold  back  hiring  and  capital  investment  some,  but  this  should  diÂ­ minish over time-particularly as firms see their sales being generated from final demands and not transitory factors  such  as  an  inventory cycle. Nonetheless,  continued overhangs  in  real  estate  markets  will  hold back both residential  and nonresidential construction,  and the  budget  difficulties  of state  and local  governments will be  a negative  factor  for growth.

Resource gaps remain large  throughout the projection period,  and could pull inflation down further.  HowÂ­ ever,  supported by our recent monetary policy actions, markets have down weighted the risks of very low (or negative)  inflation  rates.  This  anchoring of inflation  expectations  and  the resumption  of more solid  growth are expected to contribute to a small updrift in inflation over the projection period.  Still, we think inflation will end  2013  below a rate consistent  with our price stability mandate.

Respondent  2:

The incoming information on economic  activity has been recently upbeat  and has placed the economy on a firmer  footing. My fourth-quarter  GDP estimate  has  been marked  up  accordingly. Momentum from these positive  surprises  also pushes output  higher in  2011.

Nevertheless,  the  economy  is  still  confronted  by  necessary  structural  adjustments  and  resource  reallocaÂ­ tions that  will impede growth,  particularly in  2011.  These  are evident  in housing,  commercial construction, and the labor market.

In  light  of  the  recent  strength  in  the  incoming  data,  I  now  characterize  the  risks  to  my  growth  outlook as 'balanced' rather than as weighted to the downside.  I have also moved the risks to my inflation outlook to 'balanced'  from being skewed to the downside.  Recent  firming in measures of underlying inflation produced by  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  of  Cleveland  suggest  that  the  disinflation  trend  may  be  drawing  to  an  end. Furthermore,  my  preferred  measures  of inflation  expectations  have  moved  into  the  'mandate-consistent' range.

Respondent  3:

We seem to have gotten past a soft patch in the recovery that lasted from the spring through September or so. In  particular,  consumer  spending,  notably including spending  on  automobiles,  picked  up  in  the  fourth quarter. Household  spending  both  supports  and  is  being  supported  by  what  appears  to  be  an  improving labor market (see, e.g., UI claims, unemployment rate, help wanted index, surveys) despite still-limited gains in payroll employment.  Household spending, business spending on equipment and software, and employment are collectively providing momentum to what increasingly appears to be a broadly diffused, private-sector-led recovery.  Industrial production data also indicate a broadening cyclical recovery.

Conditions in capital  markets have improved  further,  reflecting greater market  comfort  with the European situation,  more  confidence  in  global  growth,  and  the  effects  of the  LSAP  program  on  risk  assets. Banks

continue to face challenges  (foreclosure documentation,  putback risk, regulatory limits on earnings capacity) but continue to build capital.  Credit is loosening a bit for smaller firms and households but remains relatively tight.  Higher equity prices,  lower volatility,  and tighter spreads  are both a sign of increasing confidence and a spur to further expansion.

Fiscal  policy  is  modestly  more  expansionary  than  expected,  due  to  the  lame-duck  agreement. However, fiscal  stimulus  on  net  is  small  and  will  likely turn  to  drag  later  this  year  or  early next. Moribund residenÂ­ tial  and  nonresidential  construction  are  a  drag  on  recovery  and  a  problem  for  the  balance  sheets  of banks, households,  and firms.  Global growth adds to growth through net exports but  subtracts through the effects of higher commodity prices on household real incomes.

Deflation  risks  are  now  very  low,  as  commodity  prices  (energy,  food,  metals)  have  risen  sharply,  TIPS breakevens are stable to up,  and the risk that the recovery might falter has receded.  The dollar is also down but  only very modestly.  On  the  other  hand,  core  inflation  remains  very  low  and  might  even  decline  a  bit further,  reflecting  slow  growth  in  unit  labor  costs  and  slack  in  labor  and  product  markets. Core  inflation seems  likely  to  remain  low  and  stable;  what  happens  to  headline  inflation  depends  on  commodity  prices, which in turn will be heavily influenced by global growth and demand.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

My outlook for inflation is shaped by the assumption that the recovery will continue on track.  A slowing in the pace of economic recovery might lead to disinflationary pressures.

Respondent  6:

The  recent  economic  data  has  mostly  been  in  line  with  what  I  anticipated  in  my  October  forecast. The economy is rebounding from its recent  soft  patch  and is poised  for moderately above-trend growth in  2011 and 2012.

As  the  recovery  strengthens,  I  expect  an  above-trend  pace  of  3.6  percent  growth  in  2011,  only  a  shade higher  than  in  my  October  forecast. Factors  that  contribute  to  my  growth  projection  include  improving financial  market  conditions,  greater credit  availability to households  and firms,  the  affects  of policy accomÂ­ modation,  and normal recovery dynamics.

In  2012  and  2013,  I  expect  growth  to  moderate  somewhat,  though  it  remains  slightly  above  my  long-run trend.  The labor market recovery is gradual - I expect the unemployment rate to move down to about 6.5 percent by the end of the  forecast  horizon,  at  which  time  it remains  above  my estimate  of the natural  rate of unemployment.  I  anticipate that  inflation will rise into 2012  and then pull back a bit  in  2013 in response to tighter monetary policy than anticipated in the Tealbook.

In  my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk  that inflation  will  rapidly  accelerate  to  unacceptable  levels  and  that  inflation  expectations  may  become  unanÂ­ chored.  To ward off these developments, the FOMC will need to commence a steady tightening of monetary policy that begins some time in the second half of 2011.

Respondent  7:

Household spending remains constrained by very slow growth in employment  and wages but the process of

household  deleveraging  appears  to be  proceeding  and,  over  time,  I  expect  the  drag  on  consumer  spending from  the  negative  wealth  effect  to  abate. Consumer  spending  has  shown  some  unanticipated  strength  in recent  months  and  there  are  signs  that  the  saving  rate  is  stabilizing. Investment  spending  also  seems  to gaining some momentum.  Spending is being supported by The recently passed fiscal package will also boost growth somewhat  in  2011.  Although the package is temporary,  and there will be payback in  2012,  I  anticiÂ­ pate that  private  spending will be  robust  enough for the  recovery to continue.  Although I project  that  the economy will  grow  at  an  above-trend  pace  over  the  forecast  horizon,  I  anticipate  that  unemployment  will decline  only gradually.  A sizeable margin of labor market  slack,  coupled with stable inflation expectations, will  keep  wage  growth  and  core  inflation  in  check  over  the  entire  forecast  horizon. I  see  both  upside  and downside risks to the forecast for growth and inflation.  On the downside, I am particularly concerned about the  potential  for  further  declines  in  home  prices  to  undermine  consumer  confidence  and  spending  and  to negatively impact financial institutions and credit availability.  Fiscal austerity in advanced nations may also undermine  growth. The  potential  for  sovereign  debt  restructurings  in  Europe  also  poses  risks  to  financial markets  and  institutions.  On  the  upside,  recent  surprises  in  consumer  spending  suggest  that  the  recovery may have more momentum than I had anticipated  .  With respect to inflation, recent large increases in food and energy prices create some upside risk to my inflation forecast.

Respondent  8:

I  believe  the  recovery  is  firmly  in  place,  and  will  be  led  by  consumer  spending  and  business  investment. GDP growth is  likely to  be  above  trend. Residential  investment  is  likely to  contribute  little  to  growth  in overall  activity.  The stock of federal debt  will grow much more rapidly than GDP under current legislation, leading to uncertainty on the nature and timing of policy actions that  will put  the stock of debt  on  a more sustainable path.  That uncertainty could make firms and households more cautious in their spending plans.

Respondent  9:

The recovery is proceeding at  a moderate pace.

The prevailing headwinds continue to work against the recovery, restraining consumer spending and business investment from their cyclical norms.  Excess inventory of residential real estate is weighing on housing prices and the net worth of households.  I expect the rate of personal savings to remain elevated as households conÂ­ tinue to repair their balance sheets.  Uncertainty is working against the growth of business fixed investment and employment,  and firms continue to streamline their channels of distribution to keep inventory positions lean.

Commodity  price  pressures  are  still  being  absorbed  at  various  stages  along  the  production  pipeline,  and inflation  expectations  remain  relatively well  anchored.  Nevertheless,  it is  likely that  conventional  measures of economic slack are missing important changes in the labor market that have created a mismatch between labor supply and demand in some sectors.

Respondent  10:

The economic recovery is gathering notable momentum,  although labor markets  are improving only graduÂ­ ally. Monetary stimulus  and improvements in banking  and financial  market  conditions  provide  key drivers for  economic  expansion over the  next  few  years,  as  fiscal  stimulus  wanes.  Still,  it  will  take  several  years  of robust  growth  to  return  the  economy to  full  employment. In  the  meantime,  significant  slack  in  labor  and goods markets will keep inflation low,  but  well-anchored inflation expectations should help avoid significant further disinflation.

Respondent  11:

Overall,  the  economy continues  to  expand  at  a  moderate  pace.  In  light  of the  major  re-balancing  still  unÂ­ derway,  the  current  transition  from  a  stimulus-supported  recovery  to  a  self-sustaining  recovery  driven  by consumer  and  business  spending  is  encouraging. Consumer spending  appears  to  have  increased  at  a  solid

pace in the fourth quarter.  Based on solid consumer demand, businesses are expanding investment in equipÂ­ ment and software,  providing further impetus to GDP growth.

Under  these  economic  conditions,  I  expect  core  consumer  price  inflation  to  remain  low  in  the  near  term but  to  eventually  move  higher. Disinflationary  pressure  from  the  sharp  recession  will  eventually  dissipate and  be  dominated  by  the  influences  of rising  commodity  and  producer  prices,  a  depreciating  dollar,  and long-run inflation expectations that  are anchored at more than 2 percent.

The  risks  surrounding  the  outlook  for  growth  remain  considerable  and  I  now  see  the  risks  as  tilted  toÂ­ ward the upside.  Fiscal  policy,  uncertainty  about  regulatory policies,  and problems  in  real  estate  continue to pose downside risks to GDP growth.  However, the resiliency of the U.S. economy and traditional business cycle  dynamics-the tendency of strong recoveries to follow severe recessions-pose larger upside risks.

As  for  inflation,  in  the  near  term,  the  severe  recession  and  recent  consumer  price  trends  pose  some  small downside risks to core inflation.  Based in part on trends in commodity and producer prices,  I see little or no risk of deflation.  Longer term,  the expansion of our balance sheet and federal borrowing needs create  a risk to  the  stability of long-term  inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn,  inflation. In  addition,  there  is  a  risk  that monetary policy will remain too  accommodative  for too long,  creating  further upside risks to inflation.  On balance,  I  see inflation risks  as weighted toward the upside.

Respondent  12:

Although the economy appears to have entered 2011  with a bit more momentum,  that momentum appears right  now  to  be  tepid  and  not  yet  robust. That  part  of  the  momentum  that  is  stronger  appears  related entirely to business investment in equipment and software,  and increases in ndustrial production.  Appearing positive but not yet definitively propelling are improvements in auto sales and net exports which have moved demand,  although net exports seem to be driven primarily by a drop in imports.

Conditions in the labor market have improved only modesty.

The  housing  market  shows  no  signs  of  emerging  from  the  significant  overhang  of  real  estate  that  is  in foreclosure or entering the foreclosure process.  The day of reckoning in which institutions that service loans address their significant loan servicing process and system failures seems to have not yet occurred,  meaning that the process by which home sales are cleared in the market will remain fitful, and therefore unpredictable. The properties subject to foreclosure that were held back by financial institutions during the  'robo-signing' period will most likely come to market,  and these surges will enhance the uncertainty of supply resulting in further uncertainty regarding home equity values.

Inflationary expectations  have  remained  anchored,  despite  the  fact  that  core  inflation  continues  to  remain low. This  stickiness  benefits  the  recovery  by  preventing  a  contraction  that  would  occur  were  real  interest rates to  rise. Although core inflation remains low,  consumer prices may rise because of increases in energy costs -  which will  be experienced by households at the pump and in heating over the winter.

Respondent  13:

Broad improvement in economic indicators and sentiment suggests a better-grounded recovery than was apÂ­ parent  as recently as last  fall.  Commercial real estate debt  problems,  one of the more prominent  headwinds over the last  couple  of years,  appear  to  be  bottoming  out,  further reducing  risks  for  banking  system.  Even so,  I  anticipate that the likely pace of job creation and ongoing problems in the housing market will continue to exert some drag on growth of personal consumption.  Housing problems may offset some of the good news for  banking sector.

Major  risk  continues  to  be  a  Eurozone  shock. My  projections  assume  no  major  shock,  but  the  realizaÂ­ tion  of the  non-trivial  possibility that  one  occurs  could  significantly and  adversely affect  growth  prospects.

Respondent  14:

After a mid-year  'soft patch' , the pace of growth of the US economy strengthened over the closing months of 2010 to a greater extent than anticipated in November.  Based on available data,  we estimate that real GDP grew  at  a  3  Â¼ %  annual  rate  in  2010H2,  one-half percentage  point  faster than  over the  first  half of the  year. The upside surprise to growth was heavily concentrated in consumer spending,  with real  PCE estimated to have increased at  a 3  Â¼ % annual rate over 2010H2 versus 2% over 2010H1.  One contributor to this stronger growth  was  a  notable  increase  in  light  -weight  vehicle  sales  in  2010Q4,  to  12.3  million  units  (annual  rate) versus  an  average  of just  11.2  million  units  over  the  first  half  of  the  year. Factors  behind  this  rise  were some improvement in labor market conditions and an overall improvement in financial conditions,  as well as (according  to reports)  some  easing  of lending  standards  for  vehicle  financing. In  addition to  the  relatively strong pace of consumer spending, export growth remained robust over the second half of 2010.  The growth contribution from government increased, in part because the state and local sector has ramped up as stimulus projects finally get  underway.  In contrast,  growth of business fixed investment  slowed somewhat  relative to the first half of the year.  Housing market activity also turned out to be even weaker than expected,  with real residential  investment  declining  at  a  12  Â½%  annual  rate  over  the  final  six  months  of 2010. Overall,  real  fiÂ­ nal sales increased around 3 Â½ % (annual rate) over the second half versus just 1% over the first half of the year.

Despite  the  fact  that  growth  surprised  to  the  upside,  the  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  has been grudging.  Private nonfarm payroll employment increased an average of around 125,000 per month over the second half,  only modestly above the  100,000 per month average of the first half.  Moreover,  the growth of hours  worked  over  the  second  half of 2010  was  slightly slower  than  that  over  the  first  half,  reflecting  a marked pick-up in productivity growth.  The unemployment  rate  averaged  9.6%  in  2010Q4,  about  where it was at the beginning of the year.  Consistent with this continued large amount of slack in the economy, trend inflation  moved lower  over the  second  half of 2010.  The  core  PCE deflator  increased  around  0.5%  (annual rate)  in  2010H2  versus  1.1% over 2010H1.

We  continue  to  believe  that  conditions  are  now  in  place  for  a  self-reinforcing  recovery  generating  aboveÂ­ potential  growth,  a  declining  unemployment  rate,  and some  firming of core inflation.  The stronger  growth over the second half of 2010 is certainly consistent with that view.  Specifically, we expect growth of real GDP of 4%  (Q4/Q4)  in  both  2011  and  2012,  with  the  unemployment  rate  approaching  7%  by the  end  of 2012. Moreover, with slack being absorbed,  import prices rising,  and inflation expectations well anchored, core inÂ­ flation is expected to begin moving higher over this forecast horizon, reaching around 1   Â½ % by the end of 2012.

Several  factors  underlie  this  projection. First,  aided  by  the  second  installment  of  large  scale  asset  purÂ­ chases  announced  by  the  FOMC  in  early  November,  overall  financial  conditions  have  improved  in  recent months.  The S&amp;P500 is up about 22% since late August.  Moreover,  as measured by the Senior Loan Officer Survey,  bank lending standards have begun to ease modestly and  C&amp;I  loans on bank balance sheets finally have started to increase.  Second,  the household deleveraging process appears to be quite far along.  Based on historical relationships,  the current  level of the personal saving rate  appears to be  about  where it should be given the level of household net worth.  Indeed,  according to the Flow of Funds data for 2010Q3,  the rate of decline of household liabilities has begun to slow while more recent data indicate that non revolving consumer debt  (excluding mortgages)  has begun to expand.  Third,  while currently quite low,  housing market activity is  likely  to  begin  to  pick  up  as  the  labor  market  improves  and  housing  affordability remains  high.  Fourth, continued favorable growth prospects among our major trading partners along with a lower exchange value of the dollar are expected to produce sustained strong export growth.  Fifth, improving domestic and foreign demand is likely to induce stronger growth of business investment.  Sixth,  with incomes rising,  tax revenues of state and local governments have begun to recover, which should help put that sector in a more solid fiscal position.  Lastly,  the  passage  of the fiscal  agreement  enhances  growth  prospects  for  2011.  In  particular,  the 2  percentage  point  reduction  of the  employee's  share  of the  OASDI  payroll  tax  is  likely to  boost  consumer spending and the immediate expensing of business investment probably will  raise investment  in equipment

and software.

The  underlying  economic  fundamentals  are  expected  to  continue  to  improve  in  2012,  with  a  more  firmly established recovery of the housing sector and modest growth of business investment of nonresidential strucÂ­ tures. However,  the  federal  fiscal  impulse  will  turn  negative  as  the  payroll  tax  rate  and  depreciation  rates return to previous levels.  Thus,  growth of real  GDP in 2012 is likely to be about the same as in 2011.

The  balance  of risks  to  our  real  activity  projection  remains  skewed  to  the  downside  but  less  so  than  in November. Housing  market  activity  generally  remains  weak  and  there  is  evidence  of renewed  downward pressure on home prices.  If sustained,  a negative wealth effect through this channel could induce households to boost their desired saving,  resulting in  a lower trajectory  for consumer  spending.  Another downside risk is  that  growth  prospects  among  major trading partners in Europe  turn out  to be  weaker than expected  as the full  force  of fiscal contraction begins to be  felt.

An important risk over the medium term remains our assumption regarding the economy's potential growth rate. While  labor  productivity  growth  is  running  close  to  the  rate  underlying  our  modal  projection,  we have  not  acquired  any increased confidence  in our long-run  assumption on productivity growth.  Given the low  level  of overall  business  investment  and the  possible  misallocation  of labor  and capital,  the  economy's potential  growth  rate  may  have  slowed  significantly. Nonetheless,  our  analysis  of recent  labor  market  deÂ­ velopments  continues  to suggest  a  decline  in  the  share  of unemployment  related  to  mismatch  between job seekers  and job openings.

The risks  around  the  central  scenario  for  inflation  are  also  slightly skewed  to  the  downside. The  downside risks  to  the  growth  projection  combined  with  the  possibility  of no  meaningful  decline  in  potential  implies downside  inflation  risks. Nevertheless,  with  the  aggressive  monetary  policy  response,  higher  commodity prices,  and the possibility of a stronger-than-expected rebound,  there remains a risk of higher inflation than our modal projection.

The  heightened  uncertainty  associated  with  the  shape  of  recoveries  from  periods  of  banking  and  finanÂ­ cial  crisis,  the  uncertainty  associated  with  the  synchronization  of  global  policy  actions,  and  the  lingering uncertainties  associated  with  the  peripheral  European  debt  crisis  result  in  greater  uncertainty  around  our central projection compared to typical levels over the last twenty years.  In particular,  we still have retained significant  tail  risks  in  our  forecast  risk  assessment,  in  part  reflecting  the  possibilities  that  the  European debt crisis (where developments have frequently surprised us through the past year) could have a much more severe impact  on the global economy,  as well as that public confidence in monetary and fiscal policy actions deteriorates significantly,  leading to unmoored inflation expectations and prompting an unexpectedly severe tightening of policy on both fronts.

Respondent  15:

In  2011  through  2013  I  anticipate  that  real  growth  will  occur  at  greater  than  steady-state  rates,  reflectÂ­ ing normal cyclical patterns reinforced by a modest  ongoing impact  of the  fiscal  stimulus package,  and the substantial  monetary stimulus  that  has  been in train  since  late  2008.  I  expect  that  beginning  in  2013  real growth will slow and subsequently approach steady-state rates.  I expect that  core PCE inflation over all of 2011  to be somewhat higher that of 2010 and increases in food and energy prices to drive headline inflation somewhat  above  the core rate  for  2011.  Subsequently,  under  appropriate monetary policy,  inflation  should approach my preferred long-run rate of 1.5  percent,  though I  believe  that  it  will  rise  above  that  rate  in  an interim period.  I  do  not  believe  that  future  energy  shocks  can  be  forecasted,  so  with  available  information I  expect  that the core  and headline inflation will be roughly equal in the out years of the projection period.

Respondent  16:

Macroeconomic policies  have  improved  somewhat  in the  last  quarter. This  has  caused  a  mark-up  of GDP

and employment  forecasts.  Policies,  however,  are still  far less supportive of long-term growth than optimal.

Respondent  17:

The economy is entering 2011  with significantly improved upward momentum.  It is tempting to extrapolate this  momentum  forward  over  the  entire  year  and  into  2012. Once  upon  a  time  it  was  certainly  the  case that  economic  recoveries  were  characterized  by  a  powerful  'virtuous  cycle'  in  which  pent-up  demand  for consumer durables and housing would trigger strong business investment and hiring that would feed back to encourage  additional  growth in  consumer  demand etc.,  etc. That's  still  a  plausible  scenario,  but  there  are several mitigating factors,  among them:

- -   Given  past  overbuilding  and  the  consequent  low  price  of  existing  homes  relative  to  new  homes,  resiÂ­ dential construction isn't going to rebound robustly anytime soon.
- -   Households  have  revised  sharply  downward  their  estimates  of  their  long-run  income  prospects,  which will mute the rebound in consumer demand.

People fear cuts in benefits and increases in taxes and tax rates.

People have seen what they had thought was real wealth evaporate.

- -   The  political  reality  is  that  government  purchases  are  much  more  likely  to  be  a  drag  on  growth  than a contributor to growth.
- -   The  goods-producing  sector  has  become  much  less  cyclically  sensitive  as  it  has  become  more  globalized. There is a much greater  'leakage'  of employment,  CAPEX,  and demand across international borders.

On  this  last  point,  although  the  contribution  of  net  exports  to  GDP  growth  is  just  as  volatile  as  ever, the  correlation  between  net-exports  growth  and  GDP  growth  has  become  much  more  negative  over  the years.  That  is to say,  the dampening effect of net  exports on the U.S.  business cycle  is much stronger these days. (Specifically,  the  1955-1983  correlation  coefficient  is  -0.25. The  1984-2010  correlation  coefficient  is  0.64.)  And this dampening was especially evident in the recent recession and recovery:  net exports provided an  unusually large  boost  to  growth  during  the  recession,  and were  responsible  for  an  unusually  large  drag on growth during the first year of recovery.

Respondent  18:

Incoming  data  suggest  that  the  recovery  is  somewhat  firmer  than  previously  anticipated. While  some  of the strength in consumer spending seen in late 2010 was transitory,  we expect private demand to accelerate over the course  of this year and next.  Real  interest  rates  remain supportive  of growth,  their recent increase notwithstanding.  The  release  of pent-up  demand  for spending  and  investment  accelerator  effects  also conÂ­ tribute  to  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon. In  addition,  firms  are  expected  to  step  up  hiring  not  just  to meet  increasing  demand,  but  also  to  catch  up  with  the  hiring  that  was  postponed  in  the  early  stages  of the  recovery. In  all,  these  factors  should  contribute  to  demand  growing  about  1   Â¼   percentage  point  above potential this year.  A more vigorous pace of growth is expected in 2012, despite the waning impact from the fiscal stimulus, as residential investment and investment in structures contribute more significantly to growth.

Risks  to  the  real  outlook  are  becoming  more  balanced. The  potential  downside,  however,  remains  much more  costly  than  the  potential  upside,  as  significant  inflationary  pressures  are  unlikely  to  materialize  any time soon.  Even a relatively small negative shock to the baseline outlook would move GDP growth closer to potential, thus yielding little or no improvement in the unemployment rate.  In this regard, the housing sector continues  to  be  a  significant  downside  risk  to  the  outlook. The  recent  declines  in  housing  prices  and  the high  vacancy rates  do  not  bode  well  for  the  sector. Moreover,  there  is  evidence  suggesting  that  residential

investment  has  an  effect  on  GDP  that  is  far  greater  than  its  small  nominal  share. This  linkage  between housing and other sectors could well imply slower growth than the baseline outlook.  Risks from a sovereign debt crisis in Europe,  too,  contribute  to the uncertainty of the forecast.

The expected pace of GDP growth over the course of this year and next implies that the unemployment rate is  still  above  7  Â½   percent  by  the  end  of 2012. Given  the  projected  sizable  slack  in  labor  markets  over  the forecast  horizon,  the  rate  of core  inflation  is  projected  to  remain  well  below  target. Recent  inflation  data continue to indicate  that  the possibility of deflation over the forecast  horizon is more than  a tail event.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c).  Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current  economic forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent  1:

We  think  GDP  growth  over  the  nearer-term  will  be  somewhat  stronger  than  the  Tealbook. This  reflects a  different  reading  on  current  cyclical  momentum,  and  not  a  fundamental  disagreement  over  the  forecast rationale;  indeed,  our projection for average growth over the next three years is very close to the Tealbook's. We are projecting a somewhat lower unemployment rate,  however,  in part reflecting some differences in our accounting for factors such as extended UI  and labor market  mismatch.

Respondent  2:

My forecast  calls  for  a  return  to  above  trend  GDP  growth,  but  at  rates  below  those  in  the  Tealbook,  parÂ­ ticularly  in  2012  and  2013. The  difference,  in  large  part,  is  due  to  the  impediments  to  growth  posed  by ongoing structural  adjustments that I  mention in part 4(a).  Consequently,  my unemployment rate forecast is  slightly higher  than  the  Tealbook's,  My  forecast  for  core  inflation  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook  in  the  near term,  though converges more quickly toward the mandate-consistent range by the end of 2013.

Respondent  3:

Similar to Tealbook but slightly more pessimistic about near-term growth prospects.  Perhaps putting a little weight on the more pessimistic forecasts of Blue Chip and other outsiders.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

I  see  inflation picking up  faster than does the Tealbook.

Respondent  6:

My inflation forecast is less influenced by the degree of resource utilization in the economy and so I project a higher pace of inflation over 2011-2013 than does the Tealbook.  Given the strength of economic growth in my baseline  forecast  and the higher inflation path,  the policy path is  less  accommodative over the  forecast horizon.

Respondent  7:

My views are largely in line with Tealbook

Respondent  8:

Under an appropriate monetary policy,  well-anchored inflation expectations would lead to an inflation path that  is  higher than the Tealbook's path.

Respondent  9:

Growth in 2011 is expected to be slightly under the Tealbook assumption, owing to a generally more modest rise  in  consumer  spending  and  business  fixed  investment. I  expect  this  subdued  growth  path  to  continue into  2012.  However,  I  have  assumed  a  lower level  of potential  output,  resulting  in  an  inflation  path  that  is more responsive to growth over the near-term.

Respondent  10:

My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection.

Respondent  11:

The  key  difference  is  the  monetary policy  path,  which  leads  to  some  differences  in  the  economic  outlook.

In  my view,  appropriate  policy should  follow  a  path  considerably different  than  in  Tealbook,  to  foster the longer-run stability of the economy.  My preferred path of policy yields modestly slower GDP growth in 2012. Nonetheless,  core  inflation  is  slightly higher  in  my  forecast  than  in  Tealbook,  because  I  expect  inflation  to move  toward  long-term  inflation  expectations  faster  than  it  does  in  Tealbook. This  difference  in  forecasts can  be  traced  to  differences  in  our  views  of the  relative  importance  of inflation  expectations  (importantly affected by monetary policy) and economic slack for forecasting inflation.

Respondent  12:

My forecast  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook  projection. However,  I  continue  to  be  troubled  by  the  unÂ­ certainty  regarding  mortgage  documentation  and  related  servicing  problems  which  are  creating  an  erratic pace  of sales  of foreclosed  properties. In  addition,  home  foreclosure  rates  will  likely be  higher  this  year  as financial institutions represent that they have fixed their internal servicing problems and restart foreclosures for  thousands  of properties. In  addition  to  the  elevated  volume  of home  foreclosures,  elevated  inventories of unsold  homes,  and  high  office  and  commercial  vacancy  rates  create  a  large  supply  and  exert  downward pressure on home equity values.  In addition,  the quality of these homes has deteriorated,  resulting in more downward pressure on prices through reduced demand.  All of these possibilities could lead to further house price  declines,  resulting in the discouragement  of potential  home  buyers and depressed housing starts.  t.

I  also  am  not  certain  that  the  reserving  that  banks  have  done  in  response  to  foreclosure  related  investiÂ­ gations  and litigation is  adequate  for  future  losses.  If concerns  are  renewed  about  the  adequacy of banking sector  capital,  there  could  be  further  damage  to  the  confidence  of firms  and  households,  leading  to  delays of purchases in business capital  and consume durables.  If severe deficiencies  in reserves were to materialize credit  availability could  again contract  dramatically.  While perhaps this is a low probability event,  it  is not one that  I  believe has been modeled and scoped in the Tealbook forecasts.

Respondent  13:

I  am not  quite  as  optimistic  about  equity prices  or  trade  balance  over  the  next  couple  of years.  I  continue to be less confident  in the projected path of energy prices

Respondent  14:

We  assume  lower  inflation  persistence  than  does  the  Tealbook. Therefore,  under  the  assumption  of well anchored inflation expectations,  we project that  inflation returns to within the  'mandate consistent'  range in 2012-3,  whereas it  remains below that  range in the  Tealbook.

Respondent  15:

Compared to the 70% confidence intervals  for the  Tealbook forecasts,  the differences between the point esÂ­ timates in the  Tealbook baseline forecast  and my projections are not  different in any meaningful statistical sense.  However I see higher inflation in the intermediate period before returning to the rate that I believe is consistent  with  appropriate  monetary policy.  In  contrast  the  Tealbook  forecast  sees  an  'extended  period' of very low inflation.

Respondent  16:

Continue  to expect  materially less  benefit  from  the  real economy  from  continued Fed balance sheet  expanÂ­ sion.

Respondent  17:

The Tealbook baseline core inflation forecast  for the next several years is not  far different  from that which I would expect  to see under  appropriate policy,  and the  Tealbook forecast  for the unemployment rate  also is reasonable.  However,  I believe that  the Tealbook continues to underestimate the incentive for businesses to meet new demand by expanding operations overseas rather than domestically-an effect that will hold down actual and potential GDP growth,  somewhat, relative to what has been assumed in the baseline forecast.

Respondent  18:

The forecast  for real  activity is  very similar  to the  Tealbook  forecast.  Core  inflation,  however,  is  projected to be lower than  in the  Tealbook.  We model inflation  as depending,  among other factors,  on near-term inÂ­ flation expectations.  In our outlook,  these near-term inflation expectations are drifting down,  thus lowering inflation.  In the Tealbook,  instead, inflation is more dependent on long-run inflation expectations,  which the Tealbook expects to remain well anchored.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(d).  Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing your  forecast  to  change  since  the previous  quarter's  projections.

Respondent  1:

Our  forecast  for  growth  in  2011  is  3/4  percentage  point  higher  than  our  projection  in  November. This revision reflects the stronger incoming data on real activity we have received over the past several months as well  as  added  fiscal  impetus  due  to  the  tax  package  passed in  December.  Our  forecasts  for  growth  in  2012 and  2013  have  changed  little. Our  projection  of the  unemployment  rate  has  revised  down  to  reflect  some unexpected decline in 2010, the stronger growth outlook, and some reassessment of the influence of various supply-side  factors on the path for the rate.  Our  inflation forecasts is little changed.

Respondent  2:

I  have  marked up my prospects  for near-term  growth relative  to my November  forecast, largely because  of the  unexpected  strength in the  incoming data.  I  also edged  down  my near-term unemployment  rate  path, due,  in  part,  to  the  surprise  0.4  percentage  point  drop  in  the  December  unemployment  rate  and  stronger near-term  growth  prospects. Finally,  signs  of some  recent  firming  in  both  underlying  inflation  trends  and inflation expectations led me to nudge up my core inflation projection.

Respondent  3:

Somewhat stronger than expected data on consumer spending and the labor market suggest that the second 'stage'  of the recovery,  led by private final domestic demand,  is under way and broadening.  Financial condiÂ­ tions have improved fairly significantly,  reflecting both increased optimism in markets and recent monetary policy actions.

Respondent  4:

N/A

Respondent  5:

There  has  been  a  pick-up  in  commodity  prices  and  that  has  led  me  to  revise  upward  my  forecast  for  core inflation.  There have been a host of good news regarding economic activity that has led me to revise upward my forecast  for 2011  GDP growth.

Respondent  6:

NA

Respondent  7:

My  forecasts  are  little  changed  from  those  in  November. Recent  data  suggesting  stronger  consumer  and investment  spending  have  slightly  diminished  my  assessment  of downside  risks  to  the  economy. I  now  see the risks  around my forecast  for growth as balanced,  as opposed to weighted to the downside.

Respondent  8:

The  data  flow  has  strengthened  since  the  last  projection. For  example,  retail  sales  and  the  ISM  indexes for  the  manufacturing  and  nonmanufacturing  sectors  have  improved  notably. Employment  growth  in  the fourth quarter was consistent with output growth.  Energy and other commodity prices have moved higher, boosting near-term overall inflation; in addition,  the price  for housing services will be less of a drag on core inflation.

Respondent  9:

My  forecast  for  real  activity  has  been  revised  slightly  high  in  response  to  incoming  data  that  suggest  a modestly stronger spending pace going forward.

Respondent  10:

Since early November, the data on economic activity have been better overall than we had expected and the pace  of economic  recovery has  picked  up  considerably. We  have  therefore  raised  our  forecast  of real  GDP growth  in  the  first  half of  2011  by  about  3/4  percentage  point  (annual  rate). Consistent  with  the  more optimistic outlook for output,  we have lowered our forecast for the unemployment rate somewhat.  Headline inflation data in the second half of 2010 came in lower than we had expected;  however,  headline inflation in the first  half of 2011  has been  revised up given the recent jump in oil prices.  Our  forecast  for core inflation in  2011  is  little  changed  as  the very low recent  core  inflation news  has  been offset going  forward  by slightly less  slack  and  a small pass-through  from higher commodity prices.

Respondent  11:

The primary sources contributing  to  changes  in  my  forecast  were  the  modestly stronger  pace  of consumer demand in the second half of 2010 combined with the  additional stimulus of the payroll tax cut  in the  Tax Relief Act  passed in  December.  These two  factors will provide greater momentum for growth in  2011,  but the  temporary  nature  of the  payroll  tax  cut  will  lead  to  a  slight  pullback  in  growth  in  2012. Based  on the  stronger  growth in  2011,  there  is  a  modest  improvement  in  the  unemployment  rate  relative  to  the  last projection.

Respondent  12:

My prior  forecast  noted that  reductions  in employment,  income  and wealth had left  many households with a  need  to  repair  their  severely  distressed  balance  sheets. I  do  not  believe  that  consumer  confidence  has returned yet  to the  levels  that  would  be  necessary  for  a sustainable  recovery.  My prior  forecast  also  noted continued  uncertainty regarding the  mortgage  documentation  problems  which  act  as  a  continuing  drag  on the resurgence of the housing market.  I believe these problems have not  yet been resolved.  I think they are in fact  somewhat  enhanced by the fact of an adverse ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court regarding mortgage assignments in blank and the possibility of the need to reserve for increased litigation costs.

Respondent  13:

Broad-based firming of economic data and market perceptions of reduced tail risks

Respondent  14:

The fiscal  agreement  enacted  at  the  end of 2010  provides more stimulus  in  2011  than  previously expected, offsetting  a lower projected path of housing starts.  However,  in  2012 that  stimulus is removed,  resulting in a somewhat lower growth rate than previously expected.

The  strength  in  consumer  spending  at  the  end  of  the  year  led  us  to  reduce  the  downside  risks  to  our forecast  and increased the likelihood of a faster rebound than in our central scenario.

Respondent  15:

My forecasts  for real  growth  and unemployment  are essentially unchanged  from my previous quarter's proÂ­ jections. The  data  from recent  months  suggest  stronger growth  than in  previous  consensus  forecasts,  with the  result  that  those  forecasts  have  been  revised  upward  and  are  now  close  to  my  prior  forecast. Since inflation  has  remained  low  relative  to  my  previous  forecast,  I  have  shifted  forward  to  2012  from  2011  my forecast  of the peak rate of inflation.

Respondent  17:

The pick up in economic growth we  are  experiencing was  not  unexpected,  and I  have  made only small  adÂ­ justments  to  my  GDP  growth  and  unemployment-rate  forecasts. The  recent  run  up  in  commodity  prices, though  also  partly  anticipated,  has  caused  me  to  increase  my  near-term  forecast  of  headline  inflation. I remain concerned that stimulus measures will, in practice, be withdrawn too slowly, giving the inflation path

a pronounced upward tilt.  Heeding the admonition that our projections be conditioned on what we believe to be appropriate policy,  however,  I  have marked down fairly sharply my 2013 inflation estimate.

Respondent  18:

The  real  outlook  and  the  inflation  outlook  have  not  changed  materially  this  year  and  next. Compared  to our previous forecast the economy is showing somewhat more momentum, but this is largely offset by higher long-term interest rates over the  forecast horizon.
