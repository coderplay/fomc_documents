Table 1. Economic projections of Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, June 2012

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The April projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on April 24-25, 2012.

- 1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: The  unemployment  rate  may  not  converge  to  its  longer-run  value  until  late  in  the 5-6  year  window.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: Our  current  estimate  of  the  economy's  potential  growth  rate  is  in  the  2%  to  2 1 % 2 range. By 2017-18 we anticipate potential growth of around 2 1 %. 4 A reasonable estimate of the long-run unemployment  rate  is 4%  to 6%. Assuming  appropriate  policy  and  no further significant shocks,  we  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  in  this  range  and  the  output  gap  to  be  around  zero  by 2017-18;  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  (1980s  and  1990s)  suggests  the  unemployment  rate  could be  somewhat  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator and  around 2.5%  for the CPI.  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  be  near  zero, we expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  close  to  2%  in  2017-18.

Respondent 4: The headwinds  facing  the  economy have been  exceptionally persistent  in  contrast to the normal  cyclical  dynamics  characteristic  of  most  U.S.  recoveries. I expect  these  headwinds  to persist,  possibly  intensifying  if  the  problems  facing  the  euro  area  result  in  sluggish  global  growth  for a prolonged  period  and  advanced  countries,  including  the  United  States,  take  actions  to  place  fiscal policy on more  sustainable  paths. I therefore think that the economy  is  unlikely  to converge  to its longer  run  steady  state  until  close  to  the  end  of  the  decade

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8: I anticipate that the  convergence process  will be shorter than  5-6 years. In my  view, real GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment  rate  will  converge  by  year-end  2015, while PCE  inflation will converge  even  quicker.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: The  convergence process  may  be slightly shorter than  5-6 years

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12: Unemployment  should  be  close  to  its  long-run  value  in  five  to  six  years. Inflation should  be  close  to  its  long-run  value  by  next  year.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14:

N/A

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Convergence  to  the  longer-run  levels of the unemployment  rate  and  inflation  is expected  in  5  to  6  years.

Respondent 17:

N/A

Respondent 18: N/A

Respondent 19: Full convergence  may  take  six  years. However,  risks  are  weighted  toward  faster convergence.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1:

N/A

Respondent 2: Several  factors  contribute to heightened uncertainty, including  the European  debt crisis, U.S.  fiscal policy  (near-term  and  medium-term),  slowing  world  growth,  and  ongoing  changes  in the regulatory  environment. In addition, the Federal  Reserve's unconventional policies  are a source of uncertainty  because  they have no historical precedent.

Respondent 3: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the standard  deviation of the FRBNY  forecast distribution  for GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  the  forecast  errors over the last 20 years. Our  assessment of the uncertainty for  all of these projections has increased since the April SEP.

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: Volatility  was  unusually  low  in  the  past  twenty  years.

Respondent 8:

N/A

Respondent 9: It is not  clear  that  real output  will  grow  more  rapidly  than  the  longer-term  trend rate and thereby return to the pre-recession trend line, or whether  we are instead now  tracking a permanently lower trend line.  Thus uncertainty  regarding GDP growth and  unemployment is  elevated relative to the recent past. Inflation  expectations are probably  more firmly anchored now than they were 10 to 20 years  ago, and the FOMC's  consensus statement has probably enhanced that anchoring. As  a result,  uncertainty  regarding  inflation  is  correspondingly  lower  than  in  the  past.

Respondent 10: The possibility  that the European debt crisis is not resolved in  an  orderly  fashion continues to be a risk to the forecast. There is uncertainty about domestic fiscal policy as well. It remains  the case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and uncertainties surrounding  the  future  path  of policy, including  the timing  of the exit from  accommodative  policy, contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Uncertainty about growth and  unemployment is high because of our  lack of experience  with recoveries from financial crises/housing busts; the ongoing  structural changes in productivity and the labor  market; fiscal policy;  and, especially, global  factors, including  not only European developments but  also China/EMEs  and  oil. Core inflation  remains quite stable, reflecting  stable inflation expectations and  monetary policy  communication.  Overall inflation is  more uncertain than historically because of the high volatility  of  commodity prices, which in turn is  tied to the variability/uncertainty in the  global  economy  as  well  as  financial  factors  to  some  extent  (e.g.,  volatile  risk  preferences).

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Uncertainty about my projection for  economic  activity is  elevated  relative to its average  over  the  past  20  years. My  assessment  includes  the  following  factors:

- (i) The'new normal'for  macroeconomic relationships going forward  remains unclear.  For example, there is greater  uncertainty  than usual about the  level  and growth rate of potential  output.
- (ii) The crisis in Europe has intensified since April, and the risks of more extreme downside scenarios  there  have  risen. In these  scenarios,  financial  market  contagion  to  the  United  States  could be  severe. At  the  same  time,  other  major  economies  in  the  world,  such  as  China,  are  slowing.
- (iii) Domestically, a downside risk is a U.S. political stalemate that leads to abruptly  contractionary fiscal policy.
- (iv) In the event of adverse shocks, there is  limited ability for  monetary  and fiscal policy to dampen the  effects. This  limited  scope  for  countercyclical  policy  implies  greater  variance  in  outcomes.
- (v) Of course, there are upside risks to the outlook as well. For example, the housing market may  be poised to improve faster than expected, which  could potentially encourage a virtuous cycle of improving  confidence,  fundamentals,  and  financial  conditions.

In contrast,  underlying  inflation  is  anchored  by  quite  stable  inflation  expectations. The  stability of these  expectations has been reinforced by  the  announcement of a 2 percent numerical objective  for inflation. Hence,  uncertainty  about  core  inflation  is  lower  than  in  the  past  two  decades. Uncertainty about  headline  inflation is broadly  similar  to the past two decades, reflecting the lower uncertainty about  underlying  inflation  that  is  offset  by  greater-than-usual  uncertainty  about  oil  prices.

Respondent 15: Compared  to  conditions  at  the time of the April meeting, the uncertainty  surrounding  forecasts of GDP  growth  and  unemployment  have  risen, primarily reflecting the crisis in Europe  and  the  fiscal  problems  facing  the  United  States  next  year.

Respondent 16: N/A

Respondent 17: The possibility of  cataclysmic effects in Europe  with unpredictable spillover effects makes  this  period  unusually  fraught  with  uncertainty.

Respondent 18: N/A

Respondent 19: N/A

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: Our  baseline  forecast  has  been  revised  down  since  April  to  show  greater  restraint on the U.S.  economy  emanating  from  events  in  Europe  and  the  fiscal  situation  in  the  U.S.  However, it is still difficult to see the risks from these  events  as balanced: the potential bad  outcomes  of the political debates both here and abroad would be associated  with recessions, while the  more successful resolutions  likely  would  not  provide  a  symmetric  boost  to  growth  relative  to  trend. This  is  especially true  with regard  to Europe, where any  resolution requires a difficult period of structural readjustments and  changes  in  terms  of  trade  that  would  severely  weigh  on  the  Euro-area  economies.

Respondent 2: The risks to GDP growth  are weighted to the downside,  and the risks to unemployment  are  weighted  to  the  upside. Downside  risks  to  growth  (and  upside  risks  to  unemployment)  in  the near  term include the European debt  crisis, a slowdown in  emerging  market growth,  and the fiscal  cliff in the United  States. In the medium  term,  I  see  the  risks  to  growth  and  unemployment  as  balanced as the  resilience  of  the  U.S.  economy  poses  upside  risks  to  growth  (downside  risks  to  unemployment) offset by downside  risks  to growth  (upside  risks  to unemployment)  from  a  possible  spillover  of  near term  risks into the medium  term. The  risks to inflation are skewed  to  the  upside  due  to the highly accommodative  stance  of  monetary  policy  and  longer  term  fiscal  imbalances.

Respondent 3: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection and the expected value from the FRBNY  forecast distribution.  The balance of risks to the inflation outlook are  roughly  balanced  over  the  near  term,  but  skewed  to  the  downside  over  the  medium  term.

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: My projection  for  inflation  is  conditioned  on my  view  that  the  output  gap  is  less negative than in the Tealbook. My  weighting  of risks for inflation reflects the possibility that this view  could  prove  to  be  wrong.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: In the near  term,  there  is an appreciable  downside  risk  to  growth  in  Europe  that could lead to lower US  exports  to Europe  and  emerging  economies. Moreover,  the  fiscal cliff poses a clear downside  risk. In the medium  term,  impediments  to  growth  may  be  serious  and  persistent enough  to  impede  a  the  rise  in  GDP  growth  given  above.

Respondent 10: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal of accommodation. Over the near term, the risk to output growth is weighted to the downside and the risk to the unemployment  rate  is weighted to the upside, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the ongoing crisis in Europe and domestic fiscal policy. Over the medium  term, as

these uncertainties  abate,  the  risks  shift to the upside  for GDP  growth  and  to  the  downside  for  the unemployment  rate.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Downside  risks  to  growth  and  upside  risks  to  unemployment  come  from  Europe and other global risks (China), fiscal cliff/debt limit, oil shocks. These outweigh the upside risks associated  with a better than expected resolution of European or US fiscal issues or greater  momentum in the economy. Risks  to inflation are tied primarily  to  commodity  prices,  which  are  volatile  but  as likely to be  declining  (esp  in  a  global  growth  slowdown)  as  rising.

Respondent 13: N/A

Respondent 14: Risks  to  growth  are  skewed  to  the  downside  and,  consequently,  to  the  upside  for unemployment. Key downside  risks  to the outlook are the European  sovereign debt  crisis and the looming  U.S. fiscal  cliff. In addition, negative shocks  could have particularly severe effects, because of the  continuing  vulnerability of  the  financial  system  as  well  as  the  limited  ability of  fiscal  and  monetary policy  to  respond  to  offset  them. Inflation  risks,  in  contrast,  are  more  typically  balanced.

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16:

N/A

Respondent 17: Downside  risks  stemming  from  the  worsening  global  outlook  continue  to  have  a dominant  influence  on  my  assessment  of  the  risks to growth  and  unemployment. The  potential  for slack to play  a greater  role  on near  and  medium-term  inflation  trends  argues  in  favor  of  shifting  my assessment  of  the  inflation  risks  from  broadly  balanced,  to  weighted  to  the  downside  (that  is,  inflation could  fall  to an  undesirably  lower  rate.)

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: My  judgments regarding appropriate policy reflect a loss function that equally weights deviations in inflation and  unemployment from their longer-run  goals. Inflation is projected to run  slightly  below  target. In  contrast,  our  miss  on  employment  is  massive-even  the  most  conservative assumption  currently  would  put  it  at  2  percentage  points-and  in  light  of  the  large  downside  risks  to the projection, the chance  for significant improvement is small. Accordingly, my appropriate policy would  add  more  accommodation  today.

My  preferred way of increasing accommodation  would  be  to  condition our future policy moves on explicit economic  markers,  namely,  that  we  would  delay  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  until the unemployment  rate  had  at  least  reached  7 percent  or the medium  term  inflation  forecast hit 3 percent. After lift-off, rates would  initially increase broadly  in line with Taylor  (1999); these plans would  also  be  communicated  today. In addition  to  these  communications,  I  would  begin  today  a  new LSAP  program  with  the  purchase  of  additional  MBS,  both  to  lower  term  premia  (with  an  emphasis on  those  in  mortgage  markets)  and  to  underscore  our  commitment  to  keep  the  federal  funds  rate  low for a long  time.

Such a policy accepts the risk of inflation running above 2 percent. However, the risk of even a moderate  loss against our inflation goal appears quite small. For example, even with the extra accommodation  provided  by the Tealbook optimal policy, inflation only overshoots our goal by a couple of  tenths over the  (long-run) projection period-and the sum of these  misses shies in  comparison to the size and  persistence  of  the  differences  between  the  unemployment  rate  and  the  NAIRU  under any  of  the  Tealbook  policy  alternatives.

Respondent 2: Key  factors informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy  are  achieving  an inflation objective of 2 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economic recovery that reduces unemployment.  In  order to preempt the potential  for rising inflationary pressures and the buildup  of  risks  in  the  financial  system  that  could  impede  the  achievement  of  these  goals,  I  currently anticipate it will be necessary to begin the process of normalizing  monetary  policy  in 2013. After raising the federal funds rate to 1.0 percent, I would  maintain  it for a period of time to allow the economy  and  markets  to  adjust  to  a  non-crisis  rate  environment.

Respondent 3: The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path  for monetary policy and the FFR are the current  state of the  economy, our  central  economic outlook, and  our balance of risks around  the central outlook. Indicators of economic  and  financial conditions generally have worsened  somewhat  since  April,  indicating  that  the  expansion  is  tenuous  at  this  time. Currently,  we observe  the  combination  of  continuing  substantial  resource  underutilization;  a  forecast  of  slow  growth, high unemployment,  and  near- or below-objective  inflation; and downside  risks  to the real activity and  inflation  outlooks  as  calling  for continued  policy  accommodation. In an environment  where  the policy rate is constrained  by  the  zero  lower bound  and  the  financial  system  remains  impaired,  such accommodation  will lead to the target FFR  remaining  near zero until late 2014. We  expect that long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over  this  period. The  pace  of  renormalization of the target  FFR  following  the  period  of  near  zero  policy  rates  will  depend  upon  our  assessment  of economic  conditions  and inflation expectations  as well as upon  credit spreads and overall financial conditions.

An  important  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  target  FFR  is  our estimate  of the equilibrium  real short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  the  this rate  is in the  range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range for nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  3.0  - 5.0%. Given  the  recent  behavior  of  nominal  and  real  Treasury yields and productivity  growth, we currently see this rate over the longer-run as more  likely to be in the lower half of the indicated range, which results in the point estimate given in the response to question  3(a). Moreover,  given  the  weak  state  of  the  economy  and  our  expectations  of  continued strained  financial  conditions,  our  assessment  of  the  current 'neutral' FFR  is below  our  estimate  of  the longer-run  FFR  and  is  expected  to  remain  so  for  some  time.

As discussed  in  our  answer  to question  3(e),  our policy path  is predicated  on  the FOMC  continuing the  Maturity  Extension  Program  (MEP)  through  the  end  of  this  year  to  provide  the  accommodation that we see as necessary in the current situation. Further deterioration in economic  and financial conditions,  our  modal  forecast,  and  our  risk  assessment  would  lead  us  to  assume  a  purchase  program with  communication  indicating  that  purchases  would  continue  until  a  self-sustaining  recovery  is  fully established.

Respondent 4: My  assessment of  economic  conditions is  close to Tealbook, but  my preferred policy path  is more  accommodative  than  the  outcome-based  rule  incorporated  into  the  Tealbook  baseline. My  modal  forecast  assumes  that  the  federal  funds  rate  will  be  maintained  in  its  present  range  until late  2015, when the unemployment rate has declined to around  6.5%.  My preferred path is  marginally less stimulative than the optimal  control path with commitment  but  more  stimulative  than  Taylor (1999). Given  the persistent nature  of the headwinds  facing  the  economy  and  the  atypical  cyclical dynamics  we  have  seen  since  the  recovery  began,  I  consider  it  appropriate  to  provide  more  stimulus than  is called  for under  Taylor  (1999). I estimate  that  under  my  policy  path,  unemployment  will  be about  0.7%  lower  in  2015  than  if  policy  instead  followed  Taylor  1999  and  inflation  will  hold  close  to 2%  over  the  forecast  instead  of  running  consistently  under  2%  under  Taylor  (1999). Although  Taylor (1999)  provides  a  useful policy benchmark,  I  believe  it is not appropriate  to  follow  its prescriptions in the current  circumstances. Importantly  the  persistent  nature  of  the  aggregate  demand  shortfallreflected in the fact that like other forecasters, I have been consistently too optimistic about the pace of recovery  over the  last  few years-suggests that the equilibrium real funds rate is depressed well below  its average historical  level. Indeed, the staff's three-factor yield  curve  model  currently  estimates that the expected  nominal short rate  ten years ahead stands at  3.07%-well below the staff's  4.25% assumed  equilibrium  nominal  rate. Survey  evidence  suggests  that  longer-term  inflation  expectations remain  firmly  anchored  at  2  percent,  and  hence  that  staff  estimate  of  the  far-forward  nominal  short rate implies that the expected real short rate ten years ahead is only 1.0 percent.. Moreover, the one-year  forward  TIPS rate 10 years ahead is  currently  only  0.7 percent-far below  its historical norm of 2.25 percent. In effect, the highly  persistent  weakness  of  aggregate  demand  calls  for  a  downward adjustment in the intercept of the Taylor  (1999) rule. Another reason I  consider it appropriate to hold the funds  rate lower for longer in response  to the constraints  that  the zero bound  have  long  placed on monetary  policy  and  to  the  asymmetric  nature  of  the  risks  facing  the  economy. Such  a strategy is similar  to  that  proposed  by  Reifschneider  and  Williams. With  respect  to  risks,  if  downside  shocks materialize,  the  Committee  has  limited  scope  for  response  due  to  the  zero  lower  bound  whereas  the scope  to tighten policy is ample  in the face of upside  shocks. When  combined  with  my  assessment that  the risks to economic  activity  are  weighted  to  the  downside,  I  see  risk  considerations  as  clearly favoring  accommodation  beyond  that  implicit  in  Taylor  (1999).

Respondent 5: My  lift-off, which I believe  should be  no  earlier than late 2015, is dependent  on improved  communication  regarding  the  purpose  of  an extended  period of a low federal funds rate; without  such  improved  communication,  I  could  anticipate  the  need  to  extend  the  time  of  first  lift  off to no  earlier  than  early  2016.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: My  January  forecast  for  2012  unemployment,  2013  unemployment,  and  2014  unemployment  is very close to being the same  as my  June forecast for those variables. My  January forecast for 2012 PCE  core  inflation, 2013 PCE  core  inflation, and  2014  PCE  core  inflation is very close  to  being  to  the  same  as  my  June  forecast. This  would  argue  in  favor  of  my  June  policy  forecast being  the  same  as  my  January  forecast. I've raised  my  fed  funds  rate  targets  by  (a  conservative)  25 basis  points  to  reflect  my  new  higher  estimate  for  the  long-run  NAIRU.

Respondent 8: Assuming appropriate policy and  my  views  on the  convergence process, my judgment  is  that  the  federal  funds  rate  should  be  increased  in  late  (i.e.,  fourth  quarter)  2013.

Respondent 9: I believe  that  in order  to achieve  an  inflation  rate of 2 percent we would want  to begin  raising  the  federal  funds  rate  by  late  2013.

Respondent 10: Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation.  Economic  growth  will  be  slightly  above  trend  in  the  second  half  of  2012  and  beyond; unemployment  will decline slowly. The  Committee  will find it necessary  to adjust policies  to prevent inflation  from  rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: I have pushed out takeoff by two quarters or so reflecting the slower progress on unemployment  and  inflation  remaining  near  target. I have extended  the  time  near zero slightly to compensate  partially  for  the  time  at  the zero lower bound. I assume  that  the  MEP  is  continued through  end  2012.

Respondent 13: I would  begin  raising  rates  as  soon  as  it  is  clear  that  we  are  making  material  and sustainable progress  on  the  employment side  of  our  mandate,  looking  at participation,  employment  to population  and  other  broader  measures  as  well  as  the  headline  rate. The  precise  timing  will  depend on  the  rate  of improvement  as  well  as  the  absolute  levels.

Respondent 14: Large  and  persistent  output  and  unemployment  gaps  coupled  with  inflation  that is moderately below  our 2 percent objective  call  for  continuing  very  accommodative  monetary policy through  most  of  2014.

Respondent 15: While  unemployment  is  likely  to  remain  elevated,  I  expect  that  it  will  be  appropriate  to begin raising  the  target  for  the  federal  funds rate  in  late  2014  to prevent  inflation  from rising above  levels consistent with price stability. By  2014, the economy  will  have  recovered  enough  that preserving  the  stability of long-term  inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn, inflation will warrant  some tightening  of  monetary  policy. This  view  of the appropriate  path  of  policy  reflects  the  importance  I place on keeping  the underlying  inflation rate close to 2 percent, to preserve our credibility and to maintain  price  stability.

Respondent 16: The  first increase in the federal funds rate is conditioned  on  an unemployment rate  falling below 7 percent  and  underlying inflation below  2.5 percent. In the  modal  outlook, inflation remains  well  contained  and  the  pace  of  economic  growth  picks  up  sufficiently  to  lower  the  unemployment rate below the 7 percent threshold only in  2015. This approach  to setting  the federal funds rate

is consistent  with optimal policy  calculations based on FRB/US that place equal weights on deviations of inflation  from  a  2  percent  target  and  the  unemployment  rate  from  the  natural  rate.

Respondent 17: I expect  the  federal  funds  rate  to  remain  in  the  0  to  25  basis  point  range  at  least until such  time  that  the  rate  of unemployment  falls  under  7  1/2  percent,  accompanying  an  inflation outlook that is projected to be around 2% over the medium  term.

Respondent 18: I begin by noting that under my  assumptions  for output, unemployment,  and inflation,  and  according  to  the  SEP  spreadsheet  calculator,  an  outcome-based  rule  suggests  funds-rate lift-off in 2014,  with  the  funds  rate  reaching  a  level  of  approximately  0.5  at  year-end  2014.

From this point of departure, I have adjusted the year-end 2014 value upward by 100 basis points, to 1.50,  to  reflect  two  factors. First,  the  outcome-based  rule  does  not  incorporate  the  further  stimulative effects of our asset purchases, so to the extent that these holdings are still in place, once  lift-off  occurs, it makes  sense  to  adjust  the  funds  rate  upward,  all  else equal. Second,  my  estimate  of  the  long-run steady-state  NAIRU, at  5.8%, is a  little on the high side, so as unemployment begins to decline toward that  level  it follows  that  one  would  want  to  tighten  a  touch  more  aggressively.

Respondent 19: My policy projection is guided by  the  1993 version of the Taylor Rule,  with some smoothing  and  a  temporary  downward  adjustment  to  the  neutral  real  rate. As I think it desirable to begin  raising  short-term  interest  rates  substantially  earlier  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  I  also think it desirable to begin shrinking the balance sheet earlier than is assumed  in the Tealbook. I remain  skeptical of the impact  on  real economic  activity  of purchases  of Treasury  securities and of changes  to  the  maturity  distribution  of  our  Treasury  portfolio.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the Tealbook?  If  yes,  please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or  if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

Under my appropriate policy assumptions, we purchase  $500 billion of MBS over the next six  months. Furthermore,  I  anticipate  that  the  lift-off  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  the  second  half  of  2015. Accordingly,  actions  to  normalize  the  balance  sheet  would  be  delayed  relative  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 2: No

Because  my  view  of  appropriate  monetary  policy  includes  an  earlier  lift-off  from  zero  for  the  federal funds rate, I would also start the normalization process for the balance sheet earlier than in the Tealbook,  in  line  with  the  exit  strategy  principles  agreed  upon  by  the  FOMC  in  June  2011.

Respondent 3: Yes

With the Tealbook assumption of  lift-off of the  target FFR having  moved to  within one quarter of our assumption,  the  differences  in the timing  of the renormalization  of  the  balance  sheet  (based  on the June  2011  exit strategy principles)  are  little different. However, because  of  the deterioration  in  our central outlook  and  greater  downside  risks, we believe that some  additional  accommodation  should be provided  through  a  further  extension  of  the  duration  of the Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet. To provide  that  accommodation,  we  assume  that  the  MEP  is  continued  through  the  end  of  the  year. In addition, if there are indications of a further deterioration  in the real outlook  or a further increase in the  downside  risks,  we  believe  that  additional  accommodation  through  a  purchase  program  would be warranted. If such  a program  was  instituted,  the  accompanying  communications  should  indicate that purchases would  continue until  conditions point to substantial progress in  meeting  the  maximum employment  objective.

Respondent 4: Yes

To provide additional support to the recovery I assume that the FOMC  continues the Maturity Extension Program through the end of the year.  If I do not see evidence in the  months ahead that the economy  is  making  satisfactory  progress  in  lowering  unemployment  toward  normal  longer-run  levels, I assume  that  further  balance  sheet  actions  will  be  implemented.

Respondent 5: Yes

The  Tealbook  assumes  the  termination  of  the  Maturity  Extension  Program. My  forecast  assumes  an extension  of  this  program  as  providing  further  downward  pressure  on  long  term  interest  rates.

Respondent 6: Yes

I assume  some  additional  moderate  policy  accommodation  through  extension  of  the  MEP

Respondent 7: Yes

I believe that it be optimal to initiate  exit  more rapidly than is  contemplated by the Tealbook. My optimal  path  of  monetary  policy,  given  my  current  forecast,  involves  stopping  re-investment  in  early 2013  and  initiating  asset  sales  in  mid-2014.

Respondent 8: Yes

According  to the  Committee's  exit strategy and  my date of  lift-off, I think the FOMC  should begin reducing the SOMA portfolio  earlier  (e.g.,  early  2014) than in the Tealbook. The pace of the subsequent reduction  likely  exceeds  that  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 9: No

I would  initiate  our  balance  sheet  exit  strategy  sooner  than  is  assumed  in  the  Tealbook,  in  sync  with my  forecast  of  an  earlier  lift-off  in  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 10: No

My  forecast  does  not  incorporate  any  additional  LSAPs  or  MEP.

I anticipate  following  the  Committee's  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path is steeper than  in the Tealbook,  I anticipate  that we would  reduce  the  size of the balance  sheet  more quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 11: Yes

I believe  that  extending  the  MEP  program  as  described  in  Alternative  B  is  appropriate.

Respondent 12: Yes

I assume  the  MEP  is  extended  for  the  remainder  of  2012. Otherwise,  as  consistent  as  possible  with Tealbook  and  broad  exit  principles.

Respondent 13: Yes

I assume  that  the  MEP  will  be  extended  as  proposed  in  Alternative  B.

Respondent 14: Yes

I assume  an  extension of the  maturity  extension program (MEP) through the  end of  2012. In addition, I assume  that  liftoff  of  the  funds  rate  will  occur  in  the  fourth quarter  of  2014,  which  is  a quarter  later than  Tealbook,  and  my  balance  sheet  assumptions  are  adjusted  accordingly.

Respondent 15: No

N/A

Respondent 16: Yes

The  outlook  is  conditioned  on  a  continuation  of  the  maturity  extension  program  through  the  end  of this year, and  on an additional round of securities purchases via a balance sheet expansion  amounting to $500  billion. A  reduction  in  the  size  of  the  Federal  Reserve's  balance  sheet  starts  to  occur  only  at the  time of the  federal funds rate's  lift-off from the  zero lower bound, which  occurs in  late  2015.

Respondent 17: Yes

I have assumed a  continuation of the current  maturity  extension program through the end of the year.

Respondent 18: Yes

I am  assuming  that  we  will implement  an  extension  of the Maturity  Extension  Program  along  the lines sketched  in  Alternative  B  of  the  proposed  draft  statements.

Respondent 19:

No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Accommodative  monetary policy,  improved household  and business balance sheets, and  pent-up  demands  for  capital  goods  and  consumer  durables  should  be  boosting  activity  at  rates above trend. However, even with relatively few financial spillovers, the events in Europe  and the developing  world  portend  weak  demand  from  abroad. In addition, it is difficult to envision a base case scenario  for the U.S.  that  does  not  include  a  step  up  in fiscal restraint  at the turn  of this year. Furthermore,  as  evidenced  by  the  recent  slowdown  in  employment  growth  and  softness  in  spending indicators, household  and  business  sentiment  remains  extremely  fragile, and bad news  continues  to induce  new  waves  of  caution  that  then  impinge  on  spending. And  for  the  foreseeable  future,  we  can only  expect a flow of such  negative news shocks  emanating  from Europe  and the fiscal policy debates in the  United  States.

Summing  these  factors, we are projecting  that the  economy  will only grow  close to 2 percent over the next year. Since this is essentially in line with the (medium-term)  trend rate of growth, the unemployment  rate is projected to remain near  its current level over that period. As we move into the second  half  of  2013,  we  assume  that  the  economy  will  begin  to  gain  some  of  its  long  awaited  cyclical momentum,  and  that  activity  will  gradually  accelerate,  with  growth  reaching  a  3-1/2  percent  rate  in 2014.

Our  inflation  forecast  assumes  that  anchored  inflation  expectations  will  largely  offset  the  influence of declining prices for energy and other commodities and the downward pressure on prices from resource  gaps. On balance,  we  are projecting  a small downtick in  core inflation  over the next year. Owing  to  lower  energy  prices,  overall  inflation  will  run  several  tenths  below  core.

Respondent 2: I continue  to  expect a  moderate  economic recovery  over  the next several years  with a gradual  improvement  in unemployment.  Recovering demand,  improving labor  and housing  markets, and  accommodative monetary policy will support  economic growth over the forecast horizon.  However, financial  headwinds,  high  household  debt  levels,  and  reductions  in  government  spending  will  weigh  on growth. Rising  concerns about the European  sovereign debt  crisis in  conjunction  with indications of a slowdown  in  economic  activity  in  Europe  contributed  to  my  downgraded  outlook  for  growth. The considerable  uncertainty  surrounding  U.S.  fiscal  policy  poses  a  large  risk  to  the  outlook.

Turning to inflation, I  expect that a gradually improving  economy  and  stable inflation expectations will keep core inflation near 2 percent over the forecast horizon. Over  the medium  term,  a  highly accommodative  monetary  policy  and  large  long-run  fiscal imbalances  pose upside risks to inflation expectations  and, hence, inflation. In addition, the current extraordinary  level of monetary policy accommodation raises the possibility of distortions in financial  markets  and the  mispricing of risk that could  eventually  destabilize  the  economy.

Respondent 3: Data released over the intermeeting period  tended to be weaker  than expected, leading  to  a  downgrading  of  our  assessment  of  the  underlying  strength  of  the  US  economy. The  labor report  for May  was particularly disappointing. Also, new  orders  for nondefense  capital goods plunged in March  and  then  fell  further  in  April. Changes  in  a  fairly  broad  range  of  financial  market  indicators and  commodity prices over the intermeeting period have been  consistent  with a  loss of  momentum.

At  this time  we  project  that  real  GDP  will  grow  at  just  a  2%  annual  rate  in  the  second  quarter, near the  estimate  for  2012Q1  and down from  our  mid-May projection of  around  3%. Despite a sharp decline of energy prices that has provided a boost to real disposable income, it appears that real  PCE growth in Q2 will be down slightly from the Q1  rate. Real residential investment is expected to expand in Q2  at a rate  comparable to the Q1 increase. Growth of business investment spending  likely  will be

only  modestly stronger than Q1's relatively dismal  gain. Real government spending is  continuing  to decline in Q2, and the net export growth  contribution is expected to be  zero.

Regarding inflation, the  12-month change in the overall  PCE deflator was  1.8% in April, down from 2.1%  in  March  and  the  recent  high  of  2.9%  in  2011Q3. Based  on  the  May  CPI  data,  we  expect  the  12 month  change  of  the  total  PCE  deflator  to  slow  to  1.5%  in  May,  reflecting  the  drop  in  energy  prices. Further slowing is expected in the  months ahead as year-over-year changes in energy prices turn deeply negative: given  our  energy  price  assumption,  the  12-month  change  of  the  total  PCE  deflator  should be down  to  1.3%  in  August  and  September. It also appears  that  core  inflation  has  peaked,  with  the 12  month  change  of  the  core  PCE  deflator  down  to  1.9%  in  April  from  2.0%  in  March. The  May  CPI data  suggests  a  further  slowing  to  1.8%  for  May.

In  our  forecast  of  December  2011,  we  anticipated  growth  to  slow  in  2012H1  to  around  1 1 2 %  to  2% (annual rate). However, the major driver of that forecast was our assumption that the payroll  tax cut and  emergency  unemployment  benefits  would  not  be  extended  for  2012,  thereby  sharply  depressing consumer spending  over the first half of the year (in this forecast  we  continue to assume a fiscal drag in 2012  of 1 2 percentage point, then rising to a full percentage point in  2013, reflecting assumptions similar to those in the Tealbook). Of course, those two  provisions  were  extended  for  2012, and  the growth of real PCE  and  residential  investment  over  2012H1  appears  to  be  above  our  December  projections. Nonetheless,  real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  still  average  just  2%  over  2012H1.

Two  components  of  final expenditures  are primarily responsible for this relatively weak  performance.  The first is inventory  investment. In part this is due to the  fact that  consumer spending grew faster than  we  anticipated. Thus,  this development  should  not  be  viewed  as  evidence  of  underlying weakness.

More  troubling  and  less  well  understood  is  the  tepid  growth  of  business  fixed  investment  (BFI).  It now looks like the GDP growth  contribution from BFI in  2012H1  will be about half what we expected in December. Moreover,  the  higher  frequency  data  do  not  point  to  a pick-up  in H2. As mentioned above, new  orders  for nondefense  capital goods  are down  and the Architectural  Billings index  fell back below  50  in  April. Thus,  we  have  extended  the  recent  weakness  of  BFI  growth  over  2012H2.

For  2012 we now project growth of real GDP of  2.1% (Q4/Q4), down from  2.7% in April.  This is a relatively  large  change  over  a  period  of  less  than  two  months,  although  much  of  the  decline  is  due to the fact that the April forecast was compiled  when  we  anticipated  growth  in 2012Q1  of around 3%  (annual rate)  whereas  it  is now  estimated  at  1.9%. In addition  to  the downgrading  of projected BFI  growth,  we  have  also  tempered  the  growth  of  real  PCE  over  H2,  reflecting  the  recent  weakness of the  employment  data,  the  downward  revisions  of  labor  compensation  for  2011Q4  and  2012Q1,  and the decline  of equity  values. Export  growth  is  now  expected  to  be  somewhat  slower,  reflecting  both the  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  the  downgrading  of  foreign  growth. With  growth  in  2012H2  around our  estimate  of potential,  we  anticipate  only  a  modest  further  reduction  of  the  unemployment  rate  to 8.0% in  2012Q4. This projection is up from  7.8% in the April SEP  even though we  assume that the labor  force  participation  rate  will  be  0.1  percentage  point  lower  than  in  April  (63.7%  versus  63.8%). Given the steep decline of energy prices that has occurred in  2012, the  total PCE deflator is expected to rise 1 1 %  - 1 1 %  (Q4/Q4)  as  opposed  to  the  2.7%  rise  that  occurred  in  2011. 4 2

We  continue to assume in our  central projection that by  2014 the headwinds slowing  the  economy will diminish and growth  will pick up  substantially above our estimate of potential growth. With

The deterioration of conditioning assumptions over the intermeeting period also resulted in a markdown  of projected  growth  of  real GDP  in  2013,  although by  a  relatively  modest 1 percentage 4 point, to 2.6%  (Q4/Q4)  from  2.9%  in  April. This revision reflects an expected  continuation  of the somewhat  slower growth trajectory for BFI and a somewhat  lower growth contribution from net exports  due  to  lower  foreign  growth  and  a  higher  path  for  the  dollar. With  growth  somewhat  above potential,  the  unemployment  rate  is  likely  to  fall  about 1 percentage  point  to  7.5%  by  2013Q4. With 2 inflation  expectations well  anchored  and  oil prices rising  only very  modestly, the  four-quarter change of the  total  PCE  deflator  rises  to  1 3 %  - 2% in  2013, just below the FOMC's  longer-run objective. 4

long-run  inflation  expectations  well-anchored,  we  also  project  inflation  to  move  towards  the  FOMC's longer run objective by  the  end of  2014.

Our risk and  uncertainty  assessments imply that  our  modal projection  (conditional  on  an  extension of the MEP)  is  both  somewhat  optimistic  and  unlikely  to occur. The  substantial decline in global longer-term  interest  rates-outside  of countries  caught  up  in the euro area crisis-was  a major  factor behind  this  dire  assessment. In particular,  the  risks  of a disorderly  exit  from  the  euro  area  and  high levels of contagion  have  increased  markedly  over  the  inter-meeting  period. Some  of  the uncertainty might  be  resolved  by  the  elections  in  Greece  on  June  17  but  until  European  policymakers  can  agree on  a robust  solution  to  the  imbalances  in  the  euro  area  downside  risks  are  likely  to  predominate.

Respondent 4: Incoming  data  during  the  intermeeting  data  has  caused  me  to  downgrade  my  assessment of the underlying momentum  of  aggregate  demand. In response, I now assume  that the FOMC  will  provide  additional  monetary  policy  accommodation  by  holding  the  funds  rate  at  zero  for about 2 quarters longer than I previously judged appropriate and by  continuing  the MEP rather than allowing it to end, as scheduled, in June. In my  forecast, this additional accommodation  works  to offset the weaker  underlying  pace  of  spending  so  that  the  unemployment  rate  at  the  end  of  2014  is only a few  tenths higher than I forecast in April and inflation, as in April, remains  close to 2 percent. Abnormal seasonal  factors  complicate the interpretation of data pertaining  to spending  and the labor market. It appears  that  unseasonably  warm  weather  pulled  forward  hiring  into  the  first  quarter  and may likewise have pulled forward  spending. Data on both employment growth and  consumer spending in the second  quarter have weakened  significantly, perhaps  partly reflecting payback. That  said, a wide  range  of  data  suggests  that  the  momentum  of  aggregate  demand  has  genuinely  weakened. With respect  to  the  labor  market,  employment  growth  and  GDP  growth  now  appear  to  be  in  more  normal alignment. In other  words,  the  period  of  'catch  up'  in  hiring  appears  to  have  ended. Absent  further policy  actions, I would  envision  growth  near  trend  resulting  in  no  meaningful  progress  in  improving labor  market  conditions  over  the  next  few  years. In addition,  the  global  outlook  has  weakened  significantly  as the situation in Europe appears to be deteriorating. China  also appears to be  experiencing a significant slowdown. These  factors are impinging  on U.S. trade performance  and  are impacting financial conditions. Lower  equity  prices  and  a  strong  dollar  will have  a negative  effect on demand. Lower  oil prices and the reduction  in Treasury  yields reflecting safe haven  flows serve as only very partial positive offsets. In addition, I see the risks to growth  as  asymmetric. The  risks to financial stability from European  developments  have  intensified and the upcoming  'fiscal cliff' continues to pose  a significant downside  risk  to activity. With  respect  to  inflation, upside  risks to inflation have diminished  as  energy prices have  moved down  considerably. With  stable  inflation expectations  and very  modest growth in  compensation, I  expect inflation to remain at or slightly below the FOMC's 2% target,  but  should  downside  economic  risks  materialize,  I  would  think  that  inflation  would  fall  below, possibly well below,  our objective.

Respondent 5: My  outlook  is  shaped  primarily  by  the  uncertainties  of  how  recent  developments, primarily  in  Europe,  comprehensively  contribute  to  a  loss  of  household  and  business  confidence. The developments in Europe are  most profound in this respect, but I continue to see downside risk from the anxiety in Europe  contributing  to the growing pessimism resulting from the modest growth in the US, the  failure of the housing  market to rebound  more quickly, the anxiety  surrounding  the  completion of a refinancing, the presidential  election year,  and the demoralizing  effects of  long-term unemployment. Personal  income  is  flat, which  points  to  less support  for  household  spending  going  forward. Private sector job gains in the past few  months are slow and there is a noticeably softer trajectory of industrial production.

Respondent 6: Far  and  away  the  most  important  factor  shaping  this  forecast  is  the  relative  magnitude  of  the  negative  effects  of  the  Eurozone  sovereign  and  bank  problems. My  forecast  is  premised

on the assumption  that uncertainty and stress continue at high levels through the next two quarters, but that a full-blown systemic  crisis does not develop  in Europe. If this darker  outcome  does come  to pass, my  expectations  for growth  and  unemployment would be substantially  worse,  and  my expectations  for inflation moderately  lower. Conversely, in the less likely but not impossible  event that European  officials take sufficiently bold measures  that there is a general relaxation of market tensions,  I  would  expect  a  smaller  drag  on  both  trade  flows  and  confidence  levels,  and  thus  modestly stronger  numbers  for  growth  and  unemployment. The  U.S.  economy  itself  continues  its  pattern  of  a slow-moving  recovery, though still  slower than in April, While a variety of objective  measures  might suggest  that  a  considerable  part  of  the  damage  from  the  burst  asset  bubbles  and  recession  have  been worked  off, and  thus  a period  of higher-than-trend  growth  could  be  in  the  offing, the persistence  of the European  problems,  along  with uncertainty  associated  with the fiscal  cliff, seem  to have placed  a fairly  low  ceiling  on  growth possibilities  in  the  next  few quarters. The  slowing  from  what  was  already no more  than  a tepid pace, against the backdrop  of the large external and political risks, makes  a recession  more  than  a  small  possibility

Respondent 7: Growth  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  both  demand  and  supply  forces. On  the demand  side,  household  spending  will  continue  to  be  constrained  by  the  significant  loss  of  wealth  and net  worth,  as  documented  in  the  recent  released  summary  of  the  2010  SCF.  On  the  supply  side,  there have been  significant  changes  relative to four to five years ago. Firms  are finding it harder  to find appropriate  workers. Entrepreneurs  lack  resources  to  initiate  startups,  which  robs  the  economy  of  an important source of employment growth.  The high level of  corporate profits suggests that firms enjoy more  market power, which  reduces  labor demand.  Finally, of  course, there is  considerable uncertainty about  future  taxes  and  regulations.

Both  demand  and  supply  push  up  - temporarily  - on  the  unemployment  rate. They  operate  in opposite  directions  on  inflation.

Respondent 8: I continue  to think that convergence  to  steady  state  is progressing. Nonetheless, the  recent  growth  and  inflation  data  have  caused  some  changes  in  my  outlook.

Respondent 9: Output  and payroll growth have been  softer than expected  so  far this year. Over time,  additional  firming  in  the  labor  market  will  be  reflected  in  gradually  improving  personal  income and  consumer  spending. Business  investment  should  continue  to  expand  in  the  second  half,  although perhaps  a  pace  below  that  of  the  last  several  years. Residential  investment  is  growing  at  a  moderate pace that is likely to continue. Federal  defense  spending  has  been  unexpectedly  soft, but oil prices have  fallen  more  rapidly  than  expected.

The  expectation  that  the  federal budget  outlook requires significant  adjustment,  combined  with significant  uncertainty  about  the  nature  of  the  adjustments  that  will  be  adopted,  is  likely  to  dampen growth  for  the  remainder  of  the  year  and  beyond.

Oil price declines have been unexpectedly steep,  and  could reflect Gulf political  strategies  as much as any global growth  slowdown. I expect  oil prices to flatten out in a month  or  two. While  falling energy prices are likely to deflect core inflation for a time, that's likely to prove temporary, and I expect  core  inflation  to  return  close  2  percent  by  the  end  of  the  year.

Respondent 10: Incoming  data  on  economic  activity  have been somewhat weaker than I  expected in my  April  forecast  leading  to  a  slightly  downward  revision  to  my  near-term  economic  outlook. My view is that this weakness  it is tied to uncertainties about Europe  and domestic fiscal policy and is temporarily  leading  to  restrained  business  spending. I expect  that  spending  will  pick  up and  the economy will rebound as uncertainty surrounding the crisis in Europe and domestic fiscal policy diminishes  toward  the  end  of  this  year.

I expect  3 percent  growth  over  the medium  term,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. With  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect the unemployment rate to  move down to about  6.3 percent by  the  end of the  forecast horizon, at which  time  it remains  above  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that headline  inflation  will  be  2  percent  in  2012  and  remain  at  that  level  in  2013  and  2014. Inflation  stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than  that  anticipated in the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening of monetary  policy  that  begins  some  time  toward  the  end  of  2012..

Respondent 11: I used  the  TealBook  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 12: The  moderate  strength  earlier  in the year appears  to have been  due  in part  to temporary  factors,  including  inventory  accumulation,  the  surge  in  auto  sales,  moderation  in  concerns about  Europe,  and  the  burst  of  job  creation,  as  well  as the weather. Recent  slowing  seems  to  be  in part  a return  to  the extended  pattern  of  sluggish  growth  and  hiring,  together  with  worsening  global financial and economic  conditions, notably related to Europe. In part the pattern of sluggishness reflects the absence of usual cyclical drivers,  especially the  lack of a robust housing  recovery,  as well as the weakness  in consumption  as  households  deal with the significant loss in wealth and income triggered by the crisis and recession as well as poor job prospects. Fiscal factors, including state and local, are an additional drag. Household and business confidence have improved but remain relatively  low,  and  there  is  considerable  uncertainty  about  the  strength  and  durability of  the  recovery, conditions  in  Europe,  and  the  US  fiscal  outlook. Other  than  modest  growth,  factors  that  will  put  a small  amount of downward pressure on unemployment include the end of EEB and the secular decline in participation.

Core inflation appears well anchored  and  the upward pressures  on  core from commodity prices are subsiding. Commodity  prices  are  hard  to  forecast  but  appear  likely  to  be  stable  to  down. Wage inflation  and  increases  in  unit  labor  costs  are  consistent  with  low  inflation.

Respondent 13: I see significant slack in the  economy. A substantial part of the declines in output and employment appear  to me to be cyclical,  and  not yet structural. I also believe that our internal headwinds  are  gradually  subsiding,  and  that  the  US.  economy  has  the  capacity  to  grow  at  a  rate  that would  close  the output  gap  within  a  reasonable  period. Since the financial crisis, however,  external shocks  and  headwinds  have  undermined  the  economy's  attempts  to  reach  escape  velocity.

It seems likely that developments in Europe  will restrain growth for the rest of this year, and for that reason  I  accept  the  2012  staff  baseline. For  2013  and  2014,  I  have  assumed  modestly  stronger  growth, faster employment growth and higher inflation than the baseline, based on the hope/assumption that Europe will reach some kind of more stable equilibrium, albeit one that will mean years of austerity. If instead the current turmoil in Europe  continues for a period of years, or worsens, the U.S. economy  could  face  substantial  ongoing  drag  that  would  make  it  difficult  to  meaningfully  raise  levels of employment. The same  could be said of the other much discussed risks, particularly the fiscal  cliff.

Respondent 14: I expect  the  economic  recovery  will  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace  with  real  GDP growth  only a  touch  above potential. Hence, I  expect  output  and  unemployment  gaps  to  close very gradually. Some headwinds are slowly  easing, including those related to banking and  credit  conditions. Housing  prices  look  to  have  stabilized,  which  helps  support  a  recovery  in  home  construction. At  the same  time,  other  headwinds  are  intensifying. For  example,  the  European  crisis  continues  to  weigh  on equity prices and  risk  spreads, the global  economy appears weaker, and U.S. fiscal policy at all levels

is turning increasingly contractionary. Continuing monetary stimulus should support a moderate expansion  over  the  next  few  years. Still, it will take  many  years  of  above-trend  growth  to  return  the economy  to  full  employment. In terms  of  inflation,  a  stronger  dollar,  lower  commodity  prices,  weaker import prices, and  significant slack in labor and goods  markets should keep inflation somewhat below the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation  target  for  the  next  few  years.

Respondent 15: While  the  recent  mixed  news  on  economic  activity  has  led  me  to  modestly  lower my medium-term growth forecast, I  continue to expect the  economy  to recover at a moderate rate from the  second  half  of  2012  through  2014. The  forces  supporting  recovery  include  considerable  monetary stimulus and the economy's  usual self-correcting forces. The  headwinds  holding  back  the recovery include  consumer  de-leveraging,  fiscal  restraint,  and  uncertainty  about  conditions  in  Europe.

In this environment,  I  expect  inflation  to  remain  slightly  below  2  percent  throughout  the  forecast horizon. This projection reflects recent PCE price  trends, stable inflation expectations, and slow growth  in  wages. With  the  job  market  still  weak, there  is unlikely  to be much  pressure  on  inflation coming  from  wages  over  the  next  couple  of  years.

Compared  to  conditions  at  the  time  of  the  April  meeting, the uncertainty  surrounding  forecasts of GDP growth  and  unemployment has risen, primarily reflecting the potential  for a severe  crisis in Europe  and  a  fiscal meltdown  in  the  United  States  next  year. The  surprising  dip  in the unemployment  rate  earlier  this  year,  and  its  uptick  in  May  highlight  the  considerable  uncertainty  surrounding the outlook  for unemployment. Overall, I believe that the uncertainty  surrounding the growth  and unemployment  forecasts  is  elevated  relative  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20  years.

The  risks to economic  activity  now  seem  to  be  primarily  to  the  downside. A severe recession  in Europe  and  the  additional  financial  stress  the  recession  could  cause  would  significantly  slow  growth and  raise  unemployment  in  the  United  States. A  failure of the United  States  to  act  in  a timely  way to avoid  falling  off  a fiscal cliff could  also  significantly  slow  the  economy.

For inflation, uncertainty remains higher than normal and the risks appear tilted toward the downside. There  is the potential  for  the weakness  of  the  economy  to  create  more  disinflation  than  I currently  expect.

Respondent 16: Incoming  data  point  to  a slowdown  in  the  pace  of growth  of economic  activity. Elevated  uncertainty  about  the  outlook  in the Euro  area is already affecting the U.S. economy  via lower equity  valuations and increased risk premia. In such  an environment, firms are  likely to postpone hiring  and  large  capital spending  decisions. Recent readings  on payrolls  and  on shipments  and  orders of capital goods  are  consistent  with  a  slowdown  in  business  spending. The  large  amount  of  slack  in labor markets  is also slowing wage  growth  noticeably. With  little hiring and meager  wage  growth, gains in disposable income have been disappointing and favorable movements  in food and energy prices are providing  only a partial  offset. As a result, near  term  gains  in  consumption  are  expected to be modest,  with  restraint  coming  also  from  the  decline  in  equity  valuations. The  appreciation  of the dollar and  indications  that worldwide  growth  is  now  slower  than  previously  thought  also  signal less support to activity from net exports. Fiscal policy is contractionary already, and is expected to restrain  growth  even  further  next  year. As  important  fiscal  deadlines  near,  a  contentious  process surrounding  the  direction  of  fiscal  policy  is  likely  to  add  to  an  already  uncertain  environment.

Given these  conditions,  economic  activity is expected to grow over the rest of this year  at a pace that is noticeably below potential. As a result, the unemployment  rate  is expected  to edge up by 1 of one percentage  point by the end of the year, to 8.4 percent. In response  to the deteriorating 4 economic conditions, additional monetary  policy actions are undertaken via a continuation of the maturity  extension  program  throughout  the  end  of  this year, and an additional round  of securities purchases  that  expands  the  balance  sheet  by $500 billion. The  increased  monetary  policy  stimulus eventually places the  economy  on a better  trajectory,  with GDP growth  expected to  accelerate next year. Nevertheless,  by  the  end  of  2013  the  unemployment  rate  is  still  above  8  percent,  as  uncertainty

is expected  to dissipate  only  gradually. Economic  activity is projected  to pick  up  more  strongly  in 2014, when fiscal  conditions  also become  more supportive to growth. With  considerable slack in the labor  market,  inflation  remains  below  the  2  percent  target  over  the  course  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Risks to the projection for real  activity  are importantly weighted to the downside. The baseline outlook still assumes that policy steps are taken in Europe to  contain the crisis, but recent developments indicate  that  the  probability  of  additional  financial  stress  from  the  Euro  area  remains  uncomfortably high. A  further  worsening  of  the  Euro  area  crisis  than  is  currently  embedded  in  my  modal  forecast  is a scenario  that  represents  much  more  than  a  tail  risk  at  this  point. Another  important  downside  risk to economic  growth  stems  from  the  possibility  of  more  U.S.  fiscal  tightening  than  is  assumed  in  my baseline  outlook.

Respondent 17: The  economy  continues to work against  relatively strong  currents including household deleveraging and cautious spending, flat home  prices, and fiscal restraint at all levels of government. Elevated uncertainty about Europe, U.S. fiscal concerns, and persistence of recent weak indicators  is damping  the  demand  for  expansion  of  net  new  capital  and  jobs. Slow  jobs  growth  will provide  restraint  to  consumer  spending  over  the  medium  term.

Respondent 18: My  thinking  is dominated by  the enormous uncertainty  currently associated  with the situation  in Europe,  as  well  as with  the  looming  fiscal  cliff in the US.  These  make  it  difficult  to think  in  terms  of  simply  a  modal  outlook. However,  in  attempting  to  do  so,  I  have  made  a  couple  of assumptions.  First, in the relatively near  term, the expected degree of drag created by this uncertainty seems like it is well captured by the Tealbook baseline model, through  e.g. the channels that emphasize the  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar  and  decline  of  the  stock  market.

Second, over a somewhat  longer horizon, I  am projecting  slightly  faster growth than the Tealbook baseline. One reason  is because I  think  that some  of  the  most recent  asset-price  movements driving the  Tealbook  forecast  are  likely  to  be  partially  reversed  over  time,  as  they  reflect  changes  in  discount rates/risk premia due to a flight-to-quality  effect. In the  case of FX  and  net exports for example, this corresponds  to  the  assumption  that  the  medium-horizon  effects  will  be  slightly  muted  relative  to  the Tealbook  case.

Also,  to  the  extent  that  uncertainty  is  reducing  corporate  investment  via  an  option-value  waitingto-invest channel,  this implies  that as uncertainty  is resolved  (and  assuming  the  news  is  on  average neither good  nor bad)  investment  should  grow  faster  than  it otherwise  would, given the backlog  of accumulated projects that were deferred.  The Tealbook baseline did not appear to build in this effect, since it lowered both near-term and  more distant forecasts of  corporate investment  as compared to the April  forecast. Given  this  observation,  I  upped  my  forecast  slightly  relative  to  the  Tealbook  baseline.

Respondent 19: The basic story hasn't changed very  much  over the past several  months. Drags  on growth  from  excess  housing  and  excess  household  debt  continue  to  ease. However,  cuts  in  government purchases, prospective  tax increases,  and regulatory  uncertainty  are  limiting the pace of the  expansion and  are retarding  the impact of  already  accommodative  monetary policy. In addition, downside risks stemming  from  economic  and  financial  problems  in  Europe  have  increased. We've  seen  confirmation of slower growth in the  emerging-market  economies.  In the  U.S., business  confidence is  on the rise, but businesses  remain  inclined  to  hold  higher  levels  of cash  than  normal  both  offshore  and  domestically as a hedge  against fiscal  and  regulatory  uncertainty. Small  and  medium sized business  feel  especially stymied. The  effect  is  to restrain  job  creation  and  domestic  CAPEX.  The  pace  of  the  recovery  is  unlikely to  accelerate until next year, when some of the non-monetary  uncertainties currently restraining growth  will  have  been  resolved.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: The incoming data are adding  up  to a weaker first half of  2012 than in our previous projection. Importantly,  though  we  thought  some  of  the  first-quarter  gains  would  prove  ephemeral, the labor market has  softened  more  than  we  expected. Business  spending  also has been  below  our expectation. The sharp decline  in Treasury rates, increases in high yield debt spreads, and anecdotal reports from our contacts indicate a notable increase in caution on the part of investors and nonfinancial  businesses.

More  importantly,  we  have  made  some  fundamental  reassessments  about  the  risks  facing  the  economy,  and  changed  our  outlook  to  move  those  risks  more  into  balance. First,  we  took  another  look  at our assumptions regarding the political  response to the 'fiscal  cliff,' and built in a greater  degree of restraint than in  our previous projection-reducing  real GDP growth in  2013 by about 1 percentage 2 point from  our April submission. Second, we have  taken a  more pessimistic view about the prospects for Europe. Third,  we  think  the  effects  of  the  flow  of  bad  news  from  these  events  will  have  a  greater depressing effect on business and household  spending  than  in our previous projection. Finally, we made  some  modest  downward  revisions  to  our  estimates  of  potential  output  growth.

The  sharp  decline  in  oil prices point  to lower  PCE  inflation  in  2012  that  in  our  last forecast. In addition  to the lower energy prices, we have nicked down our projection of  core PCE to reflect the somewhat higher degree of slack in  our  current projection.

Respondent 2: Relative to the previous SEP, I  expect a slower pace of recovery  in  2012 and  2013. Recent  data  releases  suggest  that  the  current  pace  of expansion  is slower than  previously  expected. The  heightened  level  of  uncertainty  emanating  from  Europe  combined  with  rising  concerns  about  the fiscal  cliff appear to be holding back  consumers and businesses as they wait to see how these issues are resolved. With a slower pace of  economic  expansion, I  expect  less improvement in the unemployment rate over  the forecast  horizon,  and  I  have  revised  down  my  forecast  for  inflation  (headline  and  core) by  about  a  tenth  of  a  percentage  point.

Respondent 3: Anumber of real  activity indicators released during the intermeeting period indicate that  economic  conditions  were  weaker  than  we  anticipated. Consumer  spending  indicators,  while  on net having  little effect on the current  quarter  forecast, indicate  less momentum  in  coming  quarters. Also,  as in the Tealbook, the downward  revision of  compensation indicates somewhat  less  consumption momentum. In addition, investment  indicators  were  weak, and we have lowered  our business fixed investment  forecast  for  2012-13. The  weak  data  on  government  expenditures  have  led  us  to  lower  our projections  for  those  expenditures  over  the  near  term. Finally,  the  recent  weak  labor  market  reports and  renewed  strains  in  financial  conditions  also suggest  less overall momentum  for  real  growth  over the  next  few  quarters.

Because of the sharp declines in oil and gasoline prices as well as the decreases in headline  measures recently, we have reduced  our projections  for headline inflation over the next  few quarters, particularly over  the  near  term. With  core  inflation  measures  little  changed  in  recent months,  there  is  little  revision to our  core  PCE  inflation  projection.

The  unemployment  rate  in  May  was  somewhat  above  our  anticipation  at  the time of the April meeting and the recent labor market indicators point to noticeably less momentum  in the labor market than at the  time of the April FOMC  meeting. We thus have moved up  our projected path for the unemployment  rate,  although  we  still  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  relatively  quickly  in 2013-14.

In regard  to  our risk  assessment, we see  more downside risks  and  somewhat  less upside risks  to real activity  and inflation than we did in April. These shifts reflect the  escalation of the European  crisis,

slower growth in a number of other  countries,  falling  commodity prices, and indications of greater strain in financial  markets. In particular,  we  have  increased  the  probability  of  financial  market  impairment leading  to  a  global  credit  crunch  and  a  severe  global  recession. As  a  consequence,  our  risk  assessment for inflation  at  medium  term  horizons  has  shifted  from  roughly  balanced  to  a  downside  skew. For  real activity,  the  balance  of  risks  has  shifted  further  to  the  downside.

Respondent 4: Incoming  data-particularly  data  on  consumer  spending  and  income,  foreign  economic growth, and the tightening of financial conditions resulting from lower equity prices and a strong dollar caused me to revise down  my  estimate of GDP  growth  and  to raise my forecast for unemployment. I have  revised  down  my  estimate  of  inflation  due  in  part  to  the  decline  in  oil prices and  also  as  a  result  of somewhat  greater  slack  in  the  economy.

Respondent 5: I have downgraded my assessment of the pace of real GDP growth since the previous SEP. The  most important development has been the significant  uncertainty  surrounding developments in Europe. As of today, the Greek  elections have not been  completed,  central banks are wrestling with a response  if any  to developments  in  Europe,  and  the  UK  has  announced  BOE  intervention. These uncertainties,  and  their  effect  on  business  and  consumer  confidence,  will  continue  at  least  as  long  as the deterioration  in Europe  continues,  which  I  assume  will  be  at least through  the  end  of the year. Given  already  high  uncertainties  in  the  US  from  factors  related  to  the  housing  market,  fiscal  policy, the  election year and long-term unemployment, I believe there will be enhanced effects on expectation channels.

Respondent 6: Europe, plus disappointing  incoming  data  across  many  fronts, though  the latter are  probably  attributable  in  no  small  part  to  the  former

Respondent 7: The shift in the Beveridge curve has proven to be persistent. It has led me to shift my  estimate  of  the  long-run  NAIRU  up. Perhaps  more  importantly,  my  uncertainty  about  the long-run  NAIRU has risen  - I would now say that a  long-run  NAIRU  as high  as 7% is  entirely possible.

Respondent 8: My forecasts have changed  little. Forecasts  for  2012 have changed because of recent information  indicating  slower  growth  and  lower  headline  inflation.

Respondent 9: The  data  on  consumer  spending,  income,  and  employment  have  been  weaker  than I expected, and energy prices have fallen sooner and more rapidly than I expected. Uncertainty regarding  the  resolution of federal fiscal difficulties is having  a greater restraining effect on activity than  I  had  thought.

Respondent 10: I've marked  down  2012  growth  reflecting  the  somewhat  weaker  recent  data,  including  employment  and  income.

Respondent 11: The  TealBook  forecast for housing now  is much  closer to my  own. Significant downgrade  in  expectations  for  the  government  and  external  sectors.

Respondent 12: I had anticipated relatively weak  economic growth and a reassertion of Okun's Law in the  labor  market, which appears to have been  confirmed, but in addition we have seen 1) a range of weaker  data  then  expected  (consumption,  employment,  IP,  household  and  business  surveys)  and  2)  a significant  worsening  of  financial  conditions  related  to  the  situation  in  Europe. These  latter  two  sets of factors have caused  me  to mark  down  expected  growth  and  to  increase  expected  unemployment commensurately.  I  also  lowered  potential  growth  a  tenth. Inflation  forecasts  are  not  much  changed.

Respondent 13: Escalating  financial  stress from  Europe;  strong  evidence  of  slowing  growth  here and  abroad.

Respondent 14: Since April, the  economic data  and  news about the European sovereign debt  crisis have been  disappointing. Although U.S. output growth has been  continuing  at a moderate pace, the economy  appears  to have  lost  momentum. My projection  for  the  global economy has  deteriorated, with conditions  in Europe  looking  notably  worse. There  is considerable  uncertainty  about  how  the European  situation  will  evolve,  with  considerable  risk  that  the  crisis  could  intensify. These  concerns have weighed on financial  markets, where equity prices have slid, risk  spreads (especially for high-yield securities)  have  widened,  and  the  dollar  has  strengthened. With  growth  only  slightly  above  trend,  I expect  even  slower  progress  towards  reducing  the  sizeable  unemployment  gap  than  I  did  in  April.

Data  on  core inflation have been  in  line  with  my  expectations  and I have not  materially changed my  forecast  for  core  inflation. In contrast,  the  sharp  declines  in  oil  and  gasoline  prices  caused  me  to lower  my  forecast  for  overall  inflation  in  2012.

Respondent 15: I have adjusted my forecast primarily in response to the news of the inter-meeting period that has been  mixed, but  generally a  little  weaker than I  expected. I see this news  as bearing primarily on the growth  rate of the first half of this year but having  some  implications  for growth over the medium  term. Coupled  with  the  recent inflation data that have come  in somewhat  softer than I  expected, the modestly weaker pace of recovery  is likely to be associated  with slower growth of wage  costs  and  a  path  of  inflation  that  is  a  little  lower  than  my  April  projection. Overall,  with  these revisions,  my  current  forecast  is  quite  similar  to  my  forecast  at  the  time  of  the  January  meeting.

Respondent 16: The worsening of the  crisis in the Euro  area  and the  associated financial spillovers to the U.S. economy  are  the main  reasons for the downward  revision  to the real outlook since the April  projections. Given  the  weaker  outlook  for  GDP  growth,  the  outlook  for  inflation  has  also  been revised  down.

Respondent 17: My  forecast  has  incorporated  weaker-than-expected  second  quarter  growth  numbers and  a more  significant  drop  in gasoline prices that has temporarily  pulled  inflation  downward. Global growth appears  to be slowing  more quickly than  I  anticipated  and I have  marked my  U.S. growth  estimates  downward  over  the  balance  of  2012  and  the  first  half  of  2013  as  a  result.

Respondent 18: The  single  most  important  factor  is  the  apparent  deterioration  of  the  situation  in Europe. The  recent  weak  labor-market  reports  have  also  played  a  role.

Respondent 19: I've made a modest downward  revision to my 2012 GDP growth forecast  reflecting recent  marginally disappointing data releases, increased evidence of fiscal authorities' inability to  act in a way  that  encourages  job-creating  activity,  and  increased  concerns  about  euro-area  financial  stability and the  outlook  for real  activity  overseas. The weaker growth  outlook abroad has put  some downward pressure  on  oil and  other  commodity  prices. Accordingly,  I  have  lowered  my  2012  headline  inflation forecast.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: As  noted  in question  3,  we  assume  more  accommodative  monetary policy  than  the Tealbook. As a result of this, and a touch higher  assumption  for potential  output  growth, we are projecting  a larger pickup  in GDP  in  2014  than  in  the Tealbook. The  more  accommodative policy also  contributes  to  our  slightly  higher  projection  for  inflation.

Respondent 2: Myforecast is now quite different from Tealbook in  2013 and 2014. I expect stronger growth,  lower  unemployment,  and  higher  inflation  than  are  contained  in  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 3: As  stated  in  our  response  to  question  3(e),  we  assume  that  the  MEP  is  continued through  the  end  of the year. Because  of  the greater  duration  in  the balance  sheet  over  the  forecast horizon,  we  assume  that  term  premia  rise  to  normal  levels  more  slowly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Over  2012H2 and 2013, the Tealbook assumes a weaker foreign growth outlook and somewhat  more dollar appreciation than in our projection. Consequently, net exports is a drag to GDP growth in the Tealbook  forecast  while  it is a modestly  positive  contributor  in  our  central  projection. In addition, the Tealbook  sees  a  somewhat  greater  reluctance  of  firms  to  engage  in  fixed  investment,  resulting  in a lower path  for business  fixed  investment  than  in  our projection.

We  see  some  of  the  headwinds  restraining  economic  growth  subsiding  more  quickly  in  2014  than in the Tealbook. Thus  we  expect  the  output  gap  to  begin  to  close  more  quickly  that  year, and  our 2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast  is  above  that  of  the  Tealbook.

We see a stronger influence of  anchored inflation  expectations  on inflation dynamics than does the Tealbook. Consequently,  our  inflation forecast and the Tealbook  forecast are similar for 2012, but beyond  that  we see total and core inflation remaining  near  2%  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  inflation declining  in  2013  and  remaining  near  the  2013  level  in  2014.

We  expect a somewhat greater decline in the unemployment  rate than is projected in the Tealbook. The source of this difference is a different interpretation of labor market dynamics as expansions mature;  that  is,  we  do  not  place  as  much  weight  on  Okun's  Law  as  the  Board  staff  do.

Although  both  the  Tealbook  and  our  outlook  now  see  a  downside  balance  of  risks  to  real  growth, we  differ  in the  assessment  of  inflation  risks  and  uncertainty. The  Tealbook  sees  the  inflation  risks  as broadly balanced  with  uncertainty  at a near  normal level, reflecting the stability of inflation  expectations  in recent  years. In contrast,  we  see a downside  balance  of  risks  to  inflation  at medium-term horizons and high uncertainty around our projections. This assessment reflects our view that the recent economic  and  financial  developments  point  to  a higher risk of a global credit crunch  and/or severe  recession  that  could  lead  to  a  substantial  decline  in  inflation.

Respondent 4: Aside from the difference in my  monetary policy  assumption from Tealbook, there are  no  meaningful  differences  in  my  assessment  of  current  economic  trends.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6: A bit uncharacteristically, I'm rather close to the staff projections. Perhaps  my relative pessimism has been  infectious.

Respondent 7: I expect  unemployment  to  be  lower  at  the  end  of  2014  and  inflation  to  be  higher.

Respondent 8: For  2012  and  2013  I  anticipate  relatively  faster  GDP  growth. For  2013  and  2014  I anticipate  relatively  lower  unemployment  and  relatively  higher  inflation.

Respondent 9: My forecasts for real GDP  and the unemployment  are fairly  close to the Tealbook's over  the  near  term,  but  are  somewhat  than  the  Tealbook's  farther  out. My  inflation  forecast  is  higher since my  energy price  forecast is a  touch higher in the second half of this year,  and  also because I put less weight  on  slack  as  a  determinant  of  inflation.

Respondent 10: My  forecast calls for a stronger economy  over the next two years and tighter monetary  policy  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: I am  a bit more  pessimistic on growth  and unemployment  than  the  Tealbook, given that we have now seen a pattern of near-trend growth for three years without acceleration. There  are few obvious  drivers for acceleration. The  drags  on growth  have  changed  (fiscal  has gone from positive  to negative;  Europe has  emerged  as a problem  even  as domestic banking  conditions have improved; housing has become  a  minor positive) but overall the headwinds to recovery  are probably no  less strong  today  then  they  were  a  couple  of  years  ago. Resolution  of  Europe  could  support  some pickup  in growth, but the  timing  of such  a resolution is difficult to predict and  could be some  time in the future. All that said, there  are not large differences  between  the  broad  contours  of  this  forecast and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 13: I generally agree with the Tealbook  baseline  narrative  and  forecast for 2012. I assume  moderately  faster  growth  in  2013  and  2014,  which  produces  faster  declines  in  unemployment. This depends on real progress in Europe as well as the absence of additional shocks.  I have  also  forecast slightly higher inflation for  2013  and  2014, due to higher growth and a belief that expectations are well  grounded  at  around  2..

Respondent 14: My forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection,  with the  main difference being  that  I  expect  inflation  to  run  a  few  tenths  higher  than  in  the  TB  in  2013  and  2014.

Respondent 15: I do  not  see  the  latest  employment  report  signaling  a  significant  downshift  in  the labor  market's  already  slow  trajectory. Further, despite  the substantial  uncertainty  surrounding  the situation  in Europe  and  the  fiscal  discord  in  the  US,  I  don't  see  these  events  weighing  as  heavily  on my baseline forecast. As such, my  second half of  2012 and  my  2013 growth forecasts are a  little over 1 2 percentage point above the TB projection.  These differences  leave my  unemployment rate projection 0.4 percentage  points  below  TB's  by  end  of  2014.

Respondent 16: The  near-term  outlook is weaker  than in the Tealbook. This more  pessimistic assessment  of  underlying  economic  conditions  prompts  a  more  accommodative  stance  of  policy  than what  is embedded  in  the  Tealbook. Ultimately,  the  economy  benefits  from  this  additional  stimulus and  growth  in  the  medium  term  is  somewhat  faster  than  in  the  Tealbook. By  the  end  of  2014,  there is little difference in the projected  level of the unemployment rate between  the two  forecasts.

Respondent 17: The  broad  contours  of the Tealbook  outlook  are similar to my  own. However, the magnitude  of  my  forecast  markdown  is  smaller  than  what  has  been  incorporated  into  the  June Tealbook, and I anticipate a faster, though  still gradual, recovery in domestic spending  and labor markets. I also project  inflation  to follow a path  closer  to  our  longer-term  inflation  objective owing

to a  more moderate drop in oil prices and  a strong  adherence of price growth to longer-term inflation expectations.

Respondent 18: The  differences  are  modest. My  forecasts  for  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  in 2013  and  2014  are  slightly  more  optimistic  than  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 19: I see a somewhat  faster pace of recovery than is  called  for in the Tealbook baseline forecast, and  a higher inflation path. These  differences  imply  there is less need  for accommodative monetary  policy.
