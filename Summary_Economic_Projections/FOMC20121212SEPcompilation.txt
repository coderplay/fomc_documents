Table 1. Economic projections of Federal Reserve Board members and Federal Reserve Bank presidents, December 2012

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change in real gross domestic product (GDP) and projections for both measures of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in, respectively, the price index for personal consumption expenditures (PCE) and the price index for PCE excluding food and energy. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. Longer-run projections represent each participant's assessment of the rate to which each variable would be expected to converge under appropriate monetary policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy. The September projections were made in conjunction with the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee on September 12-13, 2012.

- 1. The central tendency excludes the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.
- 2. The range for a variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in that year.
- 3. Longer-run projections for core PCE inflation are not collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: Our current estimate of the  economy's potential growth rate is in the 2% to 2 1 2 / % range. By  2017-18  we  anticipate a potential growth rate of  around 2 1 4 / %. A  reasonable  estimate  of the  long-run unemployment rate is 4% to  6%. Assuming appropriate policy and  no further significant shocks,  we  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  in  this  range  and  the  output  gap  to  be  around  zero  by 2017-18;  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  (1980s  and  1990s)  suggests  the  unemployment  rate  could be  somewhat  below  5%  in  5-6  years  time.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  around  2.5%  on a CPI basis and that the FOMC's inflation objective  will remain at 2% for the PCE deflator (equivalent to about  2.5%  for  the  CPI).  Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  be  near zero,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured  by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  close  to  2%  in  2017-18.

Respondent 2: Under  appropriate  policy,  the  convergence  would  be  faster  than  five  years.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: Quantitative  judgment  based  on the width of the probability intervals from the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for  GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation  relative  to  the  forecast  errors over  the  last 20 years. These  measures  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution  have  not  changed  significantly  from  the  September  SEP.  These  measures  also  reflect  our  view  of  the  appropriate  monetary policy stance providing  insurance  against  realizations of some  of the downside  risks; otherwise, the uncertainty  would  be  even  higher.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: High  level  of uncertainty  around  the  legislative  resolution  of  pending  fiscal  issues. This political contingency  carries a greater range of plausible outcomes,  with  substantially  varying effects  on  the  economy,  than  is  usually  the  case  with  purely  economic  uncertainties.

Respondent 4: I have  changed  my  judgment  of  the  level  of  uncertainty  attached  to  my  inflation projections  from  'broadly  similar'  to  'higher'. My  level of uncertainty  is a reflection of what  could constitute  different  inflation  dynamics  resulting  from  the  longer  period  of  monetary  accommodation and  a growing  central bank balance sheet. While I do not  concede that such inflation dynamics should in any  way be different  in  the  current policy  environment,  the  manner  in  which  the FOMC  and  future FOMC's  communicate the inflation potential  or  lack of potential  could have a bearing in how  markets, businesses  and  households  will  continue  to  react  to  shocks  that  might  otherwise  represent  transitory price  increases.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7:

N/A

Respondent 8: Several  factors  contribute to heightened uncertainty, including  the European  debt crisis, U.S. fiscal policy (fiscal cliff, debt ceiling, longer-term), slowing world growth, and ongoing changes in the regulatory  environment. In addition, the Federal  Reserve's unconventional policies  are a source  of uncertainty  because  they have no precedent.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Uncertainties  associated  with  real  economic  activity  and  employment  include  US fiscal policy (fiscal cliff/debt limit), developments  in Europe, Iran/oil, EME  growth, and our lack of experience  with recoveries from financial crises in developed  economies  and  with  unconventional monetary policies. Core  inflation is well anchored by  stable  inflation expectations, and commodity price fluctuations do not seem exceptionally unusual  lately or prospectively (except possibly for Middle East  developments  that  could  affect  oil  prices),  so  uncertainty  about  inflation  is  in  the  normal  range, possibly  even  slightly  lower.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: Continuing fiscal and  regulatory  uncertainty make  forecasting how slack  and GDP growth  will  evolve  next  year  almost  pure  guesswork.

Respondent 13: I believe the uncertainty  surrounding  my forecasts of GDP growth  and  unemployment  remain  elevated  relative  to  the  norms  of  the  last  20  years, primarily  reflecting  the  recession  in Europe  and  the  fiscal  problems  facing  the  United  States  next  year.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15:

N/A

Respondent 16: Uncertainty  about  my  projections  for  economic  activity  is  elevated  relative  to  its average  over  the  past  20  years. Factors  influencing  this  assessment  include:

- (i) The'new normal'for  macroeconomic relationships going forward  remains unclear.  For example, there is greater  uncertainty  than usual about the  level  and growth rate of potential  output.
- (ii) The  political  resolution  of  the  fiscal cliff remains  unclear. The  risk  remains  that  fiscal  policy could become  abruptly  more  contractionary  in January  2013.
- (iii) Europe  remains  in  a  recession  that  is  weighing  on  global  growth. Although  the  situation  looks a bit better  than  earlier in the year, the resolution of their financial  and  economic  crises remains  far off, and  concerns could easily flare up again. Other key  countries have also slowed this year and  could weigh  further  on  global  growth.
- (iv) In the event of adverse shocks, there is  limited ability for  monetary  and fiscal policy to dampen the  effects. This  limited  scope  for  countercyclical  policy  implies  greater  variance  in  outcomes.
- (v) Of course, there are upside risks to the outlook as well. For example, consumer  sentiment has been  improving. The housing  market  could  continue  to  improve  even  faster  than I  expect,  which could potentially encourage a virtuous cycle of improving confidence, fundamentals, and financial conditions. Finally, a favorable  outcome  in  fiscal  cliff negotiations  and  further  progress  on  resolving Europe's  crises  could  help  lift  the  cloud  of  uncertainty  over  the  economy.

In contrast  to  economic  activity,  underlying  inflation  is  anchored  by  quite  stable  inflation  expectations. The stability of these  expectations has been  reinforced by the specific 2 percent numerical objective  for inflation. Hence, uncertainty  about inflation is lower than in the past two decades.

Respondent 17: The outlook for the federal budget and next year's fiscal drag are especially uncertain. Inflation  expectations  are probably  more  firmly  anchored  following  the FOMC's  consensus statement;  under  appropriate  policy,  uncertainty  should  decline  further.

Respondent 18: Uncertainty  about  domestic  fiscal policy and the possibility that the European debt crisis is not resolved in an orderly fashion continue to pose risks for the forecast. It remains the case that  the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place  and  uncertainties  surrounding the future  path  of policy, including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  difference  between  the  central  projection and the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance,  the risks to the inflation outlook remain roughly balanced.  The balance of risks to the real  activity  outlook remain  to  the  downside. The  balance  of  risks  for  inflation  and  real  activity  reflects  our  view  that  the appropriate  monetary  policy  stance  in  the  current  environment  provides  insurance  against  tail  risks; otherwise,  the  balance  of  risks  for  both  variables  would  be  shifted  further  to  the  downside.

Respondent 2:

N/A

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: Our  forecast  assumes that  markets  and the public view the Federal  Reserve's statements  regarding  the  conditions  for ending  the security purchase  program  and  for  lifting the federal funds rates  as highly  credible policy  commitments. There  is a risk, however,  that some  market participants  doubt  our  resolve,  or  that  future  Committees  may  fail  to  carry  through  with  the  commitment. Either  condition would result in both output and inflation running  below our projection. In addition, we assume that budget  actions to avoid the full fiscal  cliff  will produce only a moderate drag on growth and  that  the  resolution  will  unlock  some  of  the  private-sector  spending  currently  being  curtailed  due to uncertainty  over the cliff. While  it is possible that a fiscal-cliff resolution will strengthen  aggregate  demand,  it  is  easier  to envision  less  favorable  outcomes  that  either  produce  a  more  pronounced near-term  drag  or  fail  to  resolve  uncertainty  over  future  tax  and  spending  policy.

Respondent 6: N/A

Respondent 7: Risks  to  economic  activity  are  skewed  to  the  downside,  as  the  federal  budget  situation  and  financial  uncertainties  in  Europe  could  impose  more  restraint  on  demand,  especially  in  the near  term.

Respondent 8: The  risks to inflation are skewed  to  the  upside  due  to the highly  accommodative stance  of  monetary  policy  and  fiscal  imbalances.

Respondent 9: N/A

Respondent 10: Factors cited above regarding uncertainty are mostly downside  risks, including US  fiscal, Europe, Iran/oil, and possible structural damage  remaining  from  the  financial crisis. In addition,  there  is  the  asymmetric  downside  risk  created  by  slow  growth  and  a  binding  ZLB.  However, these  risks  seem  on  the  whole  to  have  moderated  somewhat  since  the  last  SEP,  except  that  US  fiscal risks  remain  significant. Indeed,  unexpected  strength  in  housing,  improving  household  sentiment,  and the possibility that US fiscal issues or the European  situation may  be less bad than expected are mild upside risks to real  activity. Upside risk  to inflation  comes  primarily from  commodity prices and possibly  underestimation  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment,  but  there  are  also  downside  risks  from

persistent  weakness  in  labor  and  product  markets,  as  illustrated  by  relatively  low  recent  readings  on wage  and  price  inflation.

Respondent 11:

N/A

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: I believe the risks are weighted  primarily  to  the  downside  for  GDP  growth  and to the upside for unemployment. In the medium  term, the potential for a severe crisis in Europe and  a fiscal meltdown  in  the  United  States  pose  large  downside  risks  to  growth  and  upside  risks  to unemployment. I judge the overall risks to inflation to be balanced, with a downside risk that a slowing of the  economy  could pull down inflation  and  an upside risk that  our  large balance sheet  could eventually  cause  inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn,  inflation  to  rise.

Respondent 14: I consider  the  risks  to  the  outlook  for  growth  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside  due to the  continuing  potential  for  European  developments  to  threaten  financial  stability  and  also  due  to the potential  adverse  consequences  for  economic  growth  of  a  failure  by  Congress  to  successfully  deal with  the  impending fiscal  cliff. The  risks  to  unemployment  are  weighted  to  the  upside. Downside  risks to growth  translate  into  downside  risks  to  inflation. Moreover,  while  there  is  ample  scope  to  tighten monetary  policy  should  upside  inflation  risks  materialize,  the  scope  for  policy  to  offset  disinflation  is quite  limited.

Respondent 15: For  2013,  I  see  downside  risk  to  growth  and  inflation.

Respondent 16: Risks  to  growth  are  skewed  to  the  downside  and,  consequently,  to  the  upside  for unemployment. Key downside risks to the outlook are the looming  U.S. fiscal  cliff as well as Europe's recession and  still-unresolved crises. In addition, negative shocks  could have particularly severe effects, because  of  the  continuing vulnerability of  the  financial  system  as  well  as  the  limited  ability of  fiscal  and monetary  policy  to  respond  to  offset  them. Inflation  risks,  in  contrast,  are  more  typically  balanced.

Respondent 17: In the near term, there is a non-negligible likelihood of a lengthy stalemate in federal budget negotiations. Beyond that,  other impediments to growth may be serious and persistent enough  to  pull  GDP  growth  below  the  path  given  above.

Respondent 18: I view the risks to inflation as weighted to the upside over the medium  and longer  run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced. There remains  uncertainty  about  the  effect  of  the  fiscal  cliff  in  the  near  term,  but  as  that  uncertainty abates, we  could  see  a  rebound  in  investment  spending.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. You  may  include  other comments  on appropriate  monetary policy  here  as well.

Respondent 1: The  crucial factors behind  our assessment  of the appropriate  path  for monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance  of  risks  around  the  central  outlook. While  there  has  been  somewhat  more  noise  around  them (in part because  of  the  effects  associated  with Superstorm Sandy),  indicators  of  economic  conditions generally  have  indicated  that  the  expansion  remains  tenuous. Financial  conditions  are  still strained and  the  improvement  that  has  occurred  since  mid-year  is  susceptible  to  sharp  reversals  if  government policy  actions  (both  here  and  abroad)  do  not  meet  expectations. In these  circumstances,  we  still  see appropriate  monetary  policy  as  'doing  whatever  it  takes'  to  strengthen  the  economy  and  establish  a truly  self-sustaining  recovery;  under  such  a  policy,  it  will  be  the  economic  outcomes  that  will  dictate the path of the policy stance. Under  our  modal  outlook, we  anticipate that the  target FFR will remain near  zero  until  mid-2015. We  expect  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  remain  anchored  over this period. The  pace  of renormalization  of  the  target  FFR  following  the  period  of  near  zero  policy rates  will then depend  upon our assessment of  economic  conditions, longer-term inflation expectations, and  overall  financial  conditions.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. In normal  times,  we  assume  that  this  rate  is  in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium  rate as 3.0 -5.0%. Given  the recent behavior  of nominal  and  real Treasury  yields and productivity  growth,  we  currently  see  this  rate  over  the  longer  run  as  more  likely  to  be  in  the  lower half  of the  indicated  range,  which  results  in  the point  estimate  given  in  the  response  to question  3(a). Moreover, given the still-weak state of the  economy and  our expectations of  continued strained financial conditions,  our  assessment  of  the  current 'neutral' FFR  is below  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run FFR and  is expected  to  remain  so  for  some  time.

As  discussed  in  our  answer  to  question  3(e),  our  policy  path  is  predicated  on  the  assumption  that after the completion  of  the  Maturity  Extension  Program  (MEP)  at  the  end  of  the  year,  the  FOMC will begin a flow-based, open-ended purchase program of  long-term Treasury  securities to supplement the  current  agency  MBS  purchase  program.

Respondent 2: Many (most?)  of us have been  comfortable  with  our price stability performance  even when  the  medium-term  inflation  outlook  is  as  much  as  20  or  30  basis  points  below  2%. Presumably, we  would  be  just  as  comfortable  with  our  performance  if  the  medium-term  outlook  for  inflation  is  as much  as 20 or 30 basis points above  2%. With that in  mind, I don't see any  reason to begin removing accommodation until the  medium-term  outlook  for inflation rises above  2.25%. I don't see the  outlook for inflation  as  being  that  high  until  the  latter  half  of  2016. Such  an  (appropriately)  accommodative policy  will produce a faster decline in the unemployment rate  - it  will  fall to  5.5% by  the end of  2016.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: The key  factors informing  my judgment  regarding  a slow  lift-off of the  federal funds rate in 2015 include review  of a set of economic  indicators  that  together  do not yet suggest that a 'virtuous  cycle'  is firmly underway  that  would  justify  an  early  monetary  policy  contraction. While firms are hiring, they seem to be doing so tentatively, and their level of confidence in a stronger

economy  remains  low. For their part, households  are enjoying more  wealth effects, but confidence has dropped  and  real  disposable  incomes  remain  flat. Government  spending  is  uncertain,  but  fiscal impetus  will  likely  not be substantial  enough  to  provide  necessary  stimulus. Investment  spending  is poor and net exports are not showing  through  as  significant. Accordingly, my  view  of appropriate monetary  policy  is  that  it  must  remain  accommodative  as  long  as  it  can  continue  to  deliver  growthsupporting  benefits that exceed any costs in terms of price stability, financial stability and market functioning.

Respondent 5: Our  appropriate path  for  monetary policy  includes  an  explicit  numerical  threshold commitment  to  maintain  the  funds  rate  at  its  current  level  at  least  as  long  as  the  unemployment  rate remains above  6-1/2 percent  and the  outlook  for inflation over the next two years remains under  2-1/2 percent. We  feel  these  markers  would  be  achieved  some  time  after  the  economic  recovery  strengthens and  there  has  been  a  substantial  improvement  in  labor  markets.

Under  appropriate policy,  reaching  such  thresholds  would  not  automatically  trigger  an  increase  in the  funds  rate. For  example,  policy  could  remain  on  hold  if  the  outlook  for  inflation  fell  well  short  of our  2 percent  target  upon  reaching  the  6-1/2  percent  unemployment  mark.

With  regard  to  our  balance  sheet,  we  assume  that  the  'substantial  improvement  in  labor  market conditions' condition for ending  the open-ended asset purchase program would be  met when gains in payroll  employment  averaged  at  least  200,000  per  month  for  a  period  of  about  6  months,  with  these gains  accompanied  by  GDP  growth  in  excess  of  potential  and  sustained  downward  momentum  in  the unemployment  rate. Under  our  projection,  this  occurs  at  the  end  of  2013.

Respondent 6: Assuming appropriate policy and  my  views  on the  convergence process, my judgment  is  that  the  lift-off  of the  federal  funds  rate  should  occur  in Q2/2014.

Respondent 7: Liftoff  from  the  zero-lower-bound  occurs  around mid-2015,  when  the  unemployment rate  is expected  to  fall  below  6.5  percent  and  the  economy  continues  to  grow  above  potential.

Respondent 8: Key  factors informing  my  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  monetary policy  are  achieving  an  inflation  objective  of 2 percent  and  ensuring  a sustainable  economy  recovery that  reduces  unemployment.  To  maintain  the  stability  of  long-run  inflation  expectations  and  financial stability,  I anticipate  it  will  be  necessary  to  begin  the  process  of  normalizing  the  federal  funds  rate  in late 2013.

Respondent 9: I expect  the  federal  funds rate  to remain  in  the 0  to  25 basis point range  at  least  as long  as  the  unemployment  rate  exceeds  6 1 2 / percent, providing  that  inflation  is projected  to be  close to the Committee's  2 percent  objective  in  the  medium  term  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations continue  to  be  anchored.

Respondent 10: Projected path  consistent  with thresholds guidance  and optimal  control simulations. I assume  asset  purchases  continue  into  the  second  half  of  2013.

Respondent 11: Unemployment  reaches  6.5%  in  mid-2015  and  lift-off  begins. The  fed  funds  target at the end of 2015 is consistent with the outcome  based rule and with the inertial Taylor rule in Tealbook  Book  B. I have assumed  increases in the fed funds target of .25% at each meeting once lift-off begins.

Respondent 12: 'Appropriate policy'cannot be captured by  a  time-path for the federal funds rate. An  important  part  of  'appropriate  policy'  is  communicating  a  long-run  strategy  for  monetary  policy that does a better job of resisting  imbalances  and  excesses than did past strategy,  and which is not so dependent  for  its  success  on  large  downward  movements  in  short-term  interest  rates. The  formulation and  communication  of  such  a  strategy  would  strengthen  the  recovery  more  reliably  than  either  our current  form  of  forward  guidance  or  another  LSAP  program,  allowing  us  to  move  away  from  the  zero bound  more  quickly.

For purposes  of  this exercise, I considered  the  implications  of  a  variety  of policy rules, including the 1993  version  of the Taylor  rule with  a temporary  downward  adjustment  to  the  equilibrium  real interest  rate,  the  1999  Taylor  rule  with  inertia,  and  a  targeting  rule  for  nominal  GDP.

Respondent 13: I expect  that,  in  the  second  half  of  2015,  the  economy  will  have  recovered  enough that preserving  the  stability  of  long-term  inflation  expectations  and,  in  turn,  future  inflation  will  warrant beginning  to take steps to gradually reduce  monetary  stimulus. More specifically, my  view of the appropriate path of policy reflects my judgment that,  with a 6 percent  long-run rate of unemployment, it will be necessary  to begin raising  the  federal funds rate when the unemployment rate hits 7 percent in order  to  keep  future  inflation  close  to  the  long-run  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 14: My assessment  of  economic  conditions  accords  closely  with Tealbook. However,  an appropriate  monetary  policy,  in  my  view,  would  entail  a  larger  volume  of  asset  purchases  and  a  more gradual  increase  in  the  federal  funds  rate  after  tightening  commences  than  along  the  Tealbook  path. Similar  to Tealbook, I  would hold  the  fed  funds rate  at  its  current  low  level until  the  fourth quarter  of 2015,  although the unemployment  rate, at the  time I  assume first tightening is about  6.25%-somewhat lower  than  in  Tealbook. Finally,  I have  assumed  that  the  longer-run  normal  level  of  the  funds  rate  is notably  below  its  historical  average,  consistent  with  staff  estimates  that  the  expected  nominal  short rate  ten years ahead is now  3.07%-well below the staff's  assumed  4.25% equilibrium nominal rate.

Respondent 15: My  expectations are  close to those in the 'weaker demand' scenario, which  calls for  liftoff in Q4 '15 under both the outcome based rule and the inertial Taylor '99 rule. In my  forecast unemployment  will be  6.5% at Q4 '15, which  would also be  consistent  with  liftoff  under the proposed thresholds.

Respondent 16: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  are  large  and  persistent,  and  inflation  remains moderately below  our 2 percent  objective. This situation calls for very accommodative  monetary policy. Even  with  continuing  LSAPs,  appropriate  policy  calls  for  delaying  liftoff  from  the  zero-lowerbound  until the second half of 2015, when  the unemployment  rate  falls below 6-1/2 percent. My judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust  for  the  zero-lowerbound  and  for  the  effects  of unconventional policy;  and  it  is  informed by  my  assessment  of risks  to  the economy  (which  are  large  and  skewed  to  the  downside). In addition,  it  is  informed  by  my  assessment of the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Respondent 17: I believe  that  in  order  to  achieve  an  inflation  rate  of  2  percent  we  would  want  to begin  raising  the  federal  funds  rate  in  the  first  half  of  2014.

Respondent 18: Inflation and inflation expectations will be the main drivers of the removal of accommodation. Economic  growth  will  be  slightly  above  trend  in  2013  and  beyond; unemployment will decline slowly. The  Committee  will find it necessary  to adjust policies  to prevent inflation from rising  above  its  target.

Respondent 19: I am  assuming  the  FOMC  decides  to  adopt  a  thresholds  approach,  with  values  of 6.5%  for unemployment  and  2.5%  for inflation. My funds rate path is  consistent  with this  assumption. In particular,  I  have  unemployment  dropping  below  6.5%  in  mid  2015,  and  hence  the  funds  rate  lifts off before  the  end  of  2015.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

As  noted  above,  in  part  to  reinforce  the  forward  guidance  on  the  target  FFR,  we  assume  that,  after the completion  of the MEP  at  the  end  of the year, the FOMC  institutes  a  flow-based, open-ended purchase program of long-term Treasuries  with an initial pace of purchases set at about $45 billion per month. Consequently,  the  pace  of  total  purchases  of  long-term  securities  would  be  about  $85  billion per month,  similar  to the purchase  pace  of these securities under  the MEP  and  the  MBS  purchase program. In addition,  we  assume  that  the  FOMC  statement  and  other  communications  will  continue to signal that purchases  will  continue  at  least  until the FOMC  observes  substantial  improvement  in the outlook  for  the labor  market,  provided  that  the  medium-term  inflation  outlook  and  longer-term inflation expectations remain  consistent  with the FOMC's longer-run objective.  Based on our outlook, we currently expect that these purchases  will last about  one year and  total about $1 trillion, which is a longer duration program  with a larger ultimate size than that assumed in the Tealbook.  However, that total can  easily change depending  upon the progress toward the FOMC objectives-it is the progress toward objectives that is important in  our  assumed policy stance rather than a particular size of the balance  sheet. In our overall strategy for appropriate  monetary  policy, we believe that a collective emphasis of an  accommodative stance based on a portfolio of tools would enhance the  efficacy of policy in these  circumstances.

Respondent 2:

No

N/A

Respondent 3: Yes

I assume  approximately  $250  billion  more  in  asset  purchases  than  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 4: No

N/A

Respondent 5: Yes

As noted above, we assume the open-ended LSAP program  continues at an $85 billion per  month pace through  the  end  of  2013,  2  quarters  longer  than  the  Tealbook  assumption.

Respondent 6: Yes

I would  not  expand  the  balance  sheet  by  as  much  as  assumed  by  the  staff  in  the  Tealbook. Moreover, I would  begin  reducing  the  balance  sheet  sooner  and  proceed  at  a  faster  pace.

Respondent 7: Yes

Appropriate  monetary policy entails additional LSAP at a pace of roughly $85 billion per  month until the end of 2013. At that point, the labor market  recovery  is well in train, with the unemployment rate  at 7.3 percent  as  a  result  of  a  sustained  increase  in  the  pace  of  hiring  .

Respondent 8: Yes

I believe the MEP should be  allowed to expire and  we should  cease purchases of MBS at this  meeting. Maintaining  these balance  sheet policies provide little, if any, additional support to labor markets and they increase the risks of higher  inflation, higher inflation expectations, and growing financial imbalances. I believe the resulting  stance of  monetary policy would provide sufficient  accommodation for achieving  our  long-run  goals.

Respondent 9:

No

N/A

Respondent 10: No

N/A

Respondent 11: Yes

Myview of the  total  amount of LSAP purchases does not differ  materially from the Tealbook.  However, I am  concerned  that  the  market  expectation  for  purchases  does  differ  from  the  path  assumed  in  the Tealbook and I  am not  certain that it  will be possible to gradually change  market expectations as is assumed  in  the Tealbook. Rather  than a path  of purchases  that  continue  at  the rate  of  $85 billion per month  until  mid  2013  when  they  stop  altogether,  I  assume  that  purchases  will  be  gradually  reduced but  will  continue for longer. The  total of purchases  will likely be in the  $800 billion to $1 trillion range. I also  assume that the reduction  will be  accomplished primarily by  reducing  Treasury  securities while the  purchase  of  mortgage  backed  securities  continues  at  the  same  level  until  the  end  of  2013.

Respondent 12: Yes

No additions to SOMA  Treasury  security  holdings  to be made  once the MEP  is completed  at the close of  2012. However, MBS purchases to  continue into  2013 at a pace of $40 billion per  month, and maturing  Treasury  securities  to  be  rolled  over  at  auction.

Respondent 13: No

My  view of appropriate policy includes a balance sheet path that is modestly different from the Tealbook's,  but  not  materially  so. Under  my  view  of  appropriate  policy, the pace of LSAPs  in  the first half of this year  would  be  more  gradual  than  assumed  in  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 14: Yes

I assume  that  asset  purchases  continue  at  a  level  of  around  $85  billion  per  month  through  the  end  of 2013,  the  earliest  time  at  which  I  would  consider  it  appropriate,  in  the  context  of  my  forecast,  to  say that there has been  a significant  improvement  in  the  outlook  for  the  labor  market. In my  forecast, unemployment at the end of  2013 stands at  7.7%, a very  slight decline from its present level. However, my forecast for  2014 shows a very  meaningful pickup in the pace of GDP growth to  3.7% and projects a decline in unemployment of about 3/4 percentage points during  2014-i.e,  a significant improvement in the  outlook  for  the  labor  market.

Respondent 15: No

I assume  that  we  will begin to reduce  LSAP  purchases  by  mid-2013,  and  stop  them  completely  by roughly the  end of Q3. I do not  expect  a great deal of progress in reducing  unemployment in  2013. In my  view,  we  are  very  near  the  point  at  which  the  risks  of  a  larger  balance  sheet  will  outweigh  the likely benefits. I therefore  support  the  end  of  LSAP  purchases  in  mid-2013. Further  increases  to  the balance  sheet  should  be  reserved  for cases in which  we  need  to go  'all in', in particular  the case of another  recession  and  with  it  the  danger  of  deflation.

I believe  that  further  Treasury  purchases  are  of  little, if any, efficacy in reducing  unemployment. In contrast, I believe that MBS  purchases  are  likely  having  an  effect on mortgage  rates  and  on  the real economy  through  housing  prices,  sales  and  construction. These  effects,  in  turn,  are  likely  affecting the sentiments  and  behavior  of  consumers  as  well  as  financial  institutions  and  other  businesses. Nonetheless, I  would  also reduce  and  then  cease MBS purchases beginning  at  mid-year  because  the housing  recovery  will  be  well  under  way  by  then.

Respondent 16: Yes

Relative  to  Tealbook,  I  expect  LSAPs  to  continue  at  least  through  September  2013  at  a  rate  of  $85b per  month.

Respondent 17: Yes

I believe that under an appropriate  monetary policy we would  allow the MEP to expire and  would end the MBS purchase program at this  meeting. Once the MBS purchases in the pipeline have settled, the combined  effects  of  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet,  the  low  federal  funds  rate,  and  the  low  interest  rate on reserves will provide  sufficient stimulus  for achieving  the FOMC's  goals  in  a timely manner. In addition,  the  proceeds  of  maturing  MBS  would  be  reinvested  in  US  Treasuries  rather  than  in  agency MBS  as  presently  planned.

Respondent 18: Yes

My  forecast  does  not  incorporate  any  additional  Treasury  purchases.

I anticipate  following  the  Committee's  exit strategy principles, but because my  funds rate path is steeper than  in the Tealbook,  I anticipate  that we would  reduce  the  size of the balance  sheet  more quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 19: No

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Other  Conditioning  assumptions: We  expect  the  lower  degree  of inflation persistence evident since the early 1990s to continue. Inflation expectations remain well anchored. We project real foreign GDP  growth  (GDP  weighted)  at  1.7%  in 2012, at 2.7% in 2013, and at 2.8% in 2014. Our  assumptions  concerning  the  nominal  dollar exchange  rate are similar to those in the Tealbook.  Reflecting intermeeting developments, our assumed path of WTI oil prices, based on recent futures quotes, has  moved down  to  $88.00  for  2012Q4  and  $91.00  for  2013Q4,  and  $90.00  for  2014Q4. We  adopt  the  same  federal  fiscal  assumptions  as  in  the  Tealbook,  which  are  unchanged  from  recent meetings. Under  these  assumptions,  there  is  a  federal  fiscal  drag  of  1.2  percentage  points  of  GDP  in 2013,  declining  to  0.5  percentage  points  in  2014. We  also  adopt  the  Tealbook  assumptions  regarding equity  and  home  prices.

Outlook: The  conceptual  underpinnings  of  our  forecast  for  growth  and  inflation  in  2013  and  2014 are little changed  from  those  in September. As mentioned  above,  the  fiscal policy assumptions  are that fiscal drag  will increase substantially in  2013  as the payroll  tax  cut  and  extended unemployment benefits are allowed to expire at the end of 2012. This depresses  the growth  rate of real PCE  and the personal  saving  rate  over  the  first  half  of  the  year. At  the  same  time,  however,  the  effects  of  the drought  on  farm  output  will  be  subsiding  and  rebuilding  after  Hurricane  Sandy  will  be  ramping  up. Growth  of  real GDP  over  2013H1  is  likely  to be around  2%,  with  average  monthly  gains  of  payroll employment  around  170,000.

By  2013H2,  we  expect  growth  to  firm  to  around  2 3 4 / %  (annual  rate)  as  the  headwinds,  such  as household  deleveraging  and  restricted  access  to  credit,  more  fully  subside. Also  contributing  to  this firming  of  growth  is  the  turnaround  in  the  housing  market,  leading  to  gains  in  residential  investment as well  as to greater  confidence  that  has  a  positive  impact  on  consumer  spending. Uncertainty  about the US fiscal path is likely to diminish as the year progresses while world growth picks up as the Euro  area  emerges  from  recession  and  emerging  economy  growth  responds  to  fresh  policy  stimulus. Finally, the substantial  monetary  accommodation begins to have a  more substantial impact on the US economy. For all of 2013, we  expect  growth  of  real  GDP  of  around  2 1 2 / %,  with  the  unemployment rate  ending  the  year  around  7 1 2 / %.

By  2014  the  fiscal drag  is expected  to be  greatly diminished,  allowing  the  full  force  of  monetary accommodation  and  the  natural  healing  of  the  economy  to  be  realized. Growth  in  that  year  is  likely to be around  3 1 2 / %,  with  the  unemployment  rate  declining  by  about  one  full  percentage  point  to  6 1 2 / %. These  trends  continue  into 2015, with projected  growth  at  a similar rate as in 2014 and  the unemployment  rate  falling  below  6%.

The increase of the  total PCE deflator in  2012 is now expected to be  1.6%, reflecting larger declines in energy prices  than previously  expected. The projected  increase  of  the  core  PCE deflator  in  2012  is also 1.6%. In 2013 and 2014, as the  economy begins to establish greater forward  momentum, we expect both  total and  core inflation to move  gradually  higher,  with  total  PCE  deflator  inflation  moving  to around  1.8%  in  2013  and  2 1 4 / %  in  2014. The  gradual  decline  of  slack  in  the  economy  along  with  the expected decline of the  exchange value of the dollar  and  resulting  more rapid increase of nonpetroleum import  prices  contribute  to  the  expected  increase  in  inflation. With  inflation  expectations  anchored, inflation  is at its objective  in  2015.

Respondent 2: I think  that  my  central  outlook  is  not  all  that  different  from  the  Tealbook's. The economy has been hit by  a  mix of shocks. Some of these push down  on both  employment  and inflation -we can think of these as 'demand'  shocks. These shocks present no dual mandate  tensions: a monetary policy that returns inflation exactly to target in the  face of these shocks  will also return the economy  to  full  employment.

But there have been  other shocks that push  up  on inflation while pushing  down  on  employment  we  can think of these as 'supply' shocks. Typically, when responding  to these shocks using  a balanced approach  to the dual  mandate, appropriate  monetary policy  will give rise to above-target inflation for some  period  of  time.

There  are  several  key  risks  to  this  outlook. Others,  I'm  sure,  will  mention  Europe,  Asia,  and  the US  fiscal  situation. Let  me  mention  a  couple  of  others  that  don't  get  as  much  attention.

- 1. We have been  lucky  - inflation  expectations have stayed well-anchored. A  movement  in  inflationary  expectations in  either direction, but especially downward, would be challenging  for us to deal with.
- 2. The  long-run  unemployment  rate  consistent  with  2%  inflation  may  well  move  upwards  in  the next year  or two, especially if growth turns out to be slower than expected. We need to stay  alert to evidence  of  wage  and  compensation  pressures,  and  be  responsive  to  them.

Respondent 3: Despite some  weaker  than expected data  on  consumption, and the undoubtedly related  recent  declines  in  consumer  confidence,  underlying  conditions  continue  gradually  to  improve. Housing  in  particular  seems  to  have  gained  some  traction,  though  persistent  inventory  overhang  and difficulties in obtaining mortgages for purchasers  with less than stellar credit ratings suggest the pace of improvement  will  not  likely  accelerate  too  rapidly. Labor  market  conditions  also  continue  to  improve, though  again  only  gradually  and  with  no  apparent  signs  of  significant  acceleration.

The  obvious  elephant  in  the  room  is  the  set  of legislative fiscal changes  that  will  be triggered  in the absence of congressional action. Although  for modelling purposes, the Tealbook  had to make certain  assumptions about the  outcome, I don't think there  are very good grounds  for believing  that a particular  outcome  is  likely. There  is  some,  hopefully  modest,  chance  that  we  do  drive  over  the  cliff, with potentially substantial effects on growth depending  on the duration of the free  fall and its impact on  confidence. Yet there  are  also plausible  outcomes that  could simultaneously relieve businesses  and consumers,  on  the  one  hand,  while  making  a  credible  start  to  longer-term  fiscal  consolidation  needs, on  the  other. In such  an  instance,  the  steady  progress  in  housing  and  the  moderate  progress  in  labor markets  might  be  boosted  by  a  surge  in  investment  and  spending  heretofore  held  back  until  the  fiscal situation  and  thus  overall  growth  prospects  clarify.

Eurozone-generated  risks of a major financial dislocation  remain, though they have, in the  latest movement  in  their  undulating  pattern,  receded  somewhat  recently.

Respondent 4: My  central economic  outlook is currently shaped  by the fact that indicators do not yet point to the existence of a virtuous cycle that could provide the momentum  necessary  to move  the  recovery  to  a faster pace. Many  indicators  have  improved;  i.e.,  employment  is  improving, and household wealth driven by improvements  in shareholder value and home  values are growing. However,  other  indicators  that  need  to  move  in  tandem,  such  as  improvements  in  business  confidence and  capital  expenditures  and  growth  in  real  disposable  income,  are  not  robust.

Respondent 5: Even in the absence of the fiscal  cliff, we would be projecting  only  moderate growth in the current quarter. Adding  in  the  cliff's depressing  effect  on confidence  and  spending  and some modest  reduction  in  output  from  Hurricane  Sandy,  we  are  left  with  a  growth  forecast  in  the  neighborhood  of  1  percent  in  the  current  quarter.

Looking ahead, the key factors shaping the forecast are the same as they have been for some time. Our  baseline  assumption  is  that  resolution  of  the  fiscal  cliff will involve  restraint  on  the  order of magnitude  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. We  also  assume  the  resolution  will  be  clear  enough  to  release a modicum  of  spending  that  was  put on hold during the second half of 2012. Furthermore,  under our baseline scenario, Europe  will muddle  through  without  a  financial meltdown,  and  so  over time will exert  a diminishing  drag  on  confidence  and  spending. More  fundamentally,  with  the  support  of accommodative  monetary  policy,  households  and  businesses  will  eventually  make  enough  progress  in

shoring up their balance  sheets to resume  spending  more  briskly. Some  of this will reflect pent-up demands  for capital goods and consumer  durables, which will provide an impetus for above-trend growth  as the  associated  stock-adjustment process  takes place. Demand from abroad  also is  assumed to firm in 2014  and  2015, as Europe  emerges  from  recession  and  growth  in  Asia  recovers  to  a  more robust  pace.

Under  our  view  of appropriate  policy, sufficient accommodation  will  be  in  place-and  will  be  expected to remain in place-to result in inflation drifting up  some over the projected period. Importantly, a credible  commitment to our  accommodative policy stance should support inflation expectations and push inflation back  up  to a bit above our  target by late in the projection period. Still, given we expect resource gaps to remain substantial even into  2015, this projected increase in inflation is quite modest, with  the  PCE  price  index  rising  just  2.2  percent  in  2015.

Respondent 6: I continue to think the  convergence process is progressing. Nonetheless, the recent growth  and inflation data have  caused some slight changes in my  outlook. I am  assuming  a reasonable resolution  of  the  fiscal  cliff.

Respondent 7: Incoming  data have been slightly softer than expected, but overall in line with expectations. Some  of the recent softness is  likely related  to the  temporary effects  of the hurricane and the drought, which will reverse  early next year. Labor market improvements remain unsatisfactory, with declines in the unemployment  rate  being  importantly  influenced  by  declines  in  the  labor  force participation  rather  than  by  increases  in the employment  to  population  ratio. The  sluggish  pace  of growth  in the second  half of this year was influenced  importantly  by  the uncertainties  surrounding the domestic  fiscal outlook  and  the  financial situation in Europe. The  December  drop  in  consumer sentiment is just one indication of how uncertainty  about fiscal policy affects spending  decisions. The modal  economic  outlook  is  predicated  on  the  resolution  of  the  fiscal  impasse,  and  on  the  situation  in Europe not deteriorating dramatically.  If this indeed occurs, uncertainty  and pessimism about  current and  expected  conditions  will  decrease, leading to a higher pace of demand  and  hiring. As a result, after modest  gains  in  the first months  of  next  year, the pace  of growth  is expected  to  accelerate  as headwinds diminish  and the effects of the stimulative  monetary policy  actions become  more apparent.

Risks  to the real economic  outlook  continue  to  be  skewed  to  the  downside. In the near  term,  as uncertainty  remains high  and  the  effects of the fiscal restraint become  more pronounced,  growth  is expected  to stay modest. Therefore, any significant improvement  in  activity  is, at this point, only in the outlook. Given  the challenges facing the economy  in  the near-term, monetary  policy  should remain  highly  accommodative  to  ensure  a  more  robust  and  self-sustaining  recovery. For  this reason, the outlook  is conditioned  on  additional LSAP  at  a pace of $85 billion per month  until the end of 2013. This  additional  stimulus  contributes  to  a  more  robust  upturn  starting  in  the  second  half  of  next year, so that GDP growth in  2013 is expected to be  close to 3 percent despite the important restraint from  fiscal policy. By  the end  of next  year, a faster and  sustained  pace  of  job creation  leads  to the unemployment  rate  falling  to  7.3  percent. The  additional  $1  trillion of quantitative  easing  over  the course  of  2013  also  helps  stimulate  growth  beyond  next  year: The  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to near  6  percent,  with  inflation  running  somewhat  below  target,  at  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 8: While  Hurricane  Sandy  has  disrupted  many  lives  and  introduced  some  volatility  to high  frequency  data  releases,  on  net  it  should  have  little  impact  on  fourth  quarter  real  GDP  growth.

I continue to expect a moderate  economic  recovery over the next several years with a gradual reduction in the unemployment  rate reflecting  strengthening housing activity  and  consumer  confidence. In  addition,  the  labor  market  continues  to heal. Even  with  the  effects  of  Hurricane Sandy,  employment rose an average of 158 thousand  over the previous 5  months (July  - November). Finally, an extremely accommodative  monetary  policy  contributes  to  growth.

Uncertainty  about how the fiscal  cliff  will be resolved, a slowdown in  global growth,  and  expectations of higher  taxes  and  more  regulations  will  likely  weigh  on  growth. On  the  upside,  the  increases in housing activity and auto sales are consistent with a household sector that may  be even more supportive  of  growth  going  forward.

Turning  to  inflation, I expect  that  maintaining  our  accommodative  monetary  policy  (funds  rate, forward guidance, asset purchases)  would  lead to an increase in inflation in  2014 and  2015. Therefore, I think  an end  to asset purchases and  an  earlier  lift-off in the funds rate is needed to  maintain inflation close  to our 2 percent  objective.

Respondent 9: I expect  the  economy  to  remain  on  a  subdued  growth  path  over  the  medium-term owing  to  a  number  of  restraining  influences. The  rebalancing  of  household  balance  sheets  is  likely  to play  out  several  more  years  and  continue  to  hold  down  consumer  spending. Policy  and  other  outlook uncertainties  will  check  the  expansion  of  capital  and  retard  employment  growth. Fiscal  austerity  at  all levels will restrain  government  spending. Nevertheless,  I  think  growth  will  be  sufficient  to  gradually bring down  unemployment. Unusually  slow growth over the next several quarters will exert more downward  pressure  on  prices,  holding  inflation  a  little under  the  longer-term  target  during  the  first half  of  2013. Inflation  expectations,  however,  are  expected  to  remain  well  anchored  and  this  deviation from  target  will  likely  be  short-lived.

Respondent 10: Pattern of sluggish growth  in production  and income  continues. Cyclical gaps remain wide but there has  likely been at least a temporary  reduction  in potential growth  as well. Labor  market  improving  only  slowly,  leading  in  turn  to  slow  gains  in  wage  income  and  in  household spending. Unemployment  has  improved  a  bit  in  recent  months,  however,  notwithstanding  very  slow growth. Fiscal  policy, both  federal  and  state  and  local, are applying  drag  and  are  likely  to  continue to do so in 2013. In the short run, federal fiscal policy is having  adverse  effects on confidence  and spending, especially firm spending. The effects of the European situation on trade and finance, including  indirect  effects  through  other  trading  partners,  are  a  headwind,  although  the  situation  has moderately  improved  with  ECB  actions. The  drought  and  hurricane  Sandy  subtracted  from  growth recently  but  there  will  be payback  in  early  2013. Housing  is  clearly  improving  and  is  poised  to  help the  overall  recovery. Higher  house  prices  are  adding  to  the  pace  of  improvement  in  household  wealth and  balance  sheets. Housing,  improved  consumer  sentiment,  and  resolution  of  fiscal  issues  should  lead to somewhat  stronger  growth  in  2013  than  in  2012.

Core  inflation remains  very  well anchored  by  stable  expectations  and  modest  downside  pressure from labor market slack and slow wage growth. Pressure on commodity  prices has been limited, reflecting both supply  (e.g., in the case of oil, increased US  production, good  Middle  East  supply) and  demand  (weaker  global  growth,  increased  efficiency  in  the  US).  Stable  commodity  prices  implies stable  overall  inflation.

Respondent 11: My  forecast is consistent with the factors outlined in the  'Robust  Housing  Recovery'  alternative scenario. I believe that housing  will continue to strengthen. I give less weight to the potential drag from shadow inventory  coming  on to the  market,  more weight to the potential for stronger  household  formation  and  I  have  assumed  more  support  from  MBS  purchases  than  in  the Tealbook  baseline. I also assume  that  consumer  confidence  will  be  bolstered  by  rising house  prices but  not  to  the  extent  described  in  the  'Housing  Reverberations'  alternative  scenario.

Respondent 12: Drags on growth from excess household debt continue to ease, and residential investment is now  making  consistently positive growth  contributions. However,  extreme  tax  and  regulatory  uncertainty  limits the pace of the expansion and  retards the impact of a highly  accommodative monetary policy. Down-side risks stemming from  economic and financial problems abroad have  eased,

somewhat,  but  remain  substantial,  as  does  the  uncertainty  stemming  from  it  that  impacts  U.S.  business decision  making  and  budgeting. Pending  resolution  of  these  uncertainties, U.S., businesses  are avoiding new  spending  commitments  and  holding  above-normal  levels  of  cash. If the uncertainties remain  unresolved,  I would  expect  to lower my  growth  projections  and  raise  my  unemployment  estimates, perhaps significantly. Conversely, an unexpectedly rapid and favorable resolution would produce  faster GDP growth than I  am  currently projecting. Recovery  and  rebuilding  after hurricane Sandy  will  give  a  noticeable  boost  to  2013:H1  GDP  growth. On  the  other  hand,  threatened  steep  cuts in government  purchases,  if  implemented,  would  subtract  significantly  from  growth.

Respondent 13: I expect the economy  to recover at a moderate  rate from 2013 through 2015, reflecting  a  range  of  forces. The  positive  forces  include  considerable  monetary  stimulus,  improvement in the housing  sector that will gradually  spill over to consumer  spending,  and  the  economy's  usual self-correcting  forces. The  negative  forces  include  fiscal  restraint  and  uncertainty  about  fiscal  policy and  conditions  in  Europe.

In this environment,  I expect  inflation to remain  near  2 percent  from 2013 through  2015. This projection  reflects  recent  PCE price trends, stable inflation  expectations,  and  slow growth in wages. With the job  market still weak, there is unlikely to be much  upward pressure on inflation  coming from wages  over the next couple of years. The  stability of inflation and inflation expectations  around 2 percent  indicate  there  is  unlikely  to  be  much  downward  pressure  on  inflation.

As to uncertainty and risks, the fiscal cliff and the recession in Europe make the outlook for GDP  growth  and unemployment  more  uncertain than normal. Both the fiscal cliff and Europe's problems pose downside risks to the pace of recovery in the  U.S. For inflation, I believe the uncertainty surrounding  the  forecast to be consistent with historical norms  and  the  risks to be balanced. As I noted  above, if downside  risks  to the pace of the recovery  were  to materialize, inflation could slow. Alternatively, the continued  expansion  of our balance  could  eventually cause inflation expectations and,  in  turn,  inflation  to  rise.

Respondent 14: A number  of special factors, including Hurricane Sandy, the summer  drought, and  the  distortion  in  seasonal  factors  due  to  the  recession,  make  it  difficult  to  discern  the  underlying momentum  in  aggregate  demand  and  trends  in  the  labor  market. That  said,  incoming  data  suggest that  the  economy,  on  balance,  has  been  expanding,  and  is  likely  to  continue  to  expand  over  the  next year, at a trendlike  pace. The  growth  rate  of  payroll  employment  has  improved  somewhat,  and  the unemployment  rate  has  edged  down, but I do not see sufficient momentum  in  demand  to  forecast any  meaningful  further  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  during  the  coming  year. Consumer spending growth  and growth in disposable income have surprised to the downside,  and there has been a notable deterioration in consumer  confidence  as  households  appear  to  be realizing that taxes are poised to rise. Rising house prices should serve as a support to  consumer spending going  forward, but recovery  in  the  housing  market  and  residential  investment  is  likely  to  be  quite  gradual. Even  with  a successful  resolution of the fiscal  cliff, fiscal policy is poised to serve as a significant drag on spending over the  coming year due to the end of the payroll  tax cut  and  extended unemployment benefits. Slow growth  in  the  global  economy,  and  continued  contraction  in  the  euro  area  is  a  further  important  drag on growth. With  respect  to  inflation,  core  inflation  appears  to  be  running  under  the  Committee's  2 percent  objective  and  with  well-anchored  inflation  expectations  and  very  modest  increases  in  wages and labor compensation, my  expectation is that inflation  will run below 2 percent  over the next  several years  even  with  a  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy.

Respondent 15: I expect  that  the  economy  will  eventually  produce  a  run  of  'above  trend'  growth to move us  closer to full utilization of resources. I no longer expect that this run  will begin in H1  2013. I see another  2%  year, give or take, despite the help we get in Q1  from  the drought  and  hurricane rebounds. I also  see more  down  side  than  upside  risk.

It seems very likely that the fiscal negotiations  will drag  on and be quite  contentious. In particular, I fear that we may  have another debt ceiling crisis in late February, and with it another negative confidence  shock. If so, growth  could  be  even  lower  than  the  'weak  demand'  case. Even  if there is no  crisis moment,  the  year  will  probably  be  dominated  by  these  messy  and  contentious  negotiations, which  could  undermine  consumer  and  business  activity.

If the fiscal negotiations conclude quickly and successfully, there could be a positive shock to confidence. I now  view  that  as  unlikely.

I see a substantial  output  gap  and  no persuasive  evidence of damage to potential  output.

I see inflation  running  below  mandate  with  risk  to  go  lower  if  the  economy  weakens.

Respondent 16: The economy  is still recovering from the severe housing collapse and financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand  through  a  variety  of channels, which  policy has only partially offset. Some  headwinds  are slowly easing. For example, banking  and credit conditions are improving; and housing is likely to continue  its  gradual  improvement. At  the  same  time,  however,  other  headwinds  remain  intense. For example,  fiscal  policy  is  turning  increasingly  contractionary  -  the  ongoing  negotiations  regarding  the Federal fiscal cliff are mainly about how contractionary it will actually be. The global economy remains  a drag on activity. Uncertainty  about  economic  prospects  continues  to  weigh  on  consumer and,  especially,  business  spending.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow us  to  continue  making  modest progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps over  the next few years. Even  with  substantial  monetary  stimulus,  it  will  take  many  years  of  above-trend  growth to return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of inflation, significant slack in labor and  goods  markets  and  subdued  commodity  and import  prices should keep inflation somewhat  below  the  FOMC's  2  percent  inflation  target  for the next  few  years.

Respondent 17: GDP  growth  has  been  disappointing. Fiscal  drag  will  restrain  growth  in  the  first half of 2013. Later, there will be additional firming in the labor market that will be reflected in gradually  improving  personal  income  growth  and  consumer  spending. Uncertainty  over  the federal budget  and  regulatory  actions  will dampen  business  investment. Residential  investment  is likely to continue to contribute to growth  in overall activity. The  upward  trajectory  in home  prices should bolster consumer  sentiment; however, weak  income  growth  will dampen  consumer  spending  in  the near term. Government  consumption  and  investment  will  be  held  down  by  large,  persistent  federal deficits. Demand  for  US  exports  is  likely  to  increase.

Respondent 18: Uncertainty  about  U.S.  fiscal  policy  has  been  a  significant  drag  on  growth. Once this  uncertainty  fades  I  expect  that  business  spending  will  pick  up. Although  household  deleveraging continues, I  expect it to become  less of a drag going  forward  as household balance sheets improve.

I expect  3 percent  growth  over  the medium  term,  slightly  above  my  longer-term  trend. With  a moderate  pace  of  growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  6  percent  by  the  end  of  2015,  at  which  time it reaches  my  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that  headline  inflation  will be 1.8 percent in 2012 and then edge up to 2 percent over the remainder  of the forecast horizon. Inflation stays anchored  around  my  target  of  2  percent  in  response  to  tighter  monetary  policy  than that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may become unanchored. To  ward  off  these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening

of monetary  policy  by  ending  purchases  by  mid-2013  and  then  beginning  to  raise  rates  in  the  second half of 2013.

Respondent 19: I anticipate  a  marked  acceleration  in  growth  beginning  in  the  second  half  of  2013, and continuing into 2014, under the assumption that the fiscal cliff is at least partially resolved, and  that  the  situation  in  Europe  continues  to  stabilize. In this scenario,  the  gains  that  we  have  seen recently in  consumer  confidence, in the housing, retail and  auto sectors, all begin to provide a stronger impetus  to  growth,  and  I  expect  the  business  sector  to  begin  to  fall into step, increasing  hiring  and capital  expenditures. At  the  same  time,  I  expect  the  first  half  of  2013  to  be  slow,  so  that  growth  for the  calendar  year  overall  is  only  modest,  as  is  progress  on  unemployment.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecast  to  change  since the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: The  revisions to Q3  GDP  data  indicate  that the starting conditions for 2012Q4 were weaker than we previously expected, and we have reduced our projection for the quarter to between 1 2 / %  and  1%  (annual  rate). If realized,  that  would  bring  the  growth  rate  of  real  GDP  for  the second half of the year to  1.6% (annual rate), the same as over the first half of the year but below our previous projections. This has  little effect  on projections  for subsequent quarters.

Overall, the data on  consumer spending has been a  little weaker than we had expected in September, hence  we  have  lowered  our  near-term  projection  for  real  PCE.  However,  unlike  the  Tealbook,  it has less effect on subsequent quarters. In contrast, the recovery  of the housing  sector appears to have gained  momentum,  and  we  have  raised  our  residential  investment  forecast  somewhat.

Indicators of real business fixed investment  have  been  softer than expected, leading us to lower our near-term  investment  forecast  to  be  flat  for  2012H2. We  also  see investment  growth  in  the  first half of 2013  to  be  slower  than  previously  anticipated.

The  decline in the unemployment  rate  in  the second half of the year was a surprise to us, and we  have  lowered  our  near-term  unemployment  rate  projections. However,  the  behavior  of  other  labor market  data  over  recent  months  indicate  that  the  labor  market  and  the  overall  economy  is  still  rather sluggish. The  growth  of hours worked  and  average  hourly  earnings  remained  soft, and the level of hours is still well below its pre-recession level. The labor force participation rate and the employmentpopulation ratio have not changed substantially over  the year  and  remain  at  low  levels. Consequently, we  have  made  little  change  to  our  medium-term  unemployment  forecasts.

The  inflation data  so  far  in the second half  of  2012 has been  somewhat  lower  than we projected in September.  In  response,  we  have  reduced  modestly  our  projections  for  the  second  half  of  the  year. However, because some of the reduction  reflects  temporary  factors (including  weakness in nonmarket components  of  the  PCE  deflator),  we  have  not  changed  our  medium-term  inflation  projections.

A final note: many of the high frequency indicators released recently have been subject to negative impacts  from  Hurricane  Sandy. As  such  we  have  discounted  some  of  the  recent  weaker  data.

Respondent 2: My  assessment  of  inflationary pressures  is  now  more  closely  aligned  with,  although still higher  than  the  Tealbook's. My  estimate  of  long-run  growth  is  slightly  lower,  as  is  my  estimate of the  long-run  unemployment  rate.

These relatively small adjustments have resulted in a large change in what I judge to be the appropriate length of  time before the first increase of the fed funds rate. To me, this is another strong argument  why  calendar-based  guidance  should  be  abandoned  in  favor  of  guidance  based  on  economic conditions.

Respondent 3: Not  much  change. A  little downgrade  based  on  incoming  data  and  growing  likelihood  since  September  that  the  fiscal  issues  will  continue  well  into  next  year.

Respondent 4: Since the September SEP, my  forecasts have become  more  conservative  for several reasons. First, I think  that structural  impediments  in  the  economy  (such  as  credit  constraints)  will attenuate  the  speed  in  which financial  market  variables  transfer  to  effects  in  the  real  economy. However, at some  point  in  time, the credibility of the FOMC  to  communicate  effectively  its  intent  to  provide growth-enhancing  support  could  improve,  to  the ultimate benefit  of possibly  assisting  in  the  ability  to see  more positive effects on the real  economy. Should this improvement in  communication  occur prior to the occurrence of some of the costs associated with unconventionally accommodative  monetary

policy -like problems of price stability, financial stability and market functioning -then I would expect  the  forecast  to  improve.

In addition,  the  ability  of monetary  policy  to  support  financial  markets  will  likely  be  attenuated next year  as  markets gradually realize that  cumulative purchases  might be about  $500 billion  less than they  currently  appear  to  have  factored  in. Over  time,  this  realization  could  lead  to  a  small  amount  of upward pressure on long-term interest  rates and dollar appreciation, and  a small  amount of downward pressure  on  stock  market  prices.

My  forecasts have also become  more  conservative because downside risks to the outlookparticularly from  issues relating to fiscal policy and  emanating  from  Europe  -  have  remained  elevated. Continued  uncertainty  about  these  scenarios  could be restraining household  spending  and  business investment.

Respondent 5: Our  outlook  for  growth  in  2012  is  0.3  percentage  point  less  than  in  the  September SEP.  A  bit  of  this  reflects  the  weather  (a  larger  effect  of  the  drought  and  disruptions  from  Hurricane Sandy). But  most  of the revision is due  to a more  fundamental  softness  in  household  and  business spending,  some  of  which  is  assumed  to  spill  into  next  year. Furthermore,  we  have  revised  down  our estimates of potential  output growth somewhat.  Together, these result our  forecast showing  a bit  less growth  in  2013  and  2014  than  in  our  September  submission.

We  were surprised by the decline in the unemployment  rate  in 2012:H2, and have marked  our projection for the rate in  2012:Q4 down 0.4 percentage point relative to the September SEP. However, after factoring  in  the  GDP  forecast  revisions  noted  above,  our  projection  for  the  unemployment  rate in 2015:Q4  is  the  same  as  in  September.

The incoming price data have been  running below  our previous projection,  and we have revised down our projection for  2012 inflation by 0.2 percentage point. Given the persistence in the inflationary process, we have nudged down  our  forecast by  a  tenth  or two over the projection period.

Respondent 6: Slower  real  GDP  growth  recently  than  I  anticipated  has  caused  some  adjustments in the timing  of  growth  - some  reductions  in  my  growth  forecasts  for  2012  and  2013  and  an  increase in growth  in  2014. Lower  inflation  data  recently  than  I  anticipated  has  caused  some  reductions  in  my inflation  forecasts  for  2012.

Respondent 7: Incoming  data  have been, by and large, consistent with my  expectations  at the time  of  the  previous  SEP.  As  a  result,  my  views  about  appropriate  monetary  policy  has  not  changed significantly.

Respondent 8: My forecasts  for real GDP  and inflation  are relatively unchanged. However, my  unemployment rate  forecast has been revised down by  0.4 percentage point reflecting  recent (September -November)  unemployment  rate  reports.

Respondent 9: Incoming data suggest slightly less growth for 2012:H2 than I had assumed in September. Resolutions that allow us to avoid the full impact of the fiscal cliff will nevertheless introduce some  spending  drag  early in  2013. I expect this modestly lower growth trajectory  to put a little additional  downward  pressure  on  wage  and  price  growth  in  the  first  half  of  2013.

Respondent 10: Not much  overall change. Slightly better data in  labor  market, housing. Reduced tensions  over Europe. However,  businesses  remain  very  cautious  and  fiscal  tensions  are  particularly high  in  the  near  term.

Respondent 11: Continued  evidence  of  strength  and  momentum  in  house  prices.

Respondent 12: Hurricane  Sandy  has  caused  me  to  revise  2012  GDP  growth  slightly  downward, while recent favorable data have  caused  me  to  lower  the projected path  of  the  unemployment  rate. Inflation  has been  coming  in  a  bit  lower  than  I had  anticipated. As  GDP  growth  picks  up,  in  2013, inflation  should  return  to  target  levels.

Respondent 13: The data received since the September  SEP  have  been  largely consistent with the moderate  pace  of recovery and near-target inflation rate I projected at the time. However, in light of recent developments  regarding  the  fiscal cliff, I have boosted  the amount  of fiscal restraint assumed  in  the  forecast. In particular, I have  adjusted  the  forecast  to  fully  incorporate  the  end  of  the payroll tax holiday  and  extended  unemployment  compensation. By  themselves,  these  changes  have modestly  lowered  my growth  forecast  and  edged  up  my  unemployment  forecast. However,  my forecast for the unemployment rate  is now a  little  lower  than  it was  in September because  the  effects  of  the surprising  fall in unemployment  in  August  and  September  have  outweighed  the  effects  of  additional fiscal restraint.

Respondent 14: My  forecast  has  not  changed  materially  since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 15: I have significantly reduced  my  growth  projection  for 2013. I think 2013 looks like another  2%  year, in light of current momentum,  the  pending  fiscal  negotiations, recession and possible  turmoil  in  Europe,  and  slow  growth  in  some  major  emerging  economies.

Respondent 16: Since  September,  the  data  have  been  mixed  but,  on  balance,  consistent  with  my forecast. Both  unemployment  and  inflation  have  come  in  lower  than  I  expected,  and  Hurricane  Sandy has affected near-term  activity. Beyond  the  next  few  quarters, I see a bit faster momentum  in  the economy  and  somewhat  faster  progress  on  reducing  unemployment. Housing  indicators  have  come  in above  my  expectations,  and  the  tail risk associated  with Europe has  receded. Oil prices are lower, which  will  help  support  consumer  spending.

In addition to a faster momentum, my  unemployment path  falls  faster  because I have  lowered my estimate of potential growth for the next few years. Hence, the economy closes output and unemployment  gaps  more  quickly.

My  inflation  forecast  is  a  bit  lower,  reflecting  recent  data  as  well  as  the  lower  path  for  oil  prices.

Respondent 17: The  growth  of  wage  and  salary  income  was  revised  down  significantly. Business investment has been  weaker  than I  anticipated. The  likelihood  of achieving  meaningful progress  on establishing  a sustainable  federal budget trajectory has diminished. My  long  run growth  estimate is lower,  due  to  lower  expected  growth  in  composition-adjusted  labor  hours.

Respondent 18: My  economic  forecast  is little changed. But  given the current stance of policy, I've pushed  out  the  date  of  liftoff  from  2012  to  2013  and  steepened  the  policy  path..

Respondent 19: Overall, my  forecast  for GDP  growth  is  very  close  to  that in the previous  SEP. My  forecast for the unemployment  rate  is  essentially shifted down  by  0.30, in light of the drop we have had since September, but the trajectory going  forward  remains very  similar.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: As  stated  in  our  response  to  question  3,  we  assume  (based  on  our  modal  economic forecast)  that  the  asset  purchase  program  (MBS  plus  long-term  Treasuries)  lasts  through  the  end  of 2013 rather than through  mid-2013  as the Tealbook  assumes.  Because of the greater size  and duration in the  balance  sheet  over  the  forecast  horizon,  we  thus  assume  that  term  premia  rise  to  normal  levels more  slowly  than  in  the  Tealbook.

We  see  some  of  the  headwinds  restraining  economic  growth  subsiding  somewhat  more  quickly  in 2014  than  in  the  Tealbook. Thus  we  expect  the  output  gap  to  begin  to  close  more  quickly  that  year, and  our  2014  real  GDP  growth  forecast  is  modestly  above  that  of  the  Tealbook.

For 2013  and  2014,  the  Tealbook  expects  somewhat  stronger  real  PCE  growth  (even  though  the Tealbook  has  marked  down  its  PCE  forecast)  and  notably  weaker  business  fixed  investment  growth than  our  forecast. In part, the differences  in PCE  growth  forecasts  reflect  somewhat  different  views of the effects of the expected fiscal consolidation on household behavior. As far as investment, it appears  that  in  the Tealbook  the  restraints  that  have  held  down  fixed  investment  recently  will  fade more  slowly  than  in  our  projections.

On balance  in  2014, our projection  of stronger investment  growth  more  than  offsets  the weaker projected  PCE growth, which implies that we  forecast stronger final domestic demand growth than does  the  Tealbook. Consequently,  we  project  higher  import  growth  for  that  year. With  foreign  GDP growth  and  exchange rate projections similar in the two  forecasts, this  means that net  exports  are a drag for GDP growth in our forecast for that year instead of being  a neutral  factor  as in the Tealbook forecast.

We  expect a greater decline in the unemployment rate in  2014 than is projected in the Tealbook, even  accounting  for  the  differences  in  the  GDP  forecasts  and  having  similar  projections  for  the  labor force participation  rate. The source of this difference appears to be a different interpretation of  labor market  dynamics  as  expansions  mature;  that  is,  we  do  not  place  as  much  weight  on  Okun's  Law  as the  Board  staff  does.

We see a stronger influence of  anchored inflation  expectations  on inflation dynamics than does the Tealbook. Consequently,  our  inflation forecast and the Tealbook  forecast are similar for 2012, but beyond  that  we see total and core inflation remaining  near  2%  whereas  the  Tealbook  has  inflation declining  in  2013 and  remaining  near the  2013 level in  2014. This difference may  also partially reflect the  differing  monetary  policy  assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts.

Both  the  Tealbook  and  our  outlook  see  a  downside  balance  of  risks  to  real  growth. For  inflation, we agree that the risks are broadly balanced, but we see uncertainty as still higher than normal whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  a  near  normal  level. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that the  unusual  nature  of  the  current  expansion  leaves  uncertainty  about  both  real  activity  and  inflation above  normal  levels.

Respondent 2: I see  unemployment  falling  more  rapidly,  and  inflation  being  higher,  than  does  the Tealbook.  In  large part, this is because my path of appropriate policy is different from the policy path that  underlies  the  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 3: No  major  analytical  differences.

Respondent 4: None.

Respondent 5: Our projection  for growth is stronger than in the Tealbook. The differences  largely reflect  our  assumption  that  the  open-ended  LSAP  continues  until  the  end  of  2013  and  our  somewhat stronger  growth  rate  of  potential  output.

Our  forecast  for  inflation  is  1/2  to  3/4  percentage  point  higher  than  in  the  Tealbook. This  is due to the more  robust  growth  in demand  in  our forecast as well as to our assumption  that  a credible commitment  to  accommodative policy  will help buoy  inflation  expectations  and  thus  elevate  actual inflation.

Respondent 6: I anticipate  faster  real  GDP  growth  for  2013  and  slower  real  GDP  growth  for  2015 than the Tealbook.  For  2013 through  2015, I anticipate a lower unemployment  rate than the Tealbook.

Respondent 7: My  forecast is  conditioned  on  more policy stimulus than in the Tealbook,  and this results in a faster pace of growth in my forecast than in the Tealbook. When  conditioned on the same policy assumptions,  fading  headwinds  are  expected  to  lead  to a slightly faster pace of growth  than projected  in  the Tealbook starting  in  the second half  of next year.

Respondent 8: In comparison to the Tealbook forecast, I see greater inflationary pressures in the next few years from  a continuation  of the currently highly accommodative  stance  of  policy. In response to these pressures that threaten the stability  of  long-term inflation expectations, my  view of appropriate  policy  calls for a lift-off of the federal funds  rate in late 2013, two  years earlier than  in Tealbook. In addition,  my  forecast  assumes  that  the  MEP  program  and  MBS  purchases  end.

Respondent 9: While  my  forecast  is  broadly  in  line  with  the  current  Tealbook  baseline,  I  expect a bit more progress in reducing  unemployment over  the next two years. I also project inflation to follow a path  closer  to our longer-term  inflation  objective owing  to a strong  adherence  of wage  and price  growth  to  longer-term  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 10: A bit more  optimistic  about  growth  in  2013, assuming  reasonable  resolution  to fiscal issues and no unexpected  shocks. I remain a bit more pessimistic than the Tealbook  about the extent to which activity will accelerate in the out years, in light of the slow pace of recovery experienced  thus  far  and  the  likelihood  of  continued  headwinds  from  Europe  and  US  fiscal  policy.

Respondent 11: N/A

Respondent 12: I see  somewhat  faster  GDP  growth  in  2013  than  does  the  Tealbook,  with  a  correspondingly  larger  reduction  in  the  unemployment  rate. My  inflation  forecasts  converge  to  2  percent more  rapidly  than  the  Tealbook's. These  differences  imply  that  there  is  less  need  for  monetary-policy accommodation.

Respondent 13: My  current forecast is quite similar to the Tealbook's. The  biggest difference, which  isn't material, is in the headline  inflation forecast. Compared  to  the  Tealbook,  I  expect  less downward  pressure  from  food  and  energy  prices.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: I expect lower growth in  2013. My  expectations are  close to the 'weaker demand' forecast.

Respondent 16: My  forecast  is broadly similar  to  the Tealbook projection  on a policy-consistent basis. My  forecast  for GDP is a  touch  stronger, in part because I have  more  monetary  stimulus.

Respondent 17: Growth  is lower next year due in part to greater fiscal drag, Also, uncertainty over  the  federal  budget  and  regulatory  actions  will  restrain  private  spending  even  after  the  fiscal  cliff negotiations  are  completed. Inflation  is  higher  next  year  due  to  well-anchored  expectations.

Respondent 18: My forecast  calls  for a stronger  economy in  2013  and  tighter  monetary policy than the  Tealbook. I anticipate  a  lower  unemployment  rate  than  the  Tealbook  in  2013  and  2014.

Respondent 19: I am  a  touch  more  optimistic  for  growth  in  2013,  for  the  reasons  described  above, but  other  than  that,  am  quite  close  to  the  Tealbook.
