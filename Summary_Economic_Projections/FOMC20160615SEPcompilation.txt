Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes  from the fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change in, respectively,  the  price  index  for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  of  the  midpoint  of  the  projected  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  projected  appropriate  target level for the federal funds  rate  at the end  of the specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  March  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with the meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  March  15-16,  2016. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  in  conjunction  with the  June  14-15,  2016  meeting.

1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections is even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle  projections.

- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you  anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: Labor-force  participation  is now  near  its demographically  determined  trend,  and the  unemployment  rate  is  roughly  at  its  longer-run  sustainable  level. The  economy  appears  to  be  on  a track  that  will  push  it  past  full  employment. With  the  labor  market  tight,  and  the  restraining  eff ects  of oil-price  declines  and  a  stronger  dollar  having  waned,  I  expect  inflation  to  reach  our  2  percent  longerrun  objective  in  2017. In the  absence  of  new  shocks,  the  unemployment  rate  eventually  converges  to its longer-run  sustainable  level  from  below. The  inflation  rate  approaches  2  percent  from  above. Full convergence  might  take  5  years.

Respondent 2: N/A

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: I anticipate  that  the  economy  will  converge  to  my  longer-run  projections  in  about five years

Respondent 6: We  believe convergence  of the federal funds rate to its long-run  level could take longer  than  5  or  6  years. Currently,  the  equilibrium  funds  rate  is  well  below  its  longer-run  level  and  is expected  to  rise  only  gradually  over  the  projection  period. We  think  the  stance  of  policy  will  return to neutral  well  within  the  5  to  6 year  window,  but  when  it  does,  it  is  quite  possible  that  the  neutral rate  itself will still have  some  way  to  go  before  it  reaches  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 7: We  view  the  current  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  as  understating  the  amount  of slack  in  the  economy,  but  expect  the  activity  gap  to  close  by  the  end  of  this  year. Convergence  to  the inflation  target  is projected  to  follow  later  next  year, as inflation  expectations  gradually  revert  back to 2 percent.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  in  two  to  three  years.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: I anticipate  that  it will take five or six years  to achieve  full convergence. In my projection,  although  the  unemployment  rate  and  inflation  are  close  to  their  longer-run  values  by  the end  of 2018, the federal funds  rate at that point  is still projected  to  be  noticeably  below  its  longerrun level owing  to headwinds  that  will have not completely  faded, such as still-restricted access to mortgage  credit.

Respondent 12: I anticipate  that  the  convergence  of  real  GDP  growth  and  inflation  will  take  less than  5 years. Specifically, I expect  real GDP  growth  to  move  above  its  longer-run  rate  in  2017  and 2018 before slowing to that rate after 2018. The unemployment  rate  has  already fallen below my estimate of its longer-run  level, and I expect it will remain  there in the period from 2016 to 2018, before  moving  back  to  that  level. I expect  inflation  to  rise  to  close  to  2  percent  in  2016.

Respondent 13: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on  short-term  government  debt. This  regime  features GDP  growth  of 2.0%, unemployment  of 4.7%, and inflation of 2.0%. Because there are multiple possible  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  longer-run  projections. Calculating an  average  for  a  specific  variable  based  on  multiple  possible  outcomes  is  potentially  misleading.

Respondent 14: I believe  inflation  will  converge  to  target  this  year. Real  GDP  growth  and  unemployment  already  appear  to  have  converged  to  their  longer  run  trends.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Our  dual  mandate  goals  are  reached  or  exceeded  by  2018. However,  it  will take an  additional  year  or  two  to  work  through  the  secondary  dynamics  and  achieve  complete  convergence to our  longer-run  projections.

Respondent 17: We  estimate  the  unemployment  rate  to  be  at  its  longer-run  level  in  the current quarter,  and  project  that  it  will  remain  near  that  level  over  the  rest  of  the  forecast  horizon. However, our scenario analysis of labor flows and the historical behavior of the unemployment  rate  in long expansions  indicate  that  there  is  appreciable  probability  of  the  unemployment  rate  falling  below  our point  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  level  at  some  time  over  the  forecast  horizon.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to  be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the  FOMC  longer-run  objective. Under  these  conditions  and  with  the  resource  gap  anticipated to dissipate over the forecast horizon, we expect inflation as measured  by the PCE  deflator (on a quarterly  basis)  to  be  about  2%  by  the  end  of  2017.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  at  the  end  of  2017. Accordingly, the  projections  of  the  major  economic  variables  for  2018  are  at  their  longer-run  values.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

Respondent 15: Regarding  real  activity,  in  the  period  following  the  Global  Financial  Crisis,  it  has been  difficult  to  understand  whether  very  slow  GDP  growth  is  the  new  normal  or  a  temporary  eff ect of the crisis. Productivity  growth  has  been  very  weak  in  recent  years, but because  we  are  not sure why, it is difficult to say whether  this low productivity growth  will persist or whether  growth  will soon  revert  to  historical  norms. At  the  same  time,  the  global  economic  environment  (described  below) appears  quite  fragile  and  adds  to  the  uncertainty.

Regarding  inflation,  persistently  low  inflation  compensation  even  after  a  rebound  in  oil  prices,  along with  downward  movements  in  longer-run  inflation  expectations  in  household  surveys,  have  increased uncertainty  regarding  the  level  of  inflation  expectations  and  therefore  inflation  going  forward.

Respondent 16: Uncertainty about my  projection for economic  activity and inflation is similar to its average  level  over  the past  20 years. Inflation  remains  anchored  by  stable  longer-run  inflation expectations  at  the  FOMC's  stated  goal  of  2  percent.

Respondent 17: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. The  widths  of these intervals are roughly the same  as in our March SEP  submission. The  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity  forecasts  remain  wider  than  the  SEP standard,  as  was  the  case  in  March;  the  emergence  of  conflicting  signs  from  economic  releases  and  the potential  financial  disruptions  that  could  follow  the  British  referendum  on  EU  membership  point  to significant  uncertainty  about  the  real  activity  outlook. The  forecast  intervals  for  core  PCE  inflation still  appear  broadly  consistent  with  the  SEP  standard,  taking  rough  account  of  the  diff erences  between forecast  errors  for  overall  consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: I continue  to  show  a  balanced  risk  weighting  on  GDP  growth  and  the  unemployment rate. I'm comfortable with a balanced risk weighting given that my  projections have been on the conservative side of the professional consensus. However, I would note that my  recent discussions with  business  contacts  suggest  there's  been  some  softening  in  the  outlook  for  the  economy. I will be closely  watching  incoming  data  for  evidence  of  a  deterioration  in  growth.

Respondent 2: Risks  for output  and  inflation  are  weighted  to  the  downside  because  the  eff ective lower  bound  limits  the  ability  of  monetary  policy  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. The  downward  drift  of inflation  expectations  presents  an  additional  downside  risk  for  inflation. For  the  unemployment  rate, there  is a countervailing  risk  that  it  will  continue  to  fall  more  rapidly  than  expected  for  a  given  path for output,  as  it  has  over  the  past  several  years;  therefore  I  see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  broadly balanced.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: The  unemployment  rate  has  fallen  at  a  more  rapid  rate  than  expected  given  relatively  modest  real  GDP  growth. I am  anticipating  a  continued  decline  in  the  labor  force  participation rate, though  there  is  uncertainty  surrounding  the  path  and  the  implied  growth  of  the  labor  force. I see  a  risk  that  the  unemployment  rate  falls  further  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  average. Some measures  of  inflation  expectations  appear  to  be  moving  down  slightly,  which  raises  the  risk  of  a  timely return  to  our  target.

Respondent 6: Our  growth  forecast  is  driven  by  solid  household  sector  spending,  which,  in  turn, is propelled importantly  by further labor market  gains and some  overshooting  of full employment. However,  there  is a risk that the recent softer labor-market  data  could  be  signaling  less hiring momentum  than  we  have  assumed  and,  correspondingly,  a  less  powerful  self-reinforcing  jobs-consumption cycle  than  what  is  in  our  forecast. Furthermore,  our  business  contacts  appear  very  cautious  and  quite attentive to any bad news  they might  hear. Accordingly, it is much  easier to envision shocks that would  result  in  businesses  delaying  hiring  or  capital  expenditures  than  it  is  to  identify  developments that  would  cause  them  to  spend  more  robustly  than  in  our  projection. In sum,  we  see  the  balance  of risks  to  the  GDP  forecast  as  tilted  to  the  downside  and  those  to  the  unemployment  rate  projection  as tilted  to the  upside.

The  incoming  wage  and  price data have generally been positive, and support  our forecast that a return to target inflation may  finally be underway. The  downside  risk to our projection for real activity  imparts  some  downside  risk  to  the  inflation  outlook. More  important,  however,  is  the  fact  that despite  the  better  news  on  inflation,  financial  market  inflation  compensation  and  household  inflation expectations  remain  persistently  low. This  highlights  the  risk that longer-run  inflation  expectations may  have  slipped  below  2  percent;  at  a  minimum,  it  points  to  fragility  in  inflation  expectations. We do  not  see  major  off setting  upside  risks  to  prices. As  a  result,  we  feel  the  risks  to  our  inflation  forecast remain  tilted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 7: Core  PCE  Inflation  has  been  drifting  up  since  the  fourth  quarter  of  last  year. While part  of  the  increase  may  prove  transitory,  we  take  the  recent  data  as  indicating  that  the  risks  around the  inflation  forecast  are  becoming  more  balanced. We  continue  to  view  the  risks  to  the  unemployment rate forecast as tilted to the downside. The  unemployment  rate  at  4.7%  is  already  at  our  estimate of the  natural  rate. Although  it  is  likely  that  some  of  the  most  recent  decline  will  be  reversed  in  the near  term,  we  expect  GDP  growth  to  be  sufficient  to  push  unemployment  back  down  to  that  rate  and below  by  the  end  of  this  year. With  GDP  growth  projected  above  potential  over  the  forecast  horizon, there  is  the  risk  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  by  more  than  what  we  envisioning  in  our  baseline forecast  if higher  flows  into  the  labor  force  fail  to  materialize.

Respondent 8: N/A

Respondent 9: My  modal  forecast  is  generally  little  changed  since  March,  however,  the  policy  path associated  with  my  forecast  incorporates  a  slightly  more  gradual  pace  of  rate  increases. I continue  to view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

I expect  financial  market  volatility  to  increase  around  the  June  23  vote  in  the  U.K.  about  whether to leave the European  Union. If the U.K. votes to stay, I expect this volatility to be short-lived with no implication  for the medium-run  forecast. If the U.K.  votes to exit, this volatility could be longer  lasting;  if  it were  to  develop  into  a  more  general  tightening  of  credit  conditions,  it  would  have implications  for  the  outlook.

While  payroll  growth  slowed  in  May,  other  labor  market  indicators  do  not  suggest  deterioration. With  the  economy  at  or  near full employment,  I  would  expect  to  see  payroll growth  slow  from  the pace seen earlier in the year. Thus, I do not view the disappointing  May  employment  report  as  a significant  downside  risk.

Inflation risks are balanced. Oil prices remain  low  relative  to their levels from  several  years ago but have been  trending  up, putting some  upward  pressure  on  recent  inflation readings. The  dollar has  shown  signs  of  stabilizing,  which  should  help  to  reduce  the  downward  pressure  on  inflation  from imported  goods  prices. I view  inflation  expectations  as  being  relatively  stable,  but  the  small  downward movements  in  some  of  the  survey  measures  bear  watching. Should  inflation  expectations  show  a  more significant downward  move, this would pose a downside risk to my inflation projection. On the other hand, too slow a withdrawal of monetary policy accommodation  and continued declines in unemployment  have  the  potential  to  create  upside  risks  to  inflation  over  the  medium  run.

Risks to financial stability from very low interest rates appear  to be contained  so far. I expect them  to  remain  so  if  we  gradually  normalize  interest  rates. However,  a  failure  to  do  so  increases  these risks.

Respondent 10: N/A

Respondent 11: Three  considerations  lead  me  to  believe  that  the  risks  to  outlook  for  real  activity are  tilted  to  the  downside. First,  the  disappointing  May  labor  market  report,  together  with  the  recent weakness  in  business  investment,  may  signal  that  domestic  demand  is  proving  to  be  less  resilient  than I had  thought. Second,  although  investor  worries  about  global  financial  and  economic  conditions  have diminished  since  the  March  meeting,  some  concerns  (e.g.,  Brexit)  remain. Finally,  with  interest  rates still so low,  monetary  policy  is  less  able  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks  than  to  favorable  ones  because of the ZLB.  I  also judge  that  the  risks  to the inflation  outlook  are  tilted  to the downside  because  of low  readings  on  inflation  compensation  and  some  survey  measures  of  expected  inflation,  as  well  as  the downside  risks  to  real  activity.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: We  are  answering  this  question  variable  by  variable  as they  may  be  aff ected by important  regime  shifts.

With  respect  to  GDP  growth,  the  current  productivity  growth  regime  is  low. A  higher  productivity growth  regime  is  possible,  but  we  see  no  reason  to  predict  a  switch  at  this  time. Such  a  possible  switch, however,  leads  us  to  weight  to  the  upside  more  rapid  GDP  growth.

Concerning  unemployment,  the  current  unemployment  rate  of  4.7%  is  near  the  low  for  an  economic expansion. If a recession  were  to  occur,  the  unemployment  rate  would  rise  substantially. We  have  no compelling  reason  to  predict  a  recession  during  the  forecast  horizon. However,  such  a  possibility  leads us to weight  to  the  upside  a  higher  unemployment  rate.

For  core  PCE  inflation,  we  place  negligible  weight  on  the  prospects  of  Phillips  Curve  eff ects. There is, however,  a  risk  that  Phillips  Curve  eff ects  reassert  themselves  and  that  inflation  moves  higher. It is also possible  that inflation expectations,  which  are  currently  low, could  drift higher  and  threaten to become  unanchored.  Thus,  we  see  the  risks  on  this  variable  to  be  weighted  to  the  upside.

For PCE  inflation,  the  risks are the same  as for core PCE  inflation. In addition, much  depends on the behavior  of  energy  and  other  commodity  prices. Overall,  we  see the risks as weighted  to  the upside.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: The  global  economic  environment  is  quite  fragile. Economic  growth  in  advanced economies  remains  slow and heavily reliant on extraordinary amounts  of unconventional  monetary policy. In  a number  of  important  advanced  economies  (including  the  U.S.),  the  ability  of  conventional and  unconventional  monetary  policies  to  adequately  respond  to  adverse  shocks  appears  constrained, while the willingness  to use fiscal policy in these countries  to respond  to  adverse  developments  also appears  limited. At the same  time,  emerging  market  economies  are  experiencing  a  sharp  slowing  in growth  that  could  have  second  round  aff ects  as  households,  businesses  and  financial  institutions  adjust to a slower  pace  of  growth.

Persistently low inflation over the recovery, combined with signs of falling longer-run inflation expectations,  suggest  the  risks  to  inflation  are  to  the  downside.

Respondent 16: Risks  to  economic  activity  appear  broadly  balanced. We  have  essentially  reached our objective  of maximum  sustainable  employment  according  to  a  variety  of  labor  market  measures and  will  likely  persistently  overshoot  full  employment  over  the  next  few  years. The  main  uncertainty is by how  much  and  for how  long. Consumer  spending  remains  on  track  for  moderate  growth  this year,  bolstered  by  a  stronger  labor  market. Fiscal  policy  is  set  to  be  accommodative  in  the  near  term. There  are  upside  risks  to  consumer  and  housing  expenditure.

Growth  in  foreign  economies  appears  to  have  firmed  somewhat  in  recent  months,  but  risks  to  the foreign  outlook  remain. For  example,  the  possibility  of  Brexit  poses  some  downside  risk.

Although  the  eff ective  lower  bound  constrains  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks,  this  constraint  is  becoming  less  important  given  that  appropriate  policy  calls  for  steady  increases  in  the  target funds  rate  over  the  next  two  years.

Inflation risks are also balanced  around  an inflation path that is a little higher than in March. Ongoing reduction in economic slack supports the continued movement  of inflation to 2 percent. Disinflationary  pressures  from  abroad-namely  previous  strengthening  of  the  dollar  and  declines  in  oil prices-are  dissipating  or  even  reversing  (in  the  case  of  energy  prices).

Respondent 17: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  diff erence  between  the  central  projection  and the expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Given  the  continued  softness  in  business fixed investment  and  its  implications  for  future  output,  the  very  low  levels  of  sovereign  yields  across the advanced  foreign  economies,  and  a  still-weak  foreign economic  outlook,  we  see  the risks to real

activity  as  weighted  to  the  downside  at  all  horizons. The  notable  slowdown  in  job  growth  over  the  past couple  of  months  shown  in  the  May  labor  market  report  also  has  increased  the  uncertainty  around  our forecast  and  contributes  to  the  downward  balance  of  risks  to  real  activity. Our  risk assessment  also reflects  the  constrained  policy  space  for  reacting  to  negative  shocks  to  real  economic  activity,  as  well as to other  downside  scenarios  such  as  'Brexit'  and  risks  associated  with  fundamental  imbalances  in China  and  other  major  economies.

Inflation  risks  are  nearly  balanced  for  2016  -  17  and  modestly  skewed  to  the  downside  for  2018;  we assess  that  they  are  overall  roughly  balanced. Core  measures  of  inflation  have  firmed  in  the  first  half of the  year  and  we  project  a  slightly  faster  convergence  to  objective  relative  to  the  March  projections; even though market-based  longer-term  inflation compensation  and  survey measures  of longer-term household  inflation  expectations  remain  at  fairly  low  levels,  various  measures  of  underlying  inflation, including  our  in-house  measures,  as  well  as  commodity  and  import  prices  have  firmed  a  bit  over  the past  several  months,  dissipating  some  of  the  downside  risks  to  inflation  since  March.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  informing  your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projection  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation  for  that  year  is  close  to  or  above  2  percent,  and  your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: Weak  longer-term  U.S.  growth  prospects  have  combined  with  an  expanded  worldwide  demand  for  safe  assets  and  a  weak  and  uncertain  economic  and  political  outlook  abroad  to  put downward  pressure  on  the  neutral  real  federal  funds  rate. The  implication  is  that  monetary  policy  is substantially  less  accommodative  at  current  policy  settings  than  might  have  been  expected.

Moreover,  global  financial  integration  means  that  financial-market  conditions  are  likely  to  be  quite sensitive to increases in the level of U.S. real short-term  rates relative to foreign rates. As long as the foreign economic  outlook  remains  subdued,  a  shallow  path  for  U.S.  interest  rates  is  likely  to be appropriate.

A lower and  flatter policy path  keeps  us closer to the zero bound  for longer. Downside  risks  to the outlook  may,  therefore,  have  increased-especially  since  there  is  little  chance  of  fiscal  stimulus  to counter  unexpected  weakness  in  demand,  particularly  in  this  election  year.

On  the  other  hand,  labor-market  slack  continues  to  diminish,  and  core  inflation  measures  continue to drift upward. If international  uncertainties  were  to  suddenly  abate, we could  find ourselves  very quickly overshooting  our  full-employment  and  price-stability  objectives. I view the risk of this sort of shock as somewhat  less likely: International weakness and uncertainties will be with us for an extended  period.

I've shifted my estimate of the longer-run normal policy rate slightly downward, from 3.25 to 3.0  percent,  based  on  my  sense  that  longer-run  real  growth  prospects  have  been  adversely  aff ected  by aging  demographics  in  developed  countries,  high  levels  of  debt  to  GDP  in  these  countries,  and  sluggish trend  productivity  growth. In this context, I believe that global demand  for  safe  assets  will remain elevated  for  quite  a  while.

Respondent 2: The  labor  market,  as  measured  by  the  unemployment  rate,  is  essentially  back  to normal. But  secondary  measures  of  slack,  such  as  the  fraction  of the labor force working  part  time for economic  reasons,  remain  elevated,  and  wage  growth  remains  subdued. In addition, the neutral funds  rate  is  expected  to  rise  from  its  currently  low  level,  but  that  adjustment  is  likely  to  take  several years. As  a result,  it is appropriate  to  raise  rates  gradually.

Respondent 3: My  forecast  is  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  be  below  its  long-run  level  and  that inflation will reach 2 percent  in 2018, while the appropriate  level of the federal funds rate will still

be  slightly  below  its  long-run  level. In my  view,  policy  will  need  to  remain  accommodative  to  ensure that  inflation  remains  near  the  FOMC's  objective  over  the  longer-term  in  the  face  of  weak  demand.

Respondent 4: The  low  level of the federal funds  rate has been  necessary  to move  inflation and unemployment  back  toward  our  targets. This  is  likely  because  r*  is  temporarily  depressed  by  the  low rates  of productivity  and  other  factors. Those  factors  are  likely  to  dissipate  only  gradually,  requiring a low  federal  funds  rate  in  order  to  deliver  an  appropriate  amount  of  accommodation.

Respondent 5: My  projection  for  the  appropriate  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  reflects  my  view that  policy  should  adjust  at  a  more  gradual  pace  than  has  been  typical  in  past  liftoff  scenarios  given low  productivity  growth,  declining  labor  force  participation,  and  inflation  that  has  been  running  below target  for  some  time.

ffer Respondent 6: Our  assumed  appropriate  policy  path  has  the  funds  rate  increasing  25  bps  once  in 2016, 3 times  in 2017, and  4 times  in 2018. We  also  assume  the  Committee  strongly  communicates that  future  rate  hikes  will  depend  on  increasing  confidence  in  achieving  its  employment  and  inflation objectives. The weak first-quarter GDP  data and slowdown in the labor market this spring are reminders  that  the  economy  still faces substantial  headwinds  and  that  the  equilibrium  real  interest rate is still quite low. The current level of the funds rate likely is providing only a modicum  of accommodation. We assume, however, that communication of a state-dependent path for future rates, and  the  likely shallow  nature  of  this  path,  can  deliver  the  degree  of  accommodation  necessary to achieve our baseline projections for output and inflation. Furthermore, policy communication should indicate that we are aiming  to achieve our inflation target symmetrically, a strategy which, by definition, calls for a policy path that allows for a strong probability of modestly  overshooting 2 percent  inflation. Furthermore,  risk  management  considerations  continue  to  argue  in  favor  of  low rates in order to provide an extra boost to aggregate demand  as  a bu against future downside shocks  to activity and the asymmetric  risks  we  see to the inflation forecast. Indeed, the continued low  readings  on  financial  market  inflation  compensation  and  survey  measures  of  expectations  suggest that  we  should  be  putting  more  than  trivial  weight  on  this  latter  risk.

Respondent 7: We  have  revised  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds rate  further  down,  from  3.25  to  3.0  percent. The  revision  stems  from  the  fact  that  current  estimates of the  natural  rate  of  interest  continue  to  remain  at  low  levels.

Respondent 8: My  projection  for  the  federal  funds  rate  is  informed  by  a  simple  policy  rule  with  a gradual  rise  in  the  short-run  equilibrium  rate,  similar  to  that  used  in  the  current  Tealbook. I lowered my  federal  funds  rate  path  taking  into  account  a  25  basis  point  reduction  in  the  long-run  value  of  the federal  funds  rate  and  elevated  uncertainty  regarding  the  underlying  pace  of  potential  GDP  growth. My  estimate  of  the  longer-run  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  was  reduced  primarily  in  response  to  my lower  assumed  growth  rate  of  potential  GDP.

Respondent 9: The  trajectory  of  my  forecast  is  similar  to  my  March  forecast  but  I  have  flattened my  policy  path  somewhat. I project  that  growth  will  be  slightly  above  my  estimate  of  the  longer  run trend. I believe  that  the  economy  is  basically  at  our  goal  of  full  employment. While  certain  measures of underemployment,  like  the  number  of  part-time  workers  who  would  rather  work  full-time,  remain  at higher  levels  than  before  the  recession,  I  believe  that  targeted  programs  rather  than  monetary  policy would  be  more  eff ective in addressing  those  issues. I expect  growth  to  be strong  enough  to  lead to further gains in employment  and  declines  in  the  unemployment  rate,  although  I  expect  the  pace  of improvement  in both to slow. In this scenario, labor compensation  measures  will eventually firm, in line with anecdotal  reports of increasing wage  pressures  across a range of skill groups. I expect

the eff ects on inflation of previous  declines in oil prices and  the strengthening  of the dollar to fade over time; the recent rebound  in  oil prices has put upward  pressure  on  headline  inflation. I expect inflation expectations to remain reasonably stable, but am monitoring the recent softer readings. Reasonably  stable  inflation  expectations  coupled  with  continued  improvement  in  labor  markets  and ongoing  economic  growth  make  me  reasonably  confident  that  inflation  will  move  back  to  our  goal  of 2 percent  over  the  medium  run. I project  this  to  be  by  the  end  of  2017.

Given  that  monetary  policy  aff ects  the  economy  with  a  lag,  I  believe  appropriate  monetary  policy should  reflect  both  actual  and  projected  progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Given  the  outlook, I believe it will be appropriate  for the FOMC  to  move  rates  up  gradually  throughout  the forecast horizon,  with  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  2018  near,  but  not  quite  back  to,  its  longer-run  level of 3.25  percent. Forestalling  rate  increases  for  too  long  for  fear  of  risks  to  and  uncertainty  around  the outlook  increases  the  risks  to  financial  stability  and  has  the  potential  to  require  sharper  rate  increases in the  future,  which  poses  risks  to  the  outlook.

Respondent 10: At  least  so  long  as  growth  remains  no  better  than  slightly  above  trend  and  inflation is  not  fairly  convincingly  moving  towards  2%  a  key  consideration  in  determining  the  appropriate  path  of monetary  policy  remains  the  asymmetric  nature  of  the  Committee's  range  of  policy  instruments. The nearly  certain  need  for  resort  to  unconventional  policy  instruments  in  the  event  that  an  adverse  shock were  to  threaten  the  continued  moderation  expansion  -  or  in  the  event  growth  decelerates  significantly even  in  the  absence  of  such  a  shock  -  argues  strongly  for  maintaining  current  levels  of  accommodation so as to increase,  even  if  only  marginally,  the  economy's  resilience  to  such  a  shock. With  an  external environment  that  is  still somewhat  disinflationary,  with  more  downside  than  upside  risks  to  growth abroad,  with  very  accommodative  monetary  policies  in  most  other  mature  economies,  and  with  the resulting  risk  of  another  period  of  dollar  strengthening  as  rates  in  the  U.S.  rise,  considerable  caution is warranted.

The  very  disappointing  May  jobs  report,  though  potentially  an  anomaly,  is  an  additional  reason for  caution. Even  if  subsequent  reports  reveal  a  steadier  pace  of  job  growth  and  improvement  in  other labor market  indicators, the May  report  at the least suggests that the labor market  is not roaring ahead,  and  that  there  would  be  ample  time  to  react  in  a  measured  way  if  and  as  further  tightening leads  to  the  prospect  of  inflation  rising  above  target  in  a  non-transitory  fashion.

Respondent 11: Several  factors  continue  to  inform  my  judgment  that,  given  the  conditions  of  my baseline  forecast,  the  federal  funds  rate  should  rise  only  gradually  and  will  likely  need  to  remain  well below  its  longer-run  value  for  a  number  of  years. First,  monetary  policy  needs  to  remain  accommodative for some  time  longer  in  order  to  promote  further  labor  market  improvement. Such  improvement is desirable not only because  some  slack still remains  importantly, I view the May  decline  in the unemployment  rate  as likely to be reversed in coming  reports -but also to speed the return to 2 percent  inflation. Second,  the  neutral  federal  funds  rate  is  quite  low  at  the  moment  but  I  anticipate that  it  will  rise  over  time  as  various  headwinds  slowly  fade  and  QE-related  downward  pressure  on  term premiums  ebbs. (The  fading  of  headwinds  is  assumed  to  occur  more  slowly  in  my  current  projection than  it did  in March.) And  third,  given  that  our  ability  to  provide  accommodation  in  the  event  of  a downturn  is  currently  much  less  than  our  ability  to  tighten  should  conditions  turn  out  to  unexpectedly strong,  it  is appropriate  to  proceed  cautiously  when  tightening.

Respondent 12: My  judgment  regarding  the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  predicated on  promoting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  price  stability. My  forecast  calls  for  the  unemployment rate to be below its longer-run level and inflation close to two percent in 2016. Yet I view the appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  to  be  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  level  in  2016  and 2017. In my  view  a  gradual  path  of  the  funds  rate  promotes  economic  and  financial  stability.

Respondent 13: We  think  all  variables  have  essentially  converged  to  a  regime  characterized  by  low productivity  growth  and  a  low  real  interest  rate  on short-term  government  debt. Because  there  are multiple  possible  medium  term  outcomes,  we  cannot  provide  a  single  set  of  longer-run  projections.

Respondent 14: I believe that it is risky to keep the real funds rate well below zero with the unemployment  rate  below  the  natural  rate,  real  GDP  growing  at  potential,  and  inflation  increasing. Also,  we  need  to  begin  to  reduce  the  size  of  our  balance  sheet  in  the  very  near  future.

Respondent 15: The  neutral  rate  is  currently  very  low,  and  I  expect  it  to  rise  only  gradually  to  a longer-run  level  that  is  also  quite  low  by  historical  standards. In addition,  downside  risks  to  activity and  inflation  make  the  appropriate  policy  path  lower  over  the  medium  term  than  it  would  be  if  risks were  balanced.

In response to extremely weak readings on productivity growth in recent years, I lowered my estimate  of  the  longer-run  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  by  25  basis  points.

Respondent 16: The  labor  market  is  essentially  at  full  employment  according  to  various  measures of slack. Labor markets will continue to tighten over the next year-with the unemployment  rate falling well below  its  natural  rate-before  gradually  returning  to  full  employment. On  inflation,  transitory factors have influenced previous inflation readings. Since then, there has been some  firming in underlying  price  pressures. I expect  inflation to rise gradually  and  reach  our  2 percent  objective by the end of 2017, and  to overshoot  by  one-tenth  during  2018, before falling back  to 2 percent  in 2019. Underpinning  this  path  is  my  view  that  the  economy  will  continue  to  improve,  causing  it  to  run slightly above  its potential. Overshooting  in  unemployment  and  output,  paired  with  fading  eff ects from  the  dollar  appreciation  and  a  drop  in  oil  prices  will  push  inflation  up  over  the  next  year.

My  assessment  of  appropriate  policy  is  generally  informed  by  looking  at  simple  rules  that  adjust for the zero lower bound, as well as by my  expectations of, and uncertainty about, the costs and benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

My  fed  funds  path  through  the  end  of  2016  remains  flatter  than  some  simple  rules  would  suggest. This is based on the following: The  economy  continues  to  face headwinds  in 2016, including weak growth  abroad,  and  lingering  eff ects  of  the  recent  appreciation  of  the  dollar. In  addition,  I  have  revised down  my  estimate  of  the  economy's  potential  growth  rate,  which  I  expect  to  be  lower  in  the  long  run. These  factors  continue  to  depress  both  the  short- and  the  long-term  equilibrium  real  interest  rate.

Respondent 17: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy are the current  state of the economy,  our  central  economic  outlook,  and  our  balance  of  risks around the central outlook. The pace of normalization also will depend on how overall financial conditions  respond  to  our  policy  actions.

Currently,  despite  some  firming  in  our  inflation  outlook,  the  still-significant  uncertainty  surrounding the outlook, the continued downside risks to the outlook, and a lower projected path of the short-term  neutral  rate  all  point  to  a  slightly  more  gradual  pace  of  normalization  than  in  our  March submission  in  order  to  support  our  modal  economic  projections.

Our  current  projection  of  the  appropriate  path  has  the  target  FFR  ranges  at  the  end  of  2016,  2017, and  2018  at 3 4 / -1%,  1 1 4 / -1 1 2 / %,  and  2 - 2 1 4 / %  respectively;  the  projected  ranges  for  2017  and 2018  are  each  25bps  below  the  corresponding  ranges  in  our  March  submission. We  believe  this  slight downward  adjustment  of  the  policy  path  is necessary  to provide some  additional  insurance  against the  restraining  forces  on  the  U.S.  economy  as  well  as  to  account  for  the  uncertainty  about  the  neutral rate. Importantly,  a  flatter  policy  path  is  an  appropriate  response  to  the  loosening  of  the  policy  stance in the  advanced  foreign  economies  in  order  to  prevent  an  appreciation  of  the  dollar  that  would  unduly tighten  financial  conditions. Easier  monetary  policy  globally,  coupled  with  higher  commodity  prices, suggests  a  somewhat  faster  convergence  of  inflation  to  objective,  which  we  see  as  appropriate.

Another factor informing our assessment of the appropriate policy path is our estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate  over  the  longer  run  (r*), which  is now  in the range  of 1 2 / -2 1 2 / %. We  have  lowered  the  upper  part  of  the  range  by  50  bps  because  of  more  evidence  of  greater risk aversion  and  a  desire  for  higher  savings  globally,  which  suggests  that  it  is  very  unlikely  that  the equilibrium  real  short-term  rate  could  be  as  high  as  3%  over  the  next  5-6  years. Adding  the  objective for  inflation  (2%)  gives  our  estimated  range  for  the  nominal  equilibrium  rate  as  2 1 2 / - 4 1 2 / %. We  assess that  the  equilibrium  rate  is  likely  to  be  in  the  lower  half  of  the  latter  range  due  to  the  combination  of subdued  global  growth  and  low  longer-term  sovereign  yields  over  the  last  few  years  that  we  expect  to continue. These  factors  lead  to  our  point  estimate  of  3%  in  the  response  to  question  3(a).

We  assume  that  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that  the exit  from  the  eff ective  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed to  be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  sometime  in  2018.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: My  projections envision the U.S. economy making a successful transition from above-trend growth to sustainable growth. Such transitions have always been difficult, and given greater  international  connectedness,  divergent  and  uncertain  global  economic  trends  promise  to  make the  current  transition  more  than  usually  challenging  for  Federal  Reserve  policymakers.

Because  of the lags in inflation's response to the real economy, and in the response of the real economy  to  monetary  policy,  it  is  essential  that  the  process  of  removing  policy  accommodation  begin before  full employment  and  price  stability  are  fully  achieved. The  main  difficulty  will be accurately assessing  the  degree  of  accommodation  implied  by  a  given  funds-rate  path.

Respondent 2: The  improvement  in  secondary  measures  of  labor  market  slack  we  had  seen  earlier has slowed. Because  room  remains  to  further  reduce  slack, inflation continues  to run low and it is likely  to  be  several  years  before  it  returns  to  target. The  continued  low  level  of  inflation,  the  benefits  to the  economy  of  allowing  further  improvement  in  the  labor  market,  weakness  in  foreign  economies,  and potential  risks  to  the  US  economy  from  international  policy  divergence  all  suggest  a  gradual  approach to normalizing  the  stance  of  monetary  policy.

Respondent 3: Weak  global  demand,  weak  business  fixed  investment,  and  low  productivity  growth should  all  mean  that  GDP  growth  will  continue  to  remain  close  to  2  percent  over  the  forecast  horizon. While  I do not believe that momentum  in  employment  growth  has  sharply  decelerated, the recent monthly employment  reports have generated increased uncertainty about what trend employment growth  and  underlying  demand  will  be  going  forward.

Respondent 4: Belief  that  the  real  economy,  and  expected  technical  progress,  will  do  better  as  we approach  our  policy  targets.

Respondent 5: I expect  output  growth  to  accelerate  from  the  below-trend  pace  over  the  last  two quarters  as  the  headwinds  that  have  been  depressing  growth  recede,  Over  the  medium  term,  output grows  at  close  to  my  longer-run  trend  pace  of  2.2  percent. I do  not  take  much  signal  from  the  recent weak  labor market  data and expect that employment  growth  will  rebound  and  the unemployment rate  will  edge  down  as  the  labor  force  participation  rate  declines  further. Headline  inflation  has  been held  down  by  falling  energy  prices,  but  as  oil  prices  stabilize  and  dollar  appreciation  wanes,  inflation will  rise  and  run  at  a  pace  close  to  the  Committee's  2  percent  target  in  2017  and  2018. With  inflation and  output  growth  running  near  my  longer-term  trends,  monetary  policy  becomes  less  accommodative over  the  forecast  horizon,  and  the  federal  funds  rate  reaches  2.9  percent  by  the  end  of  2018.

Respondent 6: Accommodative  monetary  policy,  stable  financial  conditions,  a  healthy  labor  market, and  improved  household  and  business  balance  sheets  should  allow  for  solid  consumer-led  growth in domestic  private  demand. In addition,  we  assume  little  change  in  the  dollar  going  forward,  and  so project  that  the  drag  from  net  exports  will  wane  as  we  move  through  the  projection  period.

The  factors  supporting  activity  are  sufficient  to  generate  growth  moderately  above  potential  over the next three years. We  assume  that  resource gaps will be closed by late this year; although  the unemployment  rate  has  already  fallen  a  bit  below  our  estimate  of  the  current  natural  rate,  we  think it will  take  a  bit  longer  to  close  the  gaps  we  still  see  remaining  in  some  other  labor  market  indicators. We  assume  growth  will  be  strong  enough  to  push  the  unemployment  rate  down  to  4.5  percent  by  the

end  of  the  projection  period,  about  a  quarter  percentage  point  below  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate then.

As  it  has  for  some  time,  our  forecast  for  rising  inflation  relies  on  reductions  (and  some  overshooting) in resource  slack,  stabilization  of  the  dollar,  some  upward  movement  in  energy  prices,  and  a  lift  from inflationary  expectations  firmly  established  at  2  percent. All  but  the  latter  seem  to  be  in  train  now. We assume  that  a  quite  shallow  path  for  policy  normalization  and  a  strongly  communicated  commitment to a symmetric  2  percent  inflation  target  will  solidify  inflation  expectations  and  allow  them  to  assert an  upward  pull  on  actual  inflation. If this does  not  occur,  then  we  do  not  see  the  upward  force  from other  factors  as  being  adequate  to  bring  inflation  close  to  target  over  the  forecast  period.

As  to  sources  of  uncertainty,  international  developments,  their  influence  on  financial  markets,  and the spillovers to household and business confidence are likely to cloud the forecast for growth for some  time  to  come. With  regard  to  inflation, discerning  the  linkages  between  Fed  policy  (including communications), inflation expectations, and actual inflation are key uncertainties. Risks to the forecasts  were  discussed  in  the  risks  and  uncertainty  section.

Respondent 7: Information  about  economic  activity  so far this year has been somewhat  mixed, with  labor  market  and  spending  data  providing  conflicting  signals. The  conflicting  signals  could  be  due to  the  presence  of  residual  seasonality  in  the  GDP  series,  which  works  in  the  direction  of  understating growth  in  the first quarter  of the calendar  year, and  overstating  it in the remaining  quarters. Still, abstracting  from  potential  issues  with  the  quarterly  pattern  of  GDP  growth  as  currently  reported  by the  BEA,  the  pace  of  economic  activity  appears  to  be  roughly  in  line  with  expectations,  with  growth modestly  above  potential. Monthly  gains  in  payrolls  have  declined  somewhat  recently,  but  on  average remain  above our estimate of trend growth  in the labor force. Fundamentals  for  consumption  are favorable, and  recent data are consistent with household  spending  stepping  up  noticeably  from  the rather  subdued  pace  witnessed  earlier  this  year. Business  investment  has  been  disappointing,  but  the recent  decline  in corporate  bond  spreads  after  the  increase  seen  in  2015  and  earlier  this  year  should support  modest  additions  to  capital  going  forward. The  global  economy  remains  a  source  of  potential weakness,  with  the  possibility  of  a  sharper  slowdown  in  China  and  the  risks  associated  with  the  U.K. referendum  later  this  month  on  staying  or  leaving  the  European  Union. Nevertheless,  foreign  GDP growth  so  far  this  year  has  been  in  line  with  expectations.

With the stance of monetary  policy remaining accommodative, we continue to project growth slightly  above  potential  over  the  forecast  horizon. This  pace  of  growth  should  yield  further  declines  in the  unemployment  rate. In  our  baseline  forecast,  the  cyclical  improvement  in  labor  force  participation coupled  with  a  gradual  removal  of  policy  accommodation  generate  only  a  modest  overshooting  of  full employment  by  the  end  of  2018. The  possibility  that  the  unemployment  rate  will  fall  by  more  than what  we  are currently envisioning  is of particular concern. Past experience  suggests  that the more the economy  overshoots  full  employment,  the  higher  the  likelihood  that  the  economy  will  fall  into  a recession  as monetary  policy  tightens. While  monetary  policy  should  probe  for  better  labor  market outcomes,  the  potential  costs  of  this  strategy  should  not  be  ignored. The  projected  path  for  the  federal funds  rate  in  this  forecast  provides  the  opportunity  to  probe  in  a  cautious  manner,  but  a  faster  pace  of tightening  will  be  required  should  labor  market  pressures  build  more  rapidly  than  expected. With  the unemployment  rate  projected  to  stay  close  to  its  natural  level,  inflation  eventually  reaches  2  percent.

We  view  the  risks  to  the  growth  outlook  as  roughly  balanced. As  already  mentioned,  downside  risks emanating  from  abroad  are  still  present. The  expected  tightening  of  U.S.  monetary  policy  could  also entail  a  stronger  dollar  than  what  we  are  currently  envisioning. On  the  upside,  the  increase  in  the  pace of growth  of  final sales to domestic  purchasers  could  signal  a  stronger-than-expected  acceleration  in activity. On  the  inflation  side,  while  continue  to  see  risks  associated  with  the  possibility  that  long-run inflation  expectations  are  anchored  at  a  level  below  the  2  percent  target,  we  take  the  recent  progress towards  the  inflation  target  as  signaling  that  the  risks  around  the  inflation  outlook  are  becoming  more balanced.

Respondent 8: My outlook consists of modest above-trend growth over the next few years, a further, small reduction  of labor market  slack, and  inflation that converges  to target by the end of next  year.

Growth  over  the  medium  term  is  primarily  driven  by  a  sustained  pace  of  consumption  growth  and a strengthening  in investment  growth. The  growth  of domestic  demand  is  supported  by  continued firming  in  the  labor  market  and  growth  of  household  income.

The  risks  to  my  growth  outlook  remain  weighted  to  the  downside. My  current  outlook  is  predicated on moderately  stronger  growth  in  business  fixed  investment,  an  assumption  somewhat  at  odds  with recent  trends. A  recent  slowing  in  jobs  growth  and  a  softening  in  corporate  profits  also  point  to  more near-term  weakness  in  the  growth  outlook  than  I  am  currently  projecting.

The  risks  to  my  inflation  outlook  are  also  tilted  to  the  downside,  owing  mostly  to  the  potential  for slower  growth  in  the  economy.

Respondent 9: The fundamentals supporting the expansion remain favorable, including highly accommodative  monetary  policy,  household  balance  sheets  that  have  improved  greatly  since  the  recession,  continued  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  low  oil  prices. Consistent  with  the  data,  business contacts  report  further  tightening  in  labor  markets, more  widespread  difficulties  in  finding  qualified workers, and some  increased  wage  pressures  across a range of skill groups  and occupations. While global growth  prospects  remain  subdued,  monetary  policy  globally  is  highly  accommodative,  which should  promote  stronger  growth  and  higher  inflation  rates  abroad. Overall,  I  expect  growth  to  be  at or slightly above  trend  in  the  U.S., which  will  support  further  improvement  in  labor  markets. With the labor  market  already  near  full  employment,  I  expect  a  slowing  in  the  pace  of  labor  market  gains compared  to  last  year  and  earlier  this  year. By  the  end  of 2018, I project  that  the  economy  will  be near  its steady  state.

Inflation  rates  have  been  gradually  moving  up  as  the  eff ects  of  past  declines  in  oil  and  commodity prices, and  appreciation  of the dollar, work  themselves  through. This path  is consistent  with what the  FOMC  has  been  expecting. I continue  to  monitor  inflation  expectations,  especially  in  light  of  the recent softer readings. At this point, I judge inflation expectations  as reasonably  anchored. If this continues,  then  continued  output  growth  and  improvement  in  labor  markets,  and  stabilizing  oil  prices and  the  dollar,  are  consistent  with  inflation  moving  back  to  the  2  percent  longer-run  objective  by  the end  of  2017. As  the  expansion  continues  and  labor  markets  continue  to  improve,  I  expect  wage  growth will pick  up  as  well;  anecdotal  information  suggests  this  is  beginning  to  occur.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described  above,  while  there  are  a number  of  risks  to my  outlook,  I view  them  as  broadly  balanced for both  the  real  economy  and  inflation.

Respondent 10: My  baseline  expectations  have  slipped  just a bit since the March  SEP  -  now  I would  characterize  that  baseline  expectation  as  for  growth  right  around  trend  for  this  year  and  next, with  somewhat  slower  improvement  in  labor  markets. The  more  significant  issue  is  around  risks,  which I now  find  even  more  weighted  to  the  downside. Putting  aside  any  potential  risk  from  Brexit,  external risks seem  still moderately  to  the  downside,  though  less  in  the  next  quarter  or  two  than  thereafter. The  change  is  in  my  assessment  of  domestic  risks,  which  in  the  March  SEP  I  had  regarded  as  roughly balanced. While  I continue  to believe there are some  upside  domestic  risks,  recent  developments  in the  labor  market  and  with  business  investment  suggest  that  there  is  some  increased  possibility  of  more slowing  of  growth  than  in  my  baseline  forecast.

Respondent 11: My  outlook  for  real  activity  assumes  that  increases  in  the  underlying  strength  of the  economy  will  enable  real  GDP  to  grow  at  a  pace  slightly  faster  than  potential  on  average  even  as the federal funds  rate  rises gradually,  thereby  generating  further  improvements  in  the  labor  market. This increasing strength partly reflects a gradual diminution of the drag on net exports from the

dollar and  foreign  growth,  continuing  recovery  of  the  housing  market,  somewhat  easier  fiscal  policy, modestly  faster  productivity  growth,  and  a  bottoming  out  of  the  contraction  in  oil  drilling. A  tighter labor  market  (including  a  modest  undershooting  of  the  longer-run  sustainable  rate  of  unemployment), combined  with  a  fading  of  the  transitory  inflation  eff ects of dollar appreciation  and  lower  oil  prices, should  enable  headline  inflation  to  move  back  to  2  percent  by  2019.

The  key  risk to this forecast is that the headwinds  currently  restraining  real  activity  will  fail to dissipate as rapidly or by as much  as I anticipate; I am  particularly concerned  by  risks emanating from  abroad. I am  also  concerned  that  the  return  to  2  percent  inflation  may  prove  to  be  slower  than I anticipate, reflecting several risks-the potential for further dollar appreciation  and declines in oil prices  if  global  growth  worsens;  the  possibility  that  long-run  inflation  expectations  may  be  starting  to slip; and  the  possibility  that  labor  market  slack  is  somewhat  greater  than  I  estimate.

Respondent 12: My  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  is  characterized  by  above-trend  growth  in  2017 and  2018. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth  from  rising  employment  and  wages,  past gains in household  wealth, and accommodative  financing  conditions. Growth  is likely to slow over time  as  the  economy  operates  at  full  capacity. I see the  unemployment  gap  as  essentially  closed  after the  rapid  reduction  in  economic  slack  in  the  past  few  years. My  inflation  outlook  projects  an  inflation rate near 2 percent  from  2016  onwards,  an  acceleration  from  the  inflation  rate  in 2015  that reflects improving  labor  market  conditions  and  the  dissipating  eff ects of past dollar appreciation  and  lower energy  prices.

I view  uncertainty  surrounding  my  projection  of  the  unemployment  rate  as  higher  than  levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years, primarily  due  to  the unusual  volatility  in the labor force participation  rate. I also view  uncertainty  around  my  projection  of  the  PCE  inflation  rate  as  higher  than levels  of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  reflecting  the  volatility  in  oil  prices  in  recent  years.

I see the risks to economic  growth,  inflation,  and  unemployment  as  broadly  balanced. Downside risks  for  real  GDP  growth,  stemming  from  concerns  about  corporate  profits  and  the  pace  of  growth  of productivity  and  the  labor  force,  are  roughly  off set  by  the  strength  of  households'  balance  sheets,  rising wages,  consumer  confidence,  and  the  strength  of  residential  investment,  which  represent  upside  risks for  consumer  spending  and  housing  activity. Regarding  inflation  risks,  while  the  potential  for  slippage of longer-run  inflation  expectations  is  a  downside  risk,  an  economy  operating  at  full  employment  with near-zero  interest  rates  and  the  potential  for  faster-than-expected  wage  growth  are  upside  risks.

Respondent 13: This  forecast  departs  from  previous  forecasts  by  adopting  a  regime-based  conception of medium  and  long-term  outcomes  for  the  U.S.  economy. In our  conception,  there  are  multiple such regimes, and we appear to have converged to one of them. The current regime is viewed as persistent,  and  so  we  see  no  reason  to  forecast  an  exit  from  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast  horizon. Monetary  policy  is  regime-dependent,  and  can  be  viewed  as  optimal  given  the  current  regime. Longer  term,  the  economy  may  visit  some  of  the  other  regimes,  such  as  ones  associated  with  higher productivity  growth,  a  higher  real  return  to  short-term  government  debt,  or  recession. If the  economy transitions  to  any  of  these  states,  all  variables  may  be  aff ected  and,  in  particular,  the  optimal,  regimedependent  policy  rate  would  require  adjustment. However,  we  have  no  way  of  predicting  when  these transitions  may  occur,  and  so  we  forecast  that  we  will  remain  in  the  current  regime  over  the  forecast horizon.

Respondent 14: Real  GDP  per  worker  has  risen  by  slightly  less  than  1  percent  annually  over  the last 10 years;  my  projection  is  for  slightly  faster  growth  in  the  medium  term. Population  growth  for ages 16 to 64 is projected to be 0.5 percent annually. These supply-side factors yield longer-term growth  of  1 3/4  percent  per  year. Strong  consumer  spending  and  residential  investment,  along  with modest  growth  in  business  investment,  result  in  growth  being  slightly  faster  than  trend  in  2016  and 2017.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Recovery  from  the  housing  collapse  and  financial  crisis  has  been  a  slow  process. Nonetheless, much of the healing process has already taken place. The ongoing improvement in financial conditions  is supportive  of  a healthy  pace  of consumer  spending  growth. Ongoing  declines in unemployment  and  broader  strength in the labor market, including some pick up in wage and disposable  income  growth  should  support  solid  consumption  growth  going  forward.

The  strong  relative  performance  of  the  U.S.  economy  over  the  past  year,  the  subsequent  monetary easing  in  Europe  and  elsewhere,  and  the  depreciation  of  the  renminbi  resulted  in  a  sharp  appreciation of the  dollar  last  year. This  appreciation  has  been  a  drag  on  net  exports  and  GDP  growth. In recent months, the dollar appreciation has subsided, which should mitigate that source of drag to GDP growth. In addition,  financial  market  volatility  over  the  past  year  has  calmed  with  equities  growing in recent  months  and  interest  rate  spreads  falling.

In this environment,  I  expect  the  economic  recovery  to  proceed  at  a  moderate  pace. Output  and unemployment  gaps  were  essentially  closed  by  the  end  of  2015. With  substantial  monetary  stimulus still at  play,  I  expect  these  aggregate  indicators  to  overshoot  in  the  coming  year,  before  reverting  back to potential  in 2019. This  overshooting,  along  with  the  dissipating  eff ects  from  falling  energy  prices and  a  rising  dollar  should  lead  to  faster  inflation  over  the  next  year. Inflation  reaches  the  FOMC's  2 percent  target  by  the  end  of  2017  and  slightly  exceeds  it  in  2018. Well-anchored  inflation  expectations and  a  fed funds  rate  above  its  long-run  value  by  the  end  of  2018  will  bring  the  economy  back  to  full employment  in  2019  and  push  inflation  back  down  to  our  objective  of  2  percent.

Respondent 17: Despite  the  disappointing  May  employment  report,  we  have  kept  our  modal  forecast  essentially  unchanged  from  that  in  March. In many  respects,  the  underlying  fundamentals  have improved  since  March. Growth  of  real  disposable  income  has  been  quite  strong  and  equity  values  are near the highs of May  2015. Credit spreads have returned  close to the levels of last August. The broad  trade-weighted  dollar  is off its peak  from  early in the year, and  the adverse  impact  of dollar appreciation  that began  in mid-2014  is likely waning. Indeed, we are projecting a modest  increase of real exports  in 2016Q2  following  declines  over  the past two quarters. Beyond  these  improved  financial  conditions,  household  and  business  balance  sheets  are  in  good  shape,  fiscal  policy  is  slightly stimulative,  and  monetary  policy  is  still  very  accommodative.

From  around  1.6%  (annual rate) over 2016H1, we see real GDP  growth  of around  2 1 2 / % over 2016H2. This  results in growth  of 2.1%  (Q4/Q4)  for  2016,  the  same  as  the  March  projection. The main  engine  of growth  will continue to be consumer  spending,  which  we  expect  to increase 2 3 4 / % (annual  rate)  over  2016H2,  essentially  the  same  as  the  past  1 1 2 / years. The  personal  saving  rate  is expected  to  remain  essentially  unchanged  around  5 1 2 / %.

We  anticipate  some  modest  bounce  back  in  business  fixed  investment  over  2016H2  after  its  recent weakness. Oil prices (WTI)  have firmed to around $50 per barrel. Some  weekly surveys suggest that  the  active  rig  count  has  finally  hit  a  bottom. In addition,  we  expect  the  inventory  correction  to be over by 2016H2,  which  should  help  firm  manufacturing  production  and  lead  to  some  increase  in the capacity  utilization  rate. The  net  export  growth  contribution  is  expected  to  remain  significantly negative  (around  -0.5  percentage  points),  despite  resumed  growth  of  exports,  due  to  faster  growth  of imports  as  the  domestic  inventory  correction  comes  to  an  end.

Finally, the housing sector should provide some  impetus  to growth: despite the loss of upward momentum  over  the  past  six  months,  housing  starts  are  likely  on a gradual  upward  trend,  particularly given the low level of inventories  and  continued  low  mortgage  rates. In addition, spending  on improvements  to  the  existing  housing  stock  has  been  growing  strongly  since  mid-2015.

The  roughly  2%  growth  predicted  for  2016  is  slightly  above  our  estimate  of  the  economy's  potential growth  rate-around  1 3 4 / %. However,  we  expect  productivity  growth  to  pick  up  from  its  recent  very

low levels, and  so the unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  remain  near  its  May  level over the rest of 2016.

Projected  oil  prices  through  the  end  of  2017  are  higher  in  this  submission  than  in  March. However, the  bulk  of  that  revision  is  in  the  very  near  term,  and  we  still  anticipate  a  gradual  increase  over  2016H2 and  2017. As  a result, the rate of increase  of the overall PCE  deflator  in  2016  has  been  boosted  to 1.4%  (Q4/Q4)  from  1.0%  in  March. The  projected  core  PCE  inflation  also  has  been  raised  to  1.7% (Q4/Q4)  from  1.5%  in  March.

For  2017  we  expect  growth  of  real  GDP  to  slow  to  around  our  estimate  of  potential  growth  due  to a combination  of  the  aging  of  the  business  cycle  and  the  moderate  tightening  of  financial  conditions associated with further normalization of monetary  policy. The unemployment  rate  is expected to remain  close  to  our  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  rate. Underlying  that  path,  we  assume  a  slight rise  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  over  2016-17. Productivity  growth  is  assumed  to  be  somewhat below  our  estimate  of  its  longer  term  trend  (1%  to  1 1 4 / %): consequently,  we  project  a  gradual  rise  in the  compensation  share  of  national  income  and  a  gradual  decline  in  the  corporate  profit  share. Core PCE  inflation  is  expected  to  edge  gradually  higher,  reaching  1.9%  for  all  of  2017, reflecting  reduced slack, relatively stable energy prices, a declining impulse from past dollar appreciation, and wellanchored  inflation  expectations. With  economic  slack  largely  dissipated  and  inflation  near  objective by the end of 2017, real growth, unemployment,  and  inflation  are  anticipated  to remain  near  their longer-run  levels  in  2018.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: I've  adjusted  the  within-year  timing  of  2016  GDP  growth  without  changing  average growth  for  the  year. I've  modestly  increased  my  2016  core-PCE  inflation  projection  based  on  strongerthan-expected recent monthly data. My views on policy are shaped by the backdrop of secular concerns  regarding  overcapacity  outside  the  U.S.,  high  ratios  of  debt  to  GDP,  the  long-term  nature  and difficulty  of  China's  transition  to  a  more  service  and  consumer-based  economy,  and  aging  demographics in advanced  economies. I have somewhat  hardened  my  view  that these issues will continue to be transmitted through bouts of tighter financial conditions. Accordingly, the funds-rate path that I regard  as  most  likely  to  be  appropriate  is  slightly  lower  than  before.

Respondent 2: Incoming  data  caused  me  to  mark  down  GDP  growth  in  2016  and  near-term  inflation  has  run  a  bit  higher  than  I  expected. Because  of  the  recent  declines  in  the  labor  force  participation rate,  I continue  to  expect  workers  to  be  drawn  back  into  the  workforce,  but  at  a  slightly  lower  rate.

Respondent 3: My  forecast is essentially unchanged since the previous SEP. With momentum appearing  to  have  slowed  to  some  extent  in  the  labor  market,  I  have  slightly  marked  down  the  policy path  needed  to  support  the  economy,  and  I  have  also  slightly  marked  down  my  expected  long-run  level of appropriate  monetary  policy  rates.

Respondent 4: Forecasts  for key variables are little changed  but  monetary  policy  required  to  be easier  to  attain  that  result.

Respondent 5: My  forecast  for  2016  has  lower  output  growth  and  higher  inflation  than  last  time based  on  the data  released  since the March  SEP.  As  well,  I have  a somewhat  more  gradual  pace  of normalization  based  on  incoming  data  that  has  been  weaker  than  I  expected.

Respondent 6: First-quarter growth was a percentage point weaker than we were expecting in March.  We  were  particularly  surprised  by  the  sizable  decline  in  business  capital  spending. We  assume that  the  first-quarter  weakness  will  largely  be  transitory;  indeed,  we  read  the  limited  second-quarter data as consistent with a rebound  in consumer  spending  and  a  small  gain in BFI. Supporting  this recovery, financial market  conditions  (credit  spreads,  market  volatility)  have  improved  since  March, apparently  in part due to the FOMC's  communication  of  a  less  restrictive  policy  path  through  the change  in  the SEP  policy  projections  between  December  and  March. We  are  concerned  by  the  surprising  weakness  in  the  May  labor  market  report. At this point, we  are discounting  the  signal  from these  data  to  some  degree,  in  part  because  our  business  contacts  are  not  reporting  a  marked  softening in the  labor  market. In the  end,  we  did  not  change  our  forecast  for  GDP  growth  over  the  remainder of this year,  and  the 1 4 / percentage  point  downward  revision  from  March  to  our  2016  Q4-toQ4  GDP forecasts is entirely reflective of our first-quarter miss. We  have  edged  down  our  forecasts  for  GDP growth  in  2017  and  2018  by  a  tenth  in  each  year,  to  2.2  percent. This  reflects  some  small  adjustments to potential  output  growth  we  made  in  response  to  the  MFP  data  released  at  the  end  of  March.

With  regard to prices, the incoming  data on core PCE  inflation were broadly in line with our expectations. Indeed,  with  core  inflation  up  to  1.6  percent  year-over-year  and  signs  that  tighter  labor markets  are  feeding  into  higher  compensation  growth  and  unit  labor  costs,  we  believe  we  are  starting to see some  of the dynamics  that  will  gradually  move  inflation  back  to  target. However,  the  failure of financial market  inflation compensation  and  survey  measures  of  inflation  expectations  to  solidify during  a  period  of  higher  actual  inflation  highlighted  the  downside  risks  to  the  inflation  forecast  and

argued in favor of an adjustment to our policy assumptions. To convince markets of our resolve to reach a symmetric  2  percent  inflation target-and  thus  insure an upward  pull  on actual inflation from  expectations-we  believe  the  Committee  needs  to  communicate  a  somewhat  more  accommodative policy  path  than  it  did  in March. The  uncertainty  generated  by  the  May  labor  market  report  was  a second  factor  supporting  a  less  aggressive  path  for  policy. Accordingly,  in  our  current  projection  we essentially  have  one  fewer  rate  increase  in  each  of  2016, 2017  and  2018  than  we  did  in  March. With this policy  path,  we  believe  we  will  be  able  to  reach  the  same  core  inflation  forecast  as  we  had  in  our last  SEP,  with  core  reaching  1.9  percent  by  the  end  of  the  projection  period. The  rise  in  energy  prices since March  led  us  to  revise  our projection  for  total  inflation  in 2016  up  0.2  percentage  point  to  1.4 percent;  we  left our projections  for  total inflation in 2017  and  2018  at  our  last SEP  submission  (1.7 and  1.9  percent,  respectively).

Respondent 7: Changes  to  real  outlook  have  been  minor. The  projected  path  for  the  unemployment rate  has  been  revised  down  marginally. Interest  rates  have  been  lower  than  expected,  but  their  impact on  activity  is  being  off set  by  a  downward  revision  to  the  equilibrium  federal  funds  rate. Such  a  revision also  implies  that  the  projected  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  is  on  a  somewhat  lower  trajectory  than previously  envisioned. The  inflation  outlook  has  not  changed  materially.

Respondent 8: I lowered  my  unemployment  rate  projection  0.2  percentage  point  over  the  forecast horizon  and  have  adjusted  my  assumption  for  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment  by  a  similar  amount.

I lowered  my  growth  forecast  by  0.2  percentage  point  in  2017  and  0.1  percentage  point  over  the longer-term  mostly  in  response  to  an  assumption  of  slower  productivity  growth.

My  PCE  inflation  and  core  inflation  projections  are  unchanged  from  March.

Respondent 9: My  modal  forecast  is  generally  little  changed  since  March,  however,  the  policy  path associated  with  my  forecast  incorporates  a  slightly  more  gradual  pace  of  rate  increases. I continue  to view  the  risks  around  my  forecast  as  broadly  balanced.

I modestly  reduced  my  forecast  for  growth  in  2016  to  account  for  the  weak  first  quarter,  but  the trajectory  remains  the  same: I expect  growth  to  be  slightly  above  trend  this  year  and  next,  which  will support  continued  growth  in  payrolls,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  last  year. I view  inflation  as  being on  a gradual  upward  trajectory  toward  our  2  percent  objective.

I continue to believe a gradual upward  path  for the federal funds rate is appropriate  monetary policy,  which  balances  the  risks  to  the  forecast  and  takes  into  account  uncertainty  around  the  forecast. My  slightly  shallower  path  compared  to  my  March  projection  recognizes  the  slightly  weaker  growth forecast  for  2016.

Respondent 10: See  answer  to  4(a).

Respondent 11: My  outlook  for  real  activity and  inflation is little changed  from  last  time,  but  I anticipate that the return to full employment  and  2  percent  inflation  over  the next couple of years will require  a  slightly  lower  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate.

Respondent 12: I have revised down  my  forecast for real GDP  growth  in  the first half of 2016 based  on  the  incoming  data. I have  also  reduced  my  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2017  modestly, though  I  continue  to  expect  above-trend  growth.

Respondent 13: The  forecast here represents  a conceptual  change  relative  to previous  forecasts. Medium  and  longer-term  outcomes  for  the  economy  are  viewed  as  regimes. There  are  multiple  possible regimes, but no concept of a single, long-run steady state. Optimal monetary policy is regimedependent. It is a good  time  to  begin  thinking  in  terms  of  regimes  because  output  growth,  inflation,

and  unemployment  are  all  arguably  close  to  values  that  are  likely  to  persist  over  the  forecast  horizon. Numerically,  forecast  values  are  close  to  previous  submissions  for  output  growth,  unemployment,  and inflation, but the concept  of regime-dependent  monetary  policy  means  that  the  implied  policy  rate path  is  flat.

Respondent 14: In  response  to  recent  data  on  business  investment  and  payroll  employment,  I  have lowered my real GDP  forecast slightly. In response to the latest inflation data, I have raised my forecast  for  inflation  this  year  slightly.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: Since  March,  I  have  reduced  my  unemployment  path,  largely  reflecting  incoming data. I now  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  bottom  out  at  4-1/2  percent  by  the  end  of  this  year before gradually rising back to its 5 percent natural rate over subsequent years. I discount the weak  GDP  data  for  Q1  because  of  residual  seasonality,  but  weakness  in  business  investment  spending and  construction  activity  led  me  to lower my  projection  of  GDP  growth  for  2016. With  continuing disappointment  about  productivity  growth, I have also lowered potential growth  in both the nearand  the  longer-term.

My  inflation  projection  is  slightly  higher  owing  to  firmer  data,  higher  energy  prices  and  my  expectation  of  some  overshooting  for  unemployment  and  GDP.  As  a  result,  my  projection  of  core  inflation is one-tenth  higher  for  2016,  2017  and  2018.

Respondent 17: Our  macroeconomic  projections  relative  to  those  of  March  are  broadly  unchanged. Real  GDP  growth  is  anticipated  to  be  the  same  as  in  the  March  SEP  projections  for  the  whole  forecast horizon. For  2016,  there  has  been  a  shift  in  the  composition  of  GDP  growth: relative  to  March,  we  now see a significantly  slower  growth  of  fixed  investment  spending,  which  is  off set  by  a  smaller  projected drag from net exports. There are no significant changes in the composition in subsequent years. Overall  and  core  inflation  at  near-term  horizons  are  slightly  higher  reflecting  the  rebound  in  oil  prices since  the  March  FOMC  meeting;  however,  we  see  little  change  in  the  factors  behind  our  medium-term inflation  projection. As  in  March,  convergence  of  inflation  to  the  longer-term  objective  is  expected  by 2018. As  noted  and  explained  in  the  response  to  3(b),  we  judge  that  a  lower  path  of  the  policy  rate is necessary  to  support  these  projections.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe  any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: There are several notable diff erences. First, I see the unemployment  rate  overshooting the longer-run sustainable unemployment  rate  by less than is projected in the Tealbook. Allowing  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  0.7  percentage  points  below  the  natural  rate  would  risk  the buildup  of dangerous  imbalances. Second,  because  I am  relatively conservative  in my  views  on the appropriate  path  for  the  unemployment  rate,  I  project  somewhat  slower  2017  and  2018  GDP  growth than  does  the  Tealbook. Finally, I see a more  rapid  return  to  our  2-percent  inflation  objective  than does the Tealbook. In my  view, the longer-term inflation expectations relevant to wage and price setting  remain  anchored  at  2  percent.

Respondent 2: My  forecast  for  economic  activity  and  inflation  is  broadly  similar  to  the  Tealbook except  that  I believe the improving  labor  market  will  continue  to  draw  workers  back  into  the  labor force, leading to more  progress on the labor force participation rate than the unemployment  rate. This  would  lead  to  less  upward  movement  for  wages  and  prices  if  monetary  policy  were  to  follow  the path  assumed  in  the  Tealbook. Removing  monetary  policy  more  gradually,  as  in  my  projection,  would produce  a  path  for  inflation  similar  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 3: I expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  fall  further  this  year  than  in  the  Teal  Book,  as  I do  not  expect  the  unemployment  rate  to  bounce  back  up  from  its  May  reading  and  expect  employment in  the  household  survey  to  run  higher  than  is  implicit  in  the  staff  forecast. I continue  to  expect  inflation in 2018  to  be  close  to  2  percent,  slightly  higher  than  in  the  Teal  Book.

Respondent 4:

None.

Respondent 5: NA

Respondent 6: Our  Federal  Funds  path  is  20  bps  below  the  Tealbook  in  2016  and  about  35  bps below  in  2017  and  2018.

Our  projection  for  GDP  growth  is  nearly  identical  to  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  period. However, our assumptions about potential output growth over the last few years, as well as over the projection period, are somewhat higher. Furthermore, we see the natural rate of unemployment trending  down  from  5  percent  today  to  4.8  percent  at  the  end  of  2018,  in  contrast  to  the  Tealbook's constant  5 percent assumption. We  also think that the gap today  between  actual  and trend labor force participation  is somewhat  larger  and  that  it  will  not  close  until  the unemployment  rate  is  further below  the  natural  rate. Taken  together,  this  means  our  forecast  for  activity  does  not  overshoot potential  output  to  as  great  of  a  degree  as  in  the  Tealbook. Nonetheless,  our  outlook  for  inflation  is similar, as we feel our more  accommodative  path  for  monetary  policy  will  be  successful  at  buoying inflationary  expectations,  firming  the  inflationary  attractor  and  therefore  providing  a  larger  boost  to actual  inflation.

Respondent 7: The  Tealbook's  estimate  of  the natural rate of unemployment,  at  5.0  percent, is higher  than  our  estimate,  which  currently  stands  at  4.7  percent. The  Tealbook  forecast  implies  a  more pronounced  overshooting  of  full  employment  than  our  forecast.

Respondent 8: There  are  no  important  diff erences  between  my  economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 9: As  in the Tealbook,  I  expect  that  the  economy  will  grow  at  a  moderate  pace,  the labor market  will continue to improve, and inflation will gradually return to our 2 percent longerterm  objective. My  outlook  for  the  real  economy  is  generally  similar  to  Tealbook's  forecast,  but  I  see somewhat  greater  inflationary  pressures  than  in  the  Tealbook,  with  inflation  returning  to  2  percent by  the  end  of 2017  compared  with  2020  in  the  Tealbook. As  a result,  I believe  it will be  appropriate to have  a  somewhat  steeper  path  for  the  federal  funds  rate  compared  with  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 10: No  significant  diff erences for this year. However,  I  do  not  anticipate  the  pickup in growth  throughout  2017  that  is  included  in  the  current  Tealbook  forecast.

Respondent 11: The  Tealbook  implicitly  assumes  that  the  underlying  strength  of  the  economy  will improve  somewhat  faster  than  I  anticipate,  resulting  in  a  larger  decline  in  the  unemployment  rate  and a steeper  trajectory  for  the  real  funds  rate  (although  the  latter  is  much  less  pronounced  than  it  was in March). In addition,  the  Tealbook  assumes  a  higher  estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment and  a  lower  estimate  of  long-run  inflation  expectations.

Respondent 12: The  contour  of  my  projected  path  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016-2018  is  similar  to that  of Tealbook. My  projected  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  similar,  though  I  do  not  see  it  as low  as the Tealbook  in  2018  because  I  expect  employment  growth  to  slow  in  the  next  two  years  due to demographic  factors. My  forecast  for  PCE  inflation  is  approximately 3 4 / percentage  point  higher than  Tealbook's  projection  in  2016  and 1 4 / percentage  point  higher  in  2017  and  2018. My  forecast  for core  PCE  inflation  exceeds  that  of  Tealbook  by  approximately 1 2 / percentage  point  in  2016  and  2017 and  by  about 1 4 / in 2018. With  inflation  expectations  well  anchored,  I  view  inflation  as  less  inertial than  Tealbook,  and  therefore  expect  the  eff ects of past dollar appreciation  and  oil price declines to wane  sooner  than  in  the  Tealbook  projection.

Respondent 13: The Tealbook forecast is in many  ways similar but incorporates the idea of a longer-run  steady  sate  to  which  the  economy  is  converging. Monetary  policy  has  to  be  set  appropriately as  the  economy  transitions  toward  the  longer-run  steady  state. This  tends  to  imply  an  upward-sloping policy rate path. The  regime conception  used here, in contrast, views monetary  policy as regimedependent,  and  the  current  regime  is  viewed  as  persistent. It is acknowledged  that  the  economy  may visit  other  regimes  in  the  future,  and  that  this  may  change  policy,  but  switches  to  those  regimes  cannot be  forecasted. This  suggests  a  flat  path  for  the  policy  rate  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 14: I do not believe that core inflation will fall in the second  half as is projected  in the  Tealbook. Also,  I do  not  expect  a  surge  in  real  GDP  growth  in  2017.

Respondent 15: N/A

Respondent 16: The Tealbook projects a more substantial and protracted overshooting of full employment, with the unemployment  rate declining to 4.3 percent at the end of 2018, and with inflation returning  to the 2 percent  target  only  very  gradually. In my  projection,  there  is a modest overshooting of unemployment,  output  and  inflation in 2018, and those gaps close in 2019. I see the unemployment  rate bottoming out at 4.5 percent in late 2016.The gradual removal of policy accommodation  tightens  financial  conditions  over  time  and  slows  growth  to  below  potential  in  2017 and 2018, respectively. This pushes  up the unemployment  rate  to  4.7 percent by the end of 2018. Finally, the persistent overshoot of full employment,  combined  with  firmer  price pressures, pushes inflation  back  to  2  percent  by  the  end  of  2017,  with  a  slight  overshoot  of  the  FOMC  target  in  2018.

Respondent 17: As in the March  SEP,  there  are  some  notable  diff erences  between  the  Tealbook forecast  and  our  projections  for  the  key  SEP  variables. In  part,  these  diff erences  reflect  divergences  in some  of  the  underlying  assumptions  in  the  two  forecasts  that  influence  the  dynamics  in  the  projections.

The  two  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2016  are  similar,  but  the  Tealbook  projects  a  significantly faster  growth  in  2017  and  2018  than  in  our  outlook. Furthermore,  based  on  its  assessment  of  potential GDP  growth,  which  is  below  our  assumption  for  2016-18,  the  Tealbook  path  of  real  GDP  leads  to  a notably  positive  output  gap  by  2017-18. Our  assessment  is  that  the  output  gap  is  not  positive  at  that time.

A  major  component  behind  the  diff erences  between  the  real  GDP  growth  projections  in  2017-18 is consumption. The  Tealbook  forecast  has  higher  real  PCE  growth  than  in  our  projection  in  those years, a long-standing diff erence between  the two forecasts, which likely reflects a stronger wealth eff ects in the  Tealbook  forecast. Another  component  behind  the  diff erences  is  net  exports,  which  the Tealbook  expects  to  be  a  somewhat  smaller  drag  on  GDP  growth  than  in  our  forecast: the  diff erence primarily  is  in  imports.

Another  notable  diff erence is the underlying  assumptions  on the longer-run natural rate of unemployment: the Tealbook  assumption  of 5.0% is above our assumption  of 4.8%. Combined  with our growth  projections,  we  anticipate  that  unemployment  will  be  near  its  natural  rate; in contrast, the  Tealbook  projects  that  unemployment  significantly  undershoots  the  longer-run  natural  rate. This pattern  is the counterpart  of  the  positive  output  gap  that  arises  in  the  Tealbook  forecast  but  not  in our  projections.

One  other  diff erence  in  the  labor  market  projections  concerns  the  paths  for  labor  force  participation: in our projection the participation rate is roughly flat through 2017 at 62.7 -62.8% while in the Tealbook  it  declines  gradually  to  62.5%  at  end-2017. This  diff erence  reflects  our  assumption  of  some positive  cyclical  eff ects  on  participation.

For  inflation,  the  two  forecasts  continue  to  diff er  on  how  quickly  inflation  reaches  the  2%  objective. In our  projection  inflation  is  near  2%  at  end-2017  whereas  the  Tealbook  projects  inflation  still  below 2%  until  2020,  despite  a  positive  output  gap  and  undershooting  of  unemployment  in  its  projection. The considerable  persistence  of inflation within the Tealbook  framework  appears  to  require  a  prolonged period of above-potential growth (and a positive output gap) in order to induce inflation to rise toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal. In our  forecast,  the  faster  return  of  inflation  to  its goal  reflects our  assumptions  of  less  inflation  persistence  and  a  stronger  attraction  provided  by  anchored  inflation expectations.

In terms of the uncertainty  and risk assessment, we see a few diff erences between  the two projections. On  the real side, we continue  to see higher uncertainty  than  normal  in  the projections  of real activity and  unemployment,  whereas  the  Tealbook  sees  uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This assessment  reflects our view that the unusual  nature  of the current expansion  and  the difficulty in reading  somewhat  conflicting  recent  economic  data,  coupled  with  the  atypical  policy  environment  in the U.S. and abroad and the approaching  British referendum  raise uncertainty about real activity above  the  SEP  standard. However,  we  agree  with  the  Tealbook  that  the  risks  to  real  growth  are  tilted to the  downside  for  many  of  the  same  reasons  cited  in  the  Tealbook. As  for  inflation,  our  uncertainty is broadly  similar  to  that  in  the  Tealbook,  and  near  the  SEP  standard  but  we  see  risks  to  inflation  as broadly  balanced.

Finally, our monetary  policy  path  is  aligned  with  the  Tealbook  projection  in  the  near  term,  but is significantly shallower  in 2017-18. As discussed  earlier in our submission,  we  believe that a very gradual  path  of  normalization  is  necessary  to  support  our  current  projections  for  output  and  inflation. Furthermore,  we  see  it  as  appropriate  to  provide  some  extra  insurance  against  a  tightening  of  financial conditions  that  could  result  from  policy  normalization  against  a  backdrop  of  a  looser  policy  stance  in the  advanced  foreign  economies.
