Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth  quarter  of the year indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in, respectively, the price index  for personal  consumption expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian unemployment  rate  in  the fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each participant's assessment  of the rate to which each variable would  be expected  to converge under appropriate monetary  policy and in the absence of further shocks to the economy.  The  June  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  June  17-18,  2014.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In June 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2014, 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 1, 12, and 3. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Longer-run  Projections

- 1(c). If you anticipate  that  the  convergence  process  will  take  SHORTER OR  LONGER  than  about  five  or  six  years,  please  indicate  below  your  best estimate  of  the  duration  of  the  convergence  process. You  may  also  include below  any  other  explanatory  comments  that  you  think  would  be  helpful.

Respondent 1: I expect the unemployment  rate to reach its longer-run sustainable level by 2015:Q4, and  to  fall past  that  level  in 2016. Inflation  will  likely  reach  its mandate-consistent  level  by  2016:Q4 or perhaps  sooner,  and  rise  above  that  level  in  2017. It will take  skilled policymaking  and  a  considerable measure  of  good  luck  to  ease  the  unemployment  rate  back  up  and  inflation  back  down  without triggering  a  recession. Full convergence  on  both  sides  of  the  dual  mandate  could  well  take  five  or  six years.

Respondent 2: The  convergence  process  may  be  somewhat  shorter  than  5-6  years.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4: Long-run  values  are  achieved  in  2018  or  beyond.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6: It will be shorter  under appropriate  monetary policy, in part because the FOMC will take appropriate steps to return the underlying rate of inflation to 2%, as described in Deb Lindner's June  2014  memo. My  assessment of appropriate  monetary policy puts no weight on interest rate  smoothing.

Respondent 7: I anticipate that  convergence  will  take  less than 5 years. Specifically, my  forecast calls for inflation  to  rise to 2 percent  in  2015. I expect  the  unemployment  gap  to  be  nearly  closed  in 2015  and  the  unemployment  rate  to  reach  its  longer-run  level  in  the  following  year. By  2017  I  expect real GDP  growth  to  slow  to  its  longer-run  rate.

Respondent 8: At  this  point,  convergence  is  likely  within  three  years.

Respondent 13: In our typical re-assessment of our long-run assumptions following the annual revisions of GDP  and production,  our  analysis indicated that the  economy's potential growth rate was within a range around 2%;  consequently, we have lowered our point estimate to 2% from the previous estimate  of  about  2 1 4 / %. Based  on  our  interpretation  of  the  recent  literature  and  some  previous  inhouse  analysis,  we  are  currently  maintaining that  a  reasonable  range  for  the  longer-run  unemployment rate  is 4 1 2 / %  to  6%,  with  a  point  estimate  of  about  5 1 4 / %  (rounded  to  5.3%  above);  however,  some

of our  more recent analysis indicates  a higher probability  that the estimate  could be somewhat lower, and we plan to do further analysis and to re-assess this assumption  on  a  more  frequent  basis than has been  our typical procedure. We  expect  the unemployment rate  to reach  its  longer-run  level  and the output  gap  to be small in late 2016, but some  of our recent scenario analysis of labor flows as well as our  analysis  of  recent  long  expansions  suggests  that  there  is  a  significant  probability  that  the unemployment  rate  could  fall  to  around  5%  by  the  end  of  2016.

We  assume  that  long-term  inflation  expectations  will  continue  to be  anchored  at  levels  consistent with  the FOMC  longer-run  objective  (2%  for  the  PCE deflator  and  around  2.5%  for  the  CPI based on  the  longer-term  average  of  the  difference  between  CPI  and  PCE  inflation). Under  these  conditions and  with  the  output  gap  anticipated  to  shrink  over  the  coming years,  we  expect  inflation  as  measured by  the  PCE  deflator  to  be  about  2%  in  2016  and  thereafter.

As indicated in our projections, we anticipate that under appropriate monetary  policy and no further  shocks,  the  convergence  process  should  be  largely  completed  by  the  end  of  2016.

Respondent 14: N/A

Respondent 15: I anticipate a shorter convergence process for real GDP  growth  and for PCE inflation. Real GDP  growth  and  PCE  inflation  will converge to their long-run values in 2017. As part of its convergence  process, I anticipate that inflation will exceed 2 percent  in 2015 and 2016. Meanwhile,  I  foresee  the  convergence  of  the  unemployment  rate  to  take  roughly  5  years. Given  my long-run projection of 6%, the unemployment rate  will be less than its long-run value in Q4/2014 and remain  below  until  2018.

Respondent 16: Convergence  to  the  longer-run  level  of  the  unemployment  rate  is  expected  to  occur in the second half of  2016. Inflation is projected to reach the 2 percent objective in  2019.

Uncertainty  and  Risks

- 2(a). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  uncertainty  attached  to  your  projections  relative  to  levels of uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years,  you  may  enter  them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: It remains  the  case that the effect of the extraordinary  monetary  policy  in  place and  uncertainties  surrounding  the  future  path  of  policy,  including  the  timing  of  the  exit  from  accommodative  policy,  contribute  to  uncertainty  around  my  inflation  forecast.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: Inflation expectations have probably become  more  firmly  anchored  as a result  of the  FOMC's  consensus  statements,  and  uncertainty  is  accordingly  lower  that  before  January,  2012.

Respondent 5: N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8:

NA.

Respondent 9: We  think  the uncertainty  surrounding  the growth projection has diminished somewhat  since  the  June  SEP;  nonetheless,  on  balance,  we  still  judge  the  uncertainty  over  the  forecast  as broadly  similar  to  the  levels  of  uncertainty  over  the  past  20  years.

Respondent 10: Uncertainty  about  my  projection  for  economic  activity  is similar to its average level over the past 20 years, which of course, is a period that was characterized by considerable turmoil. Inflation  remains anchored by quite stable  longer-run inflation  expectations at the FOMC's stated  goal of 2 percent. Inflation expectations have now been  well  anchored  for  about  20 years, so I see the magnitude  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  inflation  outlook  as  consistent  with  that  over  the past  20  years.

Respondent 13: Quantitative  judgment  based  on  the  width  of  the  probability  intervals  from  the FRBNY  forecast  distribution  for real GDP  growth  and  core  PCE  inflation relative to the forecast errors over the last 20 years. These intervals have narrowed modestly from those at the time of the June  SEP,  principally reflecting that the annual  revision of GDP  did  not  lead to a substantial change  in  our  assessment  of  economic  developments  over  the  past  few  years  (the  other  data  releases and  developments  since  June  were  mixed  with  only  modest  net  effects  on  the  width  of the forecast distribution intervals). Although still  wide, the  forecast intervals  for  core  PCE inflation appear broadly consistent with the SEP  standard,  taking  rough  account  for  the differences between  forecast  errors

for overall consumer  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation. The  probability  intervals  for  the  real  activity forecasts are still relatively wide in part because of the still-extraordinary economic and financial environment,  including  the  policy  rate  remaining  constrained  by  its  effective  lower  bound.

Uncertainty  and  Risks  (continued)

2(b). (Optional)  If  you  have  any  explanatory  comments  regarding  your judgment  of  the  risk  weighting  around  your  projections,  you  may  enter them  below.

Respondent 1: N/A

Respondent 2: I view  the  risks  to  inflation  as  weighted  to  the  upside  over  the  medium  and  longer run. Longer-term  inflation  risks  reflect  uncertainty  about  the  timing  and  efficacy  of  the  Fed's  withdrawal  of  accommodation. The  risks  to  output  growth  and  unemployment  are  balanced.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: N/A

Respondent 5: Although  I  see  the  distribution  of  shocks  to  aggregate  demand  as  reasonably  balanced,  I  still view  the  balance  of  risks  to  GDP  growth  as  somewhat  weighted  to  the  downside  due  to the constraints  that  limit the ability of monetary  policy  to  offset  negative  shocks  to  demand  at  the zero  lower  bound. I see  the  risks  to  unemployment  as  balanced,  with  the  risk  of  higher  unemployment due to the constraints imposed by the zero lower bound  offset by the risk that productivity may continue to grow  more slowly than anticipated, as it has done over the past few years. For some  time now inflation has been running  below the level I had anticipated. While some of the  factors that have held inflation down appear to be transitory, low inflation may prove  more persistent, creating  risks to inflation  I consider  to  be  weighted  to  the  downside.

Respondent 6: It is hard for the FOMC  to  respond  effectively  to  low inflation outcomes,  which means  that  they  are  more  likely  to  occur.

Respondent 7: N/A

Respondent 8: I see the risks to my projections as being broadly balanced. Geopolitical  tensions create  downside  risks  to  growth  via  reduced  exports  and  lower  confidence,  but  these  could  be  offset by  flight-to-quality  flows  that  put  downward  pressure  on  longer-term  interest  rates. Potential  supply disruptions  of  key  energy  commodities  could  pose  upside  risks  to  prices.

Domestically,  if  recent  subdued  readings  on  residential  investment  point  to  something  more  fundamental,  my  forecast  may  be  overestimating  growth. However,  the  upbeat  tone  from  my  business contacts  raises  the  possibility  that  my  forecast  could  be  underestimating  growth.

Given  uncertainties  surrounding  the  withdrawal  of  policy  accommodation,  there  are  some  upside risks  to my  inflation  forecast  over  the  medium  and  longer  run. In the  nearer  term,  the  continued  low readings  on  inflation  suggest  some  downside  risk  to  inflation,  but  as  noted  above,  geopolitical  tensions raise  the  possibility  of  higher  oil  prices,  some  of  which  could  passthrough  to  inflation.

Respondent 9: We think the risks to the  forecast  for growth  and  unemployment  are roughly in balance. On  the  downside,  restrictive  credit  conditions  are  weighing  on  housing,  and  they  may  hold  back the  recovery  in  residential  investment  more  than  we  think. The  international  sector  presents  another downside  risk. On  the  up  side,  improved  household  sector  fundamentals  (notably,  gains  in  wealth  and the better job  market)  and the steady improvement in the sentiment of  our business  contacts  suggest that we  could see a  more pronounced 'virtuous cyclical' dynamic than we  are projecting.

The  factors  that  could  hold  down  inflation  continue  to  outnumber  those  arguing  for  accelerating prices. The recent softer monthly  data are a reminder that there currently is not a great deal of upward  momentum in inflation.  Neither the data nor our business anecdotes point to any  meaningful cost pressures or pricing power. There are no inflationary pressures coming from abroad; indeed, exchange  rate  movements  could  put  some  downward  pressure  on  import  prices. Finally,  our  forecast of inflation picking  up  to just under 2 percent by  the  end of the projection period depends heavily on an upward pull from inflation expectations and  credible FOMC  communications about its  commitment to a symmetric  2  percent  inflation target. For some  time  we have noted  the risk that this upward force  may  not  be  as  strong  as  we  have  assumed.

Respondent 10: Risks  to economic  activity  appear  balanced. The  economy  has  rebounded  from its transitory first-quarter contraction, and  headwinds  continue  to  abate. Indeed, with diminishing headwinds, upside scenarios involving  a virtuous cycle of  economic  activity  become  more plausible.

The  zero lower bound  does  somewhat  constrain  our  ability  to  respond  to  adverse  shocks. However, this constraint  no longer appears  quantitatively  important,  especially  in  light of the apparent effectiveness  of  forward  guidance  and  LSAPs.

Inflation  risks  are  also  balanced.

Respondent 13: Quantitative judgment based  on the difference between the central projection and  the  expected  value  from  the  FRBNY  forecast  distribution. Under  our  appropriate  policy  stance, the risks to the inflation outlook are roughly balanced,  as  has been the case in recent SEPs. Also as has been the case in the past couple of SEPs,  the risks to the real activity outlook are roughly balanced  over  medium-term  horizons,  as  indicated  in  the  summary  of  our  judgment;  however,  at  the longer horizons, the risks are still modestly skewed to the downside. The broad balance over the medium  term reflects two opposing  forces. One is the possibility  that the sluggish growth during  this expansion  has  come  from  more  persistent  structural  factors  rather  than  from  various  headwinds  that are  expected  to  abate  in  our  central  forecast. The  other  is  the possibility that  the  economy has  greater underlying  strength  than  anticipated  in  our projection. Beyond  these  forces,  geopolitical  risks, such as those  recently  emanating  from  Ukraine  and  the  Middle  East,  could  have  significant  adverse  effects on  the  global  economy  and  pose  risks  to  the  U.S.  economy. Other  concerns  include  the  impact  of  the recent  (and  possible  future)  dollar  appreciation  on  U.S.  activity  and  inflation;  the  low  inflation  data in many parts  of  the  world  as  well  as  continued  weakness  in  the  euro  area,  which  could  leave  the  U.S. and  world  economies  more  susceptible  to  negative  shocks;  and  the  constraints  that  monetary  policy faces  under  the  effective  lower  bound  in  a  number  of  major  economies.

Key  Factors  Informing  Your  Judgments  regarding  the Appropriate  Path  of  the  Federal  Funds  Rate

3(c). Please  describe  the key factors  informing your  judgments  regarding the  appropriate  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate. If, in your  projections  for any  year  in  the  projection  period,  the  unemployment  rate  for  that  year  is close  to or below  your  projections  for  its  longer-run  normal  level  and inflation for  that year  is  close  to  or above 2 percent, and your  assessment of the  appropriate  level  of  the  federal  funds  rate  for  that  year  is  still significantly  below  your  assessment  of  its  longer-run  normal  value,  please describe  the  factor  or  factors  that  you  anticipate  will  make  the lower-than-normal  funds  rate  appropriate. If you  have  reduced  your estimate  of  the  longer-run  normal  value  of  the  federal  funds  rate  since  the previous  SEP,  please  indicate  the  factor  or  factors  accounting  for  the change. You  may  include  any  other  comments  on  appropriate  monetary policy  as  well.

Respondent 1: I'm convinced  that  following the 1999 Taylor rule with inertia (as is assumed  in the Tealbook baseline) would be a mistake. The rule too often causes the unemployment  rate  to substantially overshoot its long-run sustainable level. We  have demonstrated  that we are unlikely to be able to reverse such overshooting  without  triggering a full-blown recession. (Any  number  of FRB/US  simulations  will  not  convince  me  otherwise;  without  meaning  any  disrespect,  I  am  hard  over on this one.) History  teaches, instead, that the best way  to prolong  an expansion  is to tap on the brakes  while  the  unemployment  rate  is  still  above  its  sustainable  level. This  approach  was  successful in the  1960s,  the  1980s  and,  again,  in  the  1990s.

Without  inertia,  the  1993  and  1999  Taylor  rules  both  call  for  early  and  rapid  funds-rate  increases: They  say  that  policy  is currently  quite  far from  where  it ought  to be. This  is so even  if one makes reasonable  allowance  for  a  temporarily  low  neutral  real  interest  rate. It is so even  if one  builds  some 'history  dependence'  into  the  rules,  by  making  policy  depend  on  lagged  deviations  of  inflation  from target  as  well  as  current  and  near-term  expected  deviations.

Given my projections  for the unemployment  rate  and inflation, non-inertial rules prescribe a 'nearnormal'  funds  rate  by  the  end  of  2015. However,  it's  my  judgment  that  the  rapid  increases  required to reach a 3.75-percent funds rate in that time frame would be seen as a major and unwarranted departure from past Fed behavior, would spook investors,  and  would harm financial intermediaries.  A reasonable  compromise  is  a  series  of 1 4 / -point  rate hikes beginning in March,  2015, that would bring the policy rate up  to its rule-prescribed level by  the end of  2016. At that point, the unemployment rate is likely  to  be  below  the  natural  rate,  but  only  modestly  so. Subsequently,  continued  low  unemployment and  the  threat  of  above-target  inflation  mandate  that  the  funds  rate  overshoot  its  long-run  level.

I'm  not  entirely  comfortable  with  this  compromise  approach,  as  it  might  easily  suggest  to  investors that  the  post-liftoff  time  path  of  policy  is  preset. (It is not  the  rate  path  itself  that  would  be  preset, of course,  but  the  speed  with  which  the  gap  between  current  policy  and  the  rule-prescribed  policy  is closed.) However,  I'm  even  more  uncomfortable  with  the  notion  (advanced  in  some  of  the  memos  distributed  for this  meeting) that we  can delay liftoff  without  ill effect if we promise  aggressive  tightening down the road.  Investors  will pay  attention to the 'delay  liftoff' part of the  message and discount the promise  of  aggressive  future  action. With  markets  unprepared  for  rapid  rate  hikes,  it  will,  indeed,  in the  end  prove  difficult  to  follow  through  on  the  earlier  commitment.

Respondent 2: My  assumed  appropriate  path  of  monetary  policy  has  the  asset  purchase  program ending in  2014Q4  and  the  Committee  needing  to  start  raising the  funds  rate  in  2014Q4  as  the  economy continues to strengthen. The  economy is modestly above steady  state by the end of  2015  with inflation returning to 2 percent, output growth  near 3 percent, and the unemployment  rate  at 5.3 percent. My  path  for the funds rate is within the range of prescriptions  given by the monetary  policy  rules enumerated  in  the  Tealbook  and  has  the  funds  rate  gradually  rising  over  the  forecast  horizon  to  reach its long-run  level  of  4  percent  by  the  end  of  2016.

I Respondent 3: At year  end  2015  and  2016,  my projections show unemployment  at near  baseline levels of 5.4% and 4.9%, respectively -near or a bit below the highly uncertain natural rate. assume  that  inflation  is  moderately  more  responsive  to  slack  than  the  baseline  suggests  at  these  levels of resource  utilization, which  leads  me  to assume  the  'higher  inflation' path  for  inflation, given the baseline forecast for output. In light of the higher path  for inflation, I assume  a  somewhat  steeper path  of the federal  funds  rate, which  is nearly  at the longer  run  estimated  rate  (3.75%)  by  year  end 2017.

Respondent 4: I believe that in March  2015  labor  markets  will  have  improved  significantly, and inflation  will be above 1.6 percent  and increasing. Consequently, I believe we  will want to begin raising policy  rates  to  prevent  an  excessive  rise  in  inflation.

Respondent 5: My  path for the federal funds rate, both before and after liftoff from the zero bound,  is shaped  by  my  expectation  that  the headwinds  that  have  been  holding  back  the  recovery since the financial crisis will continue to exert a restraining, albeit abating, influence on aggregate demand  for several years  to  come. In addition,  inflation has been  running below  our  2%  longer-run objective and I expect it to move  only gradually back to 2%. To promote  the attainment of our maximum employment and price stability objectives over the medium  term I see it as necessary to pursue  a highly accommodative  policy. I would  assess  the equilibrium  real  funds  rate at present  to be substantially  below  my  estimate  of  its  longer-run  normal  level  of  around  1.5%  and  to  move  only some  way  back  toward  this level over the forecast period. I do not expect it to fully return to its longer-run normal level even by the end of  2017. This reflects  factors such  as (i) ongoing balance sheet repair by  households  and  limited  access  to  credit,  which prevent households  from  taking  advantage  of very low interest rates to the same  extent they would if their balance sheets had not been  impaired; (ii) a continuing,  albeit  diminishing,  high  supply  of  savings,  especially  from  emerging  economies;  (iii) fiscal policy that for several more  years makes  a smaller contribution to growth  than its historical norm; and  (iv) a temporarily decreased  growth  rate  of potential GDP  and  associated  weak  growth of household  incomes  and  income  expectations. My  estimate  of the longer-run normal  level of the nominal (and  real) federal funds rate of 3.5% (and 1.5%) are  consistent with estimates from the staff's three factor model. This  estimate  likely reflects  some  pessimism  about  the prospects  for  longer-run growth,  consistent,  for  example,  with  current  Laubach-Williams  estimates  of  trend  GDP  growth.

Respondent 6: The data suggest that there has been a sharp fall in the natural real rate of interest since 2007. We  remain below maximum  employment  and  below  target  inflation, even though the market real rate of interest (over any horizon) is much  lower than in 2007. This means  that the neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  consistent  with  target  inflation  and  maximum  employment  -  has  fallen by  even  more.

There  are  many  reasons  for  this  change  in  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest  -  but  the  main  point  is the change is likely to unwind  over  time  - but only slowly and  only partially. This judgment is borne out  by  the  real  yield  curve,  which  is  upward  sloping  (roughly  zero  over  the  next  five  years,  and  rising to just over  1%  from  2024  to  2034). Note  that  this real yield  curve  is roughly  consistent  with  inflation

break-evens  of  around  2%,  which  suggests  that  these  market  interest  rates  are  reflective  too  of  what's happening  with  the  neutral  real  rate  of  interest.

Put  another  way: I see the  intercept  term  in  the  Taylor  Rule  as  being  a  stochastic  process  with  a lot of persistence. That  intercept  term  is  very  low, and  is likely to return  to its long-run  value  only slowly.

I have also  taken on board the staff's downward revision of the underlying  rate of inflation described in Deb Lindner's June  2014  memo, as well as the staff's view expressed in that  memo that overshooting of the unemployment  rate below its natural rate  will be needed to bring inflation back  up  to 2 percent.

Respondent 7: My  forecast calls for inflation of 2 percent and the unemployment  rate  near  its longer-run level by the end of 2015. My  assessment of the appropriate federal funds rate is 1.88 percent at the end of 2015, 3.88 percent at the end of 2016, and 4.30 percent at the end of 2017, reflecting  my  desire  to  raise  the  federal  funds  rate  at  a  gradual  pace  after  lift-off.

Respondent 8: The  labor  market  has  made  considerable  progress  toward  our  goal  of  full  employment and I  expect steady progress to that goal to  continue. I project inflation  will gradually increase over  the  forecast  horizon  and  reach  the  Committee's  2  percent  longer-run  goal  by  the  end  of  2016. I believe  appropriate  monetary policy  should  reflect  actual  and projected progress  toward  the  Committee's  goals. Given the improvement in  labor  markets, a key  condition  will be when projected inflation between  one and two years ahead reaches the Committee's  goal of 2 percent. I am  growing  more confident that we  are nearing  such  a point in  time  and I believe it  will be appropriate  for the FOMC to begin  raising  the  fed  funds  rate  in 2015Q1. Consistent  with  the  Committee's  forward  guidance,  I project the fed funds rate  will  rise gradually over the rest of  2015,  similar  to a path suggested by  a Taylor  1999  rule  with  inertia. As  the  expansion  strengthens,  I  believe  it  will  be  appropriate  to  raise interest  rates  at  a  slightly  more  rapid  pace,  described  by  a  somewhat  less  inertial  Taylor  1999  rule.

As a result of delaying liftoff until early 2015 and the inertia in my  monetary  policy rule, the federal funds  rate target would  be  below  its longer-run  normal  level  at  the  end  of 2016, despite  the fact that  unemployment  and  inflation  are  both  near  their  longer-run  levels.

Consistent  with recent  Committee discussions, I believe it  will be appropriate to initially  target a 25 basis point range  for the federal funds  rate, with  IOER  at  the  top  of the range  and  other  tools-including ON  RRPs-preventing  the  funds rate from trading below the bottom  end of the range. Depending  on  our  experiences  with  these  tools  and  our  ability  to  control  the  federal funds  rate, we may  need  to  target  a  range  rather  than  a  point  target  for  some  time.

Respondent 9: The factors that shaped our views about appropriate policy in the June SEP continue to be operative in the current submission. These  still call for an early 2016 liftoff in the policy  rate.

We  continue to believe it is appropriate that the  Committee  strongly  communicate its  commitment to highly  accommodative policy and  a symmetric 2 percent inflation  target. Our preferred way of doing so is for the  FOMC  to  be  clear  that  as  long  as  the  one- to  two-year-ahead  inflation  outlook  is  below  2 percent, we  will delay liftoff until  labor  markets have regained their full health  as  measured by a broad array  of  indicators. We  assume  that  the  first  rate  increase  will  occur  sometime  in  early  2016;  at  that time, the unemployment  rate is projected to be only two or three  tenths above our 5.2 percent  estimate for the  natural  rate  and  our  outlook  for  inflation  2  years  ahead  will  just  be  reaching  2.0  percent. We believe  it will be appropriate  for  the  path  of  rate  increases  to  be  quite  shallow, at least through  the initial stages  of the normalization  process. This  would  allow  the  Committee  time  to  assess  how  the economy  is performing  under  less  accommodative  financial  conditions  and  to  insure  that  inflation  will actually make it to  target. We  feel this  lift off date and  shallow path for rate increases is appropriate policy  from  a  risk  management  perspective,  as  we  view  the  odds-and  the  costs-of  slipping  back  into the  zero lower bound  as  outweighing  those of inflation running  modestly above 2 percent  for a  couple

of years once the real side of the economy  has  returned  to  full employment. We  feel our rate path better  balances  probability  weighted  costs;  it  also  results  in  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  2017 still being  roughly 1 percentage point below  our  assumption  for  the  long-run neutral rate  even  though our  forecasts  for  unemployment  and  inflation  are  near  their  long-run  policy  goals.

Respondent 10: Output  and  unemployment  gaps  have  declined  over  time  but are still sizeable. Moreover,  my  outlook  for  inflation through  the  end of 2016 is below  our 2 percent  objective. This situation  calls for very  accommodative  monetary  policy. Appropriate  policy  calls  for  delaying  liftoff from  the  zero  lower  bound  until  the  middle  of  2015. My  judgment  on  appropriate  policy  is  generally informed by looking  at simple rules that adjust for the  zero lower bound, as well as by  my  expectations of, and  uncertainty  about,  the  costs  and  benefits  of  continuing  unconventional  actions.

Following  liftoff, my fed funds path through the end of  2016 remains flatter than some simple rules would suggest. In my projection, the reasons include the  following:

- · Although  the  unemployment  rate  by  the  end  of  2016  is  essentially  at  its  long-run  natural  rate, broader  measures  of  slack  (including  the  share  of  long-term  unemployment)  take  a  bit  longer  to return  to  normal,  reflecting  the  dynamics  of  the  labor  market.
- · Some  headwinds  have  not  fully  abated  by  2016,  such  as  credit  availability  for  small  businesses. These continue to modestly reduce the equilibrium real interest rate relative to its long-run value.
- · In an environment in which  short-term rates have been  near  zero  for  almost seven years, there are potentially  some  modest benefits  to having  an  earlier  liftoff but then a more  gradual  rate path than might normally be called for. These benefits include managing  expectations and minimizing  the  potential  for  disruptions  to  global  financial  markets.

Respondent 11: My  outlook  has  liftoff  for  the  federal  funds  rate  in  September  2015  (to  a  range  of 25-50  basis  points)  and  25  basis  point  increases  at  each  subsequent  meeting  before  reaching  a  range consistent  with  its  appropriate  longer  run  value  in  mid-2017.

I do not expect the funds rate to be at its appropriate longer-run value in 2016. Despite a convergence  of  the  U-3  unemployment  rate  to  its  longer-run  level,  I  expect  that  residual  slack  in  the labor  market  will  still  be  evident.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: The  crucial  factors  behind  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate  path  for  monetary policy and the FFR  are the current state of the economy, our central economic outlook, and our balance of risks around the central outlook. As such, we believe it is important to communciate clearly  to the public  that  these  factors  will  dictate  the  path  of  the  policy  stance. The  changes  along these dimensions were sufficient to  lead to a modest change in our assessment of the appropriate path for the  FFR.

Based  on  our  modal  outlook  and  assuming  that  long-term  inflation  expectations remain  anchored, we still anticipate  that the target range  for the FFR  will  remain  at  its current  level until mid-2015 or a little before. The pace  of  renormalization  of  the target FFR  following  the period  of  near  zero policy rates will then depend  upon  our  assessment  of  economic  conditions  and  the  outlook, longerterm inflation  expectations, and the response of overall financial  conditions to policy tightening. Our current  assessment  of  these  factors is that the pace of tightening  could  be  around  150  bps  over  the first four quarters of the normalization  process, and that the target FFR  range  at  the end of 2016 will be around  2 1 4 / -2 1 2 / %, somewhat  higher  than  our  projection  in  the  June  SEP,  reflecting  our assessment that the FOMC have greater  confidence in its  central forecast and policy strategy in  2016, and  can  thus  proceed  with  normalization  a  little  faster. Nevertheless,  we  still  expect  that  the  pace  of normalization  will probably be slow  compared  to  the pace  of  the  2004-06 policy  tightening  as a  means

to provide  insurance  against  the  various  restraining  forces  still  faced  by  the  U.S.  economy,  especially in the housing  market, which in turn  will help achieve the FOMC's objectives over the longer run. We  thus  continue  to  anticipate  it  will  be  appropriate  to  maintain  the  FFR  below  our  estimate  of  its longer-run level through  2016, but we expect the top of the target range at the end of 2017 to be equal  to  our  estimate  of  the  longer-run  FFR.

Another  factor  informing  our  assessment  of  the  appropriate path  for  the  target FFR is  our  estimate of the equilibrium  real  short-term  interest  rate. We  assume  that  in  normal  times  this  rate  is in the range  of  1%  - 3%;  adding  the  objective  for  inflation  (2%)  then  gives  our  estimated  range  for  nominal equilibrium rate as 3.0 -5.0%. The reduction of our potential GDP  growth estimate raises the possibility of some reduction in that range. However, because we already had assessed that the equilibrium rate was more likely to be in the lower half of that range because of the behavior of nominal  and real Treasury yields and productivity growth since the end of the recession, we have maintained  the point estimate of the past several SEPs, as seen in the response to question 3(a). Given the greater  uncertainty  about that  estimate because of  our  assessment of lower potential GDP growth,  we  plan  to  undertake  further  analysis  and  re-assessment  of  this  estimate.

Although  we  do  not  expect  the  need  to  deploy  additional  tools  to  provide  accommodation  in  our modal  outlook, we believe it is still important  for the FOMC  to be prepared to employ  all of  its tools to offset any  downside  risks  to  the  outlook  that  may  be  realized.

Respondent 14: Inflation  and  growth

Respondent 15: By  early  2015, the unemployment  and inflation rates  will be  close to their long-run values. Identical to my  last projection,  lift-off  should occur in Q1/2015.

Respondent 16: Liftoff of the federal funds rate from the zero-lower-bound  occurs in the third quarter of 2015. This is when the economy  is expected to be within one year from reaching full employment. With inflation well below  target and  only a modest  acceleration in the pace of  economic activity, the removal  of  policy  accommodation  occurs  very  gradually  at  first. The  federal  funds  rate is then  raised  at  a  faster  pace  once  the  economy  reaches  full  employment.

Appropriate  Monetary  Policy  -  Balance  Sheet

3(d)&amp;(e). Does  your  view  of  the  appropriate  path  of  the  Federal  Reserve's balance  sheet,  other  than  the  projected  timing  for  implementing  the FOMC's  exit  strategy,  differ  materially  from  that  assumed  by  the  staff  in the  Tealbook? Note  that  the  September  Tealbook  baseline  assumes  that asset  purchases  will  conclude  by  the  end  of  October,  leaving  the cumulative  amount  of  purchases  under  the  current  program  at  close  to $1.5  trillion. If yes, please  specify  in  what  ways  (either  qualitatively,  or  if you  prefer,  quantitatively).

<!-- missing-text -->

Respondent 1: Yes

I think it appropriate  to make  a seamless transition from our current program  of scaling back net new  asset  purchases  to  a  program  of  scaling  back  reinvestment  of  the  proceeds  from  maturing  assets. Reinvestment  purchases  might initially be reduced by a small amount-$10  billion, perhaps. The intent is to put the balance  sheet  on  a predictable,  gradually-declining  path  not  in  any  way  tied  to funds-rate  liftoff.

Respondent 2: Yes

I anticipate following the Commitee's  normalization  principles, but because my  funds rate  path  is steeper than  in the Tealbook,  I anticipate  that we would  reduce  the  size of the balance  sheet  more quickly  than  in  the  Tealbook  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 3:

Respondent 13: No

As  in the  Tealbook,  we  expect  under  our  central  scenario  another  measured  reduction  in  the  pace  of purchases  at  this  meeting,  and  for  the purchase program  to  conclude  after  the October  meeting,  with cumulative  purchases  totaling  about  $1.5  trillion.

We  still  assume  that  reinvestment  continues  until  economic  and  financial  conditions  indicate  that the  exit  from  the  zero  lower  bound  appears  to  be  sustainable  and  the  risks  of  a  reversion  are  deemed to be  negligible. Based  on  our  modal  outlook,  we  expect  those  conditions  to  occur  around  the  time  at which the top of the FFR  range reaches  1.00%, which  would be near the end of  2015. The  timing of the end of reinvestment in our modal scenario is reasonably  close to that in the balance sheet projections shown in Tealbook B. We  continue to believe that there is a significant  signaling effect about the  timing of the end  of reinvestment  such  that  adopting  a  strategy  of  waiting  to  halt  reinvestment  will  reduce appreciably the risk of  an unwarranted pulling  forward of the  expected  lift-off date  and  tightening  in financial  conditions  that  would  ultimately  jeopardize  a  smooth  take-off  of  interest  rates. Consequently, waiting  to  end  reinvestment  until  after normalization has started  will provide some  insurance  that  the take-off  will  take  hold.

More  generally, in our view the balance  sheet  remains  a significant part of the overall stance of policy, and  consequently  also  requires  continued  guidance  about  its  evolution. Even  though  the  bar should be set rather high  to promote  an  active role  for balance sheet policy  as normalization proceeds, its ability to affect term premia  and  financial  conditions  to support  achieving  the FOMC  objectives should  not  be  overlooked  or  dismissed  a  priori.

Forecast  Narratives

4(a). Please  describe  the  key  factors  shaping  your  central  economic outlook  and  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  that  outlook.

Respondent 1: Important  underlying  factors  include  the  continued  healing  of  household  finances, a recent notable decline in investment-grade  corporate  bond  premia, and some  fading of fiscal uncertainty, all of which will feed into a rebound  of business investment. Energy  and  industrial raw materials  prices  remain  tame.

In combination  with  highly  accommodative  monetary  policy,  these  factors  have  moved  us  from  a 'two-steps  forward,  one-step  back'  economy  to  a  'three-steps  forward,  one-step  back'  economy. We can expect to see occasional weak  reports and occasional weak quarters, but  the  economy  is on a firmer footing now  than  it was a year ago, despite  geopolitical risks. Labor-market  slack  continues to diminish, and chances are good  that we will be at or very near most  analysts' estimates of full employment  by  the  end  of  next  year.

On  the  inflation  front,  research  which  suggests  that  the  unemployment  rate  has  lost  its  usefulness as an indicator of near-term  wage  and  price  pressures  is not compelling. The  modest  increase  that we've  seen  in  wage  inflation  so  far  in  this  recovery  is  completely  consistent  with  past  experience. We can  expect  significantly  faster  wage  increases  as  the  unemployment  rate  moves  down. Trimmed-mean PCE  inflation-which  captures  medium-term headline  inflation  trends better  than  conventional  core PCE  inflation-responds  to  changes  in  the  unemployment  rate  as  well  as  to  the  level  of  unemployment. Thanks partly to this effect,  my inflation projection  rises to 2 percent by  2016,  and above 2 percent thereafter.

To  limit  the  overshooting  of  unemployment  and  inflation  to  manageable  levels,  it  is  necessary  that we  achieve  a  neutral  policy  stance  by  the  end  of  2016. The  only  way  to  do  this  without  one  or  more 50-basis-point  hikes  is  to  start  raising  the  policy  rate  in  the  first  quarter  of  2015.

Respondent 2: I expect  the pace of output  growth  to  accelerate  to 3 percent  in the second  half of 2014  as  the  headwinds  that  have  been  holding  down  growth  recede  The  pace  of  growth  then  runs somewhat  above  my  estimate  of  the  longer-run  trend rate of 2.4 percent over 2015 and 2016 before returning to trend in 2017. With a moderate pace  of growth  over  the  forecast  horizon, the labor market  recovery  remains  gradual  -  I  expect  the unemployment  rate  to  move  down  to  about  5.4  percent  by  the  end  of  2015,  essentially  reaching  my estimate  of  the  natural  rate  of  unemployment. I anticipate  that

headline  inflation will rise gradually  to 1.8 percent  in 2014  and  then  run  at 2 percent  pace  over 2015 to  2017. Inflation stays anchored around  my  target of 2 percent in response to tighter  monetary policy  than  that  anticipated  in  the  Tealbook.

In my  view,  the  substantial  liquidity  that  is  now  in  the  financial  system  continues  to  imply  a  risk that  inflation  will rapidly  accelerate to unacceptable levels and that inflation expectations may  become  unanchored. To  ward  off

these  developments,  the  FOMC  will  need  to  commence  a  steady  tightening  of  monetary  policy  by ending  asset purchases  in  2014Q3  and  then  beginning  to  raise  rates  in  2014Q4.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: Population  growth  in  the  16-64  age  group  is likely to be 0.5 percent  or less each year. Real GDP per employee has risen at less than a 1 percent  annual rate over the last 3 years and is unlikely  to  change  dramatically  over  the  forecast  period. Therefore  my  estimate  of  the  medium-term

trend  in  real  GDP  is  about  1  3/4  percent,  which  is  well  below  what  we  have  experienced  in  the  past. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  converge  toward  that  trend  over  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 5: After a strong bounceback  in GDP  in the second quarter from its first-quarter decline, I expect GDP growth to settle in at a  little below 3 percent through  2016, before slowing toward its longer-run normal value. In my projection, the unemployment  rate  continues to decline, reaching its longer-run  normal  value  sometime  in  2016  and  inflation  moves  slowly  back  toward  the  Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective. An  accommodative  monetary policy, some  further easing of credit constraints, and diminishing fiscal drag  will serve as important  factors propelling this expansion. After strengthening  substantially  during  the  second  quarter,  private  final  demand  seems  to  have  softened a little in recent months  on  account  of  PCE  spending. Going  forward,  I expect  PCE  to  accelerate. Factors propelling this pickup in PCE  include  a strnegthening of household  balance sheets due to rising  house  and equity prices, improving prospects  for the  labor  market  and  robust  auto sales driven by low interest rates, readily available credit, and  an aging  fleet generating  substantial  replacement demand.  Residential investment appears to have picked up from its slowdown last  fall and winter and I expect a  continued moderate pace of housing  starts and  considerable growth in residential investment in the second half of this year. Investment in equipment and intangibles advanced at a robust pace in the  second  quarter  and  recent  indicators  point  to  continued  solid  growth  in  this  category  in  the  near term. With  respec  to  the  labor  market,  the  two  most  recent  employment  reports  showed  slightly  lower payroll gains compared to  earlier in the year, and the unemployment rate has temporarily levelled off. Stil, payroll  employment  has  been  rising  at  a  surprisingly  robust  pace  over  the  past  year  given  only moderate  GDP  growth-a  pattern  that  leads  me  to  project  continued  moderate  productivity  growth over  the  next  few  years. I see the current  level  of the  unemployment  rate  as  understating  the  extent of slack in the labor market because I  view  a porion  of  the decline  in the labor force participation rate in recent  years as cyclical and  also see involuntary  parttime  employment  as  still  at  abnormally high levels. I anticipate some  rebound,  or  at least a flattening out of the participation  rate, and  a slower  decline  in  unemployment  going  forward. Inflation  has  been  running  below  the  Commmittee's 2% objective in spite of the  fact that inflation  expectations  are well-anchored. In part, I believe this reflects significant remaining  slack  in  labor  and  product  markets. My  forecast  envisions  a  return  to 2%  inflation  beyond  the  end  of  the  forecast  horizon.

Respondent 6: Like Board staff, I believe  that  the FOMC  will have  to pursue policies  that  lead unemployment  below  the  natural  rate  if  we  are  to  successfully  return  inflation  to  2%. A  major  risk  to my  outlook is that the FOMC  will not be  willing  to  following  such policies.

Respondent 7: Myforecast  for real GDP growth is characterized by above-trend growth of 3 percent in the second  half of 2014, in 2015, and  in 2016. Real  GDP  growth  is  supported  by  income  growth from rising employment  and  wages, rising household wealth,  accommodative financing  conditions,  and the ending  of  fiscal drag. As  the  remaining  economic  slack  declines,  I  expect  the  unemployment  gap to be  nearly  closed  by  the  end  of  2015. Real  GDP  growth  is  likely  to  return  to  its  longer-run  rate  in 2017.

The  contour  of  my  outlook  for  inflation  is  similar  to  June's  outlook  of  a  gradual  rise  in  inflation. The  broad-based  price  increases  over the past several months  have  increased  my  confidence  in  this forecast.

Respondent 8: Growth  in  the  first quarter was hampered by  severe weather, but  growth rebounded in the second quarter. The fundamentals supporting growth  going forward include highly  accommodative monetary  policy,  improving  household  balance  sheets,  strengthening  labor  markets  that  support consumer  spending,  easing  fiscal  headwinds,  and  further  relaxation  of  tight  credit  conditions. Optimism  among  my business  contacts is growing,  with some showing  an increased  willingness to implement

long-shelved investment projects.  Overall, I  expect these forces to support growth slightly above trend and further improvements in labor  markets over the next few years,  with the  economy  reaching  steady state  in 2017.

While  inflation  is below  our  2 percent  goal, year-over-year  PCE  inflation  rates  have  firmed  since the start of the year. Stable inflation expectations  and an improving  economy  are  consistent  with inflation  moving  back  to  the 2 percent  longer-run  objective by  the  end  of  2016. As  inflation  increases, I expect  wage  growth  to  rise  as  well.

I view overall uncertainty as roughly comparable to historical norms of the last 20 years. As described above, risks to my  outlook appear  to be broadly balanced for both the real  economy  and inflation.

Respondent 9: The  key  factors  shaping  our  forecast  are  the  same  as  they  have  been  for  some  time. Accommodative  monetary  policy,  continued  improvement  in  household  and  business  balance  sheets, and  the  diminution  of  fiscal  restraint  should  allow  domestic  demand  to  gain  momentum  as  we  move through  the projection period. Furthermore,  over  time, fewer households  and  small businesses  will find themselves  with  limited  access  to  traditional  credit  markets. Pent-up  demand  for  capital  goods and  consumer  durables  should  provide  further  impetus  to  growth.

These  fundamental  factors  supporting  activity  are  assumed  to  generate  growth  moderately  above potential  over  the  next  2-1/2  years. As  monetary  policy  normalizes  and  cyclical  dynamics  run  their course, growth  moderates  back  towards  potential  in 2017. Our  path  for GDP  closes  resource  gaps by the end of 2016. Resource  slack  thus is expected  to exert a diminishing downward  influence  on inflation as we move through the projection period;  furthermore, we assume inflation  will be pulled up by inflation expectations. In order to achieve our inflation  target, we assume policy normalization does not begin until the one- to two-year-ahead inflation outlook is  clearly headed back  towards 2 percent, and  that  at  least  initially,  the  path  for  rate  increases  will  be  shallow. Given  the  normal  inertia  in  the inflation process, we  could well see some  modest overshooting of  target beyond the projection horizon.

See the description  of  uncertainties  and  risks  in  section  2(b)  above. In addition  to  those  factors, there  is  a good  deal  of  uncertainty  over  how  resilient  the  economy  will  be  to  the  removal  of  monetary accommodation  and  over  the  potential  for  inflation  to  rise  more  rapidly  as  growth  gains  momentum. However,  as  noted  in  3(c)  above,  we  see  the  costs  of  rate  increases  substantially  weighing  on  activity and potentially pushing  us back into the  zero lower bound  as being  much higher than the implications of inflation  moving  up  more  quickly  than  anticipated. We  have  set  our  monetary  policy  assumptions accordingly,  with  a  2016  liftoff  and  shallow path for rate increases, to better  balance the probability weighted  costs.

Respondent 10: The economy  is still recovering from the severe housing collapse and financial crisis. Recoveries  from  these  types  of episodes  are associated  with  sustained  weakness  in  aggregate demand through a variety  of channels, which policy has  only partially offset. Many  of the  associated remaining  headwinds  are  slowly  easing:

- · Housing  has  been  and  continues  to  be  a  headwind. However,  with  household  balance  sheets  as well  as consumer  credit  conditions  improving,  I  expect  this  to  abate;
- · The  drag  from  contractionary  federal  fiscal  policy  is  steadily  diminishing;
- · The  global  economy is  slowly  improving,  and  a  severe  crisis  in  Europe  or  emerging  markets  looks less likely over time. Still, the durability  of  the European  recovery  is  uncertain,  and  deflationary risks are substantial. Potential  financial disruptions  in emerging  markets  and  geopolitical tensions  are  also  concerns;
- · Policy  uncertainty  is  back  to  fairly  normal  levels.

In this environment, I  expect  the  economic  recovery  will proceed  at a  moderate pace,  which  will allow  us  to  continue  to  make progress  on  closing  output  and  unemployment  gaps  over  the  next  couple

of years. Even with substantial monetary  stimulus, it will take a sustained period of above-trend growth  to  return  the  economy  to  full  employment.

In terms  of  inflation,  significant  slack  in  labor  and  goods  markets  and  mostly  subdued  commodity and import prices should keep inflation below the FOMC's  2  percent  inflation target for the next couple  of years. Well-anchored  inflation  expectations  and diminishing  slack  eventually pull  inflation back  to  our  objective.

Respondent 11: I am holding  to my previous forecast which  calls for a 3 percent  run-rate in output growth  over  the next several quarters, a further reduction  of labor market  slack, and  inflation that gradually  converges  to  target.

My  medium-term  outlook  is  supported  by  continued  capital  expansion, ongoing  strength  in the industrial sector, and a strengthening  in consumer  spending. Despite some  recent softness in consumer  spending  (which  appears  to  be  at  odds  with  more  favorable  fundamentals),  my  medium-term outlook  for  consumption growth reflects a  more robust pace of disposable income growth  amid further improvement  in  household  wealth  and  consumer  sentiment.

The risks to my  growth outlook remain balanced. I cannot dismiss the possibility that recent weakness  in  consumer  spending  will prove  to be  more persistent  than  what I project  in my baseline outlook. I am also treating the deteriorating  economic prospects in the euro area as a renewed downside risk. Further weakness in the euro area  could dampen prospects for US exports and  could also  lead to disruptions  in  European  financial  markets  which  could  spill  over  into  US  and  other  financial  markets. On  the  other  hand,  many  major  economic  indicators  have  improved  markedly  and  may  be  signaling an  even  faster pace  of  activity  than  I'm  currently projecting  in my  baseline  outlook.

I judge  the  risks  around  my  inflation  outlook  as  balanced. The  uncertainty  regarding  the  amount of slack in the economy  suggests  risks  on  either  side  of  my  baseline  inflation  projection. On  the  one hand,  despite  improvement  in  the  unemployment  rate,  wage  growth  remains  modest  and  alternative measures  of labor market slack are still stubbornly above their pre-recession levels. On  the other hand,  slow  labor  productivity  growth  is  suggestive  of  lower  potential  output.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: Since the end of the recession, the U.S.  economy has grown at a  compound  annual rate of 2.2%, which  is only modestly  above  our  revised  estimate  of 2%  for the economy's  potential growth  rate. Several times in this expansion  it has appeared  that  real growth  was  on the verge of breaking  through  the  various  headwinds  that  were  restraining  it;  however,  each  time  some  shock  or  a tightening  of  fiscal  policy  has  pushed  the  economy  back  to  the  moderate  growth  path.

We now appear to be again at one of those points when several  economic indicators are suggesting a pickup  in  the growth rate  of real GDP.  In particular, recent high  frequency data suggest  that business fixed  investment  may  finally  be  moving  to  a  higher  growth  path,  which  is  probably  necessary  for  the U.S.  economy  to  move  to  a  higher  growth  path  on  a  sustained  basis.

These recent events are consistent with our long-standing narrative for the U.S. economy: the headwinds  that  have restrained growth  over the past several years will gradually subside, allowing improved  underlying  fundamentals  to  exert  themselves  more  forcefully. These  improved  fundamentals include  stronger  household  balance  sheets  combined  with  gradually  improving  credit  access. In addition, while  mortgage underwriting  standards remain quite tight, the excess supply of housing  has been worked  off, and both home  prices and rents suggest that housing supply is not keeping pace with  demand. As  demonstrated  by  financial  markets  conditions  and  the  surge  of  M&amp;amp;A  activity, market participants  are demonstrating  a  greater  risk  appetite. Finally, fiscal consolidation  at both the  federal  and  the  state  and  local  levels  has  largely  run  its  course.

Despite  these  positive  developments,  we  now  expect  the  path  of  real  PCE  to  be  somewhat  softer compared  to  projections  from  earlier  in  the  year, even  after accounting  for  the  recently  released  Q2

QSS and  August  retail  sales  data. Over  the  second  half  of  2013  real  PCE  growth  moved  up  to  nearly 3%  (annual  rate), the highest since 2010. The  personal  saving  rate, which  had  averaged  7.6%  over 2012H2,  had  fallen  to  4.4%  in  2013Q4,  a  level  consistent  with  the  historical  relationship  between  the personal saving rate and household net worth. However, over 2014H1  the saving rate has moved higher  and  is  likely  to  reach  5.6%  for  2014Q3,  even  as  household  net  worth  has  continued  to  rise. The personal  saving  rate  thus  is at least 2 percentage  points  above  what  the  historical  relationship  with household  net  worth  would  suggest. This  is  consistent  with  the  view  that,  in  the  wake  of  the  financial crisis and the sluggish recovery to date, households  have higher than normal  precautionary  saving demand.

Another reason to dampen the projected path of real  PCE is that the growth impulse from the consumer  durable  goods  cycle  is  likely  to  soften. Sales  of  motor  vehicles  have  steadily  recovered  from the  recession's  depths  to  an  average  of  17.0  million  units  (annual  rate)  over  the  three  months  ending in August. At this level, the additional  upside  potential  to  these  sales is limited, and  thus  it seems unlikely  that  they  can  continue  to  grow  at  the  10  percent  rate  of  the  past  year.

Putting  it  together,  we  now  project  that  real  GDP  will  grow  at  an  annual  rate  of  just  under  3% over 2014H2, bringing the 2014 Q4/Q4  growth  rate  to 1.9%. We  anticipate that growth  will pick up  a little further  from  the  2014H2  pace  in  2015  to  3.2%  (Q4/Q4),  and  then  slow  to  around  2 1 2 / % in 2016 as rising interest rates begin to have an effect. The  unemployment  rate  declines  over  that period but at a  more gradual rate than over the past year, reflecting  our assumptions of some cyclical improvement  in  productivity  growth  and  gradual  increases  in  the  labor  force  participation  rate  and the average workweek: the unemployment rate is projected to decline to 5 1 2 / %  in  2015Q4  and  then to 5 1 4 / %,  our  estimate  of  the  natural  rate,  in  2016Q4. With  little  remaining  slack  and  inflation  at  its objective, we project that real GDP growth in  2017  will equal potential growth  and the unemployment rate  will remain  at  its  natural  rate.

Our  corresponding  inflation forecast is essentially unchanged  from  June. Core PCE  inflation is expected to increase gradually over the forecast horizon and  to be close to the FOMC objective in  2016. In addition to the gradual reduction of slack, the slow rise of inflation is due to rising  marginal  costs of production  and a slowly depreciating  exchange value of the dollar. Long-term inflation  expectations, a key driver of the inflation process, are assumed to be well anchored over the forecast horizon,  limiting the  increase  in  inflation  set  in  motion  by  these  other  forces.

Respondent 14: The  fan charts  on page  60  of Tealbook A  remind  one  of  the  enormous uncertainty about forecasts even a year ahead. This allows me to put  more weight  on impressions I have formed of the general direction of developments, based on the past and  on recent changes in key  macro variables and  trends.

Respondent 15: As  I anticipated,  the  weak  economic  performance  in  Q1/2014  was  temporary. I see sufficient momentum  and  monetary  accommodation  to  project  that  unemployment  and  inflation will be  close  to their  long-run  values  by  late  2014/early  2015.

Respondent 16: After a disappointing first half, the pace of growth in  economy activity is expected to accelerate in the second half of this year. This acceleration should ultimately lead to a broadbased and sustained recovery in 2015-16. While there are signs that point to some improvement in demand  going forward, the strength and durability of the projected pickup in activity remains uncertain. Consumers  remain  cautious  despite  relatively  healthy  gains  in  real  disposable  income  so far this year. The lack of availability  of  mortgage credit to individuals  with FICO scores below 640 is disproportionately affecting younger people, and  could be an important  factor behind the slow pace of household  formation  and  slow  recovery  in  residential  investment. Too,  the  recent  disappointing  news concerning  euro-area growth highlights the possibility of a further appreciation of the dollar and  more drag  to  growth  from  net  exports.

In all, we  expect that the projected  acceleration in  economic  activity  will be  modest by  historical standards. Support  from  net  worth  and  continued  improvements  in  the  labor  market  should  provide room  for  somewhat  faster  growth  in  household  expenditures,  even  taking  into  account  the  possibility of increased  risk  aversion  following the  financial  crisis. The  acceleration  in  the  investment  components of demand  is  expected  to lag, since the expansion  in the availability of mortgage  credit  is likely to be gradual  and  large  investment  spending  decisions  are  likely  occur  only  once  uncertainty  about  the sustainability of a more  robust  recovery  has  dissipated. We  judge  that  the most  recent  readings  of the  unemployment  rate  are  understating  the  extent  of  labor  market  slack. Moreover,  with  continued improvements  in  the  labor  market,  we  expect  the  relationship  between  the  unemployment  rate  and GDP  growth  to  revert to historical norms. For these reasons, we project a gradual decline in the unemployment  rate even with the economy poised to accelerate some. By the end of 2017, the unemployment  rate is expected to be somewhat  below the level consistent with full employment, with inflation  still running below  target. In a context of growth  modestly above potential  and  little inflationary pressures,  monetary policy  can afford to be patient at first when removing  accommodation. Liftoff  from  the  zero-lower-bound  is  expected  to  occur  in  the  third quarter  of  2015,  once  the  economy is projected to be about one year  away  from reaching  full employment. As the  economy gets  close to full employment,  the  removal  of  policy  accommodation  occurs  at  a  faster  pace.

While there are upside risks to our growth outlook, the pattern in the recovery  so  far has been one of growth  consistently below our expectations. The possibility of Europe being mired in a long-lasting slump is also a reminder of the persistence of adverse scenarios where policy may  not provide an adequate offset. As a result, we view the risks to the growth outlook as  tilted slightly to the downside. In this context, the risks to the unemployment  rate  outlook  are  broadly  balanced,  as  disappointing growth  outcomes  are  balanced  by  the  possibility that downside  surprises  to the the unemployment rate  will  persist. Risks  to  the  inflation  outlook  are  skewed  to  the  downside,  since  the  extent  to  which long-run  inflation  expectations  can  anchor  inflation  remains  uncertain.

Respondent 17: My  expectation continues to be for a path of moderate  recovery as household deleveraging  continues  and  as  fiscal  contraction  loosens. However,  the  mixed  data  of  the  intermeeting period  particularly  the last two  jobs reports  underscore  just  how  moderate  the  recovery  is, and how  it  may  still  be  susceptible  to  the  fits  and  starts  pattern  observed  over  the  last  few  years.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(b). Please  describe  the  key  factors  causing  your  forecasts  to  change since  the  previous  SEP.

Respondent 1: In June I  was  less optimistic about growth prospects than was the Tealbook.  Boardstaff projections have since  moved in my direction. More  generally, the  economy has been  evolving much  as I had expected, and I have not  felt compelled to make significant adjustments to any  of the real-activity,  inflation,  or  policy  projections  I  submitted  in  June.

I heavily  discount  the  August  non-farm  jobs  report. One  has  to  go  all the way  back  to  JanuaryJuly, 1997  to find seven straight months  with  non-farm  job  increases  in  excess of 200K.  It's hardly earthshaking  to  see  'only'  142K  jobs  added  in  August,  2014  following  six  straight  months  of  strong gains.

Respondent 2: Based  on the incoming data  and  my projection  for the pace of growth over the next 3 years  I have  revised  down  slightly  my  path  for  the  unemployment  rrate.

Respondent 3:

N/A

Respondent 4:

N/A

Respondent 5: My forecast has changed only a little since June. My projected path for the unemployment  rate  is  essentially  unchanged  beyond  the  near-term,  whereas  GDP  growth  is  slightly lower, on balance, over the forecast horizon, in light of incoming data suggesting continued slow productivity  growth, and my  projection  for inflation is just a little higher, as I expect  increasingly tight resource uitlization  to support the return of inflation to  our 2 percent objective.

Respondent 6: There  has  been  little  change  in  my  forecast,  except  that  as  described  above,  I  took on board the change in the staff's  assessment of underlying  inflation.

Respondent 7: The  information  received  since  June  suggests  a lower path  of the unemployment rate  in 2014  and  2015. Because  of  the  faster-than-expected  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions, the likely end of asset purchases in October, and  my  increased  confidence in the inflation outlook that stems  from  the  firming  of  recent  inflation  readings,  I  now  expect  an  earlier  time  of  lift-off, in March 2015,  will  be  appropriate.

Respondent 8: My  forecast is little changed  from  the previous SEP.  Growth  in the first half of this year  was  slightly  weaker,  on  net,  than  I  had  anticipated,  but  I  do  not  see  this  as  carrying  much signal for the outlook  going  forward. The  unemployment  rate  has  moved  down  slightly  more  than  I anticipated  in  June,  causing  me  to  slightly  lower  the  path  for  the  unemployment  rate  throughout  the forecast  horizon. Inflation  data  have  come  in  roughly  as  expected  so  I  have  not  changed  my  inflation projection.

Respondent 9: Our  outlook  for  growth  in  2014  is  essentially  unchanged  although  the  first  half  of the year looks to have been  a bit stronger than we had projected  while  the second half is looking marginally softer. The  composition  of growth  is different, however, as the incoming  data point to less consumer  spending  but  stronger  outlays  for  fixed  investment  and  inventories  (for the year as a whole). We  do  not,  however,  see  large  implications  of  these  changes  for  the  projection  beyond  2104. The  unemployment  rate  has  come  down  a  touch  more  than  we  expected  in  June,  and  inflation  has

been  a  touch  higher,  and  we've  carried  these  through  to  corresponding  small  changes  in  our  outlook for the year  as a whole. Our  2015  and  2016  projections  for  growth,  labor  markets,  and  inflation  are essentially  unchanged  from  June. We  have  made  no  material  changes  to  our  assumptions  concerning policy  or  financial  market  developments.

Since June, our business  contacts  have become  more  uniformly  optimistic, and we feel that the downside risks to the projection  for growth have diminished since our previous SEP submission.  They continue to report little or no inflationary pressures, and so have not allayed our concerns about downside  risks  to  the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 10: Since June, I have made only modest changes to the broad  contours of my forecast. The  economy  has rebounded strongly in the second quarter and is poised to  continue to grow steadily over the remainder  of the year. On  net, my  GDP  forecast  for 2014 is only slightly weaker  than  in June. This  minor downward  revision is because recent data  on  consumer  spending  fell  a bit short of my  expectations. The  overall pace of the recovery, however, remains  strong enough  to continue to bring  the  unemployment  rate  down.

The  unemployment  rate  is  slightly  lower  than  what  I  expected  in  June,  leading  me  to  nudge  down its projected path. I currently expect the unemployment  rate  to reach its longer-run value of 5.2 percent before  the  end  of  2016. However, I  expect broader  measures  of  labor  market slack  to  come down  a  bit  slower  than  the  unemployment  rate.

Finally, recent data on core and overall inflation were in line with my expectations. That, in combination  with the fact that my forecast for GDP has not changed substantially over the past three months,  means  that  my  outlook  for  inflation  is  essentially  unchanged  compared  to  that  in  June.

Respondent 11: My  forecast  today  is  essentially  the  same  as  it  was  in  June. My  growth  forecast for 2014  is 2.2 percent, up 0.2 percentage  points  from  my  last  submission. I have not adjusted  my inflation  forecast,  as  recent  readings  are,  on  balance,  consistent  with  my  previous  projection.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: The  revisions  to  our  GDP  projections  were  strongly  influenced  by  the  soft  PCE data  so far this year: through  July, real PCE  has  risen  at a 1 1 4 / %  annual  rate  this year. We  thus have  marked  down  our  real  PCE  forecasts  over  the  forecast  horizon. This  change  was  offset  partially by  a  mark-up  in  business  fixed  investment,  as  the  data  we  have  received  on  this  component  have  been somewhat  stronger  than  we  had  anticipated.

Much  like  the  Tealbook,  we  saw  the  July  and  August  labor  market  reports  as  indicating  somewhat slower  improvement  in  labor  market  conditions  than  was  observed  in Q2. Combined  with  the  slower GDP  growth  in  2014H2  and  2015  (and  slightly  stronger  cyclical  rebound  in  productivity  growth),  we project a somewhat slower decline in the unemployment rate through  2015.

Our revision  to the  estimate of potential GDP growth reflects the sizable decline in the unemployment rate over this  expansion  even  as GDP growth has been  moderate,  mitigated by  our  assessment that part of the declines in the labor force participation  rate and in the growth  rate of the capital stock  reflect cyclical  factors. Separate analysis also indicates that there is a very high probability that the U.S. economy  is in a low trend productivity  growth  state, which  also affects our assessment  of potential  GDP  growth.

Respondent 14: For  the  same  reasons  as  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 15: The  weak  economic  growth  in  Q1/2014  caused  small  markdowns  of  growth  for the  first half of 2014  as  well  as  for the  entire  year.

Respondent 16: The projected pace  of growth over the  forecast horizon is now slower relative to the June projection. This mainly reflects a downward revision to potential GDP growth  over  the period  2014-16. The  expected path  for  the  unemployment  rate  is  more  favorable,  as  a  result  of  lowerthan-expected  unemployment rate readings so far this year. There have been  no  material changes to the  inflation  outlook.

Respondent 17: My  forecast hasn't actually changed  materially since June. The  little burst of pretty  good  data  and  then  the  little  burst  of  not-so-good  data  have  almost  evened  out. I have  marked down  a bit  my  expectations  for growth  in the next couple of years on the assumption  that  growth potential  is  a  bit lower  than  I  had  previously  been  assumiing.

Forecast  Narratives  (continued)

4(c). Please  describe any  important  differences  between  your  current economic  forecast  and  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 1: I believe longer-term  inflation expectations  are  currently  well anchored  at  a rate consistent with the Committee's  inflation objective. I'm convinced  that in the near term inflation responds  to changes  in slack as well as the level of slack. I prefer to use the trimmed-mean  as  my measure of core inflation, rather than strip out food and energy price increases. For all of these reasons,  I  see  inflation  rising  farther  and  faster  than  does  the  Tealbook.

At the same  time, I believe that increases in the unemployment rate are difficult to  contain  once they  begin. An  implication  is  that  the  risks  to  misestimating  slack  are  asymmetric: It is substantially more  dangerous  to  overestimate  slack  than  to  underestimate  it.

Because I anticipate a higher inflation path than does the Tealbook, and because I see both substantially  less  benefit  from  overshooting  full  employment  and  substantially  greater  risk,  I  believe it is appropriate  for  monetary  policy  to  move  more  rapidly  to  a  neutral  policy  stance.

Respondent 2: My  forecast  calls  for  higher  inflation  and  tighter  monetary  policy  over  the  forecast horizon  than  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 3: N/A

Respondent 4: The  Tealbook  assumes  a  significant  acceleration  in  productivity  growth,  while  I'm projecting productivity  to  grow  at  about  the  average  rate  we've  seen  since  the  recession. In addition, the Tealbook projects GDP  growth substiantially  above potential,  whereas  in my projection,  growth is closer  to  its trend.

Respondent 5:

N/A

Respondent 6:

N/A

Respondent 7: The appropriate path for the federal funds rate in 2015, 2016 and 2017 in my forecast lies above  the Tealbook  forecast. In addition, I expect somewhat  higher  inflation through 2017. I also  do  not  expect  unemployment  to  undershoot  its  longer-run  level.

Respondent 8: My  forecasted outcomes  are broadly similar to those in the Tealbook. I expect that GDP  growth will proceed at an above-trend pace from 2014H2 through 2016 and that the unemployment  rate  will  continue to decline. However, my forecast  calls  for somewhat  more inflationary pressure  than  the  Tealbook  forecast. I expect  that  inflation  will  return  to  our  2  percent  longer-term objective by the  end of  2016. Compared  with Tealbook, this firmer path  for inflation  calls  for a steeper path  for  the  funds  rate.

Respondent 9: We  assume  that  the  first  increase  in  the  funds  rate  will  occur  early  in  2016,  three quarters  later  than  the  Tealbook. Our  rate  of  increase  after  liftoff  is similar. Accordingly,  at  the  end of the projection period  our  assumed  level of the funds rate  only reaches  2.75 percent.

Our projection for growth in  2014:H2 is a  touch below the (modified) Tealbook.  Our projection for growth  in  2015-2017  averages  about 1 4 / percentage  point  stronger  than  the  Tealbook. The  difference essentially  reflects  our  somewhat  faster  assumption  for  the  growth  rate  of  potential  output  over  that period. We  also do not see  current  tensions between a broad view of  labor  market indicators  and GDP

being  as large as the Tealbook does, and  so we are  comfortable with an estimate of the current output gap that is somewhat larger.  Accordingly, we do not project much  overshooting of potential by the end of the projection period, and while our  NAIRUs are the same,  our projection for the unemployment rate  is a couple  of  tenths  higher. Our  projection  for  inflation  is  similar  to  the  Tealbook.

Respondent 10: My  forecast is broadly similar to the Tealbook projection. One notable difference is that  the  Tealbook  has  a  much  more  protracted  return  of  inflation  to  the  FOMC's  stated  2  percent objective. Also, the Tealbook  assumes  an overshoot  of  employment  above  full  employment  (that  is, the  unemployment  rate  falls  significantly  below  the  natural  rate)  that  is  not  mirrored  in  my  forecast with  appropriate  monetary  policy.

Respondent 11: My growth and  unemployment projections are not  materially different from those in the Tealbook  for  all forecast horizons. I do not share the  Board staff's  assessment that inflation expectations  are  misaligned  with  the FOMC's  explicit  inflation  objective. As such,  inflation  reaches 2.0 percent  in  my  outlook  by  2016.

Respondent 12: N/A

Respondent 13: The  general  contours  of  our  and  the  Tealbook  forecasts  for  real  GDP  growth  are roughly  similar,  so  the  differences  are  more  in  the  details. Our  forecast  for  real  GDP  growth  in  2015 is somewhat  above  that  of  the  Tealbook. The  most  notable  factors  for this difference appear  to be business fixed investment  and net  exports. The Tealbook projects  slower  growth in business fixed investment  in  2015  than  in  our  forecast;  the  reason  for  this  difference  is  not  immediately  clear,  but  it may  in  part  reflect the Tealbook  assessment  that  the  capital  stock  is  fairly  close  to  levels  consistent with its assessment of potential growth. For net exports, the Tealbook appears to have imports increasing  faster  than  in our projection,  which  may  reflect  some  larger  effects  of dollar appreciation than  in  our  forecast. These  factors  are  offset  partially  by  faster  consumption  growth  in  the  Tealbook forecast,  a long-standing  difference  with  our  forecast,  in  part  reflecting  stronger  wealth  effects  in  the Tealbook forecast. For 2016, real GDP  growth  in our projection is modestly below the Tealbook forecast: again,  our  consumption  forecast  is  lower  than  the  Tealbook's,  while  our  investment  forecast is higher.

One other difference to note in the real  activity forecasts is that the path of personal saving  rate in our  forecast  lies  above  that  in  the  Tealbook  forecast: we  have  taken  on  board  to  a  greater  extent  the rise of the personal saving  rate in the first half of this year than has the Tealbook. As we noted in  4(a), the higher  saving  rate  can  be  explained  through  a  stronger  precautionary  saving  motive;  however,  it does  represent  an  upside  risk to our consumption  forecast  if  that  motive  weakens  along  the  lines  of the  Tealbook  forecast.

More  fundamental  differences  in  the  two  forecasts  are  in  the  paths  of  the  unemployment  rate  and inflation. Although  less  so  than  in  the  July  Tealbook,  the  Tealbook  forecasts  that  the  unemployment rate will be below its natural rate assumption  for a prolonged  period, whereas  we project the unemployment rate to  fall to its natural rate  and then remain there. This difference appears to reflect differing views  about  inflation  dynamics. In the Tealbook,  with  the  underlying  inflation  rate  below the FOMC  longer-run objective, a prolonged period of low unemployment (and  a positive output gap) appears  to  be  necessary  to  induce  inflation  to  rise  toward  the  longer-run  inflation  goal-even  then,  inflation does not approach the goal until  2019. In our framework,  with anchored inflation expectations and  little  slack  by  the  end  of  2016,  we  anticipate  inflation  to  be  essentially  at  the  longer-run  goal,  and thus unemployment is not expected to  fall below the natural rate. The faster return of inflation to its goal  in  our  forecast reflects  our  assumptions  about  inflation persistence  and  the strength  of  attraction provided by  anchored  inflation  expections.

In terms  of  the  uncertainty  and  risk  assessment,  we  see  some  differences  between  the  two  projections. On  the  real side, although  we  see  modestly  less  uncertainty  around  the  real  GDP  and  unemployment  forecasts  than  in  June,  we  continue  to  see  it  as higher  than  normal  whereas  the  Tealbook sees uncertainty  at  near  normal  levels. This  assessment  reflects  our  view  that  the  unusual  nature  of the  current  expansion  as well  as a policy  environment  that  is  constrained by  the  effective  lower bound leaves uncertainty about real  activity above even the  more  elevated SEP standard  associated  with the 20-year  window  of  forecast  errors. As  for inflation, our  views  on  the  risk  assessment  are  now  similar to those in the Tealbook  after  a long period  where  we  had  assessed  the uncertainty  as higher than normal.

Respondent 14: No  large  differences.

Respondent 15: In terms of real GDP growth, the key difference involves  timing. I project  more growth  than  the  Tealbook  in  2015  and  less  growth  than  the  Tealbook  in  2016;  however,  total  growth over the two years is quite  close. In  terms of unemployment, I project higher  levels than the Tealbook in 2016,  2017,  and  the  long  run. In terms  of inflation, I project  an overshooting  in  2015  and  then a reduction  in  inflation  during  2016,  with  convergence  to  2  percent  in  2017. Meanwhile,  the  Tealbook projects a slow return to the 2 percent inflation  target in the  long  run.

Respondent 16: The two  forecasts are similar, both on the real and the nominal side. The Tealbook forecast, however,  is  conditioned  on  a  higher  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate  over  the  period  2015-16. Still, by  the  end of  2017 the  expected  level of the  federal funds rate in the two  forecasts is about the same.

Respondent 17: No  major differences  -  only a  few  tenths of a percentage point differences  one way or another
