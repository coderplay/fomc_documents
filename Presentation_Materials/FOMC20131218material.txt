OCTOBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.  Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September October generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand is expanding at a moderate pace.  Indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Available data suggest that  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while but the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices,  Inflation has been running continues to run well below the Committee's longer-run objective, but even though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the continues to see modest downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move and it will monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation is moving back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year since the inception of its current asset purchase program , the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting judges that progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation is not yet sufficient to warrant reducing the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee

- will, at its coming meetings, assess whether incoming information continues to support  the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market s conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective.  Asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular Indeed, to provide additional monetary accommodation , the Committee decided now intends to keep the its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ [ 6 | 5½ ] percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. If inflation remains well contained when the unemployment threshold is reached, as the Committee expects, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators of economic and financial conditions in determining how much longer to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate.  Indicators relevant to a comprehensive assessment of labor market conditions include the level and growth of payroll employment, labor force participation, and measures of hiring and separation.  The Committee expects to be patient in considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate so long as inflation remains well behaved.
- 6. When the Committee eventually decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Consistent with its current economic outlook, the Committee anticipates that keeping the target for the federal funds rate below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time will be appropriate to help achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability.

However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month. In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions, the Committee decided to modestly reduce the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in January, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $35 billion per month rather than $40 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $40 billion per month rather than $45 billion per month. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions The Committee's sizable and stillincreasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger

economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether If incoming information continues to broadly support  the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor s market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective , the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings . However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular,  The Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this also reaffirmed its expectation that the current exceptionally low target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to ¼ percent will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. The Committee now anticipates, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate well past the time that the unemployment rate declines below 6½ percent, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions The Committee's sizable and stillincreasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader

financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  In judging when to moderate the pace of asset purchases, the Committee will, at its coming meetings, assess whether If incoming information continues to broadly support  the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor s market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective , the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in measured steps at future meetings . However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's economic outlook as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

If the Committee judges it appropriate to convert the remainder of its flow-based asset purchase program to a fixed-size program in order to provide certainty about its intentions for bringing the program to a close, it could replace paragraphs 3 and 4 with the following:

- 3 . ′ In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market over the past year, the Committee today is announcing a plan to end its current asset purchase program.  From January through June of 2014, the Committee will add  [ $180 ] billion to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of [ $30 ] billion per month, and also will add [ $180 ] billion to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of [ $30 ] billion per month, bringing the total increase in the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities during 2013 and

If that information is not broadly consistent with the Committee's expectation of continued improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee is prepared to use its policy tools, including additional asset purchases, as appropriate to promote its longer-run goals.

OCTOBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September generally suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace. Indicators of labor market conditions have shown some further improvement, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Available data suggest that household spending and business fixed investment advanced, while the recovery in the housing sector slowed somewhat in recent months.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Apart from fluctuations due to changes in energy prices, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year, the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting the pace of its purchases. Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the continues to see modest downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished, on net, since last fall.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that inflation will move and it will monitor inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation is moving back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. Taking into account the extent of federal fiscal retrenchment over the past year since the inception of its current asset purchase program , the Committee sees the improvement in economic activity and labor market conditions since it began its asset purchase program over that period as consistent with growing underlying strength in the broader economy.  However, the Committee decided to await more evidence that progress will be sustained before adjusting judges that progress toward its objectives for the labor market and inflation is not yet sufficient to warrant reducing the pace of its purchases.  Accordingly, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular Indeed, to provide additional monetary accommodation , the Committee decided now intends to keep the its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ [ 6 | 5½ ] percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments. If inflation remains well contained when the unemployment threshold is reached, as the Committee expects, the Committee will consider a broad range of indicators of economic and financial conditions in determining how much longer to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate.  Indicators relevant to a comprehensive assessment of labor market conditions include the level and growth of payroll employment, labor force participation, and measures of hiring and separation.  The Committee expects to be patient in considering any increase in its target for the federal funds rate so long as inflation remains well behaved.
- 6. When the Committee eventually decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Consistent with its current economic outlook, the Committee anticipates that keeping the target for the federal funds rate below its longer-run normal value for a considerable time will be appropriate to help achieve and maintain maximum employment and price stability.

Statement Regarding Purchases of Treasury Securities and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities

On December 18, 2013, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a pace of about $35 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month, beginning in January 2014.  The existing December schedules for agency MBS purchases at a pace of $40 billion per month and Treasury securities purchases at a pace of $45 billion per month remain in effect until that time.  The FOMC also directed the Desk to maintain its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

Purchases of agency MBS will continue to be concentrated in newly-issued agency MBS in the To-BeAnnounced (TBA) market, and purchases of longer-term Treasury securities will continue to be distributed using the existing set of sectors and approximate weights.  These purchase distributions could change if market conditions warrant.

The amount of agency MBS to be purchased each month and the tentative schedule of Treasury purchase operations for the following calendar month will continue to be announced on or around the last business day of each month.  Additionally, the planned amount of purchases associated with reinvestments of principal payments on holdings of agency securities that are anticipated to take place over each monthly period will be announced on or around the eighth business day of the month.

Consistent with current practices, the purchases of agency MBS and Treasury securities will be conducted with the Federal Reserve's eligible counterparties through a competitive bidding process and results will be published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.  The Desk will continue to publish transaction prices for individual operations at the end of each monthly period. All other purchase details remain the same at this time.

Additional information on the purchases of agency MBS and longer-term Treasury securities can be found in a set of Frequently Asked Questions for each asset class in the following locations:
