- -- Other  U.S. asset prices  could be affected.

<!-- missing-text -->

Implications for U.S.  Economy

<!-- missing-text -->

- * Demand  here  and abroad shifts to U.S.-made goods.
- * U.S.  domestic demand  is reduced relative to  U.S.  production.
- * Fiscal contraction could contribute to domestic demand constraint.
- * Monetary policy maintains full utilization of resources.
- * Sectoral  shifts in  production may  entail adjustment costs.

Disorderly Adjustment

- -- Abrupt  adjustment entails asset price  changes.
- -- Exchange  rate  depreciation at center.
- Magnitude and  pace.
- --  Implications for global asset prices.

*Bank positions netted;  Caribbean and unknown  holdings distributed to other countries pro rata.

Disorderly Adjustment Scenarios

Scenario  1:  30 percent dollar depreciation absent responses in  interest rates. U.S.  and foreign  policy interest rates follow Taylor rule.

Scenario 2: Scenario  1 plus 250 b.p. increase in  U.S.  equity and  bond  premiums. Smaller financial shock in foreign economies.

Scenario  3:  Scenario 2 with  no zero  bound on policy interest  rates (quantitative easing).

Conclusions

- * U.S.  external deficits are  not sustainable.
- * Depreciation in 2002  and 2003 helped slow the widening trade deficit, but no evidence that  adjustment has begun.
- * Substantial further dollar depreciation  is required.
- * Orderly adjustment of 1980s associated with acceleration of foreign activity and brighter investment prospects abroad.
- * Disorderly adjustment more  likely with loss of confidence  in U.S.  policies and prospects.
- --  Contractionary effects could be  greater for foreign  economies.
- --  Asset price  declines depress output at home and abroad.
- --  Dollar depreciation  boosts U.S.  production and damps foreign production.
- * Effect  on  U.S. inflation  is  modest.
