Agenda Item 4: Issues relating to year-end operations

A Proposal to rescind 1977 Guideline:

- Challenge in meeting reserve needs:
- ~Elevated and hard-to-predict reserve needs, double needs are plausible; could be greater prior peak
- ~~Heightened demand for US Treasury securities in flight to quality and liquidity
- Would like to expand pool of collateral available for temporary reserve adding operations to include all federally-sponsored agency securities; including agency pass-through mortgage-backed securities
- Committee vote to rescind should be on the understanding that Desk will continue practice of making no outright purchases of agency securities until so is consistent with Committee's views on the maturity and asset structure of SOMA doing
- ~Minutes could reflect this and appropriate role of System open market operations in the agency market
- In conjunction with use of tri-party custodian arrangements, Desk would be able to accept all securities issued or guaranteed by federalsponsored agencies, as well as Treasury STRIPS .
- B Amendment to Authorization to extend repo maturity to 90 days:
- repo term better suits typical year-end reserve needs and is the market standard contract for 'term'' financing: 90-day
- Would be particularly helpful this year end.

C Amend Authorization to permit reverse repurchase agreements

- Would like to develop contingency for &amp;lt;late-day" operations for end markets year -
- Feasible through use of tri-party arrangements but contingent upon dealer willingness to accommodate our needs;
- operations, through repo, works via tri-party arrangements Adding
- However, in order to execute reserve draining operations through triparty arrangements would have to use 'reverse repo rather than matched sales
- Had been planning to ask Committee to adopt reverse repo in Authorization as part of plans for next-generation trading systems
- Attachment VIII of Aug 17 memo contains proposed language
- ~~suggest maximum maturity be parallel with repo days

D Further discussion of prospects for year-end market strains.

- preference: temporary authority to auction options on repo and on matched-salelreverse repo My
- Purpose to calm expectations; to reduce risk that year-end and early January markets fail to provide effective intermediation
- Details would need to be worked out in discussions with market participants
