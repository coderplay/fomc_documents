- Soft landings, while not common, have occurred
- Soft landings were generally accompanied by pre-emptive tightening and benign shocks
- Tight labor markets have often been associated with rising inflation, both domestically and internationally
- The evidence is ambiguous as to whether tight labor markets cause financial instability or have permanent positive spillovers

4. Parameters of the Phillips Curve Over Time

<!-- missing-text -->

- Many of the inflationary episodes occurred when the inflation process was more sensitive to slack and more persistent (e.g. 1960s and 1970s)
- Committee sometimes underestimated depth of undershoot, in part due to incomplete real-time data
- Monetary policymakers did not always focus on restraining economic activity to avoid inflation

5. Concluding Thoughts

- Changes to the inflation process and inflation below the Committee's objective reduce the probability of a sizable inflationary episode
- We continue to judge that financial stability vulnerabilities are currently at only a moderate level
- There is still substantial uncertainty about the current state of the economy
- The inflation process is not static
- The economy will be subject to shocks

Note: In the two panels above, each circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The red diamonds for each year represent the median of the federal funds rate prescriptions that were derived by taking each participant's projections for the unemployment gap, core PCE inflation, and longer-run nominal federal funds rate for that year and inserting them into the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule. The whiskers represent the central tendency of the prescriptions of the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule using participants' projections. One participant did not submit a longer-run projection for the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 20-21, 2016, meeting, and one participant did not submit such a projection in conjunction with the December 13-14, 2016, meeting.

Fiscal Policy Assumptions

- 路 Nine of you incorporated some change in fiscal policy in your baseline projections.
- - Most of this group assumed that the fiscal stimulus would be of the same order of magnitude as in the December Tealbook.
- 路 Eight of you did not incorporate a change in fiscal policy in your baseline projections.
- - Many in this group expressed the view that uncertainty surrounding prospective changes in fiscal and other policies is very large or that there is not yet enough information to make a reasonable assumption about the magnitude of the changes.

N OVEMBER 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year. Although the unemployment rate is little changed in recent months, job gains have been solid.  Household spending has been rising moderately but business fixed investment has remained soft.  Inflation has increased somewhat since earlier this year but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved up but remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 录 to 陆 percent.  The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has continued to strengthen but decided, for the time being, to wait for some further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at

auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
