Action on Proposed Adjustments to External Communications Policy for System Staff

June 19, 2012

FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff 1

Preamble

In the course of making monetary policy decisions, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) makes extensive use of background materials prepared by the staff of the Federal Reserve System, and senior staff give regular briefings at FOMC meetings. In addition, staff are directly involved in the implementation and communication of the Committee's policy decisions.

Federal Reserve System staff have contacts with members of the public in the process of gathering information about current economic and financial conditions. In addition, staff synthesize that information using a variety of analytical methods and statistical tools, and the continual refinement of these methods and tools is facilitated by ongoing interactions with academic researchers, staff at foreign central banks, and other outside analysts. Finally, staff play a significant role in helping the public understand the rationale for FOMC decisions. T he principles described below recognize the importance of these activities for monetary policymaking and are not intended to inhibit the staff from conducting or broadly disseminating economic research or from carrying out other appropriate communications with members of the public.

To reinforce the public's confidence in the transparency and integrity of the monetary policy process, the FOMC has established the following principles to govern the public contacts of Federal Reserve System staff who have access to confidential FOMC information. 2 The FOMC maintains responsibility for ensuring that all System staff with such access abide by these principles. Specifically, the President of each Federal Reserve Bank is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality of FOMC information at that Bank and for the conduct and discretion of that Bank's staff with regard to the use of that information, and the Chairman fulfills this role for Board staff.

General Principles

- 1. Federal Reserve staff play a significant role in enhancing public understanding of the FOMC's actions, thereby promoting the effectiveness of monetary policy. In all communications with the public regarding monetary policy issues, members of the official staff should refrain from publicly expressing their own personal opinions or predictions views regarding prospective monetary policy decisions and should never speculate about future monetary policy decisions or actions that have not been announced by the Committee . In explaining the rationale for announced FOMC decisions, staff should draw on Committee communications, the Chairman's press conference remarks, and other published materials as appropriate. Whenever staff make public comments on monetary policy, they should clearly indicate that those comments are solely their own responsibility and should not be interpreted as necessarily representing the views of the FOMC, its principals, or any other person associated with the Federal Reserve System.
- 2. To foster the ongoing frank exchange of views at FOMC meetings, staff will refrain from characterizing such discussions-apart from what has been published in the minutes of each FOMC meeting-in any contact with an individual, firm, or organization outside of the Federal Reserve System.
- 3. To protect the independence of the FOMC's decision making process from short term political --pressures, members of the official staff of the Board and Reserve Banks will follow their respective codes of conduct regarding partisan political activities and strive to avoid any appearance of political partisanship when discussing economic or policy issues in their contacts with the public.
- 4. Staff will carefully safeguard all confidential FOMC information. 3 No confidential information may be released except pursuant to Committee instructions or with written authorization from the Chairman and prompt notification to the Committee.
- 5. To ensure that no member of the public is able to profit financially from acquiring nonpublic information about economic and financial conditions or about the methods and tools that are currently being used to assess those conditions, staff will not provide such information to any individual, firm, or organization outside of the Federal Reserve System unless the information has been cleared for publication and is made widely available to the public. Unless the information has been made widely available to the public, Federal Reserve staff members will refrain from

J

disseminating information outside the Federal Reserve System, such as information about economic and financial conditions or about the methods and tools that are currently being used to assess those conditions, that might allow an individual, firm, or organization to profit financially.

- 6. Staff will strive to ensure that their contacts with members of the public do not provide any profit -making person , firm, or organization with a prestige advantage over its competitors. They will consider this principle carefully and rigorously in considering invitations to speak at meetings sponsored by profit -making organizations and in scheduling meetings with anyone who might benefit financially from apparently exclusive contacts with Federal Reserve staff. -
- 7. To facilitate the effectiveness of the Committee's policy deliberations and the clarity of its communications, staff will observe the blackout period on monetary policy communication that begins on the Tuesday morning of the week at midnight Eastern time seven days prior to each regularly -scheduled FOMC meeting and ends at midnight Eastern Time on the Thursday following next day after the meeting. During each blackout period, staff will refrain from providing information expressing their views or providing analysis to members of the public about macroeconomic or financial developments or about current or prospective monetary policy issues unless that information has already been cleared for publication and made widely available to the public prior to the blackout period. Staff will be able to carry out their responsibilities for public dissemination of published Federal Reserve data and System surveys and reports, including answering technical questions specific to a data release.
- 8. In carrying out their official responsibilities, Federal Reserve staff engage in certain closely held -communications with other parts of the U.S. government, with foreign central banks and governments, and with international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements. In communicating with individuals from such institutions, staff may exchange views on current economic and financial conditions or discuss policy related matters of -interest to the Federal Reserve, including nonpublic information, and such communications are not subject to the blackout period described above. In all such interactions, however, no confidential FOMC information may be released except pursuant to Committee instructions or with written authorization from the Chairman and prompt notification to the Committee.

Practical Examples

To assist Federal Reserve System staff in understanding the application of these principles, the FOMC has considered how the principles should be applied to some common requests for public contact. For example, the following contacts would generally be consistent with the Committee's policy on external communications, as long as the staff member carefully adheres to all of the principles listed above during the contact itself:

J

- 1. A presentation at a widely attended meeting, where the event is organized by a non profit --entity and does not involve fundraising. Such a meeting might be sponsored by an academic institution, non profit organization, or civic or trade association (such as a chamber of -commerce or a state or national bankers' association).
- 2. A private meeting with members of the public-such as bankers, community representatives, industry representatives, or labor representatives-to collect information about current economic and financial conditions, without disseminating any information that is not widely available to the public. Whenever practical, at least two Federal Reserve staff should be present at such a meeting.
- 3. A working paper, presentation, or publication that evaluates the effectiveness of monetary policy actions taken in the past.
- 4. A discussion between Federal Reserve and Treasury staff (including during the blackout period) regarding recent economic and financial developments in a foreign economy, how to interpret them, and their implications for future developments.

In contrast, the following contacts would not be consistent with the principles set out above:

- 1. Disclosure of confidential FOMC information.
- 2. Disclosure or characterization of the views expressed at an FOMC meeting.
- 3. Disclosure of an FOMC participant's personal views on monetary policy that have not previously been communicated to the public.
- 4. Public communications in which a Federal Reserve officer staff member expresses personal opinions about prospective monetary policy decisions.
- 5. A prediction to members of the public about Committee action prior to the Committee's announcement of such decisions.
- 6. A private meeting with selected clients of a regulated entity or financial firm to discuss monetary policy.

Of course, the foregoing examples are not intended to serve as an exhaustive list, and hence good judgment will be essential in applying these principles. Moreover, whenever staff are unsure about whether specific contacts with the public would be appropriate, they should consult in advance with the appropriate staff person or with the head of their respective institution-namely, the Chairman in the case of staff at the Board of Governors, and the President in the case of staff at a Federal Reserve Bank.

Questions for FOMC Discussion on Developing a Consensus Forecast and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report (QMPR)

June 19, 2012

- 1.  Do you think that the development of an FOMC consensus forecast and QMPR would comprise a significant enhancement to the Committee's policy communications?
- 2.  If the Committee decides to explore this initiative further, does it seem reasonable that the Chairman would consult with the Committee in developing the consensus forecast but would have ultimate responsibility for the consensus forecast and the accompanying narrative in the QMPR, which would also convey the diversity of participants' views?
- 3.  Would it be worthwhile to conduct an experimental exercise in conjunction with the July FOMC meeting before deciding whether to proceed any further with this initiative?

APRIL FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.  Labor market conditions have improved in recent months; the unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has picked up somewhat, mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually.  Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

- 4. In the Committee's assessment, the risks to the outlook for growth in output and employment are primarily to the downside, while the risks to the outlook for inflation are roughly balanced. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook for economic activity; these risks have become somewhat greater since earlier this year.  The risk of a sharp increase in the prices of oil and other commodities, which could lead to temporarily higher inflation and temporarily weaker growth, has diminished recently.
- 5. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, and labor-market conditions have improved , on balance, this year in recent months.  The unemployment rate has declined but remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment have Private domestic demand has continued to advance. Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has picked up declined somewhat, mainly reflecting higher lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, However, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually.  Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year is expected to affect inflation only temporarily, and The Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation over the medium term will run at or below about the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger sustainable economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late [ 2014 | 2013 ] .

As rates of resource utilization rise toward levels consistent with maximum employment, the Committee eventually will need to make monetary policy less accommodative in order to ensure that the economy expands at a sustainable pace and to prevent inflation from persistently exceeding its longer-run objective.  In determining the appropriate time to increase its target for the federal funds rate, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including actual and projected labor market conditions, the medium-term outlook for inflation, and the risks to the achievement of the Committee's objectives.

- 4. The Committee also decided to continue its complete at the end of this month the program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as that it announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate necessary to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of maximum employment and price stability.

Operational Plan for Maturity Extension and Reinvestment Initiatives

Statement Regarding Continuation of the Maturity Extension Program

On June 20, 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities.  Specifically, the Desk was directed to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years and to sell or redeem an equal par value of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less.  This continuation of the maturity extension program will proceed at the current pace, adding about $267 billion to the overall size of the program by the end of 2012.

The FOMC also directed the Desk to continue reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) in agency MBS, and to suspend, for the duration of the maturity extension program, rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues at auction.

Purchases of Treasury securities for the maturity extension program will be distributed across five sectors using the same approximate weights that have been used in the purchases to date:

<!-- missing-text -->

- *The on-the-run 10-year note will be considered part of the 8- to 10-year sector.

This distribution could be altered if market conditions warrant.

A combination of sales and redemptions of Treasury securities will be conducted to match the amount of purchases over the program.  Sales of Treasury securities will take place in securities maturing between January 2013 and January 2016. Securities maturing in the second half of 2012 will be redeemed - that is, allowed to mature without reinvestment - since redeeming maturing Treasury securities has a nearly identical effect on the portfolio as selling securities nearing maturity. Once the maturity extension program is completed, the Federal Reserve will hold almost no securities maturing through January 2016.

J

The Desk will continue to publish a tentative schedule of operations for the following calendar month on or around the last business day of each month. The schedule will include the anticipated amount of redemptions, purchases and sales to be conducted, operation dates, settlement dates, security types (nominal coupons or TIPS) to be purchased or sold, the maturity date range of eligible issues, and an expected range for the size of each operation. The next schedule of operations will be released on Friday, June 29.  All other program details remain the same at this time.

Additional details on the program's structure can be found in the revised Frequently Asked Questions for the Maturity Extension Program.
