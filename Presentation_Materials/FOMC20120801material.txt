2. The Case for Simple Rules

- Simple policy rules can,
- - capture most of the benefits of sound policy that policymakers can realistically hope to attain.
- - provide a transparent and predictable link between the policy rate and macroeconomic determinants.
- - provide a useful discipline on the exercise of discretion.

Taylor  1993 ( ) :

𝑅𝑡 = 2.25 + 𝜋𝑡 + 0.5 ( 𝜋𝑡 - 𝜋 ∗ ) + 0.5 𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡

Taylor ( 1999 ) :

𝑅𝑡 = 2.25 + 𝜋𝑡 + 0.5 ( 𝜋𝑡 - 𝜋 ∗ ) + 1.0 𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡

Inertial Taylor  1999 ( ) :

𝑅𝑡 = 0.85 𝑅𝑡-1 +0.15[2.25 + 𝜋𝑡 +0.5( 𝜋𝑡 - 𝜋 ∗ ) + 1.0 𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡 ]

Outcome-based :

𝑅𝑡 = 0.81 𝑅𝑡-1 +0.19[2.25 + 𝜋𝑡 + 0.73( 𝜋𝑡 - 𝜋 ∗ )

+  .94 𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡 +2.72 ∆𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡 + 2.05 ∆ 𝑅𝑡-1 ]

First-difference :

𝑅𝑡 = 𝑅𝑡-1 + 0.5 �𝜋𝑡+3 𝑡 | -𝜋 ∗ � + 0.5 Δ 4 𝑔𝑎𝑝𝑡+3 𝑡 |

Nominal income targeting: 𝑅𝑡 = 0.75 𝑅𝑡-1 +0.25 (2.25 + 𝜋 ∗ + 𝑦𝑛𝑡 - 𝑦𝑛𝑡 ∗ )

𝑅 is the federal funds rate; 𝜋 is generally the trailing, four-quarter rate of core PCE inflation; in the first-difference rule, 𝜋 is the projected four-quarter rate of headline inflation; 𝜋 ∗ is 2, the Committee's inflation target; and 𝑔𝑎𝑝 is the staff estimate of the output gap.  In the nominal income targeting rule, 𝑦𝑛𝑡 is 100 times the log of the level of nominal GDP and 𝑦𝑛𝑡 ∗ is 100 times the log of potential nominal GDP, where potential nominal GDP is defined as potential real GDP multiplied by a price target equal to the GDP price index in the fourth quarter of 2007 and growing thereafter at a rate of 2 percent per year.

Exhibit 2

1. Output Gap Measurement and the First-Difference Rule

- Output gap is subject to substantial measurement error in practice.
- Prescription of the first-difference rule is largely invariant to measured level of the gap.
- In response to realistic measurement error, a substantial response to level of the output gap probably remains appropriate.

Exhibit 3

1. Reasons to Deviate from Standard Simple Rules at Present

- Optimal policy computations (under perfect foresight) suggest maintaining accommodation longer than simple rules suggest.
- Nonstandard structural features of economy at present might warrant deviating.
- Risk management considerations argue for extra accommodation to offset asymmetric risks that bias economy toward effective lower bound.

2. Simple Rules in a Comprehensive Policy Framework

- Research supports that simple rules capture much of what good policy should aspire to in normal times.
- Simple rules could be a useful part of, but are not a substitute for, a comprehensive policy framework.
- Principles of forecast-based targeting could also be a useful part of an overall framework.

Alternative LSAP programs

-  The 'Alternative A' program involves purchasing $600 billion of Treasury securities and $400 billion of agency MBS by the end of the third quarter of 2013.  The maturity distribution of the purchased securities is similar to that under the second LSAP program.
-  The 'greater duration' program involves purchasing $750 billion of Treasury securities and $250 billion of agency MBS by late 2013.  The maturity distribution of the purchased Treasury securities is similar to that under the MEP (that is, longer than under the second LSAP program).
-  Estimated term premium effects of the 'greater duration' programs are approximately twice as large as those under the 'alternative A' program.

JUNE FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately this year.  However, growth in employment has slowed in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Business fixed investment has continued to advance.  Household spending appears to be rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has declined, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.  Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities.  Specifically, the Committee intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less.  This continuation of the maturity extension program should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee is prepared to take further action as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

AUGUST FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

However,  Growth in employment has slowed been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Business fixed investment has continued to advance.  Household spending appears to be has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  Despite some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.

- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities begin a new large-scale asset purchase program . Specifically, the Committee now intends to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years at the current pace and to sell or redeem an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less increase its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about [ $45 ] billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about [ $30 ] billion per month . The Committee anticipates continuing to add to its holdings at least until it observes sustained improvement in labor market conditions, as long as projected medium-term inflation is close to its mandate-consistent level and longer-term inflation expectations remain stable. This continuation of the maturity extension program The increase in the Committee's securities holdings should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates , support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. This new purchase program replaces the previously announced maturity extension program; therefore, the Committee is ending its sales of shorter-term Treasury securities and reinstituting its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee will regularly review the pace and composition of its securities purchases in light of the economic outlook and its ongoing assessments

of the efficacy and costs of the program, and is prepared to take further action make adjustments as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

In a related action, the Board of Governors voted today to reduce the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances from 25 basis points to 15 basis points effective with the reserve maintenance period that begins on August 9, 2012.

- 3'. To support a stronger sustainable economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditionsincluding low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. As rates of resource utilization rise toward levels consistent with maximum employment, the Committee eventually will need to make monetary policy less accommodative in order to ensure that the economy expands at a sustainable pace and to prevent inflation from persistently exceeding its longer-run objective.  In determining the appropriate time to increase its target for the federal funds rate, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including actual and projected labor market conditions, the medium-

term outlook for inflation, and the risks to the achievement of the Committee's objectives.

JUNE 2012 DIRECTIVE

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it began in September to purchase, by the end of June 2012, Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of $400 billion, and to sell Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less with a total face value of $400 billion.  Following the conclusion of these purchases, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion. For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its current policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues.

- 2. Should the Committee proceed with a second experiment? If so, do you have any specific suggestions regarding the design of that experiment and when it should take place?
- 3. If the Committee proceeds with a second experiment, to what extent should participants be expected to provide input to the Chairman in advance of his initial preparation of the consensus forecast? Should a compilation of participants' initial input to the Chairman be circulated to all Committee participants; if so, should it be with or without attribution?
