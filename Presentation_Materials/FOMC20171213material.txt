Note: The data for the actual values of the variables are annual. The percent changes in real GDP and inflation are measured Q4/Q4. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP or the unemployment rate.

The red diamonds for each year represent the median of the federal funds rate prescriptions that were derived by taking each participant's projections for the unemployment gap, core PCE inflation, and longer-run nominal federal funds rate for that year and inserting them into the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule. The whiskers represent the central tendency of the prescriptions of the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule using participants' projections. One participant did not submit a longer-run projection for the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 19-20, 2017, meeting, and one participant did not submit such a projection in conjunction with the December 12-13, 2017, meeting.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real gross domestic product (GDP) from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in table 2 of the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP). Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box 'Forecast Uncertainty' in the SEP.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2 of the Summary of Economic Projections. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

Estimated Recession Probabilities

- Estimate regressions relating financial variables to the event of being in recession at some future date.
- Current probability of a recession occurring over the next four quarters:
- Regression using unadjusted spread: 38%
- Regression using adjusted spread: 2%
- Regression using unadjusted spread and the excess bond premium: 7%

Note: Excess bond premium developed by Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) and updated by Board staff.

Policy Considerations?

- B: A gradual path of removing accommodation appropriate to balance the risks of continuing to miss your inflation objective and an overheated labor market
- C: More urgent need to slow growth in output and employment to sustainable rates
- A: Willingness to tolerate a larger undershooting of the unemployment rate to forestall a decline in inflation expectations

Market Participants' Views

- Conversations with market participants do not reveal heightened concern about the decline in the yield spread

- Low inflation risk premium
- Low global yields and volatility

Although the hurricanes caused a drop in payroll employment in September, the unemployment rate declined further.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in quarters.  Gasoline prices rose in the aftermath of the hurricanes, boosting overall inflation in September; however, inflation for items other than food and energy remained soft.

Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding will continue to affect economic activity, employment, and inflation in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.  Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.

The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.
