Exhibit 1

Alternative Scenarios for Contingency Planning - an Experiment

Main Results from the Survey

- · Nine said scenario 1 (Tealbook baseline) was closest to own modal outlook; most others saw stronger real activity and/or higher inflation
- · Most thought differences across scenarios merited adjustments to their own individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy
- · Ten specifically indicated that additional portfolio actions could be appropriate in some circumstances
- · Enough information provided to infer views on whether the current policy should be maintained, tightened, or eased in each scenario
- o Eleven favored maintaining status quo or easier policy in scenario 1
- o Thirteen favored tighter policy in scenario 2; similar number in scenario 4
- o Twelve favored or would consider an easier policy in scenario 3
- · Several cited risks (e.g., fiscal policy) as influences on their policy assessments

Do Conditions in Scenarios 2 to 4 Warrant a Change in Own Policy Assessment Relative to Scenario 1? (number of responses)

<!-- missing-text -->

Should Policy Be Tighter, Easier, or the Same as Current Policy? 1

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1. Current policy defined as maintaining 'at least through late 2014' language and initiating no new asset purchases or MEP.
- 2. Includes two participants who said they might tighten, in that they would consider pulling forward the current liftoff date.
- 3. Includes two participants who said that they might ease, in that they would consider additional balance sheet actions.

Exhibit 2 Additional Results and Issues

- · Many thought judging appropriate policy responses was difficult without more information for each scenario
- · Frequently mentioned examples of other useful indicators included:
- o Additional inflation measures, house prices, broader range of financial market data, readings on foreign economic conditions, initial claims, and business surveys
- o Anecdotal information from business contacts
- · Some questioned the general design of the exercise
- o Scenario descriptions did not identify fundamental shocks driving each scenario, nor how events would play out
- o Scenarios might be more useful if they provided this information
- · Several participants offered general comments on the potential value of scenario exercises
- o Three said that they might be useful for internal deliberations, but further work was needed before they could be used in public communications
- o Two suggested that such exercises could help to provide information on the Committee's reaction function

Low Interest Rates Could Create New Vulnerabilities

- · Could be one impetus for new financial products
- For example, Exchange Traded Notes offer leveraged returns
- Limited aggregate size, but will monitor growth and complexity
- · Financial institutions look to enhance returns
- Pension funds or insurance companies with target returns may take on excessive risk
- Depository institutions could mismanage the risks of unexpected shifts in the yield curve

MARCH FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately.  Labor market conditions have improved further; the unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance.  The housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has been subdued in recent months, although prices of crude oil and gasoline have increased lately.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects moderate economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets have eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices will push up inflation temporarily, but the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

Labor market conditions have improved further in recent months ; the unemployment rate has declined notably in recent months but remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment have continued to advance.  The housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has been subdued picked up somewhat in recent months, although mainly reflecting higher prices of crude oil and gasoline have increased lately. However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects moderate anticipates that, absent further policy stimulus, economic growth over coming quarters would be unacceptably slow and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will would decline only very gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets have eased, though they continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices earlier this year will push up is reducing consumers' purchasing power while boosting inflation temporarily, but the Committee anticipates that subsequently inflation will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3.1 To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to continue expand its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. After completing the transactions that it announced last September, the Committee intends to purchase, between July 2012 and the end of March 2013, an additional $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years, and to sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 4 years or less.  These transactions should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

- 3.2 To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to continue its purchase an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities by the end of April 2013 . The Committee also will complete the program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as that it announced in September. These transactions should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.
- 4. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions -including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run- are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 5. In judging the appropriate stance of monetary policy, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including rates of resource utilization, the projected pace of improvement in labor market conditions, the contours of the medium-run inflation outlook, the stability of longer-run inflation expectations, and the balance of risks that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.
