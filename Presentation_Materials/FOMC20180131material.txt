A conceptual framework for inflation dynamics

Expectations-augmented Phillips curve:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where:

𝜋𝜋

GAP

𝜋𝜋 𝑒𝑒

Z

𝜀𝜀

core PCE inflation inflation expectations relevant for wage and price setting measure of resource utilization (e.g., the unemployment gap) set of supply shocks (relative energy and import prices) residual

In this framework:

- · Permanent changes in expected inflation eventually pass through one-for-one into actual inflation.
- · If expectations are perfectly anchored, transitory supply shocks and temporary changes in slack have only transitory effects on inflation.

A conceptual framework… (continued)

Accelerationist Phillips curve:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

In an accelerationist model:

- · Inflation expectations reflect actual past inflation.
- · Assuming that the coefficients on lagged inflation sum to one implies that even transitory shocks have permanent effects on inflation.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Observed inflation and the staff framework

An anchored-expectations framework appears to better explain observed inflation dynamics in recent decades.

<!-- missing-text -->

- · Since the mid-1990s, core inflation has been well characterized empirically in terms of transitory fluctuations around a stable long-run trend.
- · The Great Recession appears to have left little, if any, permanent imprint on inflation trend.
- · Movements in long-run expected inflation roughly parallel those in inflation's long-run trend.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Issues associated with the staff framework

The role of inflation expectations and how they are formed

- · Evidence that long-run inflation expectations drive inflation is largely circumstantial; the idea also has weak theoretical support.
- · Not clear which inflation expectations should be most informative for inflation.
- · Constructing a meaningful empirical model of expectations has become essentially impossible.

<!-- missing-text -->

The staff assumes that inflation's trend, ultimately determined by expectations, has been stable for many years at a little below 2 percent and that it will edge up over the medium term.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Issues associated with the staff framework (cont'd)

The effect of slack on inflation

- · The Phillips curve appears relatively flat at present; hence, inflation is not very informative about resource utilization.
- · The staff could be mismeasuring slack.
- · The staff could be wrong about the current or prospective effect of slack on inflation.

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Issues associated with the staff framework (cont'd)

Coefficient stability

- · Given the short sample the staff uses for our empirical inflation models, influential observations can importantly affect the models' estimated coefficients.
- · One example: the effect of the PCE price index for financial services.

Coefficient on labor market slack from two specifications

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Issues associated with the staff framework (cont'd)

The role of wages

- · Labor costs are likely very important for firms' pricing decisions.
- · Empirically, we find little evidence that independent movements in average labor costs have had a material influence on aggregate price inflation in recent years.

Interpreting unexplained movements in inflation

- · They might reflect an incorrect assessment of the effects of fundamental factors.
- · They might reflect a missing fundamental factor.
- · They might reflect idiosyncratic price shocks or simple noise.

Contributions to core PCE inflation

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Alternative explanations for recent low inflation

- · Greater competition.
- · Foreign slack and other global factors might be putting downward pressure on domestic prices beyond what is already captured in the staff framework through exchange rates and import prices.
- · PCE medical services prices have been held down by budgetary pressures at both the federal and state levels.

General forecasting model and established findings

Common specification:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

where π t = inflation, π ˚ = measure of trend, X t ´ 1 contains the t set of economic drivers, and ε t is the residual

- § Basic idea: Inflation contains a slow-moving trend component and a cyclical component

Historically, forecast errors have been sizable

- § But forecasts have been more accurate since 1990 than for most of the 1970s and 1980s

The variation of inflation explained by the model has fallen over time

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

General model and established findings: economic drivers

Many studies have examined the efficacy of output gaps, unemployment gaps, and other indicators for forecasting inflation

Body of evidence in the forecasting literature indicates that including economic drivers typically harms forecast accuracy

- § Drivers are sometimes, but not consistently, helpful
- § One possible explanation: Phillips curve relationship exists but is weak enough to be difficult to consistently see in forecast comparisons

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

General model and established findings: trend inflation

One common approach measures trend inflation with a long-run inflation expectation from a survey

- § Consistent with a common econometric definition of trend as a long-horizon forecast

The other common approach treats the trend as unobserved and estimates it as part of a combined model for actual and trend inflation:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- § Some studies add other indicators - e.g., survey-based long-run inflation expectations or bond yields

Flexible model to assess the relationships among inflation, its trend, and long-run expectations:

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

- § Inflation and inflation expectations can provide useful information on trend inflation
- § Not a structural model of inflation or inflation expectations

Historical estimates from Chan, Clark, and Koop study:

- § Survey expectations improve model fit and trend precision
- § Expectations commonly exceed trend
- § Forecasting performance comparable to literature benchmarks

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Specific estimate of trend inflation: current PCE inflation

<!-- missing-text -->

- § Current point estimate of trend is 1.8 percent
- § Survey expectations exceed trend
- § Estimated trend edged down from 2008 to 2015 and has since remained stable
- § Model forecasts 1.8 percent inflation in 2019-20, with 68 percent confidence interval of 1.0 percent to 2.6 percent

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Model uncertainty

Model-based forecast confidence bands capture uncertainty associated with parameter estimation and the model's error term

Additional uncertainty surrounding the model choice is considerable

- § Choice of any economic drivers: models including them have a fairly poor track record, and many indicators perform comparably
- § Specification of trend: selected econometric trends and survey expectations perform comparably on average, but can yield very different forecasts at a point in time
- § Updated Stock-Watson model forecast of PCE inflation in 2019-20: 1.6 percent
- § Updated Faust-Wright model forecast in 2019-20: 2 percent

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Summary

Recent challenges in forecasting inflation are not unusual

- § Forecast uncertainty remains sizable and consistent with historical norms

It seems premature to conclude that something has gone wrong with all our models

- § Models are no more limited now than before
- § Better models would help, but developing them remains a challenge

The inflation puzzle: Maintaining perspective

- · We have missed our target on the low side for several years
- -Although some of those years featured elevated unemployment, which would imply below-target inflation, other things equal
- · The SEP has over-predicted inflation for several years
- -Perhaps due to a higher natural rate assumption, and some unexpected dollar appreciation

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Explanations for low inflation

- · Temporary factors (cell phone services, import prices, etc.)
- -Centered in spring 2017; if  temporary, should have faded by now in high-frequency data.
- · Small or zero Phillips Curve slope
- · Very  low natural rate of  unemployment
- · Unanchored long-run expectations
- · A change in the mark-up of prices over unit labor costs?

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

What is our model of  inflation?

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Structural versus reduced-form models of  inflation

· Structural model

Committee sets Federal funds rate to affect

(expected rates and) Asset prices , which influence

· Reduced-form model

Inflation tends to revert toward

Long-run expectations (and target?)

(current and expected) Activity gaps , which move

Inflation towards the Committee's

Inflation Target

Long-run expectations depend on central bank actions, realized inflation, and the target

- · This reduced-form model describes the data reasonably well
- · But it doesn't tell monetary policymakers what to do to achieve their desired outcome

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

A shallower Phillips curve?

- · Effect of  gaps on inflation is not easy to discern in the data
- · Coefficient small (-0.1?), but probably not zero

<!-- missing-text -->

What if  there's no role for gaps?

An expectations-only inflation model?

- · Suppose the true gap coefficient is zero
- · Only expectations matter? LR t t E π π =
- · What determines inflation expectations? How does monetary policy influence expectations?
- · Is it reasonable to assume a full de-coupling of  inflation from the real economy?
- -I think it's premature to conclude this
- -But if  so, what are the alternatives?
- · Pure monetarist model? Set money growth = k%
- · Neo-Fisherian model? Funds rate = real rate + inflation

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

How low can the natural rate go?

- · It appears to be lower than we had earlier estimated
- -SEP estimates have dropped significantly over the past five years
- · Still, compensation growth has risen modestly over that period, suggesting we may be a bit below the natural rate
- · How much lower could the natural rate be?
- -Below 4%?

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Dragging the expectations anchor?

- · Some measures of long-run expectations have declined recently
- · Empirical evidence suggests that the marginal predictive power of any of these LR expectations measures is quite small in recent years
- -Thus it is not apparent that LR expectations have dragged inflation down of late

<!-- missing-text -->

Nonlinearities in the response of  inflation to gaps?

- · Several Fed authors have suggested that the Phillips curve slope differs for low, high, and near-zero gaps
- · Evidence:
- -For 1990-2017, magnitude of slope decreases as gap goes from negative to nearzero to positive
- -Risk: Response of inflation may increase as unemployment falls further

<!-- missing-text -->

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)

January 30-31, 2018

Conclusions

- · Recent low inflation does not rank terribly high in the Ripley's Believe-it-or-Not of  Economic Puzzles
- -And it may be too difficult to control inflation to within a few tenths of  a percentage point of  our goal
- · Critically: Inflation is probably still linked to real activity
- -Coefficient small-ish, but could be larger for low unemployment
- -Significant risk to assuming that inflation is decoupled from the real economy if it is not
- · Policy implications:
- -Inflation likely to rise as unemployment remains low/falls further
- -If  so, continued removal of  accommodation will likely be appropriate

Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR) January 30-31, 2018

Questions Regarding Inflation Dynamics

- 1. Do you subscribe to a Phillips Curve type of inflation framework?  Why or why not?
- a. If the answer to (1) is 'yes,' then why do you think inflation has not increased in recent quarters?
- b. If the answer to (1) is 'no,' then what inflation framework do you use for monetary policy purposes?  How does monetary policy influence inflation in this framework?  Does the framework better explain recent inflation data?
- 2. In your view, what role do short-run and long-run inflation expectations play in the wage and price setting process?  How are those expectations formed, and how does monetary policy influence them?  What is your current assessment of inflation expectations?

DECEMBER 2017 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.  Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined this year and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  Hurricane-related disruptions and rebuilding have affected economic activity, employment, and inflation in recent months but have not materially altered the outlook for the national economy.  Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/4 to 1-1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
