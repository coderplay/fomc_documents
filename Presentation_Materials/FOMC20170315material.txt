System Open Market Account Reinvestment Policy

David López-Salido, Jane E. Ihrig, and Julie Ann Remache March 14, 2017

Exhibit 1

The Macroeconomic Effects of a State-Contingent Approach to Ending Reinvestment

Policy Assumptions and Modeling Approach

- ● Two reinvestment policies:
- ● State-contingent policy: Reinvestments cease in the final quarter of the year in which the federal funds rate passes 1‰ or 2‰ percent.
- ● Fixed-date policy (TB baseline): Reinvestments cease at the end of 2017:Q3.
- ● Previous memos analyzed a small number of ''adverse scenarios.''
- ● We use stochastic simulations of FRB/US to consider a wide range of potential scenarios.
- ● FRB/US simulations are combined with the model staff uses to estimate term premium effects of changes in the SOMA portfolio.
- ● Federal funds rate is governed by inertial Taylor (1999) rule.

Results

- ● Inasmuch as the TB baseline projects that the FFR will reach 1‰ percent at the end of 2017:
- ● Under the 1‰ percent policy , about half of the simulations show reinvestment continuing beyond 2017.
- ● Under the 2‰ percent policy , the median date for ending reinvestment is the end of 2018.
- ● Over the entire set of simulations, relative to the fixed-date policy:
- ● The median size of the balance sheet is $525 and $660 billion larger under the 1‰ and 2‰ percent policies, respectively.
- ● Median macroeconomic outcomes differ only slightly under the state-contingent policies.
- ● The state-contingent policies modestly reduce the probability of returning to the ELB.
- ● In ELB episodes, relative to the fixed-date policy, state-contingent policies:
- ● Lead to a median difference in the balance sheet of up to $1.5 trillion;
- ● Produce a small improvement in macroeconomic outcomes.

Caveats

- ● Our results are sensitive to:
- ● The structure of FRB/US and its historical distribution of shocks.
- ● The baseline projection.
- ● The assumed interest rate rule.
- ● A baseline closer to the ELB, or a non-inertial response to recessionary shocks, would imply a larger probability of returning to the ELB.
- ● In such circumstances, policymakers might wish to consider resuming reinvestment or even undertaking new asset purchases to support improved macroeconomic outcomes.

- "Immediate cessation": All maturing securities are redeemed beginning in Q4 2017. .
- "Capped Treasury": Maturing Treasury securities are redeemed up to a maximum of $30 billion per month. .

Questions for Discussion

- (1) What are your views about the factors that should influence the timing of a change to reinvestments? What are your views about the principles that should guide a possible restarting of reinvestments at some point in the future?
- (2)  What are your views regarding the four illustrative options for reinvestments discussed in the staff memo? Are there variations on these basic approaches (or entirely different options) that you believe should be considered?
- (3)  What changes in FOMC statements, minutes, and other communications may be appropriate to provide guidance about the likely timing and other aspects of a change in reinvestment policy? When should such changes in communications be implemented?

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: The data for the actual values of the variables are annual. The percent changes in real GDP and inflation are measured Q4/Q4. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. One participant did not submit longer-run projections for the change in real GDP or the unemployment rate.

Note: In the two panels above, each circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The red diamonds for each year represent the median of the federal funds rate prescriptions that were derived by taking each participant's projections for the unemployment gap, core PCE inflation, and longer-run nominal federal funds rate for that year and inserting them into the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule. The whiskers represent the central tendency of the prescriptions of the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule using participants' projections. One participant did not submit a longer-run projection for the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December 13-14, 2016, meeting, and one participant did not submit such a projection in conjunction with the March 14-15, 2017, meeting.

Note: The blue and red lines in the top panel show actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the percent change in real GDP from the fourth quarter of the previous year to the fourth quarter of the year indicated. The confidence interval around the median projected values is assumed to be symmetric and is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years; more information about these data is available in Table 2. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections; these current assessments are summarized in the lower panels. Generally speaking, participants who judge the uncertainty about their projections as 'broadly similar' to the average levels of the past 20 years would view the width of the confidence interval shown in the historical fan chart as largely consistent with their assessments of the uncertainty about their projections. Likewise, participants who judge the risks to their projections as 'broadly balanced' would view the confidence interval around their projections as approximately symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty and risks in economic projections, see the box 'Forecast Uncertainty.'

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the SEP projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because the SEP projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric, except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation is not intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed on average over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in Table 2. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if it has been truncated at zero.

JANUARY-FEBRUARY 2017 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate stayed near its recent low.  Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment has remained soft.  Measures of consumer and business sentiment have improved of late. Inflation increased in recent quarters but is still below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.  Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1/2 to 3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

MARCH 2017 ALTERNATIVE A
