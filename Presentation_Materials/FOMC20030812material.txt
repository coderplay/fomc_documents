Exhibit 2 Policy Expectations and Choices

<!-- missing-text -->

- *Estimates from federal funds and eurodollar futures, with an allowance for term premia and other adjustments

Arguments for Easier Policy

- Greenbook credible, but prefer more rapid progress against slack and; perhaps; a greater inflation buffer .
- Or may want more insurance.
- Aggregate demand could be weaker than in Greenbook.
- Aggregate supply could be stronger than in Greenbook.

Desk Survey of Primary Dealers

- All 22 dealers expect no policy change at this meeting:
- 16 expect unchanged risk assessment.
- 4 expect growth risks to downside
- 2 expect balanced risks.

Arguments for Unchanged Policy

- Greenbook credible and acceptable.
- Early evidence of accelerating demand.
- More fiscal stimulus coming on line.
- Rise in yields may signal firming economy.
- Apparent rise in inflation expectations.

Assessment of Risks

- Developments over intermeeting period would seem to call for an unchanged assessment of risks.
- Offsetting effects of strong incoming data and backup in rates suggest balanced risks to growth.
- Continued low inflation; strong productivity; weak labor market; and small downward revision to staff forecast suggest downside risks to inflation.
- relatively high hurdle for changing the risk assessment today .
