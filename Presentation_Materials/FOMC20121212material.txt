Summary

- · Developments to date may not signal a notable increase in systemic risk.
- Increased demand for corporate credits reflects, in part, interest on the part of long-term investors.
- Dealers appear to be better managing the pipeline of deals.
- Market participants continue to characterize conditions as significantly tighter than in 2006 and 2007.
- · Some situations bear watching.
- Potential for a disorderly deleveraging could rise if available borrowing capacity were taken up quickly.
- Reversal of inflows into corporate bond and loan funds could strain these markets.
- Some institutions could "reach for yield" in new and difficult-to-detect ways.
- · Overall, low interest rates may be contributing to some increase in willingness to bear risk.

Benefit-cost analysis

benefits and costs depend on the size of the balance sheet ( x)

𝐵 𝐸 𝜋 ( , ) , 𝐶 𝑥 ( )

𝐸 = 𝑒𝑥 + 𝑔 employment depends on size of balance sheet plus other factors ( 𝑔 ) ---suppressing the funds rate

We are likely to learn more about benefits, costs, efficacy, and other factors as x increases

Optimality (ex post)

𝐵′ 𝑒𝑥 ( ∗ + 𝑔 𝑒 ) = 𝐶′ 𝑥 ( ∗ ) suppressing the inflation term (assume in region where more stimulus is helpful; infl expectations captured in 𝐶 )

<!-- formula-not-decoded -->

Evaluating benefits and costs at beginning of program

Benefits

- 1. Forecast-based; unemployment and inflation miss in same direction through 2015
- 2. Efficacy assessment

Costs

- 1. Market function
- 2. Fiscal/capital gains and losses
- 3. Exit (balance sheet normalization)
- 4. Financial stability

Exiting from the program:   Rhetoric should focus on ongoing evaluation of efficacy and costs

- Case 1.     Seeing progress
- a. Because is higher:  'income effect' (-) versus 'substitution effect' (+)
- b. Because

- 𝑔 is higher:   can do less than expected, partially offsetting increase in 𝑔

Case 2.    Limited progress, no identifiable exogenous factor Presumption that 𝑒 is low, costs of program increasing Efficacy, cost language sets predicate for ultimate winddown with 𝐸 ∗ still low

- Case 3.      Progress impeded by identifiable factors 𝑔 (e.g., fiscal cliff)

OCTOBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months.  Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has advanced a bit more quickly, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed.  The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.  Inflation recently picked up somewhat, reflecting higher energy prices.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgagebacked securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.

These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 $100 billion each per month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with [ maintaining satisfactory progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability | its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent ].

OCTOBER 2012 DIRECTIVE

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to continue the maturity extension program it announced in June to purchase Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 6 years to 30 years with a total face value of about $267 billion by the end of December 2012, and to sell or redeem Treasury securities with remaining maturities of approximately 3 years or less with a total face value of about $267 billion.  For the duration of this program, the Committee directs the Desk to suspend its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Desk is also directed to continue purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $40 billion per month.  The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

DRAFT

Statement Regarding Purchases of Treasury Securities and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities

On December 12, 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to purchase longer-term Treasury securities after the maturity extension program is completed at the end of December 2012, initially at a pace of about $45 billion per month.  The FOMC also directed the Desk to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a pace of about $40 billion per month.  These actions should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

The FOMC also directed the Desk to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS, and, in January, to resume rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues at auction.

Beginning in January, the purchases of longer-term Treasury securities will be distributed across 7 sectors based on the following approximate weights:

Under this distribution, the Desk anticipates that the Treasury securities purchased will have an average duration of approximately 9 years, roughly the same as the net of the duration of the securities purchased and sold under the maturity extension program.  The distribution of Treasury securities purchased could change if market conditions warrant.

The Desk will continue to publish a tentative schedule of Treasury purchase operations for the following calendar month on or around the last business day of each month. The schedule will include the anticipated amount of purchases to be conducted, operation dates, settlement dates, security types (nominal coupons or TIPS) to be purchased, the maturity date range of eligible issues, and an expected range for the size of each operation. The next schedule of operations will be released on Monday, December 31.  The amount of additional agency MBS to be purchased each month will also be announced on or around the last business day of the prior month.

Consistent with current practices, the purchases of Treasury securities and agency MBS will be conducted with the Federal Reserve's primary dealers through a competitive bidding process and glyph&lt;c=3,font=/MOAOGM+Calibri&gt;
