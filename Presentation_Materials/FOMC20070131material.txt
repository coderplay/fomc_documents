Should the Committee Change Its Current Practices for the Production and Publication of Forecast-Related Material?

Key Issue

- · The Federal Reserve regularly provides information on the outlook to the public.
- · Effort undertaken with an eye towards advancing the goals of economic performance, public discourse, internal discourse, and efficient operations.
- · But would changing your practices advance these goals further, or achieve a better trade-off?

Three Questions

- 1. What production and publication options are open to the Committee?
- 2. What can we learn from the international experience?
- 3. What governance issues would alternative approaches raise?

Production Options and Their Implications

Three Basic Options

- · Independent (each participant responsible for his or her own forecast)
- · Centralized (FOMC or a subcommittee produces a single forecast)
- · Coordinated (each participant produces own forecast but conditions on a common set of assumptions for factors such as oil prices and fiscal policy)

Implications for Communications and Operational Costs

Publication Options

- · Release more information about individual forecasts?
- · Provide more forecast details?
- · Lengthen the forecast period?
- · Publish information about the outlook more frequently?
- · Publish fan charts and confidence intervals?

Two Options for Setting the Federal Funds Rate

- 1. Condition the outlook on 'appropriate' monetary policy
- · Publishing details about the 'appropriate' funds rate path could facilitate telling a more informative story
- · Forecast might be mistaken as a promise
- · Release might generate public criticism and create political pressures
- 2. Condition the outlook on a flat funds rate or market expectations
- · Might mitigate some of the problems of the 'appropriate' option
- · Would alter nature of the outlook and create communication challenges
- · Would require statement about desirability of the projection
- · Might require providing guidance about a more 'appropriate' path

The Experience of Foreign Central Banks with Published Forecasts

Publication Choices                                 Factors

<!-- missing-text -->

- *Dissents at the Norges Bank are not released until 12 years after publication.
- **External members at the RBA and the Norges Bank are not full-time employees of the central bank and do not necessarily live in the same city.

Consequences of Publishing a Forecast

- Publication is regarded as useful by central banks and obervers:
- --   Central banks have increased the amount of detail.
- --   Observers agree that forecasts have improved communications and accountability.
- We have found very little econometric work on whether publishing forecasts has improved monetary policy communications or economic outcomes:
- --   Publication has nearly always been part of a package.
- --   Econometric evidence does not provide a basis for deciding to publish a forecast.

Exhibit 5 (Last page)

The Role of Economic Forecasts in the Policymaking Process

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1 Does the Committee want to produce a joint forecast or conduct a survey of individual forecasts?
- 2 If the forecasts are done individually, should they be based on common assumptions about some key conditioning factors?
- 3 Should the forecasts be accompanied by a minutes-style narrative description?
- 4 Should the Committee jointly agree on the minutes-style description or delegate the release of it to the Chairman or the staff?
- 5 How frequently should forecasts be made?
- 6 How many years should the forecast cover?
- 7 How many variables should be forecasted?
- 8 Should there be some attempt to convey formally the uncertainty surrounding the forecasts?
