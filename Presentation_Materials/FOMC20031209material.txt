December 9, 2003

Status  Report from  the Working  Group on  Communications

- 1. The Working Group has reduced the many proposed alternatives for the risk assessment  into three  basic types
- * that differ according to their specificity, discussion of levels and changes of output and inflation,  and  length of the time horizon.
- 2. Reserve Bank and  Board  staff will stress test the alternatives
- * under six scenarios that include  likely near-term  course of economy and episodes that have proven challenging.
- 3. Board  staff will prepare  memos  on expediting the  release of the  minutes and enhancing the role of the economic  forecasts of the governors and Reserve  Bank presidents, which the Committee  may consider as a substitute or complement to the proposed  risk assessments.
- 4. This material will be sent to the Committee  in advance of the January meeting.

Proposal A

The Committee  believes that, for the foreseeable future, the risks to inflation relative  to the Committee's  long-run  goal  of price stability are [weighted  toward the downside / balanced / weighted  toward  the  upside]; the risks to real  economic activity relative to the long-run  goal of sustainable economic growth  are [weighted toward  the downside / balanced / weighted toward the upside]; and,  taken together,

o the  risks to  its  objectives are  roughly  in  balance.

o the  risk of inflation becoming  undesirably [high /  low] is the predominant concern.

o the  risk of [unsustainable / weak]  real economic activity is the predominant concern.

This version

- i.i-:* merges  levels and changes

-

- i :*  : alludes to benchmarks in the overall risk assessment
- i*.o :' -uses the "elastic" notion of the foreseeable future

December 9, 2003

Proposal  B

The incoming data over the intermeeting  period  suggests that  output is expanding briskly but that resource  slack remains considerable  and  inflation well contained.

The  probability of economic growth  running above its long-run  sustainable pace  is below / about equal  to / above that of it falling short over the next few quarters. Over the same period, the probability of  inflation rising  is below / about equal to / above that of it declining.  In light of this assessment  and against the backdrop  of its  long-run  goals of price stability and  maximum  employment, the  Committee judges that the risk(s)

- of [increasing pressure on  resources / decreasing pressure on resources] / (and) / [inflation  running  undesirably high / inflation running undesirably low]  is (are)  the more  pressing concern(s)
- 0 the risks to  both of its long-run  goals are  balanced for the foreseeable future.

This version

- * is  explicit about  levels (in  the  first paragraph) and  changes  (in the second paragraph)
- * alludes to  benchmarks in the overall  risk assessment
- * uses a more  specific time frame

December 9, 2003

Proposal C

The incoming data over the intermeeting  period  suggests that output is expanding briskly but that resource  slack remains  considerable  and  inflation well contained. The Committee anticipates  that the stance  of its policy, if maintained,  should foster  a working down of resource  slack over the next two years  and containment of inflation around  its already  low level.

Going forward,  the Committee's  assessment of the  risks to this outlook are such that its forecast of economic growth  for the next two years is [more / equally / less]  likely to be  increased  than  decreased over the next few months. Over the same period, the Committee's  longer-term  outlook for inflation  is [more / equally / less]  likely to  be  increased than decreased. Against the backdrop of its goals  of maximum  sustainable economic growth and  price stability, the  Committee views the risks to its  outlook [for economic activity / for inflation to  be the predominant concern] / [as  balanced].

This version

- * is explicit about levels and changes
- * alludes to benchmarks  in the  first paragraph
- * uses two time  spans (the longer forecast period and the shorter period over which that outlook might change)
- *

emphasizes the Committee's forecast of the economy
