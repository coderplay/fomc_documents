Household Deleveraging and Consumption: Evidence using Aggregate and Household-Level Data

Daniel Cooper Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Exhibits by Kevin Todd

Exhibit 1

Deleveraging Defined

- · Household balance sheet debt adjustment that lowers consumption.
- · Consumption decline exceeds what would be predicted based on current and past changes in income and asset values.
- ◦ Assumes a previous phase of leveraging where households increased consumption through debt accumulation.
- ◦ Leveraging based on expectations about future returns to housing.
- · Heavily indebted households decided that debt burdens were inconsistent with downwardly revised price expectations.

Deleveraging is not:

- · Mortgage charge-offs due to foreclosure
- · Debt reorganization to take advantage of lower interest rates
- · Debt repayment through mortgage amortization
- · Mortgage lenders forcing households to repay debt when house prices fall.

Overview of Presentation

- · Analyze deleveraging at the aggregate and household level.
- · Household-level data come from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.
- · Find little evidence of deleveraging in the micro or macro data.
- · Movements in consumption prior to, during, and following the Great Recession are driven by employment, income, and net worth.

- · More comprehensive consumption data (in addition to food consumption) starting in 1999.
- ◦ Designed to bring coverage more in line with the Consumer Expenditure Survey .
- ◦ Added in 1999: health care, mortgage or rent payments, housing insurance, transportation, child care, schooling, recurring automobile costs, and utilities.
- ◦ Added in 2005: home furnishings, recreation, clothing, and vacations.
- · Most recent data are for 2009.

Exhibit 8

Summary

- · Little empirical evidence during and/or following the Great Recession that factors other than ongoing developments in income and net worth had an impact on consumption.
- · Even if pent-up demand for deleveraging exists, the risks to consumption growth would be limited.
- · The standard relationship linking consumption to income and net worth should continue to be a reasonable predictor of household spending.

The FOMC's Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy

Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and monetary policy strategy.  The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.

- 1. The FOMC is firmly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity facilitates well-informed decision-making by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases the effectiveness of monetary policy, and enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society.
- 2. Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic and financial disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks, including risks to the financial system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.
- 3. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee judges that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.  Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.
- 4. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.  Information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections.  For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, roughly unchanged from last January but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier.
- 5. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. These objectives are generally complementary.  However, under circumstances in which the Committee judges that the objectives are not complementary, it follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.

DECEMBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global growth.  While indicators point to some improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but business fixed investment appears to be increasing less rapidly and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
- 4. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
- 5. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

JANUARY FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some apparent slowing in global growth.  While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to be increasing less rapidly has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has moderated since earlier in the year been subdued in recent months , and longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee continues to expect  a moderate s that, absent further policy action, the pace of economic growth would remain modest over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will would decline only very gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will settle, run at levels   at or [ ] below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to purchase up to an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities by the end of January 2013 . In addition, the Committee intends to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is also maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These programs should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, provide support to mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.

OR

- 3´. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities, initially at a rate of $40 billion per month . The Committee will adjust the pace of purchases and determine the ultimate size of the program in light of the evolving economic outlook and as needed to foster its objectives.  In addition, the Committee intends to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is also

maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These programs should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, provide support to mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.

The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently now anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant this exceptionally low levels range for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013 will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate exceeds [ 6½ ] percent, the inflation rate (as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures) at a horizon of one to two years is projected to be either below or close to [ 2 ] percent, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored . On the basis of currently available information, the Committee expects these conditions to prevail at least through late 2014.
