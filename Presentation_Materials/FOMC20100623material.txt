u.s. vs. Euro Area: Historical Evidence

- · Unemployment shocks less likely to lead to persistently high levels of long-term unemployment in the U.S. than in Europe.
- · Long-term unemployment exerts greater downward pressure on inflation in the U.S. than in Europe.
- · Differences usually attributed to differences in labor market institutions.

Potential Consequences of Long-term Unemployment

- · Depreciation of skills
- · Deterioration in social networks
- · Employer bias against the long-term unemployed
- · Prevents youth from gaining a foothold in the labor market

Banking Sector Vulnerabilities

European Banking Sector Losses

Capital and Loan Loss Reserves 2009

- European banks experienced substantial losses on loans and securities in aftermath of global financial crisis.
- IMF estimated in April that euro-area and U.K. banks faced about $350 billion in additional writedowns on top of the $750 billion they have recognized since 2007.
- Capital, loan loss reserves, and retained earnings should cover expected losses.

Sovereign Support for Banks in 2008

In the fall of 2008, European countries:

- Substantially expanded the maximum amount of retail deposits guaranteed.
- Guaranteed or sold guarantees on nondeposit liabilities, subject to very high caps (e.g. 17% of GDP for France and Germany).
- Allotted sizeable funds for capital injections.

Europe's sovereign debt problems could intensify if:

- Some countries fail to implement fiscal consolidation.
- Banking sector problems become more severe.

European Debt Crisis Scenarios

SIGMA Simulations

Use SIGMA to gauge impact of a European debt crisis scenario:

- Higher sovereign spreads in Europe boost corporate borrowing costs by 275 basis points.
- Euro falls 30 percent against the dollar.
- European fiscal consolidation equal to two percent of GDP.
- Financial and confidence shocks in the United States and the rest of world (ROW).

Benchmark Crisis Scenario

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

- Possible that financial conditions in Europe normalize more quickly.
- Even so, it is desirable for Europe to take additional steps to avoid a crisis:
- Should facilitate efforts of cash-strapped governments to clean up banks.
- Improve transparency to help markets differentiate good from problem banks.
- High value of ''buying time'' to avert an immediate crisis.

APRIL FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is beginning to improve. Growth in household spending has picked up recently but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures is declining and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts have edged up but remain at a depressed level.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
- 2. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longerterm inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
- 3. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
- 4. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term AssetBacked Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR) Authorized for Public Release

JUNE FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen gradually and that the labor market is improving slowly .  Household spending is increasing but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software appears to be rising at a robust pace ; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts remain at a depressed level.  Financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad, and bank lending continues to contract. Although the Committee still anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, the near-term outlook for economic activity has weakened somewhat .
- 2. Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be quite subdued for some time, remaining below rates that would be consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices .
- 3. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, will warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. The Committee expects to maintain the current range for the federal funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation are clearly moving toward rates consistent with the dual mandate.  In addition, to provide continued support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to aid overall conditions in private credit markets, the Committee will maintain holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities in the System Open Market Account at approximately their current level rather than allowing them to run off.  The Committee will also continue to roll over maturing Treasury securities.
- 4. The Committee will continue to evaluate its holdings of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.

Household spending is increasing, and business spending on equipment and software is rising at a robust pace . Underlying inflation has trended lower, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.  Although financial market conditions have become somewhat less supportive of growth on balance in recent weeks, the Committee believes that a sustainable economic recovery is under way and anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization with subdued rates of inflation.
- 2. The Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipate  that economic conditions, including low rates of s resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant low levels of the federal funds rate for some time . As a step toward normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and the level of reserves in the banking system, on August 3 the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities; the Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
