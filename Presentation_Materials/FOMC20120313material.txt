Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

JANUARY FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.  While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

MARCH FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth.  While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions have improved somewhat further , the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment ha ve continued to advance. but growth in business fixed investment has slowed, and  The housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and although prices of crude oil and gasoline have increased lately .  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, absent further policy action, economic growth would slow over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will would decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices is likely to reduce consumers' purchasing power while pushing up inflation temporarily.  Nonetheless, the Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, subsequently inflation will run at levels at or below those the rate that it judges most consistent with the Committee's its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels the rate most consistent with the its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to purchase an additional $500 billion of agency mortgagebacked securities by the end of March 2013 . In addition, the Committee decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee also is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These programs should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, provide support to mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Questions for FOMC Discussion of Policy Communications Issues

- 1. Should the Committee's post-meeting statements be used to provide information about the links between the Committee's economic outlook and its policy decisions?
- a. Should the post-meeting statement incorporate qualitative or quantitative information about the economic conditions that the Committee judges would lead to a shift in the stance of monetary policy, that is, either to the start of policy firming or to the provision of additional monetary accommodation (perhaps along the lines of the attached sample language in section B of the appendix)?
- b. Should the post-meeting statement incorporate additional information about the Committee's economic outlook over the medium run rather than just over coming quarters (as in the attached sample language in section C of the appendix)?
- c. If you support adding quantitative information to the statement along the lines of (a) or (b) above, what process would you envision using to settle on the specific information to be added?
- d. If the post-meeting statement provides further information about the conditionality of the forward guidance, should the Committee continue to refer to a calendar date in describing the likely timing of policy liftoff?
- 2. Would further adjustments to the SEP be helpful in clarifying the linkages between the Committee's economic outlook and its policy decisions?
- a. Should the SEP provide summary information about the views of Committee members separately from the views of all FOMC participants?
- b. Should the SEP use scatter plots or other visual representations to provide information about the connections between participants' economic projections and their policy projections?
- c. Should the full 'matrix' of projections be released to the public, thereby linking each participant's economic forecasts with his or her policy judgments?  If so, should the Committee identify the individual making each set of projections or seek to preserve participants' anonymity to the extent possible?
- d. Are there other enhancements to the SEP that you view as potentially helpful in increasing the public's understanding of the links between the economic outlook and the Committee's decisions?
- 3. Are there other potential approaches for clarifying the conditionality of the Committee's policy decisions that you see as potentially promising?  For example, should the Committee start producing consensus forecasts for publication in the SEP? Or perhaps the SEP could provide information about the Committee's likely response to alternative economic scenarios?  If you think these are promising ideas, how would you envision the process of producing the consensus forecasts or alternative economic scenarios?

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Appendix:  Sample Language for the Post-Meeting Statement

- A.  For reference, the January statement language was:
- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that the economy has been expanding moderately, notwithstanding some slowing in global growth. While indicators point to some further improvement in overall labor market conditions, the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment has slowed, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation has been subdued in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee expects economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, inflation will run at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions - including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run - are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September. The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

- B.  In your remarks you may wish to note whether you find any of the following four alternatives to the end of paragraph 3 in the post-meeting statement to be helpful in providing greater clarity about the linkages between the economic outlook and the Committee's monetary policy decision.
- 3.1 …In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run- are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee expects that at the time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate, the unemployment rate will be nearing or will have moved somewhat below [ 7 ] percent and inflation will be close to or somewhat below [ 2 ] percent.  In judging when to first increase the target federal funds rate, the Committee will consider a range of factors, including the pace of improvement in labor market conditions and the contours of the medium-term inflation outlook.
- 3.2 …In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run- are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. The Committee currently projects that, with the target federal funds rate maintained at exceptionally low levels, inflation will remain close to or somewhat below [ 2 ] percent in the medium term and the unemployment rate will decline gradually.  Based on that projection, and given the lags with which monetary policy affects the economy, the Committee currently estimates that it will become appropriate to raise the target federal funds rate when the unemployment rate has moved near or somewhat below [ 7 ] percent.  In deciding when to change policy, the Committee will take into account a range of factors, including the outlook for inflation, longer-term inflation expectations, and the pace of improvement in labor market conditions.
- 3.3 …In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run- are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014. Among the factors that the Committee will take into account in determining how long to maintain the current stance of policy are the outlook for inflation, the level of longer-term inflation expectations, the extent of resource slack, and the pace of improvement in labor market conditions.  [ In particular, if inflation

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

appeared likely to be persistently above target, then, all else equal, the Committee would move to reduce policy accommodation earlier; conversely, if unemployment were not making sufficient progress toward levels consistent with the dual mandate, then, all else equal, the Committee would maintain an exceptionally accommodative policy stance for a longer time. ]

- 3.4       …In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.  The Committee also decided to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities, as announced in September, and is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee will monitor incoming economic and financial information and will make adjustments to the stance of monetary policy as appropriate to foster its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently anticipates that at the time of the first increase in the target federal funds rate, the unemployment rate will be nearing or will have moved somewhat below [ 7 ] percent and inflation will be close to or somewhat below [ 2 ] percent.  The timing of that decision will reflect a range of factors, including the Committee's inflation outlook and its assessments of the pace of improvement in labor market conditions and the longer-run normal rate of unemployment.  The Committee is prepared to provide further monetary accommodation if employment is not making sufficient progress toward the Committee's assessments of its maximum level or if inflation appears likely to be persistently below its mandate-consistent rate.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

- C.  In your remarks you may wish to note whether you find the following alternative language for paragraph 2 in the post-meeting statement to be helpful in providing information about the Committee's economic outlook over the medium run rather than just over coming quarters.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that economic growth over coming quarters to be modest and will remain moderate, reflecting ongoing drags from the housing sector and still-tight credit conditions for many households and smaller businesses . Looking further ahead, the pace of economic activity is expected to pick up somewhat, supported by the continuation of a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy. Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually towards levels that the Committee it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.   Strains in global financial markets , while having eased somewhat, continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook. The recent increase in oil and gasoline prices is likely to boost inflation temporarily, but the Committee also anticipates that over coming quarters, subsequently inflation will run at levels at or somewhat below those the rate that it judges most consistent with the Committee's its dual mandate.
