Key Background Factors

Federal Funds Rate

<!-- missing-text -->

Other factors:

- GLYPH&amp;lt;1&amp;gt; Stock market falls in the near term, and then is flat through the end of the projection period.  This implies a falling wealth-income ratio.
- GLYPH&amp;lt;1&amp;gt; Long-term corporate interest rates remain near current levels throughout the projection period.  Consequently, risk spreads on corporate bonds will remain elevated.
- GLYPH&amp;lt;1&amp;gt; The foreign exchange value of the dollar declines moderately in real terms over the projection period.
- GLYPH&amp;lt;1&amp;gt; Fiscal policy will be stimulative next year.  We assume a package of tax cuts worth $50 billion in the next fiscal year as well as further increases in discretionary spending.
- GLYPH&amp;lt;1&amp;gt; Prices of oil and natural gas are expected to recede over the next two years, consistent with quotes in futures markets.
