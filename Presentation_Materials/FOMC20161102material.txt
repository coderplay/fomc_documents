Framework objectives

Staff will evaluate options for a long-run monetary policy implementation framework that will best achieve a number of key goals:

- interest in the financial system. 1. Achieving an appropriate degree of control over short-term rates including during periods of financial distress and in a manner robust to structural changes
- 2. Enhancing the ability of the Federal Reserve to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at the zero bound.
- 3. Supporting the System's ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and support overall financial stability.

Framework objectives

In addition, alternative long-run operating frameworks will be evaluated on their ability to:

- 1. Reduce burdens and deadweight losses associated with reserve requirements.
- 2. Promote efficient, active, and resilient money markets and government securities markets.
- 3. Promote an efficient and resilient payment system.

Finally, criteria will be used in the evaluation following from the Committee's discussion of policy normalization principles and plans:

- 1. The framework should involve holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
- primarily of 2. The assets held by the Federal Reserve will consist Treasury securities.

Interest rate control: normal times and zero bound

-  In normal times, the FOMC can achieve interest rate control across wide range of potential policy rates through an appropriate choice of operating regime tools
-  These rates will likely effectively transmit the stance of policy to the real economy
-  Interest rate control could be maintained at the effective lower bound, albeit with changes to the operating regime in some cases

u

Mitigate liquidity strains

-  Regimes that operate on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve easily accommodate liquidity injections
-  Regimes operating on the steep portion of the reserve demand curve
-  Can be maintained by using reserve sterilization tools
-  Alternatively, could transition to operating on the flat part of the demand curve

Other LRF objectives

-  Burdens of reserve requirements could be reduced or eliminated
-  Reserve requirements could be set to zero in cases 1 and 3
- in case 2  VRTs could be considered
-  All regimes support active money markets
-  Promoting payment system efficiency is achieved in different ways across the operating regimes
-  Frameworks with high levels of reserve balances achieve this objective directly
- rely on existing Payment System  Those with low level of reserves Risk policies

A

u

Ceiling &amp; DW stigma

-  The Discount Window is intended to
-  support interest rate control
-  provide liquidity to address broad-based funding pressures
-  provide liquidity to individual firms
-  Stigma, perhaps most closely related to the third role, may limit discount window from performing all roles effectively
-  Separate facilities for each type of liquidity provisioning may allow each tool to work more effectively
-  Memo provides examples of facilities that may act as a more robust ceiling for rate control: DIRF and FIRF

<!-- missing-text -->

N

o

v

A

u

Liquidity provision integration

-  The degree to which liquidity backstop tools might be incorporated into the framework has implications for the design of the framework
-  Options
-  Fully integrated into the operating framework
-  Available under certain pre-announced conditions
-  Inactive

<!-- missing-text -->

N

o

v

A

u

Breadth of counterparties

-  In normal times, a narrow set of counterparties may reduce the risk of distorting markets but could be seen as providing privileges to a few institutions
-  A broader set of counterparties for liquidity provision tools could also lead to moral hazard or political scrutiny
-  In times of stress it might be advantageous to have broader reach in place in markets, both OMO and liquidity facilities, to help with interest rate control and transmission

Support interest rate control

-  Revert to prior structure when conditions warrant
-  However, starting point depends on economic variables (not a choice)
- doesn't conclude between ELB visits  Risk of ever-growing balance sheet if normalization

actively in non-ELB/normal times Use balance sheet

- state, hold relatively large balance sheet  In steady

Potential principles guiding portfolio design

-  Central bank has some leeway in determining asset composition
-  Federal Reserve Act allows only a limited universe of safe assets
-  Pre-crisis principles might hold different weights under some long-run balance sheet objectives
-  Safety (managing financial risk)
-  Market neutrality (avoiding price distortions and credit allocation)
-  Liquidity (providing balance sheet elasticity)
-  Operational readiness might be considered a new principle
-  Return and transparency might also be considerations

Fiscal and political economy considerations

-  Monetary policy has broad fiscal implications regardless of size and composition of the central bank's balance sheet
-  However, a large balance sheet accentuates important issues
-  Role of central bank in government debt management decisions
- have different, at times inconsistent, goals  Federal Reserve and Treasury
-  Costs of funding a permanently large balance sheet
- Interest payments to counterparties vs. taxpayers  Federal Reserve:
- What is cheapest source of financing?  Consolidated federal government:
-  Level and variability of remittances to the Treasury
-  Credibility or independence of central bank facing possible losses

Three broad discussion questions

- 1. The memo titled ' Interest Rate Targets and Operating Regimes ' discussed three broad types of regimes-one focused on targeting an unsecured rate in a floor system with an ample supply of reserves, another focused on targeting an unsecured rate in a corridor system with a relatively scarce supply of reserves, and a third focused on targeting repo rates.

What are your views on the key design elements of these regimes, such as the choice of policy rate to be used as a focal point for setting and communicating the stance of policy (an unsecured or secured, or an administered or market rate), the choice among alternative forms of reserve requirements (required, voluntary, or none), and whether to operate on the flat or steep portion of the demand curve for reserves?

<!-- missing-text -->

N

Three broad discussion questions

- 2. The memo also discussed possible alternative arrangements for liquidity provision that could help to mitigate stigma and create a more effective ceiling on short-term rates.

Do you have any views on changes in the discount window or on other vehicles for liquidity provision, such as the DIRF and FIRF standing facilities, discussed in the memo? What are your views about the appropriate level of readiness for the TAF as a tool to address broad-based funding pressures?

Three broad discussion questions

- 3. The memo titled ' Balance Sheet Considerations for the Federal Reserve's Long-run Framework ' discussed a range of issues associated with the long-run size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.

rates are well above the ELB? What are your views on the appropriate future use of large-scale asset purchases to support macroeconomic objectives? Should such purchases be conducted only after rates have reached the effective lower bound (ELB), or do you see some role for purchases even when short-term What are your views on the use of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to foster financial stability goals? What are your views on the appropriate long-run composition of the balance sheet?
