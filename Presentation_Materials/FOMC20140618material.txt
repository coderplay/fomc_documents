Material for Briefing on the

Monetary Policy Normalization

Deborah Leonard, Fabio Natalucci, Gretchen Weinbach June 17, 2014

Exhibit 1

Apparent areas of common ground from your April discussion

- · Use ON RRPs in addition to IOER to help control short-term interest rates
- Limit take-up of ON RRPs in some fashion
- · Do not further reduce trading in federal funds
- Have an appreciable spread between the IOER and ON RRP rates, at least initially
- · Mixed views regarding term tools; use as needed
- · Preserve flexibility about the longer-run framework
- · Develop an expanded measure of the federal funds rate
- · Inform public about updated normalization plans at time of the September meeting

Key design issue

Do you want to set and communicate the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate (or an expanded version), or by emphasizing the ON RRP and IOER rates?

Target federal funds rate (or similar rate)

- · Familiar
- · Helps leave open longer-run use

Point target?

- May be easiest to understand
- May provide clearer signal
- Desk adjusts ON RRP rate; an untested approach
- Might need to tolerate volatility around target

Or target range?

- Point target may be hard to hit
- Fixed IOER-ON RRP rate spread
- But what if funds rate moves outside its desired range?

Jun. 17, 2014

Exhibit 2

Primarily emphasize ON RRP and IOER rates

• Also point to federal funds rate?

• Greater leeway to take no action if rates move outside of expected range

Pointing to the funds rate would probably reduce that leeway

• But administered rates might need to be adjusted

Other trade-offs

- · Efficacy of chosen approach will depend on how tightly take-up of ON RRPs is limited
- · The more take-up is limited, the less the ON RRP facility can be expected to be effective
- · This trade-off has implications for:
- Your decisions about your communications strategy
- The effectiveness of monetary policy transmission

Addressing Financial Stability Concerns Associated with an ON RRP Facility: Design Features and Other Mitigants

Caps on Usage

Features of Caps

- · Focus on caps as circuit breakers during a period of market stress
- · Not intended to limit take-up under normal conditions
- Expected to bind only rarely
- · Designed to
- Prevent a disruptive surge in take-up and loss of private short-term funding
- Provide policymakers with some time to assess conditions

Assessing Design Features

- · A number of issues to consider
- · Focus on three considerations:
- 1. How to balance two policy goals:
- ✧ Controlling disruptive surges in take-up
- ✧ Setting an effective floor on rates
- 2. Ease of implementation and burden on counterparties
- 3. Communication issues
- · Two main possibilities:
- Individual caps for each ON RRP counterparty
- Aggregate cap
- ✧ Could be accompanied by a market-based pricing mechanism
- · Additional features for both cap types:
- Rigid or flexible
- Static or dynamic

Two Possible Options

- · Individual rigid caps
- Example: Caps set each month to average take-up in previous month plus $1 to $5 billon
- · Aggregate rigid cap
- Example: Aggregate cap set each week to average take-up in previous week plus $50 to $300 billion
- ✧ Accompanied by a uniform-rate auction

Further Considerations

- · The wide range for additive factors reflects the difficulty of evaluating uncertain tradeoffs between two policy goals
- · The Committee may want to consider:
- Setting caps that bind occasionally
- Imposing an ultimate limit on facility usage
- · The Committee may face pressures if circuit breakers are "tripped"
- May want to consider whether additional actions to mitigate strains would be warranted

Exhibit 4 Reinvestment Options

Sequence from June 2011 Exit Strategy

Significant Changes since June 2011

- · Cease or reduce reinvestments
- · Modify forward guidance
- · Initiate temporary reserve draining operations
- · Raise federal funds target
- · Sell agency securities

Effects of Ending Reinvestments

- · Under baseline expectations, ending reinvestments 6m before, at, or 18m after liftoff has limited effects on:
- -Term premium estimates
- -Timing of liftoff
- -Macroeconomic outcomes
- -Remittances to the Treasury
- · Models do not account for possible flow effects
- -May have some weight in MBS market
- · Increased securities holdings and excess reserves
- · Elimination of short-dated Treasury holdings
- · Changes in forward guidance
- · Indication of no agency MBS sales to normalize
- · Development of ON RRPs for interest rate control

Strategies for Timing an End to Reinvestments

- · Before liftoff
- · After liftoff
- -Trigger or threshold, possibly related to:
- · Interest rate target
- · Economic conditions
- · Time
- · Coincident with liftoff
- · Partial reinvestment options

Appendix

- 1. During normalization, do you want to communicate the stance of policy primarily by targeting the federal funds rate (or an expanded measure of the overnight bank funding rate), or to emphasize administered rates such as the ON RRP and IOER rates?
- a. If the Committee continues to target the federal funds rate or a similar rate during normalization, do you think a point target or a target range would be preferable?
- b. If the Committee communicates the stance of policy using the ON RRP and IOER rates, should it also use and point to the federal funds rate or a similar rate as one indicator of the general level of overnight interest rates?
- 2. Which types of 'circuit breakers' for limiting the financial stability risks that could be posed by a fixed-rate, full allotment ON RRP program do you find most promising?  In addition to the circuit breakers, do you see an overall limit on the size of the ON RRP program (other than the limit imposed by the size of the SOMA portfolio) as desirable?
- 3. Do you think that the Committee should cease or reduce its reinvestment of principal on its securities holdings prior to, at the same time as, or after the first increase in short-term interest rates?   Should the Committee simply cease reinvestment at the appropriate time, or would a more graduated approach be preferable?
- 4. Assuming, as discussed in one of the staff memos, that the Federal Reserve constructs an expanded federal funds effective rate that includes Eurodollar transactions as well as federal funds transactions, do you think that the expanded  rate should be published as a substitute for the existing federal funds effective rate or as an additional benchmark rate?

STATEMENT APRIL FOMC

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that growth in economic activity has picked up recently, after having slowed sharply during the winter in part because of adverse weather conditions.  Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated.  Household spending appears to be rising more quickly.  Business fixed investment edged down, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced. The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- maximum employment and the improvement interest rates, support 3. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in May, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases

in further measured steps at future meetings.  However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progressboth realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
- 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee anticipates that inflation will return to 2 percent, but only gradually; it recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions. However, in light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in May, surprisingly large fluctuations in economic growth in recent quarters and the resulting increase in uncertainty about the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the current pace of its asset purchases while awaiting further information concerning the economic outlook, labor market conditions, and inflation.  Thus, the Committee will continue to add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $20 billion per month rather than $25 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.

This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
