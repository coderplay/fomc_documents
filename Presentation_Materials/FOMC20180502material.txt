(25) Policy Considerations

- · Memo discussed a potential technical adjustment to the setting of administered rates relative to the target range
- · Specifically, lowering the interest rates on excess and required reserves -or IOR rates -to be 5 basis points below the top of the target range while keeping the ON RRP offering rate at the bottom of the target range
- · In terms of timing , such an adjustment could be made:
- · Either in conjunction with an increase in the target range, by increasing the IOR rates by less than the top of the range
- · Or, at an FOMC meeting when there is no change in the target range, in which case the IOR rates would be reduced by 5 basis points
- · Policymakers can communicate their anticipated action in advance of any adjustment through a discussion of the issue in the minutes
- · Policymakers might wish to revisit the language in the Desk directive to provide more clarity about when it would be appropriate for the Desk to conduct open market operations to keep the effective fed funds rate in the target range
- · The current language 'directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range'
- · However, policymakers might conclude that it would be more appropriate in some circumstances in the current environment to adjust administered rates to move the EFFR back into the target range rather than conduct open market operations

- EME is geometric mean using U.S. export weights of Brazil , Israel, Taiwan, India, Korea, Singapore; Russia, and China

Oil prices up but should moderate

- · Continuing their climb since 2016, oil prices jumped about 10 percent this period.
- · Strong global demand, OPEC quotas and compliance, and recent tensions in the Middle East have boosted prices.
- · Declines are projected as U.S. supply increases.

Dollar is STILL expected to strengthen

- · Much has been made of last year's weakness in the dollar.
- · Strong expansion abroad, reduced downside risks, and anticipation of foreign monetary policy probably played a role.
- · In the forecast, relative monetary policy surprises lead to a mild dollar appreciation.

Potential for financial and real effects

- · Greater attention on and uncertainty about trade policy recently.

Assessing two resonant risks in our model

· Trade war

- · After a period of rising trade tensions, U.S. and ROW apply tariffs
- · 10 percent on all imports
- · Expected to last 5 years

· Sustained Uncertainty

- · People perpetually anticipate a trade war (as outlined above)
- · But the event never materializes

Risk of higher prices and weaker output

- · A trade war leads to a temporary but sizable spike in inflation and a notable hit to output growth.
- · Even uncertainty can reduce investment and depress growth.

MARCH 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter readings.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MAY 2018

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been strong , on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their its strong fourth-quarter readings pace, while business fixed investment continued to grow strongly .  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below recently have moved close to 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriate monetary policy accommodation , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong. Inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to move up in coming months and to stabilize around modestly exceed 2 percent for a time and then run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to at 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to period of inflation modestly above 2 percent.  This inflation outcome should help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations rise to a level consistent with the Committee's symmetric objective for 2 percent inflation.

Implementation Note for May 2018 Alternatives A and B

Release Date:  May 2, 2018

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on March 21 May 2 , 2018:

- · The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously   to raise [ ] maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to at 1.75 percent, effective March 22 May 3 , 2018.
- · As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective March 22 May 3 , 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.50 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during March that exceeds $12 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during March that exceeds $8 billion. Effective in April, the Committee directs the Desk to roll over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $18 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $12 billion. Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

- · In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously   to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in ] the establishment of the

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

primary credit rate to at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective March 22, 2018. In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of …

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
