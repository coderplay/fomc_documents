November FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up.  Conditions in financial markets were roughly unchanged, on balance, over the intermeeting period.  Activity in the housing sector has increased over recent months.  Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.

With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longerterm inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.  The amount of agency debt purchases, while somewhat less than the previously announced maximum of $200 billion, is consistent with the recent path of purchases and reflects the limited availability of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases of both agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities and anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

December 15-16, 2009

December FOMC Statement-Alternative A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating .  The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months , boosted in part by government incentives for first-time homebuyers . Household spending appears to be expanding but remains constrained by the weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending is being dampened by firms' efforts to reduce inventories to bring them into better alignment with sales and by cutbacks in fixed investment . Partly reflecting these factors, the Committee anticipates that the economic recovery will be sluggish and that slack in resource utilization will diminish quite slowly absent further policy action.
- 2. Inflation has fallen considerably over the past year. With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
- 3. To promote a stronger economic recovery and higher resource utilization, the Committee will provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced amount of $1.25 trillion; the Committee anticipates that these purchases will be executed by the end of the second quarter of 2010.  The Committee is also in the process of purchasing $175 billion of agency debt ; it anticipates that these purchases will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations are likely to warrant this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Federal Reserve will continue to employ a wide range of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.

- 4. In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal Reserve's announcement of June 25, 2009.  These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1. The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.   The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

In view of continued improvements in financial market conditions and the economic outlook, the Committee decided to cap its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities at $1.1 trillion and its purchases of agency debt at $160 billion, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of January 2010 .

DIRECTIVES

NOVEMBERFOMCMEETING

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output. To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to 1/4 percent. The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions. The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter of 2010. The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near completion. The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

December 15-16, 2009

Overview

- · Inflation Persistence and output gaps are linked through the Phillips Curve.
- · Three main points.
- -Inflation persistence is largely an outcome of monetary policy and not structural features.
- -Statistically derived output gaps are not useful.
- Theoretical measures of ou put gaps may be t -useful in principle but not in practice.

December 15-16, 2009

Inflation Persistence

- · Reduced form Phillips Curve. -

* 1 ln ln ( 1 )ln t t t t t mc e            

Π is the gross inflation rate, π * is the inflation trend, mc is marginal cost, and e is a mark up shock. -

- · Modeling trend inflation is of key importance.
- -If trend is stochastic our model implies structural rigidities are less important in explaining inflation persistence.

December 15-16, 2009

Policy Implication

- · Inflation trend is a result of past policy.
- -Controlling inflation may not be too costly, especially if inflationary expectations are well anchored.

December 15-16, 2009

Output Gaps

- · Gap = output - desired output.
- · Desired output can be calculated either.
- Statistically (dev ation from a trend), or i -
- -From an estimated theoretical model.
- · Model based measures are potentially a -useful guide for conducting monetary policy.
- · Statistical and model based measures may -differ (figure 1).

<!-- missing-text -->

December 15-16, 2009

Theoretical Gaps

- · Not quite ready for use in policy because:
- -In complex models the output gap is no longer sufficient statistic for welfare.
- -Models are still preliminary
- -Different models produce very different output gaps (figure 2).

<!-- missing-text -->

-

December 15-16, 2009

Models are Useful

- · Models can inform of us about shocks.
- · Need to look at a number of models, because they produce different results.
- · Models can place discipline on policy discuss ons. i

Jeff Fuhrer December 16, 2009

December 15-16, 2009

Class II FOMC-Restricted (FR)

Overview

- · Two key determinants of inflation in current economic thinking
- -Marginal cost or output gap
- -Expectations (of inflation and, implicitly, of costs and monetary policy)
- · Both are the subject of considerable discussion
- -Can we measure gaps well? How reliable are gaps as forecasters of inflation?
- -Are expectations well-anchored? What do we mean by that? If so, will they offset downward pressure from costs or output? How are they connected to monetary policy?
- · Goals of presentation
- -Add some economic structure to the discussion
- -Examine some empirical evidence on the role of gaps and expectations in determining inflation

Inflation, expectations, and monetary policy

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

2. This relationship also holds in 't+1'

3. Implications for expectations, I

- · Inflation depends on current and expected costs/output
- · These depend (in part) on monetary policy
- · Monetary policy depends (in part) on the inflation goal, which may vary over time
- · Expectations of policy actions and the inflation goal matter

4. Implications for expectations, II

- · In practical terms, the expectations that should matter are:
- · Short-run inflation expectations
- · Long-run inflation expectations, as a proxy for the Fed's longrun inflation goal

'Anchored' expectations in this framework

- · People know the Fed's inflation goal, whether it's subject to change, and how vigorously the Fed will pursue its inflation goal
- · People expect the goal to remain reasonably stable
- -Note: Historically, some of the longer-term movements in inflation may well have been caused by fluctuations in the Fed's inflation goal
- -For that reason, and because the goal could (in principle) change over time, we allow for this effect of the Fed's goal on inflation in our framework
- -We expect (and empirical evidence confirms) that this source of variation is smaller today than it was several decades ago

'Anchored' expectations and the Fed's long-run inflation goal

- · Clark and Davig estimate a reduced-form model which shows that longterm expectations (the 10-year SPF forecast) are an excellent proxy for 'trend inflation'
- · Trend inflation may be thought of as an indicator of the public's perception of the Federal Reserve's inflation goal
- · Long-run expectations/perception of the Fed's goal 'well-anchored' of late

How much could anchored expectations offset downward cost and output pressures?

- · Answer: depends on how 'forward-looking' price-setters are
- · Consider two options:
- 1. Purely forward-looking/model-consistent
- 2. Combination of above and backward-looking
- No shock to perceived inflation target, U =0, b =.85 1. Purely forward-looking/model-consistent

So which model is more realistic?

- · A somewhat structural approach: modified New Keynesian Phillips Curve, in which expectations may be any combination of
- -'Model-consistent' or 'rational' expectations
- -Backward-looking behavior (average of past four quarters)
- -Survey-based inflation expectations
- -SPF one-year-ahead (median of forecasts)
- -SPF 10-year average (median of forecasts)

Results

Which expectations proxies best explain inflation?

<!-- missing-text -->

· Bottom line :

- -Model-consistent expectations matter relatively little
- -The extreme model with purely forward-looking expectations is not well-supported in the data
- -Modest role for inertial survey expectations in explaining short-run fluctuations in inflation

What if expectations are not fully anchored? How would a change in long-term inflation expectations affect inflation?

- · The inflation scenarios just presented treat long-term expectations as anchored at the Fed's inflation goal
- · But expectations have moved historically, perhaps because the Fed's inflation goal has changed significantly over time
- -From the early 1980s to the early 2000s, long-run expectations dropped from just below 6% to 2.5%
- · The models used in the scenarios imply that inflation eventually moves one-for-one with a sustained change in expectations
- · An empirical model that does not  impose the one-for-one passthrough of expectations into actual inflation validates this assumption

Estimate of the effect on inflation of a change in long-term inflation expectations

- · Model: vector autoregression including the SPF-10 year expectation, core PCE inflation, economic activity, and the federal funds rate (estimated 1983-2009)
- · Consider response to a 50 basis point one-time shock to the SPF 10-year expectation
- · The shock results in a persistent increase in the SPF expectation
- · The shock also generates a persistent rise in inflation, which roughly matches the rise in expectations
- · Change in long-run expectations-inflation goal?-reflected one-for-one in inflation

What factors could un-anchor inflation expectations?

- · Vector autoregressive models indicate survey-based expectations generally respond more to price variables than to economic activity or monetary policy
- · The scenario:  a -1%, one period shock to core PCE inflation
- · The shock results in a sustained reduction in core inflation of about -0.25%
- · The federal funds rate (not shown) falls in response
- · Long-run expectations gradually decline, but by a small amount-about 0.08%
- · Expectations should remain anchored as long as policy responds appropriately to inflation developments

Survey Results: Government Debt and Inflation Expectations

Exhibit 13a: Perceptions of Consumers and Financial Experts

- A. Consider the following scenario: over the next 12 months, the government debt ends up growing substantially more than the administration has predicted BECAUSE tax revenues are lower than expected while the level of government spending remains on target. Under this scenario, how would this change your forecast for the rate of inflation over the next 12 months?
- B . Now consider this alternative scenario: over the next 12 months, the government debt ends up growing substantially more than the administration has predicted BECAUSE the level of government spending is much higher than expected while tax revenues remain on target. Under this alternative scenario, how would this change your forecast for the rate of inflation over the next 12 months?

Do output gaps matter?

- · Much appropriate discussion about difficulty of measurement, small coefficients in estimated equations, etc.
- · We allow for a 'nonlinearity'viz that output or unemployment gaps matter when they're large, not much when they're smaller
- · How large is large?
- -Stock and Watson (2009) and Fuhrer and Olivei (2009) find threshold for output gap at approximately 3 percentage points (1.5 percentage points away from estimated NAIRU for unemployment)

- · The correlation improves as the horizon lengthens
- · Correlation does not imply causality
- -But many would expect a money-to-inflation causality, in the long run
- · Contemporaneous correlations: Prediction not implied
- -High money growth now does not necessarily imply high inflation later
