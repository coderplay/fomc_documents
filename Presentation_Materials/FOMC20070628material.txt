Statement

- 2. Despite the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector, the economy appears to have grown at a moderate pace so far this year.

Note. Months' supply uses the two-quarter moving average of sales. Forecast period shaded in blue.

Statement

- 2. But ongoing weakness in the housing sector implies a significant risk that economic activity might grow more slowly than anticipated.
- 3.  Core inflation has edged lower in recent months and is expected to remain moderate over the next year or so.
- 4. With this policy action, the Committee judges that the downside risk to economic growth now roughly balances the upside risk to inflation.
