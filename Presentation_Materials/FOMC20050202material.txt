Considerations Pertaining to the Establishment of a Specific, Numerical, Price-Related Objective for Monetary Policy

Divisions of Research &amp; Statistics and Monetary Affairs

February 1, 2005

A Specific, Numerical, Price-Related Objective for Monetary Policy?

<!-- missing-text -->

Key characteristics of a specific, numerical, price-related objective:

- · Numerical rather than qualitative;
- · Stated in terms of a particular published index; and
- · Either inflation control or price-level control.

A premise of the paper:

- · A price objective should be chosen to minimize the costs of deviations from price stability.
- · The premise suggests that the objective should be defined with respect to the price index most closely related to such costs.

February 1-2, 2005

Exhibit 2

Potential Benefits and Costs of Adopting a Specific Price-Related Objective

Potential Benefits:

- · Could help preserve the present commitment to price stability.
- · Could better anchor long-run inflation expectations and thereby reduce the volatility of both inflation and real activity.
- · Could improve public understanding of monetary policy.
- · Could help focus policy debates within the FOMC.

Potential Costs:

- · Could mislead the public into believing that emphasis had shifted toward the price objective.
- · Could cause the FOMC inadvertently to place more emphasis on the price objective.
- · Could diminish the FOMC's credibility when inflation differed from the stated objective.
- · Could constrain future actions of the FOMC in an unhelpful manner.

Empirical Evidence:

- · Little to no evidence regarding the likely influence on FOMC decision-making or the quality of communications with the public.
- · Some hints from foreign experience that specific price objectives have helped anchor long-term inflation expectations.
- · Disputed evidence that the reduced volatility of inflation and real output owes to improved conduct of U.S. monetary policy.
- · Simulation-based evidence that better-anchored inflation expectations would reduce the volatility of inflation and real output.

Operational Issues Related to Specifying a Numerical Price-Related Objective

A checklist for policymakers:

For index, we favor consumer prices on the grounds of:

- · Which price index?
- · The inflation rate or the price level?
- · What average rate?
- · Point objective or range?

If an inflation objective, at what rate?

- · Measurement bias:  Nearly 1 percentage point for CPI; about % percentage point for PCE prices.
- · Rationales for aiming for zero true inflation:  Traditional costs of inflation.
- · Rationales for aiming for positive true inflation:  Downward nominal wage rigidity; zero lower bound on nominal interest rates.

Effect of zero lower bound under an updated Taylor rule:

<!-- missing-text -->

- · Familiarity_
- · Quality of measurement
- · Empirical result that inflation rates move together in the long run.

Exhibit 4

Accuracy in Achieving an Inflation Objective

Imperfect controllability:

- · Inflation is volatile, and monetary policy influences it only indirectly and with a lag.
- · The FOMC could not hit a point objective precisely or guarantee a narrow range.

Percent of time that peE inflation averaged over four quarters could be held within -  1 percentage point of desired rate:

<!-- missing-text -->

Summary:

- · The FOMC could likely keep four-quarter total PCE inflation within a - l-percentage-point band about to % of the time.

Governance Issues Related to the Specification of Price Stabilty

<!-- missing-text -->

February 1-2, 2005

ExhibitS

Key Questions for Today's Discussion

How do you define price stability?

- · Is it known by inference about behavior of by a numerical specification?
- · If the latter,
- · What price index do you prefer?
- · Should the objective be stated in terms of a path for the price level or as the rate of inflation?
- · What are the desired point estimates or ranges for the inflation objective?

What role should the price objective play in the Committee's policy process?

- · Alternative I:  Maintain the status quo
- · Perhaps provide more information to the public over time as to your attitudes toward prevailing and prospective inflation
- · Alternative II:  Vote formally on a numerical inflation goal
- · Alternative III:  Survey participants as to the appropriate inflation objective

Exhibit 3

Assessing the  Risk Assessment

From  the FOMC  Statement  released  December 14 th

The Committee  perceives the upside and  downside  risks to the attainment of both  sustainable growth and  price stability for the next few quarters  to be  roughly equal. With  underlying inflation expected to be  relatively low, the Committee  believes that policy accommodation can be removed  at a pace that is likely to be measured.  Nonetheless, the Committee  will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to maintain price stability.

Three  alternatives

- 1. Get out of the business of hinting-either obliquely or directly-about future actions by dropping the entire paragraph.
- 2. Revive the first sentence assessing  risks by basing  it on the assumption  of an  unchanged  stance of policy for the  next few quarters  and couching it in terms of probabilities, not  risks.
- 3. Rely on the  gradual  evolution of the latter part of the paragraph  to convey a sense of the future  path of interest rates.
