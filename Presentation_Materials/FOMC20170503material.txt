IF's Benign (if Unspectacular) Foreign Outlook

- · GDP growth in the advanced foreign economies (AFEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs) settling in at potential.
- · Inflation stabilizing at 3 percent for the EMEs and trudging toward 2 percent for the AFEs.

<!-- missing-text -->

Factors Supporting EME Forecast

- · The stabilization of commodity prices after a modest pickup last year.
- · Step up in global trade, partially related to high tech.

<!-- missing-text -->

Factor Supporting AFE Forecast

- · Accommodative monetary policy
- · Policy rates expected to remain very low.
- · Balance sheets remaining sizable and in some cases still growing.

<!-- missing-text -->

Dollar and Trade

- · Dollar appreciates, on average, 1½ percent a year.
- · As policy divergence not completely priced into markets.
- · Contributing to a small net export drag over the forecast.

<!-- missing-text -->

Relatively Happy Forecast

- · Outlook for global growth stabilizing and even some upward surprises.
- · Data and financial conditions point to low probability of global recession.
- · Risks becoming more two sided.

<!-- missing-text -->

Upside Risk: Stronger Growth/Tighter Policy Abroad

- · Positive data and passage of political risks could presage more rapid foreign growth/inflation and forceful central bank responses.
- · Foreign growth 1 ppt above baseline with sharp depreciation of dollar leads to stronger U.S. growth and inflation even when AFE central banks tighten more aggressively than baseline policy rule would imply.

<!-- missing-text -->

Downside Risk:  EME Turbulence

- · EME debt rising
- · Positive investor sentiment spurring strong inflows.
- · Chinese growth supported by rapid expansion of credit.
- · And, in some cases, to high levels.
- · Leaving EMEs vulnerable to shifts in sentiment.

<!-- missing-text -->

Downside Risk: EME Turbulence (2)

- · U.S. monetary policy normalization sharply boosts the dollar, leading to heightened financial pressures abroad that elevate EME borrowing costs and weigh on confidence, reducing foreign economic activity.
- · U.S. real GDP slows noticeably and inflation fails to reach target over the forecast period.

MARCH 2017 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in February indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace.  Job gains remained solid and the unemployment rate was little changed in recent months.  Household spending has continued to rise moderately while business fixed investment appears to have firmed somewhat.  Inflation has increased in recent quarters, moving close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective; excluding energy and food prices, inflation was little changed and continued to run somewhat below 2 percent. Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The  Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 3/4 to 1 percent.  The stance of  monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal  funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail  in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic  outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from  its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed  securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longerterm securities at sizable levels, should help  maintain accommodative financial conditions.

Communicating a Plan for Ceasing or Phasing Out Reinvestment

- · The Committee intends to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of securities by gradually reducing its reinvestment of repayments of principal on securities held in the System Open Market Account.
- o Specifically, the Committee intends to set a cap on the amount of the Federal Reserve's holdings of maturing Treasury securities that will be allowed to roll off each month; the Committee anticipates that the cap will increase from $5 billion to $35 billion in equal quarterly steps over 1½ years.
- o Similarly, the Committee intends to reinvest in agency MBS, each month, principal repayments that the Federal Reserve receives from its holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities only to the extent that such repayments exceed a specified cap; the Committee anticipates that the cap will increase from $3 billion to $21 billion per month in equal quarterly steps over 1½ years.
- o The Committee also anticipates that the caps will remain in place once they reach their respective maximums so that the Federal Reserve's securities holdings will continue to decline in a gradual and predictable manner until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
- · The Committee currently anticipates gradually reducing the quantity of reserve balances to a level appreciably below that seen in recent years but large enough to enable routine fluctuations in the demand for reserves, or in autonomous factors that affect the supply of reserve balances, to be absorbed without significant fluctuations in the effective federal funds rate and without frequent open market operations to adjust the level of reserves.

OR

- · The Committee anticipates gradually reducing the supply of reserve balances to a level appreciably smaller than in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis.
- · The Committee is prepared to adjust details of its planned approach to reducing the Federal Reserve's securities holdings in light of unexpected economic and financial developments. In particular, the Committee is prepared to increase or fully resume reinvestments if a future deterioration in the economic outlook warrants a [ sizable ] reduction in the Committee's target for the federal funds rate.

[ All ] participants also agreed that the Committee will use changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means for adjusting the stance of monetary policy. However, the Committee is prepared to use its full range of tools, including adjusting the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions warrant a more accommodative stance of monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.
