Exhibit 4

A Recession at the ZLB

2. Calibration

- · Recessions don't die of old age.
- · Nonetheless, there is about a 15-to-20 percent chance that a recession will occur in any given year-and thus close to a 50 percent chance over medium term.
- · We consider the implications of a recession that starts in 2016:02, when the federal funds rate is forecast to still be near the ZLB.

3. Unemployment

• Based on the five more-moderate recessions since 1960.

• GDP falls 0.75 percent from peak to trough.

• The federal funds rate falls 275 basis points.

• Assumes no unconventional policy.

- · Starting in 2018, there would be room to accommodate a 275-basis-point funds rate cut.
- · However, a recession may not be moderate; taking account the severe recessions as well, the average drop in the funds rate has been 400 basis points.
- · Moreover, in our scenario, EDO's estimate of the equilibrium funds rate drops by 650 basis points.

174 of 195

Exhibit 1:  Policy Alternatives A, B, and C

Current and Expected Economic Developments

Labor Market

- · All alternatives report further improvement in the labor market

Inflation

- · Alternatives B and C
- o Both characterize inflation as continuing below the Committee's objective
- o Alternative B describes market and survey measures of inflation expectations, respectively, as low and having edged down while alternative C characterizes these measures as stable
- o Both B and C reaffirm the expectation that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term and state reasonable confidence in that forecast
- o Alternative B retains the need to monitor inflation closely in paragraph 2 and emphasizes that intention in paragraph 4
- · Alternative A
- o The Committee is not sufficiently confident in the outlook for inflation
- o Cites "subdued" inflation, core inflation, and gains in labor compensation; also cites "low" measures of inflation expectations
- o Current shortfall from 2 percent is "only partly" attributable to transitory factors that will "eventually" dissipate
- o Committee is prepared to add accommodation if information does not soon indicate inflation moving up toward 2 percent

Communicating the Expected Funds Rate Path

- · Adjustments will be gradual if the economy evolves as expected
- o Alternative B: The Committee's economic outlook is consistent with "gradual adjustments" and economic conditions are likely to "evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases"
- o Alternative C refers to "appropriate adjustments" in paragraph 2 and omits "only" in paragraph 4.
- o Both state that the funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels expected to prevail in the longer run
- · Adjustments will be conditional on economic conditions
- o Both state that "the timing and size of future adjustments" will depend on "realized and expected economic conditions" relative to objectives and
- o The actual path "will depend on the economic outlook as informed by the incoming data"

FOMCSTATEMENT OCTOBER 2015

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft.  The pace of job gains slowed and the unemployment rate held steady. Nonetheless, labor market indicators, on balance, show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation moved slightly lower; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- with appropriate policy as the labor market improves further and the transitory 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate.

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium
- 4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
- 5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions

RRPs) at an offering rate During its meeting on December 15-16, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (New York Fed), effective December 17, 2015, to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (ON of 0.25 percent and in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

To determine the value of Treasury securities available for ON RRP operations, several factors need to be taken into account, as not all Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA will be available for use in such operations. First, some of the Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA are needed to conduct reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts.  Second, some Treasury securities are needed 1 to support the securities lending operations conducted by the Desk. Additionally, buffers are needed to provide for possible changes in demand for these activities and for possible changes in the market value of the SOMA's holdings of Treasury securities.

Taking these factors into account, the Desk anticipates that around $2 trillion of Treasury securities will be available for ON RRP operations to fulfill the FOMC's domestic policy directive.  In the highly unlikely event that the value of bids received in an ON RRP 2 operation exceeds the amount of available securities, the Desk will allocate awards using a single-price auction based on the stop-out rate at which the overall size limit is reached, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at this rate awarded on a pro rata basis at the stop-out rate.

Each eligible counterparty not to exceed $30 billion and at a rate not to exceed the specified offering rate. The operations will take place from 12:45 p.m. to 1:15 p.m. (Eastern Time). Any changes to these terms will be announced with at least one business day's prior notice on the New York Fed's website.

The results of these operations will be posted on the New York Fed's website. The outstanding amounts of RRPs are reported on the Federal Reserve's H.4.1 statistical release as a factor absorbing reserves in Table 1 and as a liability item in Tables 5 and 6.
