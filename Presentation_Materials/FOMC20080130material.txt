Exhibit 5

Where did Credit Rating Agencies Play a Role in the Crisis?

Key points

Road map

- 1. Credit rating agencies are one of the weak links (though not the only one).
- 2. The way that some investors use credit ratings for their own risk management has not kept up with financial innovations.

Subprime RMBS

- 1. Rating agencies got it wrong.
- 2. Rating agencies relied too much on historical data to estimate:
- · how severe a housing downturn could become.
- · how poorly subprime loans would perform when house prices fell.
- · whether the originator mattered.
- · whether refinancing would dry up.
- 3. No evidence that conflicts of interest had an impact on ratings.

ABS CDOs

- 1. Rating agencies got it wrong.
- 2. Rating models were crude, because rating agencies:
- · used corporate CDO models to rate ABS CDOs.
- · had no data on correlation of defaults across ABS.
- · used ratings as the main measure of quality of subprime RMBS.
- · only did limited, ad hoc analysis of the timing of cash flows.
- 3. Investors did not understand that structured finance securities have more systematic risk and less idiosyncratic risk than corporate securities.
- 1. Role of rating agencies in the financial crisis.
- 2. Make recommendations on rating agency practices.
- 3. Link up with investor issues.

SIVs

1. Rating agencies got it wrong.

2. Rating model for SIVs relied on a rapid liquidation of assets.

3. Even SIVs with no subprime exposures cannot roll over CP.

Exhibit 6

Recommendations on Rating Agency Practices

Six recommendations aimed at structured finance ratings

1. Differentiate structured finance ratings from corporate ratings by providing additional measures of risk or leverage.

2. Convey a rating's uncertainty in an understandable way.

3. More transparency for structured finance ratings.

4. Be conservative when rating new or evolving asset classes.

5. Enhance the rating frameworks for structured products.

6. Regulators should differentiate better between corporate and structured finance ratings.

Approach

Exhibit 7 Investor Practices Authorized for Public Release

- · Public pension funds are an informative example of how investors use credit ratings.
- · Limited financial expertise in some cases.
- · High portion of funds use credit ratings in investment guidelines.
- · Significant public information on their activities.
- · We gathered information on investment practices and fund governance for 11 funds, ranging from $250 billion in assets (CALPers) to 6 with $6 to $11 billion.

Key conclusions

- · Funds have developed workable solutions to address inexperience or lack of financial sophistication, including hiring professional investment managers and investment consultants.
- · The mandates guiding investment managers have not always kept pace with the growth of structured credit markets. These mandates:
- · Require managers to meet or exceed returns on a benchmark index or of a peer group of investment managers.
- · Constrain the risk the managers may assume.
- · Credit ratings play an important role in these risk constraints.
- · However, few of the funds we profiled made significant distinctions between ratings on structured credit and on other securities.
- · This provides scope for investment managers to move into structured credit to generate high returns, without raising warning signals about additional risk.
- · Not a "naive" use of credit ratings by the investment managers.
- · Instead, a previously effective mechanism used by fund boards falling out-of-date.

Recommendations

- 1. The pension fund industry and other investors should re-evaluate the use of credit ratings in investment mandates.
- · Investment mandates should acknowledge differences in risk, return and correlation across instruments, rather than rely on generic credit ratings.
- 2. Investors should ensure that investment consultants have independent views of the quality and adequacy of the ratings for the types of positions in the investors' portfolios.

- · Risk management practices varied by firm and by strategy, as did the range of outcomes.
- · Primary risk management weaknesses observed are not new.

Exhibit 9

Observations on Risk Management Practices During the Recent Market Turbulence

Four factors differentiated performance:

• The effectiveness of senior management oversight of balance sheet, liquidity, and capital positions;

• The effectiveness of communications among senior management, business lines, and risk management functions;

• The sophistication, diversity and adaptability of risk measures utilized;

• The attention devoted to valuation issues.

Effectiveness of senior management oversight of balance sheet, liquidity, and capital positions

- · More Effective
- · More disciplined in measuring and limiting risks in advance of the crisis.
- · More agile in reducing exposures or hedging.
- · Focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet.
- · Established capital and liquidity buffers that included lack of access to the market for funding for a period of time.
- · Created and enforced internal pricing mechanisms, capital allocation methodologies, and limits.
- · Less Effective
- · Not as focused on the overall strength of their balance sheet.
- · Operated with less of a liquidity and capital buffer.
- · More focused on earnings growth or defense of market leadership position.
- · Did not have limit structures that were consistently or effectively enforced.
- · Did not properly aggregate or monitor off balance sheet exposures.

January 29-30, 2008

Exhibit 10

Observations on Risk Management Practices During the Recent Market Turbulence

Effectiveness of communications among senior management, business lines, and risk management functions

- · More Effective
- · Emphasized a comprehensive, firm-wide consolidated assessment of risk.
- · Well established processes for routine discussion of current and emerging risks.
- · Collectively made decisions about the firm's overall risk appetite, exposures, and risk mitigation strategies.
- · Effectively leveraged the assessments of risks from one business line to consider how exposures may affect other businesses.
- · More timely and well-informed perspective.
- · Implemented plans for reducing exposures while it was still practical and more cost effective.
- · Less Effective
- · Did not effectively share information across business lines on emerging risks.
- · Comparatively slower in taking actions to mitigate exposures.
- · Each business line had to assess and consider emerging risks on their own.

The sophistication, diversity, and adaptability of risk measures utilized

- · More Effective
- · Used a wide range of risk measures and analytical tools.
- · Used a combination of different risk measures and scenario analysis.
- · Committed more resources to risk management and management information systems.
- · More timely and scalable management information systems.
- · Less Effective
- · Too dependent on a single quantitative measurement.
- · Did not utilize scenario analysis in their decision making.
- · Management information systems not as scalable.
- · Need to develop a number of ad hoc reports.

Exhibit 11

Observations on Risk Management Practices During the Recent Market Turbulence

Attention devoted to valuation issues

- · More Effective
- · More disciplined in how they valued the holdings of complex or potentially illiquid securities.
- · Invested in the development of pricing models and staff with specialized expertise.
- · Less reliant on external ratings.
- · Emphasized mark-to-market discipline.
- · Less Effective
- · Did not have key valuation models in place prior to the market disruption.
- · Relied heavily on third-party views of risks.
- · More narrow view of the risks associated with their CDO business.
- · Did not actively seek market valuation information.

Supervisory response

- · Address risk management deficiencies at each company through the supervisory process.
- · Re-emphasize the importance of strong independent risk management.
- · Complete the work already underway within the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision to update liquidity risk management guidance.
- · Review existing guidance.
- · Develop on an interagency basis guidance related to the effective management of the originate-to-distribute model.

Authorized for Public Release

Exhibit 12 Regulatory Policy

The question

• To what extent did regulatory incentives contribute to or fail to mitigate weaknesses exposed by the recent turmoil?

• Regulatory capital requirements.

• Financial reporting requirements.

Conclusions

- · For banks, regulatory capital incentives are much more important than financial reporting incentives.
- · The current regulatory capital framework is not neutral to how banks structure risk positions.
- · Although not a significant driver of bank behavior, financial reporting issues, particularly disclosure practices, have been a factor in how the turmoil is unfolding.

Basel 2 and related improvements

- 1. Capital charges for most unused short-term credit and liquidity facilities have been increased.
- 2. Standards for holding capital against the default risk of complex, less liquid products in the trading book are being finalized.
- 3. A more risk-sensitive capital treatment for securitization exposures has been established.

Authorized for Public Release

Exhibit 13

Regulatory Policy (continued)

Recommendations - regulatory capital

- 1. Reassess the treatment of certain securitizations in the Basel 2 Capital Framework.
- 2. Exercise supervisory oversight to ensure that banks sufficiently consider "reputational" risk and its implications for capital and liquidity buffers.
- 3. Rigorously assess banks' implementation of the Advanced Internal Ratings Based approach to Basel 2, including the conservatism of estimates of losses from defaults during a downturn ("downturn LGDs") and stress tests.
- 4. Explore ways to encourage the inclusion in the regulatory capital base of debt instruments that mandatorily convert into equity when a banking organization is under stress.

Recommendations - disclosure practices

- 1. Continue to push market participants to make timely and detailed disclosures about the size and composition of subprime-related exposures.
- 2. Sponsors and/or liquidity/credit enhancement providers to ABCP programs should disclose the distribution of assets underlying the programs by type, industry, and credit rating.
- 3. Sponsors should improve disclosures to investors in ABCP programs.
