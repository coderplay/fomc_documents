Exhibit 3 Questions on the Statement  Language

September  Statement

The Federal  Open  Market Committee  decided  today  to raise its target  for the federal funds rate  by 25  basis points  to  3%f percent.

Output appeared  poised to continue growing at a good  pace before  the  tragic  toll  of Hurricane  Katrina.  The widespread devastation  in  the  Gulf region,  the associated  dislocation  of economic  activiry,  and the  boost to  energy prices  imply  that spending, production,  and  employment  will  be set back in the near term.  In addition  to  elevating premiums  for some energy  products,  the disruption  to  the production  and refining  infrastructure  may add  to  energy price  volatility.

\While  these  unfortunate  developments  have  increased uncertainty  about  near-term  economic  performance,  it is  the Committee's view  that they  do not pose a more persistent threat.  Rather,  monetary  policy  accommodation,  coupled with  robust underlying  growth  in productivity,  is providing ongoing support  to  economic  activity. igher energy  and  other  costs have  the  potential  to add  to  inflation pressures. However, core  inflation has  been  relatively  low in  recent  months,  and  longer-term  inflation  expectations remain  contained.

The Committee  perceives that, w ith  appropriate  monetary policy  action,  the  upside and  downside  risks  to  the attainment  of both sustainable  grow th and price stability  should  he  kept  roughly equal \With  underlying inflation  expected  to  be contained,  the Committee  believes that  policy  accommodation  can be removed  at  a pace that is  likely  to  be  measured.  Nonetheless,  the Committee will  respond  to changes  in  economic  prospects  as  needed  to fulfill  its  obligation  to maintain  price  stability.

1. Is  productivity growth  still  robust?

2. Will  monetary policy  still  be accommnodative?

3. Are you likely  to remove policy accommodation at a measured  pace?

4. Is  there  a policy path  that  will  balance the  risks to your dual objectives  ?

Exhibit 5 Assessment  of  Risks

Alternative  B

The Committee  perceives  that, with appropriate monetary pohcy action,  the upside  and downside risks  to the attainment  of both  sustainable growth  and price  stability  should  be  kept roughly equal. \With  underlying  inflation  expected  to be  contained,  the  Committee  believes  that policy accommodation  can  be  removed  at  a pace  that is likely  to  be measured.  Nonetheless,  the Committee  will  respond  to changes  in  economic  prospects  as needed  to fulfill  its obligation  to maintain price  stabilit.
