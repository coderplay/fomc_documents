Questions for Committee Discussion

- (1) Would you prefer to communicate the Committee's approach to ending or beginning to phase out reinvestments by stating a calendar date, perhaps with economic conditionality, or by stating economic conditions that would make it appropriate to begin shrinking the balance sheet?
- a. If the Committee were to adopt a calendar-based approach, would you want to include some economic conditionality? If so, in what form?
- b.  If the Committee were to adopt a state-dependent approach, would you prefer to link the initial change in reinvestments to a numeric value for a specific variable, or would you prefer a less specific approach?
- (2) Would you prefer to cease reinvestments all at once, or would you prefer to phase out reinvestments over time?
- a. Would you prefer taking the same approach for Treasury securities and for MBS, or should they be handled differently?
- b.  If you prefer different treatment for Treasury securities and MBS, how should the approaches differ?

Potential Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections

<!-- missing-text -->

Possible Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections

-  Addition of median projections
-  Revision of Figure 2
-  Later this year:  a recommendation for fan charts to illustrate forecast uncertainty

Median projections

-  Current SEP content:
- o Table 1 and Figure 1:  ranges and central tendencies for macroeconomic variables
- o
- Figure 2:  dot plot for the federal funds rate
- o Figure 3:  histograms for all variables
-  Medians would improve communications
- o Provide a better measure of the collective view, in a more direct form
- o Standard and robust statistical measure of the center of a distribution
- o Publication would foster public use of the median as a summary of projections
-  Proposed revisions to Table 1 and Figure 1:
- o Add columns with medians to Table 1
- o Add funds rate to Table 1 as a memo item
- o Add thick red lines for medians to Figure 1
-  Recommended introduction:  September 2015
- o Minutes of the July meeting will report discussion of medians
- o Complete mock-ups of new materials to be circulated over intermeeting period

Figure 2

-  Top panel reports histogram of liftoff years; bottom panel provides dot plot of funds rate projections
-  Onset of normalization will make the top panel obsolete
-  Dot plot warrants preservation
- o Has helped communicate policy at the zero lower bound
- o Likely to remain useful for policy communication

Forecast uncertainty

-  Adding fan charts to the SEP would help to communicate forecast uncertainty
- o Staff work to date: fan charts centered on median projections
- o Quantitative illustration would complement judgmental assessment
- for communications than is the current o Fan charts likely to be more effective SEP table of forecast RMSEs
-  Concrete proposal to the Committee to come after the subcommittee resolves technical issues

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections  of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for  both  measures  of  inflation  are  percent  changes  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates  of  change  in,  respectively,  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index for PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's  projections  are based  on  his  or her assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the  rate  to  which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate  are  the  value  (rounded  to  the  nearest 1 8 / percentage  point)  of  the  midpoint  of the  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the  appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The  December  projections were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  16-17,  2014.

- 1. For  each  period,  the  median  is  the  middle  projection  when  the  projections  are  arranged  from  lowest  to  highest. When  the  number  of  projections  is  even,  the  median  is  the  average  of  the  two  middle projections.
- 2. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 3. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 4. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Definitions of variables are in the general note to table 1. The data for the actual values of the variables are annual.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In December 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 15, and 2. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.

Exhibit 2:  Alternatives A, B, and C

Alternative B

- could become appropriate to lift off in September
- but sufficiently data dependent to avoid a deliberate shift in current probabilities
- the labor market continued to improve
- solid job gains and declining unemployment
- cumulative progress in labor market conditions important
- still need to see "some" further improvement
- assessment of current and expected inflation developments unchanged
- but energy prices have fallen back
- still need to be "reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over the medium term"

Alternative A

- policy normalization not likely to begin for some time
- risks to economic activity and the labor market to the downside
- risk of persistent below-target inflation
- inflation concerns emphasized
- stronger inflation criterion
- "prepared to use all tools" to raise inflation

Alternative C

- economic conditions and the outlook consistent with lift off
- proposes language that might accompany the start of policy normalization
- indicate further appropriate adjustments expected
- add a sentence linking the overall stance of monetary policy to the funds rate
- update forward guidance for future target range adjustments
- "deviations from" objectives, or
- "economic conditions relative to" objectives
- option to retain intention to follow "balanced approach"
- retain expectation that the target rate will be below longer-run "normal" levels for some time
- add that the path might change and "will depend on the incoming data"

FOMC STATEMENT JUNE 2015

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter.  The pace of job gains picked up while the unemployment rate remained steady.  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.  Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown some improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.  Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports; energy prices appear to have stabilized.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
- 4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
- 5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR JULY 2015

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April June suggests that economic activity has been expanding moderately after having changed little during the first quarter.  The pace of job gains picked up while was solid and the unemployment rate remained steady declined .  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.

The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. However, in light of economic and financial developments abroad, the Committee continues to see  the risks to the outlook for s economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced tilted to the downside . Moreover, the Committee is concerned that inflation could run substantially below the 2 percent objective for a protracted period.
- 3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee anticipates judges that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident projects that inflation will move back to its reach 2 percent objective over the medium term within one to two years .
- 4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions. If inflation does not begin to rise soon, the Committee is prepared to use all of its tools as necessary to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years.
