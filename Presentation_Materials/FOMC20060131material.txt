Exhibit 2 Statement Considerations

Two Key Wording Questions

- 1.  How high are the odds you place on tightening at the March meeting?
- 2.  How much do you want to emphasize dependence on the data?

Alternative B

Greater Emphasis on Data Dependence

The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.

In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

The Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability.

In these circumstances, the Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to those objectives roughly in balance.

Exhibit 3 Ownership of the Statement

Options

- 1.  Vote on the entire statement and the directive.
- 2.  Vote on the directive and assessment of risks.  Clarify ownership of the remaining portions of the statement by voting to authorize the Chairman to provide a rationale for that action.
- 3.  Retain the status quo.

Vote Under Option 1

Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4½ percent.

Statement Language

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4½ percent.

Although recent economic data have been uneven, the expansion in economic activity appears solid.  Core inflation has stayed relatively low in recent months and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.  Nevertheless, possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures.

The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

Vote Under Option 2

Directive Wording

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee in the immediate future seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with increasing the federal funds rate to an average of around 4½ percent.

Risk Assessment

The Committee judges that some further policy firming may well be needed to keep the risks to the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance.  In any event, the Committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to foster these objectives.

Rationale Language

The Committee authorizes the Chairman to provide a rationale for the policy action in the statement to be released after this meeting.
