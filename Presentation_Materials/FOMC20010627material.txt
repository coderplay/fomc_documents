- a Cyclical regressors include the growth rate in real GDP and the civilian unemployment rate.
- b Capital services per hour are log-detrended interpolated values of the BLS annual series. An HP-filtered series yields nearly identical breakpoints and estimated trend rates of growth.

Note: Minimum spacing between breakpoints is 23 quarters (20% of sample).
