APPENDIX

Mr. Chairman,

I will be  referring to  this package of  charts distributed just now  at the table.

In  assessing the  prospects for changes in  monetary policy in Germany, Japan and the  United States, in each case in  recent weeks market participants appear to  have come to the  same conclusion: namely, that interest rate changes are expected: "not now, . . . later." In  this setting, financial markets have recently traded with something of a  happy calm.

As  you can see in  Charts 1A, B  and  C,  near-term, forward interest rates in  Germany, Japan and the  United States, specifically, rates on  3-month deposits, 3,  6 and 9 months forward, all have two features in common: first, they all suggest an  expected rising structure of future short-term interest rates and, second, the levels of  expected rates had  all been shifting higher over the period but have come down a  bit in  recent days.

German forward rates rose in  June as the Bundesbank extended its fixed-rate, 3.3 percent repo operations in  the face of continued above-target growth in  M3. Market participants have for some time been expecting the Bundesbank to  lower the repo rate if  M3 growth moderates, to take advantage of  the room provided by  the reductions in  the Lombard and  Discount rates in April. With this background, five other European central banks lowered rates during June. However, the longer the Bundesbank goes without reducing the repo rate, the  greater the odds seem that the next move will be an  increase rather than a  decrease --though still sometime off in  the future.

On  balance, Japanese forward rates are now  unchanged since your last meeting and  below the levels reached in  late April when market participants thought the  Bank of  Japan might raise rates in  early summer. The weight of evidence released during the period indicated a  strengthening Japanese economy but one not yet sufficiently strong to  meet Japanese officials' criteria of a self-sustaining expansion. Thus, the prospect for a Bank of Japan rate increase appears to  have been put off  at least until the fall.

Forward interest rates on  dollar deposits rose sharply following the release of  the May  non-farm payrolls report but have declined recently as market participants came to think the Committee was less likely to  raise rates at this meeting.

With the widespread sense that interest rate increases in the U.S., Japan and  Germany are a  problem --if  at all --for "manana", the three bond markets have traded relatively uneventfully and to little net-consequence, as  you can see in Charts 1D, E  and F. German bond yields did  back up  from the time of the Committee's last meeting, but are now  around levels reached in  April and  May. Ten-year Japanese yields are slightly lower and Treasury yields are slightly above their late-May levels.

Other bond markets have been more eventful and  more attractive to  investors, as reflected in  Charts 2A,  B  and  C. Italian, Spanish, Swedish and U.K. 10-year bond yields all declined by  between 12 and  29  basis points as spreads between these "high yielders" and  German bunds narrowed by  between 24 and 41  basis points. Canadian 10-year bond yields declined early in the period to  their narrowest spread against the 10-year Treasury since February 1994 before retracing much of these gains. As  has been the case all year, Brady bonds continued to  rally in  the period, further narrowing their spreads against Treasuries.

Recently, it's true that Mexican interest rates have backed up  and the peso has weakened. It is  also true that the fundamentals in  a  number of these and  other countries appear to be improving. But if one looks widely, both at industrial and emerging markets, there is a  noticeable consistency not only of the countries' "improving fundamentals" but of  what also appears to  be a  "reaching for yield" on  the part of  investors.

In foreign exchange markets, as shown in  Chart 3,  since your last meeting the dollar has traded within relatively narrow ranges against both the mark and  the yen: slightly stronger against the yen  and slightly weaker against the mark.

The greatest expressed concern in  the exchange market has been that a  prompt firming in rates by  the Bank of Japan could strengthen the yen  sharply. Near-term fundamentals are thought to favor the dollar, as  Japanese imports increase with the economic expansion and  the current account surplus tends to decline. However, it is  widely thought that there could be  a burst of yen strength when the Bank of  Japan starts raising rates, as a  result of  the expected unwinding of --  what are thought to  be --  large, leveraged short-yen-long-dollar positions. But for  the time being, the dollar's movements have been slight.

Indeed, the exchange market has enjoyed such low  volatility that traders have been complaining about a  lack of  volatility for some time, which can also be'seen in the low level of implied volatility on  currency options in  the  bottom panels of Chart 3.

While the stability of the dollar's exchange rate is certainly welcome, I  do  not take much comfort from the low level of implied volatility.

While low implied volatilities reflect, in  part, the recent exchange rate stability, they also reflect a  heavy supply of option writers. With low  returns available in  spot market trading, banks and other intermediaries are turning to  the options market to  capture premium income and, thereby, appear to be  building up  a  large aggregate position speculating on  the continued stability of exchange rates.

When spot rates break out of their ranges, the hedging activity of the option writers may  give added momentum to exchange rate movements and  implied volatilities could jump sharply --reflecting increased actual volatility, a  decline in the supply of  eager option writers, and a  squeeze on  those who are short, While I  am  always happy to leave the challenge of forecasting the dollar's levels to  Ted Truman, Charts 4  and 5  give me the confidence to stick my  neck out and note that: recent experience suggests that exceptionally low implied volatilities on currency options have often been followed by  exceptionally large upward spikes in implied volatilities and, frequently, the dollar has not performed very well during these episodes. February and March of 1995 were a particular case in  point.

In domestic operations, to  meet the large estimated reserve shortages the Desk executed both temporary operations and purchased outright 3.3 billion dollars of  Treasury bills on  June 10th. Large reserve needs continue into the maintenance period beginning at the end  of this week but the needs then recede in the subsequent period, as both currency and required reserves are forecast to decline.

As you can see in Chart 6,  we experienced some firmness in the funds rate on  the last days of the first two  maintenance periods following the Committee's last meeting. While demand for reserves still appears to  be  skewed to the end of the periods, on both June 5th and June 19th we  were unable to  inject the full amount of reserves we intended because of insufficient propositions by  dealers. Thus, the firmness in the funds rate on these days principally reflected inadequate supply due to  our smaller-than-intended operations. As an  aside, you can  also see, that we experienced a  sharp spike and then a  drop in the funds rate last night. However, there were plenty of reasons in  the banking system yesterday, but some anomalous inefficiencies in their distribution led Banks first to  think conditions were tight.

On  June 5th, some banks were able to  use the carryover provision to bring their deficiencies into the subsequent period, muting the impact of the low reserve levels on  the funds rate. However, on  June 19th, with a  3.5 billion dollar shortfall in  our operations due to  the lack of  propositions, the funds rate briefly traded at 50  percent before a variety of banks borrowed 3.8 billion dollars from the discount window.

- I  have previously mentioned my  concern about the timing of .our  daily operationswhich fall after the hours when the financing markets tend to  be  deepest and  most active. I  believe it would be  preferable if  we could routinely operate earlier in the morning, when most dealers arrange their financings. But we do  not now  have adequate information on  banks' reserve positions and on  the Treasury's balances sufficiently early in  the day  to be able to operate confidently much earlier than the current 11:30 a.m.

To shift our  normal operating time two hours earlier will require operational changes in  the collection and  dissemination of information on  balances and  reserves at  both the Treasury and the Reserve Banks which may  only be  feasible in 1997 with changes in systems. However, in  the next few  months I will prepare an outline for the Committee of the steps that need to  be taken in the hope that I  can elicit your support in  persuading both Federal Reserve and  Treasury staffs to  accelerate the flow of the reserves data on  which we  depend.

- Mr. Chairman, we  had no  foreign exchange intervention operations during the period. I will need the Committee's ratification of  our domestic operations. I will be  happy to answer any  questions.

FOMC Chart Show Presentation --  Domestic Economic Developments

Chart 1 highlights some of the monthly data that led us to think that activity had  spurted enough this spring to  bring GDP  growth over the first half of the  year to the 3 percent rate indicated in  the Greenbook. The rapid increase in  payrolls, documented in  the upper left panel of the first chart, certainly was a  key element in that assessment; moreover, the low level of initial claims for jobless benefits in recent weeks suggests that employment continued to grow at a good clip last month. To  be  sure, aggregate hours, plotted at the right, have been flat of late, owing to slippage in the length of  the average workweek. But aggregate hours in  May still were 1-1/2 percent at an  annual rate above the fourth-quarter average. Merely tacking on a trend increase in  productivity would put GDP growth in  the first half at 2-1/2 percent or so. Given the likelihood of some snapback from the  weak  productivity performance of late 1995, it  seems entirely reasonable to expect an  outcome somewhat above that rate.

The incoming spending data have been consistent with this assessment. As  may  be seen at the  middle left panel, yesterday's release showed real consumption expenditure up  another 0.7 percent in May; pending a  full report on  June auto sales, it looks like the second-quarter gain in  consumer spending may exceed somewhat the 3 percent cited in  the Greenbook. At the right, I've plotted the data on  new  home sales released this morning. Not only was there no meaningful downward revision of the high numbers for the prior few months, but sales jumped another 7-1/2 percent in  May to  a  remarkable 828,000 annual rate. Even if one does not believe that figure--and I'm  reluctant to, only partly on  the basis of  less rosy reports from some of the major builders--a further sizable gain in  residential

investment last quarter already was  pretty much clinched by  the lagged effects on construction of the rise in starts through April.

Shipments and  orders for nondefense capital goods, at the lower left, were consistent through May with our expectations of a moderating uptrend in this sector; but, with computer deliveries holding up fairly well in  nominal terms, a  substantial increase in real equipment outlays appears in the cards for the second quarter. I should note, however, that yesterday's report on  May nonresidential construction was decidedly on  the soft side, and suggests that overall BFI may  well have increased less than we  predicted.

Finally, the April pace of inventory accumulation outside the auto sector, shown at the right, and the stabilization of auto stocks -- not shown--suggests that there will be a  sizable positive inventory swing in the second quarter. Indeed, our  quarterly estimate leaves room for only modest increases in  May and  June.

As  you  know, our estimate of strong growth thus far this year isn't controversial. The primary question at this point is where the economy is headed from here. That is the subject of  Chart 2,  which summarizes our forecast through the end of  next year. We  foresee a marked drop-off in the pace of expansion this quarter and  generally moderate growth afterwards. Given the  noise in the quarterly data, it's perhaps useful to focus on  the four-quarter moving average line in  characterizing the movements in  activity. That line shows a slippage in  growth last year as firms cut back their rate of inventory accumulation and  a pickup this year with the completion of that correction. The four-quarter change rose to 1-3/4 percent as of the first quarter, and is projected to  reach 2-1/2 percent by  the fourth, before tailing off next year.

We see GDP growth over the next six quarters as running in line with potential, holding the unemployment rate at 5-1/2 percent. To date, this level of resource utilization hasn't resulted in  an acceleration of core inflation. However, we  do think that wages probably have begun to reflect the tension in labor markets, and that a  continuation of that trend will put some upward pressure on  prices. Those pressures are exacerbated by  a  stepup in food and energy inflation, so that core CPI inflation moves up to  3 percent and overall CPI inflation to  a  bit more than that. The acceleration would have been somewhat more noticeable were it not for the assumed effects of technical changes in  the price index.

Chart 3  shows the interest rate backdrop for this projection. We've assumed that the fed funds rate will remain near 5-1/4 percent. And  we've projected that long-term interest rates will come down a little--perhaps I  should say "a little further," in  light of the net decline in  yields since last Wednesday.

Given our inflation projection, these nominal rates might imply a  slight decline in  real rates, as depicted in  the middle panel. But that observation doesn't take us very far in judging the degree of restraint implied by  the recent rise in  long rates or  by  the prevailing level of  rates. The  middle panel shows that real rates are neither exceptionally high nor  exceptionally low  by  the standards of the 1980s and '90s, and the  uptick in  long rates this year has been of moderate proportions historically. The slope of the  yield curve, represented by  the red line in  the bottom panel, has been far from an infallible leading indicator of economic growth; for what it's worth, though, that slope doesn't seem to  be signaling great strength or weakness at this time. Looking elsewhere, we  would note that the

stock market is scarcely indicating a  shortage of liquidity in  the economy, and  that credit seems to be  readily available even to  many marginal borrowers. Overall, financial conditions don't strike us as incompatible with at least moderate growth in spending.

Meanwhile, fiscal policy appears to  be on  only a mildly restrictive course. As  you can see in  the top panels of  the next chart, the federal deficit seems headed for a  fourth straight decline in  the current fiscal year. What I  thought might warrant some explanation is the $35 billion increase in  the deficit we've projected for fiscal '97.

The bullet points, below, summarize the reasons for this bounceback. First, although we're assuming some cuts in discretionary programs, those cuts are not large enough to  produce another absolute decline in  spending. Second, we  aren't anticipating a  continuation of this year's relatively slow growth of entitlement outlays, especially for health programs. Third, there won't be any further installment payments next year on the retroactive tax liabilities imposed on upper-income folks by  OBRA-93. And  finally, we think individual tax withhholding may  be  running high enough this year that there'll be no need next April for the heavy final payments that occurred this year. Admittedly, there is considerable conjecture involved here, but we aren't alone in our thinking. The CBO forecast depicted by the blue lines in  the top panel has not been updated for this spring's tax surprise, but it has a  similar contour.

Ted  will now  talk about the international picture and its potential influence on the U.S. economy.

FOMC Chart Show Presentation --  Conclusion

The next three charts deal with major components of  private domestic demand. The top left panel of Chart 11 depicts our forecast for consumer spending, showing the relative strength of durables in recent years. Owing to favorable price trends and  product innovation, we  expect that durables will continue to lead the way. But growth in total spending--shown in  the first column of  the right panel--is expected to moderate to  a  2-1/2 percent annual rate over coming quarters. This is in line with projected income gains; thus, the personal saving rate--plotted as the red line, on  an  inverted scale, in  the middle-left panel--is expected to  remain around 4-1/2 percent. That panel also shows the ratio of household net worth to income. The relationship between these two  variables clearly is a  loose one. But, even with the weakening in  net worth implied by our forecast of  a  mild stock market correction, the increase in  wealth over the past year and a half might in itself suggest an  upside risk to our near-term spending forecast.

Offsetting that consideration, however, is the fact-reflected in the right panel--that debt-service burdens have been rising rapidly and likely will move still higher. This is not to say that the link between debt burdens and  potential spending is clear. Many well-to-do people probably have been using debt instead of liquidating assets to pay for their purchases; among lower income households that was not an  option, but it is impossible to say whether their spending now  is damped by  their enlarged debt burdens or  by their having already purchased, on  credit, some of the big-ticket

durable goods they couldn't--or wouldn't--afford during the recession and  weak early recovery.

The fact that consumer loan delinquency rates have risen, documented at the lower left, is often cited as evidence of financial stress, but that analysis is not entirely clear-cut. To at least some extent, the rise in  delinquencies reflects the  predictable lagged effect of fast loan growth in the  past few  years and  the extension of credit to lower-quality borrowers. But lenders evidently have been surprised by  the sharpness of the upturn in  payment problems, particularly on  credit cards,  and are  taking steps to  tighten up  their programs. As shown at the right, the willingness of  banks to  make consumer loans, as reported in our loan officer survey, has stabilized; however, we  don't foresee a  tightening of terms or standards that will greatly constrain consumer credit use in  the aggregate.

There also has been a  broadening of mortgage credit availability in recent years and some concern about deteriorating payment performance. But serious delinquencies remain low  overall and there are CRA  pressures to  keep lending, so  we  don't anticipate that underwriting practices will be  shifting into reverse in  a  dramatic way. We  do expect housing demand to  respond, however, to the rise in mortgage rates that has occurred.

As  you can  see in the top panel of the next chart, we  are looking for a  significant decline in starts over the  next few  months. with a  little upturn in  the latter part of 1997 in  response to the projected easing of long-term rates. Right now,  we  can  point to only limited evidence that housing demand is weakening in  the way  we  are forecasting. Certainly, the May sales figures didn't reveal it. And the middle left panel shows how applications for home purchase loans

held at a  high level through June. Last month's Michigan survey--at the right--showed only a  small drop-off in  perceived homebuying conditions, which remain at a  fairly high level as well. We  expect some further decline in  this index. Whether interest rates are seen as high or low is the major driver of  this index, and  the perceived unattractiveness of interest rates has yet to catch up  with the rise in  rates, as  may be seen in  the bottom panel. Incidentally, in the plot here, I've shown the prevailing rate on fixed-rate mortgages as  a ratio to the average of  the past four years--a measure that is much more highly correlated with the index of rate attractiveness than is the actual rate itself; this may get at the question of  what people see as normal. In any event, you can also see that--if past patterns hold--our rate forecast implies that, after a  considerable near-term drop, perceptions of rate attractiveness should recover somewhat.

Chart 13 summarizes the outlook for business investment. We expect to  see a  general slowing in  growth of outlays for  both equipment and  structures. You can see this in  the top two  panels. In fact, by  next year, growth in  both non-computer PDE and structures spending is projected to  have come to  a  virtual halt. Accelerator effects, depicted in the  middle left panel are central to  this forecast. Financial factors play little role in  the slowing. As  you can see at the right, corporate cash flow is expected to  cover the bulk of capital outlays, and for firms that need to  borrow, credit availability is expected to remain good.

Inventory investment is  projected to  have risen in the second quarter and to rise further in  the third, driven mainly by developments in  the auto industry. After that, it  is expected to be relatively flat, causing the stock-to-sales ratio, shown at the right, to drift downward.

To sum up, we  foresee a  moderation in the growth of domestic demand. But the result is still growth in  aggregate spending that we perceive to parallel that of the trend of  potential output. Chart 14 provides a  reminder of the key elements of our assessment of  potential GDP  growth. The rise in labor productivity in  recent years has fit quite well with the trend of just over 1 percent per annum that has been in  place since 1973. Meanwhile, labor force participation has been sluggish in  the current expansion, and given the underlying demographic patterns, we have not anticipated any  upturn. All told, with other necessary assumptions, these factors put potential GDP growth at a  shade under 2  percent on a  true chain-weight basis. As you  can see at the lower left, that's just what the Okun's law regression for the 1990s indicates--although the chart also illustrates clearly the great short-run looseness of  this relationship between changes in  unemployment and  GDP growth.

On the assumption that the Okun's law  norm holds over the coming quarters, unemployment will remain in  the recent range. There seem to have been an  increasing number of  reports of labor market tightness and a  few  more anecdotes of  wage increase. There also is some statistical evidence of  wage acceleration, although we  are discounting considerably the surges in  the most recent readings from the average hourly earnings and  ECI wage and salary series. As  may  be seen at the right, we  are projecting that overall ECI compensation growth will drift up  discernibly over the forecast period, as employers compete for scarce workers. About the time we  were wrapping up  the Greenbook, an  agreement was reached in  the Senate on how  the minimum wage legislation would be handled. As a  result, while enactment remains uncertain, the odds on it look greater. The red line illustrates the effects of the two-stage, 90 cent increase that

is contemplated. Our  guess is that the pass-through effect on  price inflation would build to about a  quarter percentage point next year.

Whether one approaches the issue by working through the labor cost side or  otherwise, our  basic point about the inflation outlook is highlighted in the top panel of the next chart. Plotted here is  the demographically weighted unemployment rate, on the horizontal axis, and  the change in  the GDP inflation rate on the vertical. Again, the scatter suggests that there's more to the inflation process than is captured by  this bivariate relationship, but the pattern exhibited does sound a distinct cautionary note about the risks when the jobless rate is below 6 percent.

As  you can see, we are a  little optimistic in  our forecast, in  the sense that our forecast lies below the regression line. We have in  effect assumed that the NAIRU is now  somewhat below 6 percent -- more like 5-3/4 percent. Could the NAIRU be still lower currently? Certainly. But even the  widely noted research by Staiger, Stock and Watson, asserting that there are very wide confidence intervals surrounding NAIRU estimates, concludes that there is relatively low probability that the NAIRU currently is below 5.6 percent.

The bottom two panels touch upon a  couple of other considerations in  the inflation outlook. First, at the left, while we expect energy prices (the red line) to have a  constructive influence in  the near term, they are expected to increase a  little more than core inflation next year. And food  prices are also expected to  rise faster than the core over the next year and a half. Obviously, the uncertainties attending the outlook for supply in  these sectors-perhaps especially in  agriculture--are very large, but we  don't see the assumptions we've made as at all extreme in comparison with what the commodity markets are anticipating. Finally, at the right, if

history is any guide, the latest purchasing manager report on  vendor performance suggests that we shouldn't anticipate much good news in the near term  with respect to the prices of intermediate materials and supplies--although I'd like to see another month's data before I believe that supply conditions have tightened to the degree indicated here.

By  all appearances, you folks have a more sanguine view of the prospects for inflation. The final chart summarizes the forecasts you have submitted. The central tendency of forecasts for output growth in  1996 is 2-1/2 to 2-3/4 percent, CPI inflation is predicted to be in  the 3  to 3-1/4 percent range. This is broadly in line with the staff forecast. But in  1997, while the central tendency of  your GDP forecasts is skewed to the low side of  ours--with unemployment to the high side--the 2-1/2 to 3 percent CPI inflation forecast is lower than ours to  a  greater degree than one would expect on the basis of the other variables. Of course, I have no  way of  knowing to  what extent your forecasts reflect a  difference of  opinion on  the core inflation process or  on the conjectures regarding the exogenous factors in  outlook.

Mr. Chairman, that final confession of ignorance concludes our presentation.

Long-Run Ranges David E. Lindsey

M2 and M3 so far this year have been growing around the upper bounds of  their annual ranges. We  expect these broader aggregates to continue expanding at such rates over the next year and a  half. This prospect again raises familiar issues for the Committee's decision at this meeting about the ranges for this year and next year.

Chart 1  in your package captures the essentials underlying the staff's view of  the outlook for M2. It shows a  scatter plot with quarterly data of  the relationship between M2's velocity, on  the vertical axis, and its opportunity cost, on the horizontal axis, since early 1959. The dots and line in  black represent what we once had confidence in--the co-movement of  M2's velocity and its opportunity cost prior to the 1990s. That is, M2 tended to move together with nominal GDP, except as influenced by  changes in its opportunity cost. The solid black line represents a regression fit over this period, which is a simplified version of  the staff's standard M2 demand equation. The two broken lines show the 95 percent confidence interval around it.

The red dots, which begin in 1990:Q1, indicate the progressive upward structural drift in  M2  velocity through the early 1990s as the historical relationship between velocity and opportunity cost increasingly broke down. A  number of reasons for this updrift in  M2 velocity and associated weakness in  M2 demand were adduced at the time. They involved the  unusually steeply sloped yield curve and very low level of  short-term interest rates, which helped to attract the public to more readily available long-term mutual funds out of liquid balances; the credit crunch at banks and the resolution of  troubled

thrifts, which reduced the aggressiveness with which these institutions sought retail deposits; and the household balance-sheet restructuring, which entailed repayment of  loans out of liquid money balances.

I've plotted the data starting in late 1994 in green. These six quarters all lie close to the green regression line fit over just this recent time frame. The close conformity with the lower black regression line might suggest that the upward structural drift in velocity has ended and that the behavioral patterns typifying M2 demand in  the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s have reemerged. This is what we've adopted as our working assumption in  our forecasts, shown by  the blue Xs, of  M2 velocity for the fourth quarters of this year and next year. As the  bluebook discussion indicated, we expect the opportunity cost of M2  to be edging down as competitive forces push up rates on small time deposits. So, M2's velocity should continue to  diminish marginally through next year. With nominal GDP projected to grow at a  4-1/2 percent rate, this velocity behavior yields our M2 forecast of  5 percent growth this year and next.

Your second chart gives a  different perspective on the relationship of  M2 and GDP--it shows the behavior of real M2 in a  business cycle context, as well as the record of  real GDP. This chart indicates that, although real M2 was an  imperfect leading indicator of real GDP prior to the 1990s, its properties in  this regard broke down completely during the first half of  the 1990s. Real M2 continued to decline while the expansion in real GDP persisted. Only about a  year ago did real M2 resume its earlier uptrend. We  have forecast continued growth in real M2 through the end of next year given the Greenbook's projection of sustained expansion in real GDP.

Judging by  either chart, the evident return of  M2's behavior to historical norms has lasted only for a  brief recent period. This observation implies a  wide range of  uncertainty around the staff M2 projection and makes a significant upgrading M2's policy role seem premature.

The first column of  your next exhibit, taken from page 11 of the bluebook, shows our M2 growth forecast of 5  percent over this year and next, along with our M3 growth projection of 6  percent for the two years. Also, we see debt expanding at a  4-1/2 percent rate over both years, matching the anticipated pace of  nominal GDP. The central tendency of  your own forecasts of  nominal GDP is a  bit higher than the staff's this year but about the same next year.

Two alternative sets of ranges are presented for Committee consideration. Alternative I  replicates the current year's ranges previously selected by  the Committee. The M2 range of 1  to 5 percent was originally reduced to its current specification in July 1993. At that time, forecasts for that year suggested, correctly as it turned out, that M2 growth would undershoot the lower bound of  the 2  to 6 percent range previously set in February of  that year. By July 1995 the restraining effects on  M2 of special factors and of  hikes in shortterm interest rates had abated and faster growth of M2 apparently had resumed. Even so, the Committee was reluctant to readjust the M2 range upward for 1995 or to  use a  higher range for 1996 to align these ranges better with likely M2 growth. The Committee was concerned that the market could misperceive a  decision to raise the range as signalling either lessened anti-inflationary resolve or heightened confidence about velocity patterns that would lead the FOMC to upgrade the monetary aggregates as policy variables.

These concerns did not deter the Committee a  year ago, however, from making a  large technical upward adjustment to the  M3 range for 1995. It raised that range from 0 to 4  percent, which had been in effect since July 1993, to 2  to 6 percent. The Committee used this higher range for 1996 as well. This adjustment recognized that M3 seemingly had resumed its historical tendency to outpace M2. Historically, the velocity of  M3 had trended down, while trend velocity of  M2 had been flat. In reports to  the Congress, both a  year ago and last February after the ranges were reaffirmed, the Committee characterized the alternative I  specifications for both M2 and M3 as benchmarks for longer-run growth of  the monetary aggregates that, on  the assumption of historically typical velocity trends, would be consistent with effective price stability.

To be sure, over this year and next, nominal GDP growth is likely to run noticeably above the pace that would be associated with effective price stability. Also, the velocities of  M2 and M3 are likely to  be  marginally depressed by the edging lower of  the average opportunity costs of  holding retail deposits. Thus, the staff's baseline projections for M2 and  M3 this year and next are around the upper ends of  their alternative I  ranges. In the framework of  the staff projection, it would take a  substantial increase in  short-term interest rates, as in  the tighter policy scenario in the second column, to  move M2 and M3 comfortably within the alternative I  ranges.

The alternative II ranges for the broad monetary aggregates are 1 percentage point higher than the alternative I  ranges, enough to clearly encompass the staff's M2 and M3 projections. The Committee may judge that an  additional half year of  monetary data has lent credence to the staff's view that growth in  broad money roughly in  line with

nominal GDP will continue over the rest of  this year and through next year as well. Even if the Committee has no intention of  upgrading the broad monetary aggregates as guides for monetary policy adjustments, it may still wish for the ranges to line up better with the probable outcomes for M2 and  M3.

FOMC Current Monetary Policy Donald L. Kohn

The situation facing the Committee, as many of  you remarked yesterday, is one in  which the economy is operating around its estimated long-run capacity with the odds perhaps skewed toward growth above potential, but there are few signs of increased price pressures. In these circumstances, the decision facing the Committee at this meeting would seem to be  whether the possibility of emerging inflation pressures is high enough to  warrant an  immediate tightening of policy, or  whether policy should remain unchanged, pending further information. That choice, in turn, would seem to depend on  a  weighing of the risks and an evaluation of  the costs and benefits of erring to one side or the other. Many of  the possible rationales for each policy option appeared in the Bluebook, but I'd like to expand on a few of  the major items.

On the unchanged policy side are two main arguments: One, that policy may  already be restrictive enough to  keep trend inflation from rising very much, if  at all; and two, that it is worth waiting to get a clearer picture on that score because relatively little may  be lost by a modest delay, even if tightening is needed.

Support for the argument that policy may  already be well positioned comes importantly from the levels of real

interest rates relative to their historical values. As we've discussed before, these comparisons are tricky because other things certainly do not remain equal over time, so that equilibrium real rates vary. Nonetheless, past relationships can provide a  starting point for assessing current financial conditions. As I  showed in  my briefing at the last meeting, a  chart of real long-term interest rates against changes in inflation over the last 15 years indicates that those interest rates right now  are around the value that on average in the past 15 years has been associated with stable inflation. At  the short end of  the yield curve, the real fed funds rate is close to 2-1/2 percent using the Philadelphia Fed survey of expected CPI inflation over the next year. This is a  half point above its long-term average, and it hasn't come down much from last year; that is, by this measure, about three-fourths of the reduction in the nominal funds rate over the past year has been offset by decreases in inflation expectations.

Moreover, both shortand long-term rates probably would not react much to the choice of  the unchanged reserve conditions of alternative B. Although the term structure of interest rates seems to have a  modest firming of policy built into it some time in the next few quarters, that firming is quite modest and most market participants do not anticipate such a move until later this year, if at all.

The staff forecast sees neither the economy nor the level of interest rates as far from where they need to be to contain inflation, and such a  judgment is important in assessing the costs and benefits to waiting. The possibility that the economy is now or soon will be producing beyond its potential implies that accommodative policy will extract an inflation penalty. But because the overshoot is unlikely to be large, the pickup in inflation would be small and gradual, and waiting to gauge the extent of actual inflation pressures probably would not foster a  process that would be difficult to reverse. In the extensions of the Greenbook forecast in  the long-run scenarios section of the Bluebook, a  hike of only 50 basis points in the funds rate at the beginning of 1997 is enough to cap inflation, albeit at the slightly higher level than now prevailing.

There may be benefits to waiting as  well. Although "unusual uncertainties" can be a  cliche used by  policymakers to avoid tough decisions, the behavior of prices and especially wages over recent years suggests that, with respect to the relationship of  inflation to output, "unusual uncertainties" do in fact currently exist. With broad measures of  inflation still well behaved and the early warning signs still mixed--as the cautionary reading emerging from the vendor delivery times in Monday's purchasing managers report is balanced against the quiescent nature of industrial commodity prices--the Committee might see itself as having

time to get additional information on the price and wage setting process. If the NAIRU is, effectively, lower than we previously thought, real interest rates will need to be lower as well than one might judge from history to accommodate a  higher sustained level of production.

Most of  these arguments for  unchanged policy would seem  most consistent with a  view that at this stage of  the business cycle policy should be directed at  keeping inflation from rising, not to bringing it down further. To have much assurance that the latter outcome would prevail would seem more definitely to require a near-term policy tightening. But the case for firming may  be broader than this, resting on  a  notion that short-term rates likely will need to be raised at some point even to keep inflation in check, and that waiting does risk complicating the conduct of policy down the road.

Although real interest rates may be reasonably positioned by  historic standards, they need to be judged against persistent upside surprises to aggregate demand and the state of  other financial conditions. And it is against this background that one could develop an  argument that policy may be too accommodative for the opportunistic policymaker leaning hard against inflation upticks. After their increase this year, real long-term rates are noticeably below their levels in late 1994 and early 1995. While real GDP in 1995 ran below the growth of potential, final

demands still increased about 2  percent. Moreover, although long-term real rates have risen a  percentage point or more since the turn of the year, they are only about half a  point above their average levels in the spring and summer of last year. These later rates, crudely, might be associated with the three percent growth of GDP or final sales now  projected for the first half of 1996, placing the economy perhaps slightly beyond its potential. Whether, in the face of strong aggregate demand, a  half point rise is enough to keep the economy around the level of its potential--or even a  bit below if  you want to tilt inflation down--is an open question. In our new  model, a  half-point increase in  intermediate-and long-term rates by itself cuts only about half that amount, that is, one-quarter percentage point, from annual growth in GDP over the next four quarters. The effect doubles when the dollar rises and the stock market falls, in line with historic relationships. We've seen the former but certainly not the latter. Not only has the stock market risen substantially, but the increase in Treasury rates has not fully shown through to private borrowers, given the narrowing of some yield spreads and the continuing aggressive posture of the banks outside the credit card area. That is, the rise in long-term rates may overstate the effective tightening of  financial conditions.

In part reflecting the sense that financial conditions are not particularly restrictive, the Greenbook has,

in effect, an equilibrium funds rate above current levels, and has identified upside risks to the forecast. With the economy near its potential, it's not surprising the clear signs of added inflation presences have not emerged. If the economy is stronger than expected, they should do so with a lag.

Hence, if  interest rates do need to be raised, the longer that adjustment is postponed, other things equal, the larger it  will have to be. There are two reasons for this. One, the real rate will need to be  more restrictive later, or restrictive for a  longer period, to offset the additional stimulus from holding real rates too low  now. Two, the nominal rate will need to rise by even more than the real rate as inflation expectations tilt up.

In concept, postponing rate increases in  favor of larger rate increases later is not a  problem if the Phillips curve is linear and inflation expectations do not respond asymmetrically, and if  there are no constraints on  upward rate adjustments. Staff work on Phillips curves has not been able to identify such nonlinearities or asymmetric reactions in labor and product markets. But the same may not hold for financial markets. Inflation expectations adjusted down to actual inflation only during the last half of last year. Financial market participants may  be particularly prone to build price acceleration back in if  they perceive the Federal Reserve as becoming more reluctant to

take anticipatory action to head off  the possibility of higher inflation. In this regard, they might see a natural hesitancy to raise rates as being accentuated at this time by pressures on the Federal Reserve to test whether the economy could operate at a  higher level on a sustained basis. Even if  inflation expectations responded only slightly and normally in  wage and price setting, an  upward ratchet in  financial markets would complicate the conduct of policy, in  part by adding to market volatility and making more difficult the interpretation of  incoming signals.

If  the Committee were to tighten policy, it  would be a  surprise to markets, and the reaction could be considerable. As we said in the Bluebook, some extrapolation of any tightening is probably inevitable--perhaps more so from a  25 basis point move. Market participants would be unlikely to view the Committee as having taken the trouble to reverse its previous direction for only one quarter-point firming, and might view the action itself as suggesting that the Committee saw greater inflation risks and consequently the need for higher real interest rates than the market had perceived. But there are elements limiting the extent of the reactions. Unlike in 1994, policy has not been on  hold for 17 months in an admittedly unsustainable posture and investors are probably not as exposed to a  tightening. Moreover, in the 75 basis point easing of the last year investors have been subject to a limited adjustment in a

policy that was basically on  track, so the concept would not be alien. The Committee's explanation of its actions, both in its announcement and in  the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony would be a chance to shape market perceptions.

If the Committee chose not to act at this meeting, but saw the risks as distinctly skewed toward a  need for tightening, it might consider adopting an asymmetric directive. Especially if the Committee were concerned that in current circumstances it might be perceived as responding sluggishly to potential inflation pressures, it  might want to signal its desire to act quite promptly--before the next scheduled meeting--should incoming data suggest a greater inflation threat. The publication of such a directive in late August should not restrict the Committee's actions if the asymmetry is adequately explained in the Minutes. Moreover, the Chairman's testimony in July  would already have conveyed the Committee's concerns.
