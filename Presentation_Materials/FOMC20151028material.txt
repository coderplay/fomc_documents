Exhibit 1 Alternative Definitions of r *

Neutral Real Rate: The short-term real interest rate corresponding to a stance of monetary policy that is neither expansionary nor contractionary.

Natural (Wicksellian) Real Rate: The short-term real interest rate that would prevail if there were no nominal rigidities (for example, price and wage stickiness), and hence is consistent with no deviation of output from its natural level.

Efficient Real Rate: The short-term real interest rate that would prevail if there were no nominal rigidities and also no real distortions (for example, imperfect competition and distortionary taxes) that might cause output to deviate from its efficient level.

Optimal Real Rate: The short-term real interest rate that would be prescribed by optimal monetary policy (defined as the interest rate plan that maximizes a welfare criterion).

Long-Run Real Rate: The average short-term real interest rate measured over a long period of time.

Steady-State Real Rate: The short-term real interest rate that would prevail in the long-run once all structural shocks die down.

FRB/US  *: r The short-term real interest rate which, if maintained for twelve quarters, would close the output gap in the FRB/US model in exactly twelve quarters.

Short-run r* in empirical DSGE models

1. The natural rate of interest (NRI)

- Defined within the New Keynesian modelling framework as

The real interest rate that would prevail in the absence of nominal rigidities

- Optimal in very simple models, where it delivers price stability and full employment
- Not optimal in more realistic DSGE models, but still useful reference for monetary policy
- - Within these models, targeting the NRI generally promotes stable inflation and economic activity

2. Strengths of DSGE approach

3. Estimates from 5 models

DSGE models provide a coherent framework to:

- 1.  Estimate the NRI, which is unobservable
- 2.  Trace movements of the NRI back to the underlying sources of business cycle fluctuations
- 3.  Study alternative policies through the use of counterfactual simulations
- Main drawback: tight link to model features
- As a partial antidote to model dependence, present estimates from a diverse set of models
- - EDO, FR, GIH: Board of Governors
- - FRBNY-DSGE
- - DALLAS: empirical model of r*
- Diversity of theoretical and empirical approaches takes into account model uncertainty

4. Conclusions

- A diverse set of empirical macroeconomic models provides a consistent account of the evolution of the NRI over the business cycle
- Financial headwinds pushed the NRI to historical lows during the Great Recession and have kept it depressed since
- The nominal natural rate is currently back into positive territory and it is projected to continue a gradual normalization

Optimal Discretionary Policy with Imperfect Information about r *

Key Elements of the Modeling Approach

- · A New Keynesian macroeconomic model.
- • An IS equation that relates output to the real interest rate.
- • A Phillips curve that relates inflation to the output gap.
- · Monetary policy stance can be defined in terms of deviations of the actual real rate from the natural real rate (  *). r
- • Policymakers choose optimal policy under discretion, that is on a period-by-period basis.
- · The effective lower bound (ELB) introduces non-linearities.
- · Central bank only observes an imperfect estimate of   *. r

Monetary Policy Strategies near the ELB with Imperfect Information about r *

Conclusions

- · r * is a relevant, albeit complex, benchmark to guide the stance of monetary policy.
- · The unobservable nature of  * introduces inescapable r uncertainties about its estimated value.
- · This lack of knowledge about  * justifies r attenuation in the optimal discretionary policy to incoming information about the state of the economy.
- · This attenuation is a manifestation of a policy of risk management that "takes out insurance" against possible adverse future outcomes.
- · Near the ELB, policy rules that increased the response coefficient on inflation, or that allowed for time variation in the intercept term, could come reasonably close to replicating optimal discretionary policy.

Caveats

- · The usual disclaimer that comes with any model-based analysis.
- · The policies studied are subject to important implementability and communication challenges.

Possible Reasons for the Discrepancy in Expectations

- Investors hold more pessimistic outlook than economists at primary dealers
- Difference between modal and mean outcomes
- Negative term premiums: Contracts offer insurance against adverse economic outcomes

October 27-28, 2015

Exhibit 2: Alternatives A, B, and C

Alternative B

- Real GDP has been expanding at a moderate rate
- Supported by "solid" gain in household and business spending
- Despite softer data, labor underutilization has diminished
- Assessment of recent and expected inflation trends largely unchanged
- Less concern about implications of developments abroad
- But monitoring global economic and financial developments
- Update communications about the timing of the first increase in the target range for the funds rate
- Shift focus from "how long to maintain" to "whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range" "later this year" or "at its next meeting," "based on incoming data"
- Leaves wide latitude at the December meeting, but could lead some to see a higher likelihood of liftoff in December

Alternative A

- Would push out the most probable liftoff date and shift down the expected path
- Less sanguine reading of recent data
- Developments abroad have tilted the risks to the outlook to the downside
- Much greater concern about the outlook for inflation

Alternative C

- Would announce the beginning of policy normalization
- Confident assessment that economic conditions meet the criteria for liftoff
- Labor market indicators will "reach" mandate-consistent levels
- Risks to outlook "balanced"
- Effects of declines in prices of energy and non-energy commodities "will dissipate"
- "Reasonably confident that inflation will rise to 2 percent over the medium term"
- Timing and size of future adjustments will depend on progress toward objectives
- Option to add "balanced approach" language
