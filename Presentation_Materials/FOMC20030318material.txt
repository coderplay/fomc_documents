Retain  a Balanced  Risks Assessment

- * War worries will constitute a significant portion of the  uncertainty.
- * Economy is fundamentally sound.
- * Change would convey more conviction to market  participants than the committee actually had.

Shift to a  Balance Weighted  Toward Economic Weakness

- * More weight given to:
- * Downbeat economic data of late.
- * Forecast that inflation would  move  lower from  an already low level.
- * Best matches investor expectations.

Frank  Knight on Uncertainty

- * ... we can only appeal to the law of large  numbers to  distribute the losses and make  them calculable...in so far as they repeat themselves.
- * ...The conception  of an  objectively measureable probability or chance is simply inapplicable.
- * ... The fundamental  uncertainties of economic life are the errors in predicting the future and in  making present adjustments to fit future conditions.

An Alternative Strategy

- * Defer announcing an  assessment of  risks.
- * Include a  promise to the public of heightened surveillance.
- * Be willing to convene a conference call before the next meeting  if events offer some clarity of direction.
