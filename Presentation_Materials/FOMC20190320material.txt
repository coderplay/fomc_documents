Options for Ending Balance Sheet Runoff

- · Two options for ending the balance sheet runoff on September 30, 2019:
- · Under both scenarios, continue to roll over principal payments from maturing Treasuries at auction ('above the cap' amount through September, 'full' amount thereafter).

Reinvestment of MBS Principal Payments

- · Interim approach for reinvesting MBS principal payments to allow the FOMC time to develop a long-run strategy
- · Reinvest MBS principal paydowns below the $20B cap in Treasury securities in proportion to Treasury maturities outstanding
- · Continue to reinvest MBS principal payments in excess of the $20B cap in agency MBS
- · Proposed MBS reinvestment strategy would avoid having purchases disproportionately focused in any one sector and likely minimize signaling for the long-run.

REVISED DRAFT: Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans

In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings and the level of reserves in the banking system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the Committee to provide additional information regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime.  At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.  The Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization released in January as well as the principles and plans listed below together revise and replace the Committee's earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.

- · To ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation, the Committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over coming quarters provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve about as expected.
- o [The Committee intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of Treasury securities by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of $30 billion to $20 billion beginning in April, and to $10 billion beginning in July. 1 ]
- o The Committee intends to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of September 2019.
- o The Committee intends to continue to allow its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury securities in the longer run.
-  Beginning in October 2019, principal payments received from agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any principal payments in excess of that maximum will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS.
-  Principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS below the $20 billion maximum will initially be invested in Treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; the Committee will revisit this reinvestment plan in

connection with its deliberations regarding the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio.

-  It continues to be the Committee's view that limited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.  The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance.
- o The average level of reserves after the FOMC has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of September will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.
-  In that case, the Committee currently anticipates that it will likely hold the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time.  During such a period, persistent gradual increases in currency and other non-reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.
- o When the Committee judges that reserve balances have declined to this level, the SOMA portfolio will hold no more securities than necessary for efficient and effective policy implementation.  Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system.

12. Changing the Tealbook's Policy Rule

- The staff's current federal funds rate path is well above the SEP.
- This is partly due to greater tailwinds.
- The rule is not serving the FOMC well.
- We will aim to introduce a simple rule that roughly mimics FOMC behavior.
- We plan to re-evaluate the rule regularly.

Monetary Policy Considerations

Two Loss Functions

- Solid: Unemployment gaps and inflation gaps that are equivalent under symmetric loss function.
- Dashed: Outcomes equivalent under asymmetric loss. When u &amp;lt; u*, only inflation outcomes matter.
- Symmetric: Bring unemployment back to u* at the cost of lower inflation.
- Asymmetric: Return inflation to 2 percent even if unemployment falls further.

<!-- missing-text -->

Optimal Policy under Asymmetric Loss

Considerations for Future Communications

- Policymakers may see no intrinsic costs, potential benefits from tight labor market.
- Evaluate possible side effects over appropriately long horizon.
- Asymmetric behavior might result in upward inflation bias.
- When ELB is important, following asymmetric policy might offset downward bias to inflation due to ELB constraint.
- Could communicate that, as long as inflation and expectations don't rise much above 2 percent, strengthening outlook leaves you patient.
- In simulations, public understands upside bias from policy preferences, downside bias from ELB.
- In practice, clear communications important.

JANUARY 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier last year.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.  Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MARCH 2019

Inflation is expected to run below the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective in the near term and then rise gradually toward 2 percent as labor market strength continues and the transitory effects of recent energy price declines dissipate. In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures and to support a sustained return to 2 percent inflation , the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.

Specifically, the Committee intends to slow the reduction of the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities by lowering the cap on monthly Treasury redemptions beginning in May.  The Desk will continue to reinvest each month's principal payments from Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) only to the extent that such payments exceed the corresponding monthly cap amounts. Additionally, starting in October, the first $20 billion per month of any agency principal payments received will be reinvested in Treasury securities; any additional agency principal payments above $20 billion will be reinvested in agency MBS. As noted in the Principles and Plans, the Committee intends to adjust the monthly caps as follows:

- *Applies to combined principal payments of agency debt and agency MBS.
- ** The first $20 billion of any agency principal payments received will be reinvested in Treasury securities.  Any additional agency principal payments above $20 billion will be reinvested in agency MBS.

Consistent with current practice for Treasury securities, the Desk will roll over at auction the principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceed the cap amount for that month.  The Desk will allocate that rollover amount across the month's maturity dates in proportion to the amount of System Open Market Account (SOMA) Treasury holdings maturing on each of those dates.  Rollovers will continue to be accomplished by placing non-competitive bids at Treasury auctions; the bids will be allocated across the securities being issued in proportion to their announced offering amounts.  The final redemption cap will be applied to the September scheduled maturities, which occur on September 30.

Consistent with current practice for agency securities, the Desk will reinvest in agency MBS any principal payments from SOMA holdings of agency debt and agency MBS received during each calendar month that exceed the cap amount for that month.  The Desk's reinvestment purchases, if any, will be concentrated in newly-issued agency MBS in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market.  The planned amount of reinvestments in agency MBS that is anticipated to take place over each monthly

period will be announced on or around the ninth business day of the month and will generally be conducted over the subsequent one-month period until the next announcement.

Additionally, in the March 2019 Principles and Plans, the Committee announced the planned conclusion of the reduction in aggregate securities holdings in the SOMA at the end of September 2019.  Beginning in October 2019, principal payments received from agency debt and agency MBS holdings will be reinvested in Treasury securities via secondary market purchases subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any principal payments in excess of $20 billion will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS in a manner consistent with current practices.  The Treasury securities purchases will initially be conducted across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.  The Desk will provide more details on these operations in May.

Balance Sheet Normalization Principles and Plans

In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings and the level of reserves in the banking system, all participants agreed that it is appropriate at this time for the Committee to provide additional information regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime.  At its January meeting, the Committee stated that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which an ample supply of reserves ensures that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.  The Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation and Balance Sheet Normalization released in January as well as the principles and plans listed below together revise and replace the Committee's earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.

- · To ensure a smooth transition to the longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation, the Committee intends to slow the pace of the decline in reserves over coming quarters provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve about as expected.
- o The Committee intends to slow the reduction of its holdings of Treasury securities by reducing the cap on monthly redemptions from the current level of $30 billion to $15 billion beginning in May 2019.
- o The Committee intends to conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of September 2019.
- o The Committee intends to continue to allow its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury securities in the longer run.
-  Beginning in October 2019, principal payments received from agency debt and agency MBS will be reinvested in Treasury securities subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any principal payments in excess of that maximum will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS.
-  Principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS below the $20 billion maximum will initially be invested in Treasury securities across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; the Committee will revisit this reinvestment plan in connection with its deliberations regarding the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio.

-  It continues to be the Committee's view that limited sales of agency MBS might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings.  The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance.
- o The average level of reserves after the FOMC has concluded the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings at the end of September will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.
-  In that case, the Committee currently anticipates that it will likely hold the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time.  During such a period, persistent gradual increases in currency and other non-reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.
- o When the Committee judges that reserve balances have declined to this level, the SOMA portfolio will hold no more securities than necessary for efficient and effective policy implementation.  Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities and maintain an appropriate level of reserves in the system.
