Exhibit 5 Assessment of Risks

Alternative B With Risk Formula

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to raise its target for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 3¾ percent.

Output appeared poised to continue growing at a good pace before the tragic toll of Hurricane Katrina.  The widespread devastation in the Gulf region, the associated dislocation of economic activity, and the boost to energy prices imply that spending, production, and employment will be set back in the near term.  In addition to elevating premiums for some energy products, the disruption to the production and refining infrastructure may add to energy price volatility.

While these unfortunate developments have increased uncertainty about near-term economic performance, it is the Committee's view that they do not pose a more persistent threat.  Rather, monetary policy accommodation, coupled with robust underlying growth in productivity, is providing ongoing support to economic activity.

Higher energy and other costs have the potential to add to inflation pressures.  However, core inflation has been relatively low in recent months, and longer-term inflation expectations remain contained.

The Committee's economic outlook is such that, if the federal funds rate were maintained at its current level for the next several quarters, output growth is more likely to be above than below its sustainable pace.  Inflation over the same period is more likely to increase than decrease.  [As a result, the Committee views the near-term risks to its dual objectives as tilted to the upside.]  In any event, the Committee is prepared to take the steps necessary to maintain price stability and sustainable economic growth.
