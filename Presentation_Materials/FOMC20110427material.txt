FOMC Briefing on Strategies for Removing Policy Accommodation

William R. Nelson

April 2 6 , 2011

/g3

Questions for Discussion:  Strategies for Removing Policy Accommodation

- 1.  Should the first step in exit be to stop the current policy of reinvesting the principal payments from agency securities?  Should that first step also include a halt to reinvestments of the principal payments from Treasury securities?
- 2.  In removing policy accommodation would you prefer to put asset sales on a largely predetermined and pre-announced path, or would you prefer to actively vary the pace of asset sales in response to changes in the economic outlook?
- 3.  In sequencing actions to remove accommodation, would you favor starting to sell assets before, after, or at the same time as increasing the funds rate?  Would you place a high priority on reducing the size of the SOMA portfolio quickly, even if that would delay liftoff of the funds rate?
- 4.  Do you agree with each of the following statements?
- /g120 The exit strategy should shrink the SOMA portfolio over the intermediate term to a level no larger than what is necessary to implement the Committee's monetary policy framework.
- /g120 The exit strategy should return the SOMA portfolio to an all-Treasuries composition over the intermediate term, which will require sales of agency securities.
- /g120 Asset sales should be implemented within a framework that has been communicated to the public in advance, and at a pace that potentially could be adjusted in response to changes in economic or financial conditions.

MARCH FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that the economic recovery is on a firmer footing, and overall conditions in the labor market appear to be improving gradually.  Household spending and business spending on equipment and software continue to expand.  However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed.  Commodity prices have risen significantly since the summer, and concerns about global supplies of crude oil have contributed to a sharp run-up in oil prices in recent weeks. Nonetheless, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, and measures of underlying inflation have been subdued.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  Currently, the unemployment rate remains elevated, and measures of underlying inflation continue to be somewhat low, relative to levels that the Committee judges to be consistent, over the longer run, with its dual mandate.  The recent increases in the prices of energy and other commodities are currently putting upward pressure on inflation.  The Committee expects these effects to be transitory, but it will pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.  The Committee continues to anticipate a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
- 3. To promote a stronger pace of economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to continue expanding its holdings of securities as announced in November.  In particular, the Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and intends to purchase $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of 2011.  The Committee will regularly review the pace of its securities purchases and the overall size of the asset-purchase program in light of incoming information and will adjust the program as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.
- 4. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.
- 5. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to support the economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate.
