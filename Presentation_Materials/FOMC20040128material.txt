Lessons from the Working Group: Formulas for the Risk Assessment

Principles for the Risk Assessment Design

Questions that were Left Unanswered Key

- 1 . The Committee should vote on the exact wording of the risk assessment.
- 2 The statement should not hamper the policy discussion.
- 3 The statement should be flexible enough to encompass the Committee members views about the operation of the economy and the concepts that can be usefully measured.
- 4 The statement should be clear to the public.
- 5 The statement should cover the range of feasible contingencies.
- 6 The statement should avoid the use of potentially charged terms.
- 1. Should the wording of the risk assessment be in terms of the levels of output and inflation or their changes?
- 2 What conditioning assumption for monetary policy should be employed?
- 3 Over what should the outlook and risks be considered? period

The &lt;Levels A? Alternative

The Committees assessment of the outlook over the next several quarters is that real economic activity may well [fall short of / be about on / exceed] a consistent with the long-run trend of its potential: Over the same period, inflation may well [fall short of / be about on / exceed] a consistent with stability in the run. path path price long

In light of these assessments and its of maximum sustainable and stability, the Committee judges that the risk(s) goals growth price

- of [weak economic activity unsustainable economic activity] (and) / [undesirably low inflation undesirably high inflation]   [is a concern / is of greater concern / are both concerns]
- to both of its long-run are balanced. goals
- Stated in terms of levels, with reference to benchmarks for inflation and output. explicit
- Silent about the conditioning assumption for policy, but based on an assumption of CC
- Horizon is several quarters, but outcomes are described relative to that continue further into the future. paths

The &lt;Levels

The Committees assessment of the outlook is that the level of economic activity will likely [fall short of / about attain remain near / exceed] the run trend of its potential in the foreseeable future Over the same period, inflation will likely [fall below / about attain remain within / exceed] the range consistent with stability in the run. long price long

In light of these assessments and its of maximum sustainable growth and stability; the Committee judges that the risk(s) goals price

- of [undesirably weak economic activity unsustainably strong economic activity] / (and) [undesirably low inflation undesirably high inflation]   [is a concern / is the greater concern are both concerns]
- to both of its long-run are balanced goals

for the foreseeable future.

- Stated in terms of levels, with reference to benchmarks for inflation and output. explicit
- Silent about the conditioning assumption for policy, but based on an assumption of an unchanged policy stance.
- Horizon is the foreseeable future.

The Changes Alternative

The Committee's assessment of the outlook is that economic growth will likely [fall short of / about attain remain near / exceed] its long-run sustainable pace in the foreseeable future Over the same period, inflation likely [fall / remain about the same / rise] will

- Stated in terms of changes in output relative to potential and changes in inflation.

In light of these assessments and its of maximum sustainable growth and stability, the Committee judges that goals price

- economic growth [below / equal to above] its long-run sustainable pace (and) / [falling stable rising] inflation [is the greater concern is a concern / are both concerns]
- the risks to the achievement of both of its run are balanced goals long

for the foreseeable future.

- References to levels and benchmarks would be in the first paragraph.
- Silent about the conditioning assumption for policy, but based on an assumption of an unchanged policy stance.
- Horizon is the foreseeable future.

Some Possible Pitfalls

- run sustainable pace "Long
- "Level of potential output'
- ~Price stability"

Clarity

- 22 'Path consistent with.
- "Foreseeable future

Conditioning assumption

Expedited Release of the FOMC Minutes

Pros

Cons

- Providing more timely information to the public
- Increasing transparency and accountability
- Potential for shortening the policy announcement

- Adverse interactions with other aspects of Committee communications
- Interaction with the MPR and testimony
- Creating additional news events
- Blackout periods

Enhanced Role for the FOMC Projections

There are several margins over which the Committee can choose:

- Increased frequency (every meeting Or every quarter).
- Increased length of projection periods.
- Increased number of variables in the projections
- â‚¬. g-, core PCE inflation; potential output growth, the 'working definition of stability; or the width of uncertainty bands for the projections. price
- Separate projections from the Monetary Report and testimony. Policy

Pros:

- Providing more timely information to the public.
- Both about the central tendencies and the range of opinions .
- Increasing transparency and accountability.
- Possible substitute for the risk assessment in the statement.

Cons:

- As a matter of process; should the forecasts be:
- Included in the minutes of the meetings?
- Revised after the meetings?
- text? Augmented by explanatory
- The might not understand the conditional nature of the projections. public
- Separate publication would create additional news events.
- The Committees credibility could be impaired if the forecasts turn out to be wrong:

Exhibit 4 The  Considerable  Period Sentence

December  2003 FOMC Statement

"With  inflation quite low and  resource  use slack, the Committee believes that policy accomodation can  be maintained  for a considerable period."

Considerable  Period  Options

Retain

*  Confident economy will evolve in a benign manner.

*  Or inflation on  low side of desired  range.

Drop

*  Tightening within  next few meetings not ruled  out.

*  Costs of having to delay tightening or  renege damaging.

Modify

*  Outsized market reaction to dropping.

* "Patience" would imply gradual firming.

Potential  Alternative

"With  inflation quite low  and resourse  use slack, the Committee  believes that  it can  be  patient in  removing its policy accomodation."
