OPERATING POLICY

Statement Regarding Repurchase Operation

September 17, 2019

In accordance with the FOMC Directive issued July 31, 2019, the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York will conduct an overnight repurchase agreement (repo) operation from 9:30 AM ET to 9:45 AM ET today, September 17, 2019, in order to help maintain the federal funds rate within the target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent.

This repo operation will be conducted with Primary Dealers for up to an aggregate amount of $75 billion. Securities eligible as collateral in the repo include Treasury, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Primary Dealers will be permitted to submit up to two propositions per security type. There will be a limit of $10 billion per proposition submitted in this operation. Propositions will be awarded based on their attractiveness relative to a benchmark rate for each collateral type, and are subject to a minimum bid rate of 2.10 percent.

ELB risk

- · Historically, the FOMC has lowered the federal funds rate by more than 4 percentage points during recessions.
- · All responses to the June SEP indicate that the longer-run normal level of the federal funds rate is less than 3½ percent.
- · As a result, it is likely that the ELB will bind in most future recessions.
- · A variety of statistical and economic models confirm this result.

Options to strengthen the current framework away from the ELB

- · The increased risk that the ELB will bind in the future may inhibit the Committee's ability to achieve inflation outcomes that are symmetric around 2 percent.
- · To mitigate this 'low inflation bias' within the current framework
- ම Keep the federal funds rate during expansions at a level lower than justified in the absence of the ELB.
- ම Adjust the federal funds rate less-aggressively when inflation is above the 2 percent objective than when inflation is below the 2 percent objective.

Ways to strengthen the current framework at the ELB

- 1. Forward guidance and balance sheet policies could be deployed faster and more aggressively.
- 2. Committee could announce in advance more details of how the FOMC plans to respond to future ELB episodes.
- 3. Forward guidance could be explicit about the situations in which the provided guidance will cease to apply.

Alternative frameworks

- · The Committee may want to consider policy strategies that overshoot the FOMC's objectives, including make-up strategies.
- · The costs and benefits of overshooting strategies in a simplified economic model are illustrated in the figure.

CLASS II FOMC -- RESTRICTED (FR)

Ways to mitigate the time-inconsistency problem

- · Easier to implement when there is broad public support.
- · Tactics to mitigate time-inconsistency
- 1. Make verifiable promises.
- 2. Communicate policy strategy to the public through a variety of channels.
- 3. Policy strategy that is in effect during both recessions and expansions.
- 4. Rely on shorter-term promises.

Two recent examples of overshooting policies

- · Czech Republic sustainably raised inflation to target.
- ම Czech National Bank published forecasts with inflation overshooting its objective over a relatively short horizon and by a small amount.
- · In Japan, inflation has remained below objective.
- ම Announcement of overshooting was seen as a relatively minor deviation from past policies that had produced low inflation for a number of years.

Makeup Strategies

- · Can makeup strategies better serve the Committee in addressing future downturns?
- · Elements of (inflation) makeup strategies
- o Bygones are no longer bygones.
- o Past misses of inflation are, at least in part, made up.
- · Potential benefits of makeup strategies
- o Lower-for-longer supports aggregate demand and inflation even while the ELB binds.
- o More stable inflation, on average, may lower inflation sensitivity to transient developments and help to anchor inflation expectations.

Design of Average Inflation Targeting (AIT). Part I.

· Length of the makeup window

- o As time advances, inflation misses that occurred farther in the past eventually become bygones.
- o Longer windows imply more extended lower-for-longer interest rate paths.
- o Sensitivity of the economy to interest rates and of inflation to slack critically affects the size of the stabilization gains.

<!-- missing-text -->

Design of Average Inflation Targeting (AIT). Part II.

· Symmetric vs asymmetric nature of makeup

- o What is policymakers' willingness to slow the economy because inflation averaged above 2 percent in the past?
- o Symmetric AIT may constrain desire to act promptly at the onset of a recession.

<!-- missing-text -->

Adjustments to Communication

- · Effectiveness of makeup strategy relies on public's understanding of its elements.
- o Details and evolution of makeup measure (and implications for policy).
- o Evolution of makeup measure vs headline inflation.

<!-- missing-text -->

Inflation Expectations Adjust Less than Predicted by Conventional Theory

<!-- missing-text -->

Key Results

- 1. Makeup strategies help increase inflation from low levels while also moderately offsetting the real effects of adverse economic shocks.
- o This is true even when much of the public is uninformed about the monetary strategy.
- o Caveat: if the public is uninformed, policymakers attempt to reach their average inflation target through overshooting the 2 percent objective and (potentially) overheating the economy.

<!-- missing-text -->

Key Results, Continued

- 2. There is a possibility that makeup strategies, which aim to influence short-run inflation expectations, could inadvertently unanchor longer-run inflation expectations.
- o Overshooting of the 2 percent objective could lead to longer-run inflation expectations drifting upward and result in a longer period of inflation above 2 percent than intended.
- o This risk is particularly salient for asymmetric variants of average inflation targeting.
- 3. If it takes time for the public to learn about a new policy strategy, then early adoption is important.
- o When the federal funds rate is constrained by the ELB, it may be very difficult for the public to distinguish between many different policy strategies.

Some Caveats

- 1. There is still considerable uncertainty about expectations formation.
- 2. FRB/US is only one model of the economy.
- 3. Many dimensions of robustness are not analyzed in our memo.

JULY 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although growth of household spending has picked up from earlier in the year, growth of business fixed investment has been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 2 to 21/4 percent.  This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
- 4. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on July 31, 2019 September 18, 2019 :
