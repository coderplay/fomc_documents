Communications Considerations Regarding Plans for Open Market Operations

Thomas Laubach October 4, 2019

Options for Communications

- · The FOMC could issue a statement following the regularly scheduled October meeting or well before.
- o Separate from your regular post-meeting statement to emphasize decisions are distinct from the choice of policy stance.
- o Announcing decisions before the October meeting would provide more time for Treasury purchases.
- o Releasing a statement prior to October 30 might convey sense of urgency.
- · Highlight continuity with January 2019 decision to maintain an ample supply of reserves so that control over the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of administered rates.
- · Communicating intention to maintain reserves at or moderately above levels prevailing in early September would provide assurance to market participants.
- · How specific to be about the mix and size of outright purchases and of term and overnight repo operations?
- o Communicate intention to conduct outright purchases and term repo operations as necessary to achieve and maintain desired level of reserves.
- o In addition, continue to offer overnight repo operations to mitigate the risk of money market pressures.
- o Specific amounts for outright purchases, size and other terms of term and overnight repo operations could be announced by the Desk, adjusted over time if needed.
- · In light of the uncertainty surrounding the level of reserves most consistent with efficient and effective implementation, emphasize that you…
- o …will continue to monitor money market developments as you assess what that level is;
- o …stand ready to adjust the details of these plans as necessary.
