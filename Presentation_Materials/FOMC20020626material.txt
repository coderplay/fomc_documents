Exhibit 2

The FRB/US Model of Inflation Dynamics

- 路 /c66 t = /c36 /c66 t-1 + (1/c36 ) /c66 t e -/c40 (U  - U t t n ) + relative price shocks + unit labor costs

/c66

- =
- rate of price inflation

/c66

- e = expected rate of price inflation
- U = unemployment rate
- U n = natural rate of unemployment
- /c36 , /c40 = coefficients
- 路 /c66 e reflects knowledge of the structure of the economy, including the conduct of monetary policy.
- 路 How do our factors fit in this model?

/c60

- Changes in the conduct of monetary policy alter the influence of U on /c66 e .
- /c60 Changes in labor productivity growth affect inflation through unit labor costs.
- /c60 Labor market developments shift U n .
- 路 Movements of (U - U  ) n explain about 20 percent of the variation of year-to-year changes in inflation.
