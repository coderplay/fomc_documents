APPENDIX

FOMC NOTES -PRF July 1-2, 1997

Mr. Chairman:

I  will be referring to the three pages of color charts.

Since your last meeting, there has been a  further unwinding of expectations for the Committee to raise rates. As you can see in the first panel, U.S. forward, three-month rates have shifted downward in recent weeks --  particularly following the data releases in early June.

Looking past all of the politics of  European monetary union, German interest rate expectations have shown a  very modest, decline. While there are some indications that the German economy may pick up in the second half of the year, no one expects this to  press on resources, nor to improve the German fiscal position appreciably, nor is there seen to be  much --if any --risk of an  increase in rates by the Bundesbank.

In Japan, as shown in the third panel, interest rate expectations have shifted up and down. Japanese forward rates were rising in  May, significantly influenced by  official pronouncements that the Japanese economy was stronger than the market thought and that the Bank of Japan would be raising rates sooner rather than later. But data releases in late May and early June did not support the heightened expectations created by the earlier open mouth operations and, once again, market participants perceived a  postponement of any  action by the Bank of Japan until closer to calendar-year end.

The market's first reaction to last week's release of the Bank of Japan's "Tankan" survey was to shift back to  the stronger-sooner view. But looking past the headline index, and the exporters' continued strength, the soggy state of the nonmanufacturing sectors suggested that the "self-sustaining forces of recovery" remain elusive.

Looking at this page as a  whole, the narrow spreads between current and forward rates in all three markets are striking. In Germany the spread between current three-month deposit rates and those expected nine months forward is only 27 basis points, here in the United States it is 44 basis points, and in Japan: 62 basis points. Don and I  frequently debate how to  measure term premia in forward contracts: but, however measured, these are very tight.

Turning to the second page, even as Japanese interest rates declined a  bit, shown in the top panel in  the benchmark Japanese government bond, the yen has generally maintained its recent strength against a  number of currencies, as you can see in the bottom panel.

The yen's continued strength, I  think, is a  function of the fears of the unhedged masses, resulting from the pain still lingering from the yen's sharp move in May.

For example, the two-year appreciation of the dollar against the yen induced Japanese exporters to lag their normal hedging of dollar receivables. But now, with a  greater sense of two-way risk, the exporters are playing catch-up and, once again, their hedging activities weigh on the exchange market's consciousness.

Perhaps more importantly, I  think we in the United States take too narrow a  view of  unhedged yen borrowings. By referring to this type of exposure as the "yen carry trade" we compartmentalize it as something limited to the sophisticated, leveraged strategies of hedge funds.

However, in the Asia-pacific economies, borrowing from Japanese banks is routine and unremarkable. While good data on unhedged yen liabilities is hard to come by, anecdotally it seems to  be worthy of note.

One Asian central banker suggested a  rather powerful analogy to  me, by  observing that the Japanese banks were doing in reverse sequence exactly what the U.S. banks did in the 1980s. U.S. banks first over-extended themselves lending to developing economies and, followed this up in the midand late 80s by overindulging in the U.S. real estate market. Japanese banks first over-extended themselves in Japanese real-estate lending in the late 1980's and have spent the last several years aggressively lending to (what we now  call) emerging market economies, such as Thailand. Ignoring the obvious supervisory issues, this view helps me  better understand why I  am  hearing as

much today about unhedged yen liabilities, with dollar-yen trading around 114, as I  did two years ago when dollar-yen was trading below 100.

Turning to the third page of charts, the unwinding of expectations for any near-term rate increase by the Committee gave another shot of adrenaline to the rally in financial assets: here are but a  few examples.

In the first panel, you can again see the impact of the data releases in early June, leading to  the sharp narrowing of the spread between the Committee's Fed Funds target and the yield on the two-year note. Following the non-farm payroll and  retail sales figures --  and reflecting, in part, the tight technical conditions in the short-end of  the yield curve which I  will come back to in  a  moment --this spread was squeezed down to 50 basis points, before widening out a  bit in the last few days.

In the second panel, as a  proxy for the general rally in emerging market debt, spreads over comparable Treasuries of Latin American, stripped Brady bonds are shown. I  think it is significant, if understandable, that these spreads narrowed so noticeably on the fact of the Committee's decision to  leave rates unchanged at your May meeting, suggesting the importance of risk premia tied to the level of  U.S. rates.

In the third panel, various equity indexes are graphed, reindexed to  April 15th for comparison. You can see that the spring rally got going after the release of the first quarter ECI and then simmered down a  bit. Looking back, I  am  a  lot more comfortable with the fact that the market rallied in late April on  muted price data than I  am with the more recent leg of the rally, which took off on  the suggestion of  weaker economic activity, seen in the softer-than-feared employment report on June 6th and retail sales release on June 12th.

U.S. equity markets pretty much peaked out the next day, with the June 13th release of  May PPI (which is not indicated on the chart).

Yesterday's Wall Street Journal story about the "liquidity premia" being paid for the bluest of the blue chip stocks, because they will be  "easier to sell", strikes me a  potential leading indicator of liquidity illusions.

Turning to domestic operations, required operating balances fell to just under 15 and half billion, breaking the previous low set in  January of 15.75 billion, reflecting the continued growth of sweep accounts. However, overall, the Fed Funds market has behaved reasonably well --  with predictable exceptions, such as yesterday when the funds rate traded above 6  percent for much of the day with the conjunction of  the quarter-end and the settlement of  the twoand five-year Treasury auctions. In general, it still appears to  me that the funds market is adjusting to the gradual decline in required reserve levels. However, Don and I  have circulated to the Committee a  paper, prepared by  Board and Desk staff, on  measures which could be taken to address funds market volatility should it develop.

Just before your last meeting, we concluded a  5.1 billion dollar par amount coupon pass and, in the last two weeks, we completed a  second consecutive coupon pass, in three legs, for a total of 4.7 billion par amount.

In  maintaining the current 50-50 balance between Treasury bills and coupon securities in the System Open Market Account, I have been trying to follow a  pattern of alternating bill and coupon passes. However, the bill market has become extremely tight, as described in Section III.B. of the Desk's written inter-meeting report, principally as a  consequence of the Treasury's notable decrease in bill issuance. Instead of purchasing bills, and further contracting the limited supply in the secondary market, I  elected to purchase coupon securities.

Treasury's decreased issuance of bills is noteworthy as an example of external constraints on the management of the SOMA. Last September when the Committee discussed the optimal structure and management of the SOMA, some members expressed a  preference for increasing bill holdings. While we still owe the Committee further work on the principles and alternative portfolio structures which could guide SOMA's management, I  did undertake to  increase the Desk's flexibility by  arranging with the Treasury for them to treat SOMA as an "add-on" in bill auctions, just as they do in coupon auctions, so that amounts we roll over would not be deducted from the Treasury's total offerings to the public.

While formally the Treasury now treats our bill awards as an add-on, as a  de facto matter, it still appears to  me that their offerings to the public are affected by SOMA's rollovers and, thus, we continue to have an impact on  bill supply in the market. I  hope that, over time, the Treasury will become comfortable

treating our bill holdings more flexibly and we will continue our dialogue. But, at least in the short run, unless we want to evaporate the bill market, I  feel somewhat constrained from purchasing bills.

In general, I  prefer the transparency of  making SOMA purchase from the  market and, thus, I  have a  preference not to purchase securities directly from foreign central banks when offered. More recently, I  have also been conscious of the supply conditions in the bill market. However, on June 20th we did purchase just under 600 million dollars worth of  bills from the Bank of Thailand, out of one billion they were seeking to sell. I  was inspired to do  this, in part, to avoid being seen selling a large quantity of bills in the  market on  the day the Thai finance ministry was changing hands. We  also had a  need to add reserves that day, which initially we thought would be around one billion, but we scaled back our purchase when our forecast need declined.

There were no foreign exchange intervention operations during the period.

Mr. Chairman, I  will need the Committee's ratification of the Desk's domestic operations and I  would be happy to  answer any questions.

As often eems to  be the  case, conomic activity s  been  proceeding s e ha at  an  uneven  pace  in  recent uarters, eating  ncertainty out  the  "true" q cr u ab signal manating  from the  data.  Since  the  Greenbook was published  e e w received ore monthly  information  bout  spending  in  the  second  quarter: m a higher han  expected  consumption, ut  lower  inventory  nvestment nd t b i a construction tlays.  On balance,  e would be inclined  t  this  oint o ou w a p t revise up our  estimate  f  second-quarter P  growth  by about  a quarter o GD of  a  percentage  oint,  o  2-1/2 ercent.  I  should ote  that he  charts how p t p n t s the  forecast  s  published  n  the  Greenbook. a i

Averaging  through he  first-quarter    and the  second-quarter g,  we t zig za think eal DP r G growth  has been  running  in  the  neighborhood  of  a 4 percent annual  rate o  far his ear.  This  clearly  s  an  unsustainable ce,  and we s t y i pa expect  economic  growth  to  slow  gradually  ver  the  next  year  and a  half. o The basic ationale  or  the  slowing  was laid ut  for ou in  the  Greenbook, r f o y and I  won't  go through he  entire  tory.  Suffice  t o  say  that,  n  our  view, t s i t i a combination f  waning stock  demands for  business  nd household o a investment oods and a moderate  tightening   financial d credit g of an conditions  hould  damp  aggregate emand. s d

We  expect he  unemployment rate o  edge down  during he  remainder t t t of  this  ear.  Next  year, ith  output rowing  at  around  potential,  e y w g th unemployment rate olds  just  bove  4-1/2  percent--a gree  of  labor arket h a de m resource tilization  at e  think  s  consistent th  upward pressure  n u th w i wi o labor osts nd,  eventually,  prices. ndeed, s  you can  see  from  the c a on I a

For  what it's  orth, he  latest ue Chip consensus orecast  s  telling w t Bl f i a story imilar  o  the  staffs r  GDP s t fo over  the  next ear  and a half. owever, y H the  average  Blue  Chip forecaster ems to  have  a  higher stimate  f se e o potential P  growth--that , he  projected  rowth  of  GDP  in  the lue GD is t g B Chip consensus  is  not  sufficient    keep the nemployment rate rom  rising. to u f The Greenbook and the  Blue  Chip consensus  project  ssentially  e  same e th inflation te or  the  four  quarters  f  1998--suggesting at e are ra f o th w considerably  ore optimistic out  the  likely  ear-term rade-off tween m ab n t be unemployment and inflation.

As shown in  the  upper  panel  of  chart ,  our  forecast  s redicated  n 2 i p o the  assumption hat he  federal  unds  rate ill emain  at  its urrent  evel t t f w r c l through  this ear.  But,  as  inflation  essures  egin  to  mount and  real ates y pr b r drop,  we assume that he  nominal  fed  funds  rate ill ove up about  50 t w m basis oints.  The expectation at onetary  policy ill old  steady n  the p th m w h i near  term  has  helped  fuel   rally  n  bond markets  since he  last  OMC a i t F meeting. However, as  labor arket  pressures  ontinue o  tighten  nd  credit m c t a demands grow,  we think ond traders  ill ose  some of  their  nthusiasm, b w l e and yields  ill egin  to  rise ater  his  ear.  Reflecting e  assumed System w b l t y th tightening,  ng-term ates re  projected  o  rise    bit urther  ext  year-lo r a t a f n averaging  about  7-1/4 ercent n  the  second  half f  1998. p i o

We  anticipate at he  stock arket  will limb  a little  rther  n  the th t m c fu i next  few months. But we think orporate  rofits  ill rove  disappointing c p w p over  time, nd coupled  with  higher nterest tes, is ill ead  to  an a i ra th w l appreciable  arket  correction   1998--on  the  order  of  15 to  20 percent. m in

On the  fiscal  olicy ront,  he  federal  eficit   expected o  widen a p f t d is t touch  next  year  as  the  growth  of eceipts  lows--primarily  cause e don't r s be w anticipate  other utsized  ump in  revenues ike he  ones  we  saw in  the an o j l t past wo years.  In  addition, e  budget  resolution ised  he  caps  on t th ra t discretionary  ending  and this  hould  add about  $8  billion   nondefense sp s to outlays  ompared with  the  last  reenbook.

The next  chart ddresses  he  first   these ssues.  Based on the  evidence f  the  past ive a t of i o f months,  the  foreign  xchange  value  of  the  dollar  n  terms  of ther -10 currencies  ppears o  have e i o G a t reached  a  high  plateau. As is  shown in  the  top  left  anel,  he  rise  n  the  dollar  ince ts rough n p t i s i t i mid-1995 has  been associated th  a relative se n  U.S.  real 0-year nterest  tes. ver the  forecast wi ri i 1 i ra O period,  e are  projecting  slight  ownward  drift  n  the ollar  eflecting  e  net ffect  f  the  four w a d i d r th e o influences  n  the  dollar  isted   the  box at he  right. o l in t

This  brings e to  the  fourth  nfluence  n the  dollar,  uropean  Monetary  Union.

Canada's utput ap is  projected  o  narrow  more rapidly,  ut  to  remain  somewhat p o g t b larger  han apan's  t  the  end  of he  period. t J a t

In  the  case f he  United  Kingdom, our  estimate  f  the  level f otential tput ay well  be o t o o p ou m conservative  n  view of  last  riday's  ubstantial  ward revision   the  level f  actual utput.

The Euro Area  presents  n interesting  se  in  the  context  f  the  start   EMU. a ca o of We  estimate that he  output ap for  the  area  as  a whole  still ll e substantial   ore than  a percentage  oint t g wi b --m p -when the  European  Central  ank opens  its oors  in  early 999.

As always,  a key element  in  our  GDP  forecast  s  the  consumer sector-i the  subject  f  chart . The upper  left  anel,  resents  he  outlook or  sales o 7 p p t f of  light  otor  vehicles. ur projection,    well  as  those f  many  industry m O as o analysts, ts  the  "fundamental" emand  for ight ehicles--based pu d l v on demographic  and scrappage rends--at  out  14-1/2  to  14-3/4 illion  nits t ab m u per  year.  Sales his ear  are  likely  o  once again  exceed  the  underlying t y t trend,  eflecting,    part,  he  strength  f  income and consumer  sentiment. r in t o But sales re  expected  to  move  down toward  the  trend uring  1998,  and a d motor vehicles,  herefore, ve  a  slightly gative nfluence  n GDP  growth t ha ne i o next  year.

As noted  in  the  Greenbook,  we think hat he  current  pause"  in t t " consumer  spending  outside  f  the  motor  vehicle ector  s ust  hat--a use, o s i j t pa and not  the  beginning f  a protracted ump. As I  noted  earlier,  e o sl th monthly  PCE  data  for ay  that e received esterday  ame  in  stronger M w y c than  expected nd have led  us  to  revise  p our  forecast  f  second-quarter a u o consumer spending  by about  three-fourths    a percentage  oint.  Moreover, of p as  suggested y the  forecast  ar  for  1997 in  the  upper  right  anel,  onsumer b b p c spending  for  goods  and services  ther han  motor  vehicles  s xpected o o t i e t continue ising  t  a  fairly pid lip uring  the  next  several  onths, r a ra c d m bringing he  four-quarter  owth  rate o  more than  3-1/2  percent. t gr t

Our bullish  ear-term n PCE forecast  elies,   part,  n consumer r in o sentiment. s may be seen  in  the  lower  panels,  oth  the  overall  ichigan A b M sentiment ndex  and the  question  n  unemployment expectations,  ich is i o wh

not  part f  the  aggregate ndex, uggest hat onsumers  are  extremely o i s t c upbeat  currently.

Returning o  the  upper  right anel,  onsumer  spending  slows  over  the t p c course  of  1998 as  the  pace  of iring  oderates  and income  growth  tapers h m off.  Spending  may  also  be damped  next  year  if enders  ighten  redit  erms l t c t and standards,  s  they've  lready een  doing  on a limited  asis--especially a a b b for  credit  ards.  Finally, ere s  the  question f  our  stock arket  forecast c th i o m and  how  we see  it ffecting  onsumer  spending.  That  is he  subject  f our a c t o y next  chart.

Share  prices ave  risen  oughly  90  percent  since he  end h r t of 1994, producing  a substantial  crease  n  price-earnings  tios.  he p-e  chart in i ra T shown here  updates  the  one Mike presented  o  you in  February.

And yet,  analysts  xpect  even  faster  rofit  rowth  for he  next  three e p g t to  five ears--the ddle  left  anel. y mi p

In  terms  of  our  consumption  forecast,  e  ups  and downs  of  the  stock th market  are  expected o  have  a muted effect. he lower  panel  compares  the t T wealth-income atio  the lue  line)  ith  the  consumption  rate--that  ne r ( b w is,o hundred  minus  the  saving  rate. he chart uggests  hat onsumption  growth T s t c since  early  1995 has  been  considerably  ess han  would have been  expected l t on the  basis f  this imple  wealth-spending  elationship.   course,  he o s r Of t opposite roblem  existed  arlier   the  nineties.  uture evisions   the p e in F r to national  ncome accounts ould  possibly  lter  his icture, t  for ow  it's i c a t p bu n our  assumption hat n  recent ears  other actors  ave  been  offsetting  e t i y f h th influence  f  the  wealth  effect. revious reenbooks  have  discussed  ome o P G s of  the  possible  xplanations: rong ncome growth  that  as not  yet  been e st i h fully ncorporated  nto erceptions  f  permanent  income;  increased  ebti i p o d service  urdens, specially ong  households  with  below-average ncomes; b e am i and perhaps  an increased  esired  o  save  for etirement, pecially ven  the d t r es gi attention   the  media to  the  problems  of  the  social  ecurity  nd  Medicare in s a systems.  In  any event, ur  assumed stock arket  correction   1998 o m in reverses  his  ear's  harp  rise n  the  wealth-income atio, ich  may  begin t y s i r wh cutting  nto pending  by  year  end. i s

Your next  chart xamines  the  other ey source  of  deceleration   GDP e k in growth  next  year:  slowing  of  business pending or  equipment.  As may a s f be seen  in  the  upper  panel, nvestment  n  producers'  urable quipment  this i i d e year  is  growing  at  an even  more remarkable ate han  the  outsized  ace r t p recorded n 1996--fuel  y continued apid pending or  computers,  surge i b r s f a

in  aircraft  liveries,  d a revival  f  outlays  or ther apital  oods after de an o f o c g a period  of  dormancy. However, all hree omponents  of  PDE  are  expected t c to  grow more slowly  in  1998.

The middle  left  anel  presents  ctual  nd expected nit hipments  of p a a u s PCs. The data  are  collected  the  Information  echnology  Industry by T Council,   trade ssociation presenting e  leading S  PC and a a re th U microprocessor  anufacturers. s you can  see, he  industry  xpects m A t e shipments o  cool  a bit his ear  and  next.  Nevertheless, ey  still e t t y th ar forecasting ins  of  more than  15 percent er  year.  Recognizing he ga p t performance  improvements  in  these oxes,  unit C sales nderestimate b P u by perhaps  10 percentage oints  r  more the  growth  of  real omputer p o c investment  s  reported  n  the  national  ncome accounts.  If nything,  hen, a i i a t our  forecast  f  an 18-1/2  percent ise  n  real utlays ext  year  may  be on o r i o n the  low side.

Meanwhile, Boeing  continues  o  ramp up  its roduction. y the  end  of t p B this ear, oeing  expects o  be completing 0 planes  per  month--about y B t 4 twice  the  pace  recorded ate ast  ear.  Under current  chedules,  he l l y s t delivery  ate evels  ff n  1998 and  the  impetus o r l o i t GDP growth  from  this sector  lackens. s

months. But investment  emand is  projected  o  soften hereafter    output d t t as decelerates d cash-flow lattens. an f

In  contrast  o  the  marked deceleration  are  forecasting r t we fo equipment, he  growth  in  outlays or  nonresidential  ructures    expected o t f st is t be maintained t  close o  the  current  ate.  Contracts  or rivate a t r f p nonresidential  ildings  re  at  high  levels;  acancy  rates  or  office  pace bu a v f s have declined teadily; nts re  rising; d REIT financing  s  readily s re a an i available.

As shown in  the  upper  panel  of  exhibit  0,  the  strong nvestment  n 1 i i computers  has  been associated  ith  a pickup  in  the  growth  of  the  capital w stock  for nformation  rocessing  quipment.  In  addition, e  growth  of  the i p e th stock  of  other inds  of  business quipment--the  iddle  panel--rose   the k e m in mid-1990s  and has  remained  elevated  ompared with  the  1980s and early c nineties.  ccordingly,  he  lower  panel  illustrates  t he  average  growth  of A t tha t aggregate apital  nput or quipment  and  structures  lative   the  growth c i f e re to of  labor--that  , apital  eepening--has  een  running  bit aster  n  recent is c d b a f i years  than n  the  preceding ecade. But  this elatively  all tepup s  not i d r sm s i enough,  by itself,  significantly st ur  assessment f  trend roductivity to boo o o p growth. And, as  Dave Stockton ill ow discuss,  still e  no w n we se compelling vidence  that here as  been  an  improvement  in  the  growth  of e t h potential P  recently. GD

As shown in  the  upper  panel  of  your  next  chart,  e'  re  projecting at  he  growth w th t in  potential tput ver  the  next ear  and  a half ill emain  at  the  1.9  percent  nnual ace ou o y w r a p that  e estimate  as  prevailed  ince he  cyclical ak  in  1990. That  projection w h s t pe is composed of  nearly qual  contributions  om  the  growth  of  labor nput--line  -and  the e fr i 2growth  of  productivity--line 3.

Taken at  face alue, he  published igures  or  productivity   the  nonfarm business v t f f in sector  oint  o  a sharper lowdown in  productivity nce  1990 than  we have  assumed-p t s si perhaps  to  about  3/4  percentage oint  er  year.  However, as  we have  noted  previously  n p p i the  Greenbook,  we are  anticipating  at eal utput nd,  hence  productivity, l e revised th r o a wil b up in  this ummer's  annual  revisions   the ational  ncome  accounts y enough  to  support s to n i b our  0.9  percent stimated  rend--plotted  red  in  the  middle anel.  But  in  the  absence  of e t in p any clear igns n  the  data  of  an increased  ace  of  efficiency ins  or  a greater  ick p in s i p ga p u capital  eepening,  e  have  been  reluctant    project   still gher rend oing  forward. d w to a hi t g

The acceleration   economic  activity er  the  past ear  likely  as  provided in ov y h a boost  to  output  er  hour.  However, next  year, e anticipate  at roductivity  ll ise p w th p wi r a bit ore slowly--gradually  proaching ts  onger-term  rend--as tivity celerates d m ap i l t ac de an firms each  deeper  into he  diminishing  ool  of ualified rkers. r t p q wo

Abundant  job  opportunities  ve  been  drawing  people nto he  labor orce t  a ha i t f a rapid lip ver  the  past ear.  The labor orce articipation e--shown  n  the  lower  left c o y f p rat i panel--moved bove 67  percent  n  recent onths,  up about  1/2  percentage  oint rom  a a i m p f

year  ago. And  in  the  context f  our  projection   some further  ightening   labor o of t of markets, e anticipate at  he  participation  te ill ontinue o  edge up over  the  next  six w th t ra w c t quarters.

As shown at  the  right, e  resulting bor orce rowth  is  expected o  remain  above th la f g t its   percent rend ver  the  projection riod.  Even so,  the  projected  trength  f  economic 1 t o pe s o activity is  ear  and smaller roductivity ins  in  1998 cause  employment growth--the th y p ga second  column--to utstrip  he  expansion  of  the  labor orce ver  the  forecast  eriod. o t f o p

As a consequence, he  unemployment rate--shown  n  the  upper  left  anel  of  chart t i p 12--  falls  o  close o  4-1/2 ercent y early ext  year.  Other  indicators   labor arket t t p b n of m conditions  re  showing similar  igns f  tautness.  or  example,  in  the  Conference  Board a s o F survey--the  pper  right  anel--the mber of  households eporting  hat  obs re  plentiful u p nu r t j a exceed  by a  wide margin  those  reporting  hat obs re  hard  to  get.  In  addition, e  help t j a th we've  been  getting  rom decelerating alth nsurance osts ay  be coming to  an end. f he i c m The results  f  a Peat  Marwick  survey  of  large irms re  presented  n  the  middle  left  anel. o f a i p These  firms eport  arger ncreases  n  health nsurance remiums in  1997 than  in 1996. r l i i i p Although  these ncreases  re  small  and  could  be  offset  y  lower  wage gains,  ealth are i a b h c costs re  unlikely  o  be as  favorable  n influence  oing  forward  as  they  have  been in  the a t a g recent ast. p

In  our  view,  these actors  lready  ave  left  ome imprint  n compensation f a h s o inflation--plotted e  black  line n  the  lower  panel.  And  with  the  unemployment rate as  th i projected  o  move still wer,  further  ild  acceleration   xpected ver  the  next  year t lo a m ise o and a  half. hat  this rocess as  not  gained  any  perceptible mentum T p h mo likely  eflects e r th

fact hat,  hile  tightness   labor arkets  may be boosting ourly  compensation osts t w in m h c a bit  ore quickly,  e have  yet  to  witness ny  increase  n  inflation  pectations--a m w a i ex necessary ngredient  f  a conventional  age-price piral.  ndeed, he  Michigan  survey  of i o w s I t inflation  pectations--shown    the  middle  right  anel--has sically en  moving ex in p ba be sideways  for  some time  now.

To a  large xtent,  evelopments n  product arkets  appear,  hus  far,  o  have  short e d i m t t circuited is eedback echanism. Two  key  factors, clining  on-oil  mport rices nd th f m de n i p a ample manufacturing  lant apacity,  re  highlighted   the  upper  panels f  your  next p c a in o exhibit.  s shown in  the  left  and  panel, on-oil  mport rices  ropped  3 percent ast A h n i p d l year  and appear  to  have  declined t  a  similar  ace  over  the  first lf f  this ear.  For  the a p ha o y reasons  that  ed discussed  arlier,   are  expecting hese eclines  o  give  way to T e we t d t increases  ater  his ear  and  into he ext, eakening one  of  the  factors  hat  as l t y t n w t h suppressed rice nflation  er  the  past ear  and  half. p i ov y

Another  favorable  nfluence  as  been  healthy  rowth  of  capacity,  hich has  kept i h g w the  factory  tilization e lose o  its  istorical  erage,  nd  by our  assessment,    largely u rat c t h av a a neutral  nfluence  n  price ressures  n  the  goods sector.  oreover,  we  are  anticipating i o p i M that tilization  tes  ill dge down over  the  projection terval,    manufacturing u ra w e in as investment  lans  are  only  gradually  caled ack  in  response o  the  weakening of  sales, p s b t profits,  d  cash low  that  e have  projected  or his  ector. an f w f t s

Owing to  these estraining  fluences,  e  cyclically  justed  arkup of  prices  ver r in th ad m o unit abor osts n  the  nonfarm  business  ector--plotted he  middle  panel--is pected o l c i s in  t ex t drift  own  somewhat over  the  forecast riod.  As a  consequence,  e are rojecting ly d pe w p on

a  very  modest  upturn n  broad  measures  of  price nflation--shown    the  lower  panels. i i in GDP  prices--the ack  line--are ojected  o  pick  up from  a  2 percent  ncrease  n  1996 to bl pr t i i a 2-1/4  percent ncrease  his  ear  and  2-1/2 ercent  ncrease  ext  year.  The sharp  slowing i t y p i n in  food  and  energy  prices  nder  way this ear, hich  receives    much larger  eight  in u y w a w PCE  prices--the  d  line--results  ower  consumption rice nflation  is ear  before re in  l p i th y moving up to  a  2-1/2  percent  ace  in  1998. p

Obviously, here re  considerable  isks  hat ie n both  sides f  our  inflation t a r t l o o projection.  ne risk s  that urrent  nd prospective  abor arket  tightness ll eave  a O i c a l m wi l clearer  ark on the  inflation  ocess oing  forward  than  has  been  apparent ver  the  past m pr g o year.  And, if he  price ews turns ess avorable, e  feedback  into nflation  pectations t n l f th i ex and labor osts ould  be  more abrupt. c c

Another  risk, ich has  received  onsiderable  ttention,   he  possibility  at wh c a ist th fundamental  changes  are  taking lace  in  the  economy that ave  raised  nderlying p h u productivity owth  and  restrained  flation. e implications   such  an acceleration gr in Th of in productivity  e  the  subject  f  your  next  two charts. n  the pper  panel f  chart 4,  I ar o I u o 1 have  plotted  roductivity    the  nonfinancial rporate  ector  f  the  economy.  This  sector p in co s o covers  a bit ore than  half f m o GDP and may  be  less  usceptible   measurement  error  han s to t the  financial d  non-corporate  ectors  f  the  economy.  Much  like he  broader onfarm an s o t n business  easure  showed in  chart 1, m I 1 there re  no clear-cut gns hat  he  trend n a si t t i productivity   this ector  as  improved. But  over  the  past wo years--a  eriod   have of s h t p I highlighted   red  on the  chart--productivity  increased  t  nearly  3 percent  nnual in has a a a rate,  ell  above its  -1/2  percent  istorical  end--the ack ashed  line. w 1 h tr bl d

If ne wished  to  take  an optimistic ant, ch  an  upturn ould  be viewed  as  hinting  t o sl su c a an improving  productivity rformance. pe

You, of  course,  re  quite  amiliar th  the  suspects  n  this tory--rapid  vestment a f wi i s in in  new technologies,  e  payoff rom  corporate  estructurings,   the  imperative  o th f r and t innovate n  response o  an increasingly  mpetitive  orld  economy.  I  would note  one i t co w additional ssibility--low   stable  nflation.  ome acceleration   productivity po and i Ifs of is under  way, the  reduction  n  inflation  d  inflation  certainty   recent  ears ay have i an un in y m played  an  important upporting  ole. s r

The lower  panel  of  the  exhibit  utlines  he  effects at  step-up n  the roductivity o t th a i p growth  trend ould have on both  the  supply and demand  sides f  the  economy.  On  the w o supply  side,  n increase  n  the  pace of  productivity owth  will nitially se usiness a i gr i rai b profitability  enabling irms  to  produce  more with  less. owever,  competitive  ressures by f H p soon  would emerge that orce  down  price nflation    better  eflect e  slower rowth  in f i to r th g the  costs f roduction. n  labor arkets, eal ages rise  ore rapidly  hrough ome o p I m r w m t s combination f  lower  price nflation  d larger  ominal  wage gains. o i an n

On  the  demand  side f  the  economy, technological provements  boost usiness o im b investment,  s  firms eek  to  take  advantage f  profitable portunities.  useholds  also a s o op Ho raise  pending  as  more rapid rowth  in  both  capital d labor ncome lead o  upward s g an i t revisions   their  stimate  f  trend--or -called  ermanent--income. eedless  to  say, in e o so p N there re  similarities  ween these upply-  nd demand-side  effects  nd some recent a bet s a a economic developments.

Price easurement  for  monetary  policy m

Over the  past ear, ommittee  members have  raised    number of  questions  bout he y C a a t conduct  of  monetary  policy n  a  low-inflation  vironment.  In  a  paper irculated  cently  o i en c re t the  FOMC, my  colleagues  avid  Lebow, Deb Lindner,  an  Sichel,  nd  Bob Tetlow  focused D D a in  depth  on issues  urrounding  he hoice  of  a  price easure  to  guide  monetary  policy  nd on s t c m a defining ero  inflation    terms  of  the  available blished  rice ndexes. z in pu p i

We  organized ur  project  round  four  basic uestions: irst, at  does  economic o a q F wh theory uggest s  the  measure  of  prices  ost  appropriate r udging  the erformance  of s i m fo j p monetary  policy?  Second,  what  are  the  statistical  ationships ng  the  major  price rel amo indexes hat e monitor? Third, hat  are  the  measurement  errors  n  these ndexes nd what t w w i i a rate f  change  in  these easures  would correspond oughly o  zero  inflation?  nd  finally, o m r t A what would be the  consequences or  the  stability    real utput nd interest  tes,  f  focusing f of o a ra o monetary  policy n  various easures  of  price nflation? o m i

Let  me  start  ith  the  guidance rovided y economic  theory. nfortunately, eory w p b U th does  not  point nambiguously  to  a specific ice ndex  to  guide  monetary  policy. n u pr i I principle,    answer  the uestion  oherently  equires   complete  model of  the  economy that to q c r a incorporates l f  the  costs f  inflation. ing  such  a model,  one could  trace  onetary al o o Us m policy ctions  hrough  to  their  ffects  n different  ice easures  and  then  define   price a t e o pr m a objective  o  minimize  the osts f  inflation  d inflation  certainty.  he problem  is hat o t c o an un T t n such  comprehensive odel exists.  s a  consequence, ur  analysis--like  iterature--is m A o thel somewhat compartmentalized  nd  thus  not  entirely tisfying. at  said,  he  authors  ote a sa Th t n some useful bservations. o

One observation  s  that  ome costs f  inflation  int oward  the  desirability i s o po t of stabilizing road  measure  of rices, th  the  choice  determined y one's  udgment  about a  b p wi b j how inflation stortions  e  related  o  movements in  various easures  of  aggregate  rices. di ar t m p Households, usinesses, d governments  all articipate    transactions  at  ould  be  distorted b an p in th c by  inflation,  pairing fficiency d  ultimately ducing ociety's  nsumption ossibilities. im e an re s co p Under these ircumstances, abilizing road  collection   prices,  uch  as  the  GDP  price c st a  b of s measure,  might  be  appropriate.  f  ne viewed  household ecisions, rticularly  ose elated I o d pa th r to  long-term aving  and  investment,   most  susceptible    errors  ssociated th  inflation, s as to a wi greater  eight  might  be  placed n stabilizing onsumption  price easure, uch  as  PCE w o a  c m s prices. ut, e see  little  stification   onsidering,   a  long-run bjective, y  narrower B w ju forc as o an measure  of  prices.

A second  observation  s  that  he  measure  of rices  mplicitly  bedded in  nominal i t p i em interest tes  ight  be  the  appropriate jective  f olicy,  specially  ne  were concerned ra m ob o p e ifo about  minimizing  tax  distortions  d  limiting e ffect  f  the  inflation  sk  remium on the an th e o ri p cost f  capital.  hat is his  easure? We  don't  now.  It ould seem likely  hat  nterest o W t m k w t i rates  re  determined y  the  interaction    borrowers nd lenders  ho must  be considering a b of a w a very  broad  range  of rices  n  making their  ecisions.  his  is n  issue hat eserves ome p i d T a t d s careful  mpirical  ttention. e a

Finally,  noted  that here re  some arguments  in  favor f  including  ssets  n he we t a o a i t price ndex  to  guide  monetary  policy. rankly,  e didn't ke much progress  valuating i F w ma e these rguments.  And, in  the nd,  we largely  unted  on  the ssue or hree retty  ood a e p i f t p g reasons:  no theory,  o data, nd  no empirical  odels. With respect  o  the  theory,  here s n a m t t i

surprisingly  ttle  rk that ddresses  his  ssue. n  the  data ide,  onstructing   index  that li wo a t i O s c an included   reasonably  omprehensive  coverage  of  asset  rices  ould be  a  monumental a c p w undertaking.  inally, rgeting ch  an index,  ven  if  t  ere available,  uld be such  a F ta su e i w wo radical  eparture  rom  your  past ehavior,  conometric odels  estimated  n historical  ta d f b e m o da would not  provide uch guidance  for olicymaking. 'm  afraid  hat  his  s  an  issue hat m p I t t i t remains  on  the  research  genda. a

In  the econd  section  f  the aper,  he  authors  ddress he  question  f  whether, n s o p t a t o i practice, e  choice  of  an  inflation  asure  matters. f ll  he  major  measures  move closely th me I a t together  ver  time, he  choice f  which index  to  focus n will  ot  be  very  consequential.  e o t o o n W employed a battery  f  statistical  ts  o  determine hether  most  broad  measures  of  inflation o tes t w move together  ver ong  periods r  drift  part;  n  the argon f  econometricians,   tested o l o a i j o we whether  measures  of  inflation  e  cointegrated.   concluded  that he ost  broad  measures ar We t m are  cointegrated;  hat  s,  CE, GDP,  and  CPI inflation   not rift  part ver  long  periods  f t i P do d a o o time.

However,  that oes  not  mean that  hese easures  will lways  be  giving he  same d t m a t signal bout  inflation. e paper  presents  preads etween  the  four-quarter  anges  of  the a Th s b ch major  indexes.  Over the  past en ears,  he  GDP  chain-weighted  rice ndex  has  increased, t y t p i on average, bout  0.3  percentage  oint er  year ess han  the CE  price easure, nd 0.5 a p p l t P m a percentage  oint er  year ess han  the  CPI. But  year y year, hese ifferences uctuate p p l t b t d fl considerably  nd  can  give  conflicting  gnals  bout  the  magnitude  and direction  f nflation a si a o i movements.  For  example,  PCE  inflation  s  run  about  0.2  percentage  oint  ess er ear  than ha p l p y CPI inflation  er  the ast en ears.  But  for  a  time  last  ear, CE  prices  ere  rising 4 ov p t y y P w 3/

In  the hird  ection  f  the aper,  he  authors  eview  our  current  hinking  bout t s o p t r t a measurement  bias n  the  CPI,  and  extend hat  nalysis  o  GDP  and  PCE  prices. learly, i t a t C in assessing  he  performance f  inflation  lative   the  objective  f ero  inflation, s t o re to o z it i necessary  o  take  account  of  the easurement  bias n  the elevant  rice  ndexes. s we have t m i r p i A noted  previously, r  current  est stimate  f  the nnual  bias n  the  CPI  is  about  1  percentage ou b e o a i point. y  1999,  we estimate  hat  he  bias ill e  about  0.8  percentage  oint  er  year.  The B t t w b p p smaller stimated  ias  largely  eflects  r  assumption hat  LS  will mplement  geometric e b r ou t B i weighting or  some item  strata  n  the  CPI next ear, urther  educing  ow-level  ubstitution f i y f r l s bias.

Because  PCE  prices,   a  large xtent,  se  CPI components  in  their  onstruction,  is to e u c th index  is ubject  o  most  of  the  same sources f  measurement  bias.  The principal ception  s s t o ex i that  hain-weighting  f  the CE  price easure  avoids he  upper-level  ubstitution s hat c o P m t s bia t plagues he  fixed-weighted  PI. We  estimate  hat  he  overall  ias n  the CE  chain rice t C t t b i P p index  will e  0.6  percent  er  year  in  1999--two-tenths ss han  the  CPI. A  little  re guess b p le t mo work was involved n  deriving    measure  of he  bias  in  the  GDP i a t price ndex.  But  using  the i available  esearch  nd  a  dose  of udgment, e estimate    bias f  0.7  percent  er  year. r a j w a o p

There  isn't  ch evidence n whether  these iases ight  have  changed  over  time.  It's mu o b m possible  hat  he  rapid ace  of  technical  hange  that  e perceive  n ecent ears as  led  to  an t t p c w i r y h

In  the  final  ection  f he  paper, e explored ow stabilization  various  nflation s o t w h of i measures  might  affect  he  behavior f  real utput nd  interest  tes. ecause  certain  rice t o o a ra B p indexes  are  more sensitive   certain  ypes f  shocks, tabilizing  fferent ice easures to t o s di pr m could  have different  nsequences or  the  variability   eal utput nd interest  tes. or co f ofr o a ra F example,  because  we consume more petroleum roducts han  we produce, luctuations    oil p t f in prices  ave  larger  ffects  n  PCE  prices  han  GDP  prices. onsequently,  f  hese ere  the h e o t C i t w chief ource  of  inflation  sturbances,  miting  luctuations    PCE  prices  ould  result s di li f in c in larger  luctuations    real utput han  would a  similar  tabilization DP  prices. f  course, f in o t s of  G O the  opposite  ould  be  true s  well; omestic roductivity  ocks  would have  larger  ffects  n c a d p sh e o production  rices  han  consumption rices. p t p

MONEY AND DEBT RANGES FOMC BRIEFING Thomas D. Simpson

July 2, 1997

The choice regarding annual ranges for broad money and debt conjures up a  sense of  deja vu. The staff is again projecting that growth in  M2 will be  near and M3 a  little above the upper ends of their respective ranges for this year. Moreover, the picture does not change greatly for next year, measured against the current ranges which were first selected in  mid-1995. In contrast, debt of  domestic nonfinancial sectors continues to  expand around the midpoint of the 3 to 7 percent range that was first adopted at the beginning of 1995.

Perhaps the best way to examine these projections is to begin with debt. The top panel of  your first exhibit shows that we expect debt this year and next to continue growing in  the 4-1/2 to 5-1/2 percent shaded area that has characterized the period since 1990. This is close to projected growth in  nominal GDP this year and a little faster than GDP next year. The composition of  total debt growth, however, is shifting a  little from federal, the thin line, to private borrowing. Within the private sector, borrowing by businesses is expected to be  boosted by healthy gains in  capital outlays, in the context of  little further improvement in internally generated funds, while household debt decelerates further but continues to outpace income. In  the period ahead, we see private sector borrowing restrained only fractionally by a  shift by creditors away from accommodation toward snugging. With banks and thrifts healthy and lending continuing to be  profitable, even as credit quality erodes a bit, we foresee depository credit growing in line with or a  touch faster than debt over these two years, as shown by the thin line in the lower panel.

The top panel of your next exhibit illustrates the staff's projected funding by  banks and thrifts of those depository credit flows. The M3 funding of depository credit, the shaded portion of the bars, picked up in 1995 around the time that depository credit moved higher. In particular, issuance of large time deposits, shown in the center panel for commercial banks, reversed course and has risen smartly ever since. Last year, M3 was lifted by some substitution of CDs for liabilities to foreign offices, the broken line, although that runoff may be drawing to an end, perhaps owing to the pickup in  credit this year that needs to  be financed. We  expect recent funding patterns, with a  considerable emphasis on  M3 sources, to persist through next year.

We also expect that money market mutual funds in  M3, shown in the memo line of  the lower panel, will continue to grow very rapidly reflecting to their popularity for liquidity management, imparting some upward thrust to M3. As a  consequence, the staff projects that M3 will grow 6-1/2 percent this year and 6  percent next year, also shown in the lower panel, extending to four the number of consecutive years of M3 growth in  the 6  to 6-3/4 percent area.

Probably of  more importance to the Committee is M2 and the issue of  whether its recent behavior has been in line with a  more traditional velocity relationship. Exhibit 3  plots the now-familiar relationship between M2 velocity, the vertical axis, and a  measure of opportunity costs, the horizontal axis, and is the same as chart 6  in the bluebook. As illustrated in the upper panel, along the top line, recent observations remain in the cluster that has characterized the period since mid-1994, which is amplified in  the lower panel. The implied velocity relationship--as embodied in  the slope of the line-has properties that are quite similar to the one that characterized

the three-decade period ending in the late 1980s, the lower line in the upper panel.

The incoming evidence on the M2 relationship has, indeed, been encouraging. Staff analysis suggests that, in addition to a similar relationship with opportunity costs as before, recent experience has been consistent with less noise in  the V2-opportunity cost relationship and a  prompter response of  M2 to  movements in interest rates and income than before.

Nonetheless, the period of closer fit still is quite short in terms of statistical reliability, and one that has been on the tranquil side of longer historical experience. Moreover, the financial environment has changed in some important ways since the late 1980s, such as the much greater availability and lower transactions costs of long-term mutual funds, which as an analytical matter might suggest changes in  velocity behavior. These considerations would seem to argue for continued caution in  viewing M2 as a  serious guide to policy or a  key indicator of economic developments, although continued stability and predictability might suggest that unexpected movements in  this aggregate deserve some weight in  the constellation of indicators that you rely on in assessing economic and price trends.

Our forecast of  growth in M2 for this year, 4-1/2 percent, falls a  little shy of  that of income and thus our expected Q4 velocity in the lower panel, shown by  a  red X, stands a  little above that of Q4:1996. Next year, we  are projecting that M2 growth, at 4  percent, will again fall short of income, implying a  value of  V2 for Q4:1998 shown by  the other red X. The rise in  V2 next year owes to some assumed monetary tightening over the second half of the year.

In view of  these various considerations, the staff has suggested two alternative sets of ranges, shown on exhibit 4,  which also appear on  page 20 of the bluebook. Alternative I  ranges are those adopted for 1997 by  the Committee in  February, and alternative II ranges are higher by 1  percentage point for M2 and 2  percentage points for M3, better centering them on staff projections both for this year and next. The suggested range for debt is the same under both alternatives. I  would note that your central tendency for growth in nominal GDP, shown as a  memo line, brackets the staff forecast for this year but is a  little higher for next year. This implies that if your financial assumptions are similar to those of the staff, your expectations for money and debt growth, based on  normal velocity behavior, are similar to those of  the staff for this year but perhaps a  bit stronger for 1998.

Should the Committee believe that velocity relationships are still rather uncertain and that the most effective role for the ranges continues to be as benchmarks of  monetary growth under price stability and historically normal velocity behavior, then alternative I  would again seem to be  favored, both for 1997 and 1998. The midpoint of alternative I  for M2 is 3  percent, close to staff's expectation of nominal GDP growth under price stability. Because we  would also expect debt growth to average around 3  percent in  these circumstances--the bottom of the current debt range--the Committee might want to consider lowering the range for debt to that of  M2, were the debt range, too, to be viewed as  a  benchmark under price stability. However, changing any of  the ranges could run the risk of being construed by  the public as suggesting that the Committee would be  placing greater emphasis on the money or debt aggregates in  its conduct of  policy than it has in recent years.

Should the Committee instead wish to announce ranges consistent with its expectations for  money and debt growth, it still could choose between alternatives I  and II. Alternative I  ranges might be favored in  this context if  the Committee thought that velocity relationships had become reasonably predictable again and it wanted the ranges to convey expectations of  money growth under a relatively tight policy stance designed to lean against upward inflationary pressures. Were there concerns that a  boom economy might be in  the offing, M2 in  that event would likely breach the upper end of  the alternative I  range, providing a  further rationale for imposing more monetary restraint.

Alternative II ranges are better centered on staff projections, given the Greenbook forecast and its financial assumptions. Moreover, they might be  viewed as more consistent with the Committee's expectations for 1998, given your central tendency for nominal GDP growth. Furthermore, alternative II ranges provide greater scope for real output to expand in  line with favorable supply shocks to the economy as  well as a  little more headroom if the Committee foresaw turbulence in equity markets as a  distinct possibility and the monetary aggregates becoming a  likely refuge for shell-shocked investors.

FOMC  Briefing Donald L.  Kohn

I'll begin with some thoughts on  the longer-term strategies section of the bluebook, talk a  bit about how the  results of those exercises might--or might not--relate to  the current situation and  finish with proposed changes in  the  wording of the operational paragraph of the  directive.

My  take on the  modeling exercises will start with chart 2 following page 6  of the bluebook. These simulations are  built from the Greenbook forecast and illustrate the basic risk embodied in  that forecast. Specifically, that the economy most likely is operating beyond its sustainable potential, and unless the  Committee tightens sufficiently at some point, inflation will be  on an  upward trajectory.

This imbalance has opened up  despite a  real federal funds rate, shown in the upper right panel, that is at  or even above its  historical averages. Those historical averages do  not factor in the extraordinary contribution of recent financial conditions in  supporting spending. In  effect, the rise in  stock prices and unusually generous provision of credit to  many private borrowers, through their effects on  wealth and  on  the cost of funds, are seen as having substantially increased the  equilibrium rate. In the staff forecast, narrowing profit margins take their toll on equity prices and credit availability, and fiscal policy continues to  be  modestly restrictive, reducing the  equilibrium

rates. Eventually, a  real funds rate around its current level becomes high enough to  bring aggregate demand in line with longrun supply. But this happens over a  period of  years. In  the interim, inflation picks up, so that merely avoiding a  decline in the real funds rate will require raising the nominal rate--a process the Greenbook assumes gets started in  the second half of next year.

If the staff has correctly identified the risks, the question is not  whether the funds rate will have to  be  raised, but only when, by  how  much, for  how  long, and  what will be  the eventual inflation rate. Once an  output gap  has opened, inflation pressures begin to  build, and  the sooner action is taken, the less disruptive will be  the needed adjustment. At  this point, according to the model, holding inflation near its recent levels without incurring a  recession--the "stable inflation" strategy--can be  accomplished with fairly prompt action and a moderate rise in the nominal funds rate over the  next year.

These simulations were done by  taking the extended Greenbook forecast and  manipulating the federal funds rate to  achieve particular outcomes. A  more general question concerns the  Committee's strategy in  responding to actual or expected deviations of output from potential and  inflation from its objectives as the economy is subjected to  unexpected developments. In  particular, we  were interested in comparing the consequences of a  so-called opportunistic strategy--one that waits for favorable surprises to  reduce inflation from moderate levels--to strategies that

deliberately seek lower inflation. To  make this comparison, we needed to  move away from the Greenbook projections and subject the staff's econometric model to a  set of surprises that approximates those that have hit the economy over the last several decades. These are the stochastic simulations in the second part of this bluebook section. We  tried to look at two potential issues--getting to  price stability, and  what happens once you're there.

As to  the first issue, the results shown on  chart 4  after page 12 address the transition from one steady state with inflation at  2-1/2 percent to another with inflation at 1 percent. The asymmetric responses of an  opportunistic policymaker to inflationary and deflationary surprises under these circumstances do  guarantee that the long-run inflation goal is eventually achieved. Not surprisingly, it takes considerably longer on average if a  policymaker waits for favorable shocks rather than deliberately seeking price stability. In fact, the time to  get to  price stability under the opportunistic strategy depends on the nature of the shocks hitting the  economy--the smaller the shocks, the longer the time. All policies ultimately entail about the same cumulative output loss, but the  deliberate policymaker takes that loss earlier, for  a  shorter time, and  in the form of larger output gaps than does the  opportunistic policymaker. The  model, as  we  used it, does not  differentiate between deliberate and opportunistic policies in terms of the public's understanding of the System's objectives and  hence the

credibility of  policy. Moreover, it  makes no  provision for reduced distortions and enhanced efficiencies as inflation falls; presumably the choice between these approaches would rest, in part, on  an  evaluation of the benefits of achieving price stability sooner under a  deliberate strategy relative to the costs of the sharper output losses likely to  be involved.

Within the set of deliberate strategies, it is instructive to  compare the Henderson-McKibben or target zone policy rules to the Taylor rule. Not only is attention to output gaps entirely consistent with achieving inflation objectives, but  placing more weight on  such gaps than on  the deviations of inflation from its objective, as in  the Henderson-McKibben rule, may involve achieving this goal on  average with less wrenching adjustments.

Comparing chart 4  with chart 5,  which is after page 15, raises the question as to  whether strategies need to  be  adapted once the inflation objective has been reached. This is an important topic--and a  full treatment would deal with the potential problems of the zero interest rate constraint, among many other issues. As  you can  see, given shocks of the nature of those of the last 30  years, there is a  substantial probability of measured inflation falling below zero when one is your objective. In  this limited exercise, opportunism, which to  be sure is usually presented as  a  transition strategy, fares poorly in  the steady state in  terms of  damping variations in  inflation around a

goal. Henderson-McKibben seems to  do  very well, with its strong responses to inflation and especially output gaps.

But, I  should caution, a  number of caveats apply to this result, raising questions about whether vigorous policy responses are always advisable in  the real world--especially the world you are facing now. First, the  parameters of the  Henderson-McKibben rule were derived to  work well in  a model not too  dissimilar from the one  actually used to generate these simulations. In  addition, in  using a model--and in  particular its steady state--we are assuming that the underlying structure of the economy is known and  does not change over time; in the exercises, all the surprises that the economy faces involve the  positions of the various functions, not the slopes. The size of the coefficients that govern how the economy responds to  monetary policy are known with certainty. As  you discussed at  your last meeting, some kinds of uncertainty--especially about the response of the economy to  policy--do argue for a  cautious approach.

Moreover, forceful policy is  most appropriate when surprises are in aggregate demand. In  such circumstances, output and inflation are  moving in the same direction; with no short-run tradeoffs, vigorous policy is stabilizing in  every respect. In effect, the staff forecast embodies such a  shock, in  which unanticipated strength in aggregate demand has pushed the economy past its sustainable potential. Recent favorable inflation outcomes are seen, in  part, as the consequence of temporary factors that are likely to dissipate, as Dave Stockton discussed. This

is  what gives the payoff we  saw in the first set of simulations from prompt policy actions, and  would be  the rationale for  an immediate tightening, as in  alternative C.

Such a  response might not  be appropriate if the surprises are more on  the supply side of  the economy. Supply shocks do entail tradeoffs, in  which policymakers might well choose more restrained actions that take some of the surprise in  prices and some in output. Dave's briefing modelled a  favorable productivity surprise in  which the Committee could realize some combination of lower inflation and  higher production. The  bluebook showed an  exercise in  which NAIRU was 4-3/4 percent, and holding the funds rate locked in  the current unemployment and inflation rates.

Thus, in  formulating policy, differentiating among various types of shocks is essential, but this can be  quite difficult as events unfold. Key  uncertainties at this time surround the relationship of output to  prices--whether or to what extent there has been a  favorable shift in  the economy's aggregate supply. The  combination of  an  upside surprise to output and  shortfall in inflation in  the first half of this year does suggest the possibility of a  favorable supply shock, rather than a  shift in demand.

In  these circumstances, the  Committee may  view recent data as  at least justifying maintaining the "wait and  see" posture of alternative B  to assess the current situation. It  may  view  data on  actual prices and  the absence of most early signs of  pressures

on  margins and  prices, as increasing the  possibility that the economy is  not producing appreciably beyond its potential. Moreover, slowing final demand may suggest that the expansion is moderating enough to hold the economy at  its present level of resource utilization, limiting any  buildup of inflation pressures that may  be  occurring. Finally, with inflation already quite low, the Committee may  see the gains from further disinflation as sufficiently small to  take a  bit of a  chance on  the economy being able to  sustain the  current high operating level.

But, as I  noted, identifying the type of shock is problematic in real time. Prices usually lag  output, and  movements or  surprises in  prices and  economic activity over a  relatively short interval--such as the first half of this year--may not be  unambiguous indicators of the  underlying situation. The size of the decline in the unemployment rate and  the  degree of strength in  output may  suggest that at least some of the firsthalf performance reflected a positive demand surprise that threatens to  outpace any lasting upward shift in  sustainable supply. Any  such increases in long-term supply are likely to occur relatively slowly if they  are the result of a  pick up  in productivity trends that are just becoming visible in  the  data, or of  more flexible product and  labor markets.

Consequently, even if the Committee believes the staff has not fully taken into account the implications of the recent good price performance, it may  see the risks still as tilted toward higher inflation. If so, at  some point it  may  wish to consider

further tightening, even before it sees convincing evidence of accelerating prices. If demand has overshot potential, as the simulations showed, the longer corrective action is delayed, the more difficult the adjustment is likely to  be. So  long as the Committee saw this to  be  a  distinct possibility, and the incoming data weren't contradicting this hypothesis, a  gradual, occasional firming might be  one  possible approach, which ensured against cumulating inflation pressures. A  view that higher inflation remained the  major risk to the economy, and  one that was serious enough to  potentially warrant Committee action before too long, could be  reflected by  retaining the asymmetrical language of  the directive.

And that brings me  to  my  final subject. The bluebook suggests Committee consideration of the changes in the wording of two  sentences in  the operational paragraph of the directive, which are shown on  page 31. In  the first sentence, the alternative would make explicit your expectations for the funds rate-something you now  do in  public announcements of  policy changes. We  propose retaining the language that indicates that you  work through reserve markets to the federal funds rate, rather than simply giving a  funds rate target. This is an  accurate description of  the process, and  avoiding the implication that the Federal Reserve controls the federal funds rate absolutely and directly might be  especially helpful if that rate becomes more variable with the drop in reserve balances.

The second suggestion involves the sentence dealing with intermeeting changes in the reserve conditions and the funds rate. No  changes are  proposed for the preamble of the sentence, which describes the background against which any such decision should be  made. But we  do give possible alternative wording for the  part of the sentence that establishes symmetry or  asymmetry. The alternative drops the  would/ might and  slightly/somewhat distinctions, which the Committee has been making less use  of  in recent years. In  addition, in  framing the symmetry/asymmetry language we tried to give a  sense of  what this might mean in the context of  considering an intermeeting policy adjustment. Specifically, it seems to  imply something about how incoming information is weighed. For  example, an  unexpected pickup in consumer prices might be  more likely to trigger consideration of action if the Committee were already concerned about the risks that inflation would rise. We  recognize that various members interpret this part of the directive differently, that no intermeeting adjustment has been  made for some time, and that we may  feel a  certain kinship with Pandora before the  discussion proceeds very far. Indeed, the Committee has lived for some time with the "constructive ambiguity" of the current wording of this sentence, and  may  prefer to  continue in this mode.
