Statement Regarding Treasury and Agency Reinvestments

[June 14, 2017]

On [June 14, 2017], the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to begin reducing the reinvestment of principal payments from the System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS). As described in the June 2017 addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the Committee intends to reduce reinvestments by implementing a series of gradually rising caps that limit the reduction, or runoff, of Treasury and agency securities holdings each month.

The Committee directed the Desk, effective in July, to reinvest in new Treasury securities at auction only the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during a calendar month that exceeds $6 billion, and to reinvest in agency mortgage-backed securities only the amount of principal payments received during a calendar month from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities that exceeds $4 billion. This step will begin a gradual decline in the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.  Based on June 2017 addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans, the schedule of monthly runoff caps will be as follows:

<!-- missing-text -->

** Once caps reach their maximum amounts, they will remain in effect until the Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.

For Treasury securities, the reinvestment amount for a given month will be determined by subtracting the Treasury runoff cap amount from the total amount of Treasury principal payments scheduled to be received over that calendar month.  The Desk will allocate that reinvestment amount across the month's maturity dates in proportion to total maturities of SOMA Treasury holdings on each date.   In months when the amount of maturing securities held by the SOMA is lower than the runoff cap, the full amount of maturing principal will be allowed to runoff.

Consistent with current practice, Treasury reinvestment operations will continue to be accomplished by placing non-competitive bids at Treasury auctions allocated proportionally across the securities being issued by announced offering amounts.

Similarly, for agency securities, the reinvestment amount for a given month will be determined by subtracting the agency runoff cap amount from the sum of agency MBS principal payments that are anticipated to be received over the month plus the agency debt principal payments that are scheduled to be received over the month. In months when the amount of principal proceeds are lower than the runoff cap, the full amount of maturing principal will be allowed to runoff.

Consistent with current practice, reinvestment purchases of agency MBS will continue to be concentrated in newly-issued agency MBS in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market. Going forward, the planned amount of reinvestments in agency MBS that are anticipated to take place over each monthly period will be announced on or around the ninth business day of the month and will generally be conducted over the subsequent one-month period until the next announcement.  Specifically, in [July], the reinvestment amount will be announced on [July 14] and purchases associated with that amount will proceed through [August 11].  The [June] monthly reinvestment amount and operating schedules will remain unchanged by the change in the reinvestment policy.

Draft of

Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans

Addendum to the Policy Normalization Principles and Plans

As adopted effective [June 13, 2017]

- [All] participants  agreed  to  augment  the Committee's  Policy  Normalization  Principles and  Plans  by  providing  the  following  additional details regarding the approach the FOMC intends to use to reduce the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury and agency securities once normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. 1
- · The Committee intends to gradually reduce the Federal Reserve's securities holdings  by  decreasing  its  reinvestment  of  the principal  payments  it  receives  from  securities  held  in  the  System  Open  Market  Account.  Specifically, such payments will be reinvested only to the extent that they exceed gradually rising caps.
- ○ For  payments  of  principal  that  the Federal  Reserve  receives  from  maturing Treasury securities, the Committee anticipates  that  the  cap  will  be  $6 billion  per month initially and will increase in steps of $6 billion  at  three-month  intervals  over 12 months until it reaches $30 billion per month.
- ○ For  payments  of  principal  that  the Federal Reserve receives from its holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities,  the  Committee  anticipates  that  the cap will be $4 billion per  month  initially and will increase in steps of $4 billion at three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20 billion per month.
- ○ The Committee also anticipates that the  caps  will  remain  in  place  once  they reach  their  respective  maximums  so  that the  Federal  Reserve's  securities  holdings will  continue to decline in a  gradual and

- predictable  manner  until  the  Committee judges that the Federal Reserve is holding no  more securities  than  necessary  to  implement  monetary  policy  efficiently  and effectively.
- · Gradually  reducing  the  Federal  Reserve's securities holdings will result in a declining  supply  of  reserve  balances.    The Committee currently anticipates reducing the quantity of reserve balances, over time, to a level  appreciably  below  that  seen  in  recent years but larger than before the financial crisis;  the  level  will  reflect  the  banking  system's demand for reserve balances and the Committee's decisions about how to implement  monetary  policy  most  efficiently  and effectively in the future.  The Committee expects to learn more about the underlying demand for reserves during the process of balance sheet normalization.
- · The Committee affirms that  changing the target range for the federal funds rate is its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  However, the Committee would be prepared to resume reinvestment of principal  payments  received  on  securities held by the Federal Reserve if a material deterioration in the economic outlook were to warrant a sizable reduction in the Committee's target for the federal funds rate.  Moreover,  the  Committee  would  be  prepared  to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if  future  economic conditions  were to  warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.

March 18, 2015, the Committee adopted an addendum  to  the  Policy  Normalization  Principles  and Plans, which is available at www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/FOMC_Poli-cyNormalization.20150318.pdf.

Note: The blue and red lines are based on actual values and median projected values, respectively, of the Committee's target for the federal funds rate at the end of the year indicated. The actual values are the midpoint of the target range; the median projected values are based on either the midpoint of the target range or the target level. The confidence interval around the median projected values is based on root mean squared errors of various private and government forecasts made over the previous 20 years. The confidence interval is not strictly consistent with the projections for the federal funds rate, primarily because these projections are not forecasts of the likeliest outcomes for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments of appropriate monetary policy. Still, historical forecast errors provide a broad sense of the uncertainty around the future path of the federal funds rate generated by the uncertainty about the macroeconomic variables as well as additional adjustments to monetary policy that may be appropriate to offset the effects of shocks to the economy.

The confidence interval is assumed to be symmetric except when it is truncated at zero-the bottom of the lowest target range for the federal funds rate that has been adopted in the past by the Committee. This truncation would not be intended to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative interest rates to provide additional monetary policy accommodation if doing so was judged appropriate. In such situations, the Committee could also employ other tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may differ from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width and shape of the confidence interval estimated on the basis of the historical forecast errors may not reflect FOMC participants' current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around their projections.

* The confidence interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term interest rates in the fourth quarter of the year indicated; more information about these data is available in table 2 of the Summary of Economic Projections. The shaded area encompasses less than a 70 percent confidence interval if the confidence interval has been truncated at zero.

MAY 2017 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen even as growth in economic activity slowed.  Job gains were solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate declined.  Household spending rose only modestly, but the fundamentals underpinning the continued growth of consumption remained solid. Business fixed investment firmed.  Inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective.  Excluding energy and food, consumer prices declined in March and inflation continued to run somewhat below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory and continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further, and inflation will stabilize around 2 percent over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 3/4 to 1 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of

P

longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
