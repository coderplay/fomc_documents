- IL Domestic Operations
- A Mix of operations since last meeting

At your last meeting, I spelled out plans:

- To and what would be a comfortable pace of outright purchases of Treasury coupon securities see? stry
- To target 35 % for SOMA Treasury bill auction participation
- To use mix of 30/60/90 repos to meet balance of reserve needs day
- Would not purchase bills outright until perhaps after the Treasury refunding announcements

In response to views expressed by Committee members and my assessment of evolving market conditions, since then we:

- Purchased $4.2 billion in coupon securities on five different days
- Purchased $2.3 billion in bills on April 11
- Redeemed S1.6 billion at auctions
- S977 million in bills; S568 million of the last 7-year note
- We now hold 40% of two bill issues
- On two other issues, even though we redeemed, ended up with less than 35% because of high levels of add-ons for foreign central banks
- Used occasional 28-day repos to meet underlying reserve needs
- Now, 4 separate 28-day repos on books, value of S8.2 billion
- Most of our repo operations of only a few days duration, because of day-to-day volatility in the Treasury account as a consequence of tax inflows

Domestic operations, continued

- C Impact of Federal revenues and Treasury refunding plans on flow of new Treasury issuance and System operations
- At the end of March, Treasury?s issuance plans reflected the Administration's forecast of a FY 2000 surplus of S176 billion.
- On basis of April receipts, the Administration s current forecast is for a surplus of S226 billion.
- At the quarterly refunding announcement in early the Treasury announced their intentions: May,
- To buyback (no more than) a total of up to S30 billion this calendar year
- To maintain the 10- and 30-year programs
- To eliminate the Year bill, once Congress adopts some technical amendments.
- To &amp;lt;trim? the size of 2-year note monthly auctions; and
- That further increases in revenue would likely lead to a switch from monthly to quarterly 2-year note auctions
- In addition, although not announced, Treasury has told us that the amount of bills likely to be auctioned each week for the rest of the year has been reduced by more than 20% (S21 billion to S16 billion)
- These reductions in the Treasury's issuance plans have implications for System operations for the balance of this year

- IL Domestic operations, continued
- D. Proposal for interim System operations for discussion with Treasury

At your last meeting, I thought that we might be able to &lt;comfortably" purchase outright up to S20 billion in Treasury securities.  In light of both Committee members views and the changes in the outlook for new issuance, I have tried to devise a means to increase the amounts we would be purchasing.

Given the uncertainties the Treasury faces in debt management, and the impact of System operations on their primary and secondary markets, I would like to inform them in advance of my plans for managing SOMA over coming months, in to permit them to adjust their strategy. It will also be vital for us to communicate clearly to market participants about these changes. part

In brief, I would like SOMA:

- to operate on a schedule for participation in Treasury auctions, essentially locking in the status qu0 in SOMA percentage holdings for the primary market
- to increase the pace of outright purchases of coupon securities, skewing our purchases both to the middle and shorter-end of the yield curve

We would also rely on 28-day repos to meet reserve needs that cannot comfortably be filled by outright purchases and as a sbuffer? between the timing of redemptions and outright purchases

SCOPE OF THE &lt;INTERIM?' PROBLEM

Approximate underlying reserve needs we now anticipate through the end of January 2001:

- With S3.09 trillion outstanding in marketable Treasury securities; it seems we cought?' to be able to find sufficient assets to grow SOMA this year from the existing stock
- (ex. SOMA) with remaining maturities of more than 10 years
- This amount will decline as a consequence of both the Treasury's buybacks and System purchases
- Foreign and domestic private portfolios express strong demand for these long-duration Treasury assets, as reflected in the inverted long-end
- While relatively comfortable with private credit risk for shorter duration assets, perceive few acceptable duration substitutes for Treasury securities longthey
- Thus, the stock of long-duration Treasuries is not large relative to apparent demand and is expected to decline
- The flow of new Treasury securities into the market has continued to decline; with total new issuance (ex. cash management bills) falling from:
- S2.06 trillion in '97 to a forecast of S1.74 trillion for this year
- If the growth of the System's balance sheet too quickly absorbs an expanding share of both the primary market and on-the-run issues, there is a risk that System operations will come to be seen major disturbance even if transitional in the price discovery process

BASIC SOMA PORTFOLIO_OBJECTIVES

- Preference for Treasuries as asset class to grow balance sheet
- Preference for shorter, rather than longer, maturities
- reflecting interest in sufficient short-maturity assets to provide adequate maturity liquidity
- expressed through bill holdings; limited in recent years
- Not obvious that SOMA should have much interest in paying a premium for the liquidity of &amp;lt;on-the-run? issues

CURRENT TREASURY DEBT MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES

- To reduce issuance in line with revenues
- To maintain issue sizes in benchmark maturities to sustain an active secondary market key
- To avoid a lengthening of the average maturity of outstanding debt

RECONCILING SYSTEM TREASURY AND MARKET INTERESTS

- Limit System share of primary market and on-the-run issues
- To leave room for private demand ~ particularly for duration securities to adjust to reductions in supply
- Expand System holdings of off-the-run, shorter duration securities
- To adjust SOMA to a shorter overall maturity that is closer to our basic preference
- To meet the System 's balance sheet needs with as much of preferred asset class as possible
- However, doing this would have an impact on the average maturity of privately-held Treasury debt outstanding

STRICTLYCONFDENTIAL (FOMC CLASS W

DETAILS OF PROPOSAL

- We would take roughly the status qu0 of our maturing holdings as shares of now-anticipated auction sizes as a schedule for SOMA participation in Treasury auctions:
- 10- &amp;amp; 30-year  15 percent
- SOMA?s bids in auctions would be the lesser amount of (a) SOMA's maturing holdings and (b) the percent limit from the schedule
- This would have only a limited impact on our currently-forecast rollovers, but in the event of further declines in issuance this would hold constant the System?s share of the primary market and, thus. should increase the amounts available for private demand from what otherwise would have been they
- It should also assist the Treasury in forecasting and managing its cash position (which is also a benefit for the Desk)
- We would also take the above schedule to imply graduated guidelines for SOMA outright purchases of off-the-run securities, over time purchasing outright:
- We could continue to bid for 5 percent of inflation-indexed securities at auction, and might be prepared to purchase up perhaps to 7.5 percent in the secondary; off-the-run market

- A rough calculation of the amounts available to be purchased this graduated guideline would be around S178 billion using
- We would continue our current practice of waiting to purchase new issues until are &amp;lt;thrice off-the-run? they
- This compares with the comparable reserve need of S88.7 billion through the end of next January (the S85 billion estimate from above; plus S3.7 billion in redemptions of 2-year notes).
- The pace of outright purchases could have a strong impact on the Treasury yield curve, tending to lower yields and, at least in the short run, could be seen as at cross-purposes with the Committee?s policy actions being
- This could also appear as a reverse &amp;lt;operation twist? even though it is motivated by the System= reasonable portfolio objectives
- I doubt that we could &amp;lt; 'comfortably? purchase the full amount cavailable? under the schedule within the next six or seven months
- Provided that we clearly communicate to market participants this radical change in SOMA's secondary market behavior, I think we could comfortably purchase considerably more than the S20 billion before year end that I suggested at your last meeting
- This is just a gap?  measure: it the onset of reserve needs sstop delays
- If Treasury supply begins to expand in the coming year or two, we will have assets to roll into again
- But if Treasury supply continues to decline over coming years, SOMA?s need for new assets will only have been delayed
