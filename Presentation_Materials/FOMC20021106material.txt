Note: The shaded range represents the maximum and the minimum values each quarter of six estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate based on a statistical filter and the FRBIUS model. Real federal funds rates employ four-quarter lagged core PCE inflation as a proxy for inflation expectations; with the staff projection used for 200203 200204.

(Four-quarter percent change)

- The perfect foresight simulations extend the key assumptions of the staff outlook (other than the path for monetary policy) through 2008: potential output grows at about 3-1/2 percent per year
- 'the exchange value of dollar measured in real terms falls at a 3 percent clip
- the relative price of oil stabilizes at its 2005 level
- modest growth in federal expenditures allows an improvement in the federal budget balance
- The real federal funds rate is calculated as the quarterly average nominal funds rate minus the four-quarter lagged core PCE inflation rate as a proxy for inflation expectations

Balance-of-Risks Statement

- "The new language is designed to express the Committee's sense of risks to the attainment of its long-run goals of stable prices and sustainable economic growth:'
- "Although 'the foreseeable future' is intended to convey a length of time extending beyond the next FOMC meeting; this concept is necessarily elastic, given that the relevant horizon may depend on economic conditions.

- Percent change; annual rate; from end of preceding period;, except civilian unemployment rate which is average for the final quarter of the period.

The Committee might retain unbalanced risks if:

- In the near term resource slack is expected to build.
- Uncertainty surrounding the forecast might seem to weigh particularly heavily on the down side

The Committee might switch to balanced risks if:

- Aggregate demand is expected to expand considerably faster than aggregate supply in the second half of 2003 and 2004 .
- Action may better balance the odds of future action. today
