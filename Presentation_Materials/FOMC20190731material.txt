Working definition of the 'current framework'

Includes everything in the Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, plus:

- ම The use of tools that have already been deployed
- ම Interest rate policy
- ම Forward guidance (FG)
- ම Balance sheet policies (BSP)
- ම 'Bygones are Bygones' approach
- ම For example, policy does not respond to the history of inflation

Last page

The 'Consensus' Statement

Statement on Longer-run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy

- ම Reiterates dual mandate goals
- ම Specifies an explicit numerical inflation objective
- ම Provides a numerical estimate related to maximum employment
- ම Emphasizes symmetry around the inflation objective
- ම Articulates 'balanced approach'
- ම Acknowledges importance of balance of risks, including risks to the financial system

Absent from current statement

- ම Does not specify how framework operates in the vicinity of the ELB
- ම Does not consider whether anchored expectations are a necessary condition for price stability
- ම Does not endorse 'make-up' policies (average inflation or 'over-the-cycle' policies) Last page

Key environmental features stressing the current framework

Lower (and uncertain)  * r

- ම Implies greater likelihood of hitting ELB

Persistently low inflation has lowered longer-run expectations

- ම Motivates an exploration of tools that return inflation more quickly to target, and avoid erosion of expectations

Changes in the process governing inflation

- ම Lower and uncertain natural rate of unemployment U *
- ම Flatter and uncertain slope of Phillips curve
- ම Harder to move inflation from below or above target
- ම Other factors leading to persistently lower inflation

Last page

Two types of potential alterations to policy

Within current framework

- ම Different use of existing tool set

Outside current framework

- ම Strategies would take 2 percent inflation goal as given
- ම But allow policies that intentionally move goal variables away from their target values
- ම For example, 'make-up' policies that seek above-target inflation if historical inflation has been low
- ම A number of variants to be discussed

Last page

Staff memo focal areas

- ම Examine post-Great Recession period
- ම Lessons about the efficacy of our tools and costs entailed in their use
- ම Did the framework constrain the Committee in the use of its tools?
- ම Discuss structural challenges noted earlier
- ම What policy challenges and risk trade-offs are posed by these structural changes?
- ම Looking forward, is the current framework likely to be effective in achieving dual mandate goals, especially given structural challenges, and given the likelihood of hitting the ELB ?
- ම How do widely-discussed alternative strategies work? How robust are they to alternative assumptions?
- ම Distributional consequences of monetary policy, augmentations to the use of interest rate, FG and BSP tools.

Summary

We draw mixed conclusions about U.S. economic performance and monetary policy under the current framework.

- ම To some extent, outcomes since the crisis reflect the challenges of conducting monetary policy in a changing economy using untested tools, rather than shortcomings of the current framework.
- ම Policymakers could act more forcefully in the future even under the current framework.
- ම A key concern is that inflation has run modestly below 2 percent for many years, and some measures of longer-run inflation expectations are low.

An important unresolved issue is whether the Committee can, under the current framework, keep inflation expectations anchored at levels consistent with achievement of its symmetric inflation goal.

Structural Changes Pose Challenges for Monetary Policy

- · Declining and uncertain natural rate of interest ( r* )
- · Declining and uncertain natural rate of unemployment ( u* )
- · Flatter Phillips curve
- · Proximity to the effective lower bound (ELB)
- · Concerns about the stability of longer-run inflation expectations

Last page

Misperceived r* Entails Asymmetric Costs

Nominal Federal Funds Rate

- · Uncertainty about r* and proximity to ELB produce asymmetric risks, may prompt policymakers to err on the side of assuming a lower r*
- · r* lower by 75 bp than historical path, starting in 2016
- · Private actors know it, the central bank doesn't
- · Tighter monetary policy implied by overestimating r* leads to worse economic outcomes, exacerbated by ELB
- · Underestimating r* eliminates persistent undershoot of inflation

Sluggish Inflation Expectations Pose a Challenge

Nominal Federal Funds Rate

- · Interaction between flatter Phillips curve and low inflation is a challenge, even worse if expectations adjust sluggishly to policy actions
- · Simulate economy going forward under optimal control without further shocks
- · Adaptive expectations: low inflation realizations feed into persistently low inflation expectations, requiring more accommodative policy
- · Steeper Phillips curve requires less unemployment undershooting to stabilize inflation

Summary of Findings

- · Uncertainty about r* and proximity to the ELB produce asymmetric risks, which may prompt policymakers to err on the side of assuming a lower r*
- · The interaction between a flatter Phillips curve and low inflation poses a considerable challenge for policymakers
- · Challenge compounded if expectations adjust sluggishly to policy actions
- · Uncertainty about u* makes the determination of appropriate policy difficult
- · A flatter Phillips curve complicates inference about u*
- · ELB limits policy space in the event of a downturn
- · Given flatter Phillips Curve, a downturn may warrant prolonged period at the ELB
- · Prolonged low rates could foster the buildup of financial vulnerabilities
- Last page · Might warrant moderation in the use of low rates for a very long time
- · Limited understanding of linkages between low rates and financial stability

Scope for Improving the Consensus Statement?

- · The Statement acknowledges some of the tradeoffs in the paragraph on the balanced approach in promoting the dual mandate when the two objectives are not complementary
- · Considerations that became important in recent times are not fully reflected in the Statement
- · Could recognize that policy tradeoffs may be affected by the proximity to the ELB
- · Could mention risk management considerations in the vicinity of the ELB:
- · Asymmetric risks due to uncertainty regarding r* and u*
- Last page · Financial stability risks that may arise during prolonged periods of low interest rates, which might otherwise be desirable

Questions for Discussion of Framework Review at the July 2019 FOMC Meeting

- 1. In what ways do you think that the current framework has helped the Committee achieve its objectives since the framework was adopted in 2012?  In what ways (if any) do you believe that the framework may have constrained the Committee's ability to achieve its Dual Mandate goals over that same period?
- 2. In light of what the Committee has learned about the efficacy and costs of forward guidance and asset purchases over the past decade, how might you use these tools differently, within the current framework, to minimize the effect of the ELB on economic outcomes?
- 3. What scope, if any, do you see for enhancing the Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy to better reflect the challenges posed by the ELB and by uncertainty about U* and r*, the role of inflation expectations, risks to financial stability, and possible interactions among these?

JUNE 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although growth of household spending appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators of business fixed investment have been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased.  In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR JULY 2019

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although growth of household spending appears to have has picked up from earlier in the year, indicators growth of business fixed investment have has been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed. On balance, indicators of longer-term inflation expectations remain low.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as inflation running persistently below 2 percent , the Committee decided to maintain lower the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 to 1-3/4 to 2 percent. This action supports the Committee 's continues to view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased remain .  In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, The Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate is prepared to make further adjustments in the target range for the federal funds rate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
- 4. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated.

- 4. The Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account in August, two months earlier than previously indicated.

ALTERNATIVE C FOR JULY 2019

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May June indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity is has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although growth of household spending appears to have has picked up from earlier in the year, indicators growth of business fixed investment have has been soft.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined remain low ; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook have increased remain elevated .  In light of these uncertainties and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will closely monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Desk Statement Regarding Reinvestments of Principal Payments from Treasury Securities, Agency Debt, and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities

Statement Regarding Reinvestments of Principal Payments from Treasury Securities, Agency Debt, and Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities

July 31, 2019

At its meeting on July 30-31, 2019, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) decided to conclude the reduction of aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) two months earlier than previously indicated.  The FOMC directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to roll over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to reinvest all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) effective August 1, 2019.  Rollovers of principal payments from maturing Treasury securities will continue to be reinvested in new Treasury securities being issued on the maturity date.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS up to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month will be reinvested in Treasury securities through secondary market purchases; agency debt and agency MBS principal payments in excess of $20 billion each month will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS.

Treasury securities purchases associated with the reinvestment of agency debt and agency MBS principal payments will be conducted in the secondary market across a range of maturities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding.  The FOMC will revisit this initial reinvestment plan in connection with its deliberations regarding the longer-run composition of the SOMA portfolio.

Under this guidance, the Desk plans to distribute secondary market Treasury reinvestment purchases across eleven different sectors, including nominal coupons, bills, Treasury InflationProtected Securities, and Floating Rate Notes. The amount of purchases in each sector will be approximately proportional to the 12-month average of the par amount of Treasury securities outstanding in each sector relative to the total amount outstanding across all sectors, measured at the end of July 2019.

The Desk will announce the planned monthly amount of secondary market Treasury reinvestment purchases up to the $20 billion maximum on or around the ninth business day of each month.  At that time, the Desk will also release a tentative schedule of purchase operations that will be conducted over the one-month period until the next announcement. The Desk plans to release the first schedule of Treasury purchase operations on August 13, 2019.

Any principal payments from agency debt and agency MBS in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency MBS.  For these purchases, the Desk will continue its current practice of announcing the planned amount of agency MBS purchases on or around the ninth business day of each month and releasing a tentative schedule of purchase operations twice a month, on or around the ninth and the nineteenth business days. The Desk plans to release its next schedule of MBS purchase operations on August 13, 2019.
