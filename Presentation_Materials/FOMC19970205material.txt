FOMC NOTES -PRF February 4-5, 1997

Mr. Chairman:

I will be  referring to  the charts distributed on  the table.

After your last meeting, U.S. forward, short-term rates continued to  back up  but, as  you can  see, not to  the levels reached last July and  late August; in  the last week or  so  they have stabilized and  even backed down a  bit in  the past two  days from Friday's levels reflected in the first panel. German and Japanese forward rates, however, have remained quite low.

This pattern of forward rates reflects expectations that a firming action by  the Committee is not thought to  be imminent but was, until just recently, thought to  be  likely sometime later this year. There are really no  prospects for an  increase in  rates by  either the Bundesbank or  the Bank of Japan in  the near future. The compression in  German forward rates seems to  me to incorporate some possibility for a  further ease by  the Bundesbank. Japanese forward rates I  think reflect the market's looking past the current position of the  Japanese economy to focus on  the risks that increased fiscal drag in  the new fiscal year, starting in  April, will slow the economy down  yet again.

The  most notable development since your last meeting has been the rapid rise of  the dollar to  levels not seen since June 1994 against the  mark and  February 1993 against the yen.

With the unwinding of the heightened expectations for  a tightening by  the Committee early last September, the dollar's interest-rate advantage began declining through late November as you  can  see  on  the second page. At that point, it  was an increasingly-fashionable, minority view that the Committee's next action would be  an  ease, as the  economy was thought to  be slowing down.

There was then  a  relatively sharp reversal of  both expectations and the trend in  interest-rate differentials early in  December, as I  described at your last meeting. This shift appeared to  be  vindicated by  the late December and  early January data releases, which pushed up  our  bond yields and  brought 10-

year differentials with Germany and Japan to  their highest levels in this decade --  though still well below the levels which prevailed in the late 1980s.

While the  widening of the  U.S. interest-rate advantage has played a  role in  the dollar's sudden climb. I  think it has really served to summarize and  underscore the market's pessimistic assessment of German and Japanese prospects. The dollar held up  quite well in the fall when the differentials were narrowing. Both then and  now the  market's strong presumption has been that risks in  the U.S. remain on  the upside, while in Germany and Japan they are seen as decidedly on  the downside.

Looking forward, at the risk of stating the obvious, it seems to me that there are "fat tails" on  both sides in the distribution of the dollar's potential moves from here.

An  unexpected pickup in  growth in  Germany or  Japan, or  a sudden acceleration of inflation in the U.S. which significantly affected bond and equity prices, could cause the dollar to sell off sharply. On  the other hand, if the market's pessimistic outlook for  Germany and  Japan were to  be  vindicated, and  if  the fragile Japanese banking system were to crack, while the U.S. economy were to accelerate, then the dollar could rise quite a bit further.

There are many in  the  market who  are  convinced that the  yen will begin to strengthen sharply against the dollar when the Bank of Japan begins to raise rates. I  am  skeptical. First, I  do  not think that this day  is  near at hand. Second, when it  does come, I  think there is a  possibility that the Japanese authorities will find, as  we  did in  1994, that when you start to raise interest rates from very low levels there are considerable capital losses to  be incurred on  bond and  equity holdings along the journey of narrowing their large negative interest-rate differentials.

Coming back to  the here and  now, the dollar has lost some of its rapid, upward momentum in the last few  days as  market participants have focused on  the combination of the muted fourth quarter price data as  well as  the  prospects for our first quarter to be  slower than the fourth quarter. As  a  consequence, our  bond yields have declined by  around 20 basis points in  recent days and our  10-year differentials with Germany and  Japan have each fallen back a  bit from the levels reflected in  the middle panel, as  of Friday. However, the  dollar has continued trading around 122 against the yen  and 1.64 against the mark. There still seem  to be  many who "missed" the dollar's rally, and  this appears to  be keeping the dollar well bid.

Turning to  domestic operations:

The turn of  the  year occurred with  only the usual degree of pressures in  the funds market. While we  did reach new  lows in operating balances in  late January, the market hardly seemed to notice.

On  page 3  of  your chart package, each of  the three panels depicts the Fed funds daily trading range and  effective rates for the four maintenance periods in  December and  January which surround each of  the last three year-ends: '94 to '95; '95 to '96; and '96 to '97. You can also see the period average operating balances for each  maintenance period, which have declined from a  range of 30 to  25 billion in  1994-95 in  the top panel, to  21 to 18 and  a  half billion this year.

On  the next page, the same periods are shown, but instead of the daily trading range (which includes the high and low  trades regardless of  the volume traded) here on  page 4  the vertical blue lines depict the funds' rates within one standard deviation of the effective rate, which measures deviations from the effective rate weighted by  volumes traded. In  the bottom panel, you can see the two days --indicated with the heavy arrows --  when operating balances reached new  lows of 15.5 and  15.3 billion, to so  little apparent effect.

This information is summarized on  the final page in  a  table which shows the number of days, in  each December-January period over the last three years, when the trading range was wider than 50 and  100 basis points, when the effective rate deviated from the target rate by  more than 10 and  25 basis points and  when one standard deviation of  Fed funds trading surrounded the effective rate by  more than 10 and  25  basis points.

Over the last three years, there has  been a  discernable increase in  the number of  days on  which the trading range varied by  more than 50 and  more than 100 basis points. But it is  much harder to  find significance in  the year-to-year comparison in  the variance of the effective rate or  the standard deviation.

In short, my  general impression has not changed: with the gradual decline in  operating balances that we  have experienced to date, while we  have seen a  modest increase in  the range of the funds rate, so far  the bulk of the  market's activity continues to occur in  patterns that appear to  reflect the familiar ebb  and flow of demand and  supply for reserves.

However, as I  have mentioned before, we continue to  have somewhat more frequent difficulties in forecasting applied vault cash and required reserves. Also, while forecasting Treasury balances around tax  payment dates is always tricky, we  are increasingly aware that, with declining operating balances in  the

banking system, a  given miss in  our forecast for the Treasury balance represents a  larger percentage of banking system balances.

Looking forward to  the upcoming inter-meeting period, I would like to  request the Committee's approval for  an  increase in the Desk's inter-meeting leeway for  outright purchases from the current 8 billion to  12 billion.

Our  current forecasts are for  reserve needs to grow by almost 13 billion by  the maintenance period before your next meeting. As  I  mentioned in  December, I plan to  conduct coupon purchases of around 6 billion over the course of February which, on current forecasts, would leave roughly 7  billion in continuing reserve needs by  the end  of  the period.

- I  am  quite comfortable meeting needs of  this size through temporary operations and, if the future conforms to  our forecasts, this may  be  the  preferable course of  action. Given our forecasts for  virtually no  growth in  required reserves, continuing needs of  this size give us  some cushion against the risk that required reserves actually decline. However, depending upon the pattern and  size of  daily reserve needs in  March, we might also want to  purchase 2  or  3 billion in  bills which, together with our 6  billion in  coupon passes planned for February, would either exhaust or  exceed by  1  billion our current 8  billion leeway.

Additional flexibility in  a  higher leeway is  desirable from my  standpoint because the future is frequently less tidy than  our forecasts. If instead of  no  growth in  required reserves, we actually experience even  modest growth, then a  larger bill pass could be desirable. In  addition, with the fixed date of the Japanese fiscal year end  looming on  March 31st, and  given the recent reassessments of the weaker Japanese banks, we face the risk that the Desk may  be  asked to  accommodate a  sudden need to liquidate securities by  the Japanese authorities to  facilitate their management of any  extraordinary dollar funding needs of  the Japanese banks. The higher leeway would help us  in  managing this contingency.

Thus, I would like to request the Committee's approval for an  increase in the  intermeeting leeway from the  current 8  billion to  12 billion.

Mr. Chairman: we  had  no  foreign exchange intervention operations during the period. But I  will need the Committee's ratification of the  Desk's domestic operations during the  period. I will be  happy to  answer any  questions.

FOMC Chart Show  Presentation  Domestic Economic  Developments --

Ted and I  shall be  referring to  the set of charts labeled "Staff Presentation...". But,  before  we  turn  to  the  first exhibit, I want  to  try  to  dispose  of the  obvious  question f  how  the  world o changed when  we  received the fourth-quarter GDP report.

You may have sensed  from the  first  paragraph  of  the  Greenbook that  we  were mentally repared  for  the  possibility t he  advance p tha t estimate f GDP o growth would greatly  xceed 3-1/2  percent. It wasn't e our best  guess as to  how  BEA analysts  ould read  the  available  ata, w d but there as  enough uncertainty  hat ne couldn't  eject  he  more w t o r t extreme  predictions  irculating   Wall Street. c on As it turned out, the "extremists" were right.

Since Friday,  we've been attempting  o  divine  the  message in t the report. The  bottom line s  that he  nature  of the  changes in  the i t fourth-quarter  cture oesn't ead  us to  alter  ur forecasts pi d l o of growth or inflationary  essures  n  any significant  . pr i way To  save time, I'll  leave  it  at  that or  now. f But we'll be  happy to respond later  o  any questions  ou may  have on the  matter. t y

I'll turn then to the first chart, which summarizes our forecast.  This is  one of the  few charts hat  e  have updated  to  take t w account  of the  fourth-quarter GDP report.  The  changes to  history  nd a forecast generally are too small to  be  visible in  the other charts, let alone to  alter the analytical content of  our exhibits. As  you can see in  the  top  panel,  we  were--and  still are--projecting  ubstantial a  s deceleration  real  DP of G growth, from more  than  3 percent ast  ear  to l y a  little over 2  percent per  year in 1997 and '98.

This output path had  led us to  predict that the unemployment rate will edge down to 5 percent by  next year. This is a  tad  below the levels reached in  the late 1980s, and  we  believe it implies enough pressure on resources to  cause the trend of inflation to  tilt upward.

However, that effect is muted in  the  projection of  the CPI by expected favorable developments in  the food  and energy sectors--and also by  technical changes in  the index. So  we  have the overall CPI decelerating in 1997 and  then picking up to  only a  3 percent increase next year.

Chart 2  summarizes the  policy assumptions underpinning our forecast. The first is that the federal funds rate is held near 5-1/4 percent. If and  as  people come to  perceive that inflation has begun to  trend upward, this stability of  the  nominal funds rate might imply a  slight decline in  the real short-term rate. Perhaps where that altered perception of a  change in  price trends may  prove more important over the  projection period is in intermediateand long-term rates, which could move upward as a  result of  some combination of an enlarged inflation premium and  an  expectation of Fed  tightening.

In the near term, however, we  think the bond markets may benefit a  bit from expectational changes related to  events in  the fiscal policy sphere. We  are assuming the efforts to  pass a  Balanced Budget Amendment will fail once again, but we  are anticipating that agreement will be  reached on  a program promising balance by 2002. That program will impose ongoing, moderate fiscal restraint on aggregate demand. While such a  development is  widely discussed, it's our  judgment that there's still enough skepticism on  Wall Street that actual legislation will have some positive impact on  the financial markets.

Why  might one anticipate a budget deal this year, after last year's failure? I've listed some of  the  more conventional reasons. First, the two sides weren't really that far apart, at least on  the numbers, when negotiations broke down a year ago. Second, the numerical task is easier now, given the revised budget outlook. The graph shows the sizable downward revision in  the CBO  baseline forecast of  the deficit since last year. The third observation is that there may be  a better setting for bipartisan action this year: Republicans in  the Congress learned the political advantages of some compromise on policy issues, while the President has identified balancing the  budget as a  top priority for his final term.

These considerations certainly don't make the balanced budget a  sure thing. Partisan tensions haven't disappeared. One of the steps many people see as an  attractive way  to achieve some of the deficit reduction--an adjustment to  the COLAs for benefits and  tax brackets--is seen by  others as  political poison. And,  discretionary spending already has been cut substantially in  many areas.

That brings me  to  an  assessment of the risks in  the fiscal outlook. One is that the strain in  reaching the  goal of  balance on paper, while providing tax  cuts as  well, will lead to  heavy use of gimmicks, such as  unspecified spending reductions or  asset sales. With it also not being possible to  rule out another political stalemate, I would characterize the risks as clearly biased toward less fiscal restraint than we  have assumed.

As I suggested, financial market participants are likely to tolerate some shortfall from  guaranteed budget balance. Indeed, as the title of  my  next chart indicates, they seem to  be in  the  grips of a  pretty powerful euphoria. Share prices have risen about two-thirds

in  the  past 25  months, producing a  substantial increase in the priceearnings ratios of the S&amp;P 500 and  NASDAQ indexes graphed at the top of  chart 3. It's natural to ask  whether such a  run-up represents a speculative bubble, rather than a  sound assessment of economic fundamentals. I haven't either the time, or  the wisdom, to do justice to  this subject. But I'll offer a  few  observations.

My  going-in point is that the mere dimension of the rally is legitimate grounds for suspicion, and that the level of popular interest in  the stock market today begins to smack of  mania. But let's try  to  look  more objectively at the evidence on  current market valuation. As  you can see, the p-e  for the S&amp;P 500, based here on twelve-month trailing earnings, is relatively high. On  the other hand, as the red  line in  the chart indicates, the current p-e  would not be quite so  high were reported profits not still being damped by special charges for restructuring. Although this time series, constructed by  Goldman-Sachs, goes back only to 1985, it is generally believed that such charges weren't so large a  factor proportionately in  earlier years. On  the third hand, however, there are those who might argue that there are earnings quality questions on  the other side, such as the lack of  recognition of stock option costs.

A  second bullish argument is that high p-e's can  be  explained by  the current low level of  inflation. The table at the  middle left shows the  negative correlation historically between p-e's and inflation.

Inflation cannot be  the only factor determining p-e's. Earnings growth prospects obviously should play a  role. The  vertical lines in  the  upper panel denote troughs in  the earnings cycle for S&amp;P 500 stocks. As you  can see, peak p-e's typically have occurred close

to troughs  in  earnings--presumably cause  people  expected  better  ays be d ahead.  Well, we're  nowhere  near  a  trough  in  earnings:  profits  ve ha been soaring in  recent years. Yet, as can  be  seen in  the  middle right panel,  analysts'  xpectations  f profit  rowth for  the  next three o e o g t five years are high and have been rising. There may be  something to the  notion  that he  S&amp;P t 500  includes  any  relatively  rong ompanies, m st c at least some well-positioned to  make extra money from foreign activity.  ut one may  reasonably sk whether  the  S&amp;P B a companies as a group can continue  to  achieve  profit  mprovements so far bove the i a growth rate of nominal GDP.

Where  we  came  out in  our projection  stock  prices  s  that of i valuations  re  probably  on the  high side, ut that  the  market is a b unlikely to  drop substantially just because of  the shortfall in profits, relative to  prevailing expectations, that we're forecasting. The  experience f recent ecades suggests hat--absent e  unforeseen o d t som political   economic shock--a ajor reversal  s  likely  o  require or m i t a significant tightening of  monetary conditions--or at least the anticipation of one.

Meanwhile, we  hold a  similar view  about credit market conditions. It  appears  to  us that enders re  demanding less nd less l a a compensation for risk. This is visible in  the narrowing of  spreads on bonds and bank loans  depicted n  the  lower  panels. Experience i suggests hat  such trends  typically  me  to  a bad end that eads  to t co l lender  retrenchment nd a contractionary rce  in  the  economy,  but  we a fo can't t  this oint  see the  circumstance hat ill  lead  to  a a p t w significant  versal  f these  lending atterns.  s  you well  know, re o p A there have been losses on  consumer loans, but banks have been  moving to  contain them, with only minor effects on  overall credit

availability. The Mercury Finance affair may  take the bloom off the sub-prime lending business, but it remains to  be  seen how  that will play out and  only a  narrow slice of the credit pie is involved.

Setting aside the  possibility that, sometime down the road, more folks will regret their earlier aggressive lending or investing decisions, what's so  bad  about their feeling so good right now? One highly relevant possibility, in  our  view, is that the developments in the financial markets will directly or  indirectly spur extra demand in the markets for  goods and  services at a  time when resources are already being stretched.

Charts 4  and 5  summarize our  projections of  demand. The top panel of chart 4  highlights the outlook for consumer spending. We expect consumption (the  black line) to remain quite robust in the near term, buoyed not only  by the strong recent trend of  disposable income (the red line) but also by  the sharp gains in  wealth and  the positive sentiment of  households. These factors should outweigh the negative effects of  high debt burdens and  tighter credit card lending practices. But we're projecting that the stock market will flatten out and that the ratio of  wealth to  income will fall in 1998. This presumably will tend  to  weaken demand growth as  time passes.

Business fixed investment is  also projected to decelerate somewhat. Financial market conditions certainly are favorable, but growth of  internal cash flow will be  slackening. We  expect that declining prices and  advancing technology will continue to  drive sizable gains in  outlays for computers and  communications equipment, but  expenditure on  other equipment is  projected to  be  flat. In manufacturing, in  particular, the level of spending already has reached such a  high level that even some drop-off would still permit

the stock of  equipment to  grow at a  good clip. On  the structures side, conditions have improved considerably in  the commercial real estate market; notably, office vacancy rates have declined substantially. We  therefore believe that overall NRS  spending will rise moderately further over the next two  years.

In  the housing market, residential investment is projected to decline this  year and  to  stabilize in 1998. Single-family starts are down from their peak, but demand appears to have leveled out in  recent months. Total starts were at a  1.41 million unit annual rate in  the fourth quarter, and  we  expect only a  modest slippage from that rate in 1997--as you  can see in  the little table. Mortgage rates over the next two  years are expected to  be about the same on  average as in 1995 and '96. But smaller gains in  income should trim demand gradually-pushing starts down still further next year. The  projected level of starts is still fairly high relative to  estimates of  what might be called for by  demographic trends. But affordability is also high in the single-family market, and  we  believe this can continue to buoy activity for a while longer. I  might note that the January Michigan survey showed perceived homebuying conditions to  be the best in  2-1/2 years.

Turning to the  next page, total government purchases (the black line) are expected to record only modest growth. In the federal sector (the  red line), shutdowns and  erratic procurement have caused gyrations in  the past couple of  years. But the trend is still negative. Meanwhile, state and  local sector finances look  good overall; however, spending is expected to  remain cautious.

Net exports have trended down in  the 1990s. We  are anticipating that the  negative contribution to  GDP growth from this

sector will increase this year before moderating in 1998. Ted  will be discussing this pattern in a  few  minutes.

The final component of GDP--inventory investment--is a neutral factor in the  outlook. Inventory-sales ratios are low in  the aggregate--indeed, if the advance GDP  numbers for the fourth quarter are correct, the ratios are a  touch lower than anticipated in the Greenbook. We  expect stocks to  grow fairly steadily, at  about the same pace as  sales, making no  net contribution to GDP  growth.

Even though output growth is expected to slacken, it remains above potential and the  pressures in  labor markets are projected to mount. In  my  first chart, I  noted that the unemployment rate was projected to run a  shade lower than in  the late 1980s, when inflation flared up. The top two  panels of chart 6 provide a  check on  the relative degree of  tightness. As  you  can see, both the help  wanted ad index and  survey evidence on  households' perceptions of job availability tend to  confirm the recent readings from  the  unemployment rate.

But, is it clear that, even if  our GDP  path is correct, the labor market will tighten further as we've predicted? This appears to be  an  important difference between our forecast and those of  many outside analysts, who  don't anticipate the  decline in  unemployment that we  have--even though their output growth predictions are similar. The two  middle panels highlight a  couple of  key factors in  our thinking. First, on  the left, we  have extrapolated the recent upturn in  labor force participation, on  the assumption that the  perceived better job availability and  rising real wages will attract more potential workers. In addition, welfare reform is likely to  provide some boost to  participation, though how  fast that will show up  is far

from clear. Obviously, in  past years, the participation rate rose much faster than  we  are  projecting, but that was before the rate for women had  gotten so  close to that of  men. We  could see a  greater surge, which would tend to hold  up  the  unemployment rate, but we  think the risks are reasonably balanced.

At the right is  our forecast of  productivity. We  still don't have the official estimate of  fourth-quarter output per  hour, but it is apparent that the increase was much greater than we  predicted. However, we  think that merely makes more plausible our judgment that one shouldn't take at face value the very weak trend in the data of the  prior few  years. We  are, if anything, more comfortable now  with our forecast that productivity will grow about 0.8 percent per  year in 1997 and '98. Although that would be down from what was evidently a gain of  about 1.2 percent last year, it is just below our  revised assumption for the underlying, cyclically adjusted trend rate.

In sum,  we  don't believe greater participation or productivity growth is likely to  prevent labor demand from pressing harder on  labor supply. As  you can see in  the bottom panel, this pressure evidently has begun to  leave its mark on  wages. I've shaded the periods when  unemployment is below our  estimates for the  NAIRU--6 percent in  the late 1980s, and 5.6 percent recently. The  wage and salary component of the ECI (the  black line) accelerated considerably last year, boosted in  part by  the minimum wage hike, and  the benefit component stopped decelerating. Indeed, on  a  quarterly basis, there was some sign of  acceleration in  benefits.

The  pickup in  compensation gains this year will be exacerbated by  another increase in  the minimum wage, and  perhaps by  a lagged effect of  last year's acceleration in  the total CPI. In  1998,

we  project only a  small further increase in  compensation gains, in  the absence of further minimum wage shocks and  in  light of this year's lower CPI inflation. One identifiable upside risk, especially in 1998, is  that various pressures in  the health care sector will manifest themselves in  a  considerable hike in  the  premiums charged employers, who  may not be  able to offset those cost increases quickly.

Labor cost increases are the key element in  our  price outlook. As  you can  see at the top of  chart 7,  pressures on  physical capacity in  manufacturing are not extraordinary. The capacity utilization rate is just a  little above the historical average and vendor delivery performance, which typically mirrors the utilization rate, is also in  the neutral range.

One factor keeping price pressures down is the availability of imports at attractive prices. As  you can see, non-oil import prices have been falling and  are expected to continue doing so gradually for a  while longer; that is projected to turn around by  next year, however, and import prices become a  factor pushing up  core inflation. Meanwhile, as I  noted earlier, the supply-demand balance in  the food and  energy markets is expected to  help hold down overall inflation.

The  bottom panels show  the resultant relative movements in the total and  core CPIs. Because of  the favorable movements in  food and  energy prices, the overall CPI is projected to decelerate substantially this year. Moreover, although it picks up  in  1998, the rate of overall CPI inflation continues to  be held down by  subdued food and  energy price increases. In  contrast, the core CPI accelerates from  year to  year as rising labor costs are passed through in  an  environment of  high resource utilization and lessened

competition from import prices. I might note that the relative movement of import prices would appear to  be  one of the reasons why inflation picked up  more quickly when labor markets tightened in  the 1980s; as  you  can see in  the middle left panel, import prices were moving up  fairly rapidly in  that period. The data  panel at the lower right shows the annual inflation figures, including, in  parentheses, the numbers adjusted for the estimated effects of technical changes in the indexes.

Ted  will now  discuss some external influences in  the outlook for the economy.

Turning  to  bond markets, he  bottom  panels, he ecline  n  ten-year  overnment  bond yields t t d i g among industrial  untries  rom their  eaks  in  1995 has  been  phenomenal,  ranging rom  5  percentage co f p f points r  more in  the  three ormerly igh-yielding untries  n  Europe  to  a more-moderate  percentage o f h co i

Chart  11  focuses n  an issue bout  which we can  get  a  bit ore of  a  fix --  he  relationship o a m t between  exchange  rates,  mport rices,  nd U.S.  inflation. ices  f  U.S.  imports re  influenced  y a i p a Pr o a b number of  factors, croeconomic  as  well  as  macroeconomic.

The next  chart xamines  another nfluence  n U.S.  inflation:  il rices. s shown in  the  top e i o o p A left  anel, ominal  oil rices  ave  been  creeping p since arly  1994 and  have  recently  eached   peak p n p h u e r a that as exceeded  over  the  past ecade  only  briefly  n  the  context f  the  Gulf  War.  The panel  at  the w d i o right  rovides ore perspective  n  oil-price  velopments  over  the  past wo years. It hows both  the p m o de t s spot  price f  West Texas  Intermediate  nd  the  implied olatility  a  percent f  the  price. he o a v as o T implied olatility  er  the  past ear  exceeded  that n  1995 by a  large argin, ut  was not  significantly v ov y i m b different om the  average  of  the  previous  ive ears. fr f y

In  our  forecast,  continue  o  assume  that  il rices  ill ecline  urther  rom  recent  eaks  as we t o p w d f f p the  market  finally  djusts  o  the artial sumption f  Iraqi  hipments  and  additional oduction  omes a t p re o s pr c on stream  from the  North  Sea  and  non-OPEC  developing  ountries. owever, in  light  f  recent c H o trends,  e have  again  postponed  full  eturn  o  a  lower  level f il rices,  nd  that evel  s  about w a r t o o p a l i

While our  assumption bout  oil rices  elps  to  impart ome downward  pressure  n  the  overall a p h s o price evel,  ne would  be  justified    being  skeptical out  when the  decline  ill e  complete, ow l o in ab w b h enduring  it ill e,  and whether  oil rices nstead  ight  continue o  trend igher.  To illustrate e w b p i m t h som of  the  implications   an alternative  l rice cenario,  e ran  the  staff's  mbined  model in  its of oi p s w co adaptive xpectations  ode.  The results e  shown in  the  bottom  portion  f he  chart. he baseline e m ar o t T is  the  Greenbook forecast tended  to  1999 as  presented  n  the  Bluebook.

In  this  lternative, .  CPI inflation    about  4 tenths  igher han  in  the  Greenbook baseline a U.S is h t this ear, eclining  o  a tenth igher n  1999.  Growth of  U.S.  real DP  is  essentially  changed y d t h i G un because  the  stimulus rom  a lower  real unds  rate nd  an even  weaker  dollar  ffsets e  tax-like fect f f a o th ef of  increased  pending  on  imported  oil.

It s  possible  hat hese istorical  lationships  ve  changed. There  is  some evidence hat i t t h re ha t they  do change  over  time, ut  they  change  only  slowly, nd I  would hesitate   predicate    forecast b a to a for  1997 on  such  a  proposition.

I'll be  very brief. Your final chart summarizes the forecasts that you submitted for use in the Humphrey-Hawkins report. Your forecasts of real GDP growth are somewhat below ours. Consequently, your unemployment rates are higher. But your CPI predictions also are higher than ours, putting you  closer to  the consensus than we  are.

Under that  orecast, ort-term  nterest tes nd hence  opportunity  osts re f sh i ra a c a expected o  be about  flat  ver  1997.  Thus,  M2  growth  is  projected  o  expand in  line ith  the t o t w staff  orecast  or ominal  income,  at  a  4-1/2  percent ate.  Such growth  would leave  V2, as f f n r shown in  the  upper  panel, ittle  anged  over  1997 and  essentially   the  estimated  egression l ch on r line.

The second  line f  the  table ndicates at 3  growth, s  in  1996,  is  expected o  be o i th M a t somewhat brisker  han  that f  M2, running  6-1/4 ercent his ear.

FOMC Briefing Donald L. Kohn

The staff forecast suggests that the Committee will need to tighten at some point to contain inflation--a characteristic underscored by  the results of  the longer-run simulations in  the bluebook. At  the same time, uncertainties about important relationships in forecasts of  inflation have reduced confidence in some of  the key leading indicators of inflation pressures, raising questions about how the Committee can  best judge that the time has come to act pre-emptively to head off an  intensification of  price pressures if  the staff has correctly identified the underlying situation. I  will be addressing each of  these issues.

The basic message of the forecast and its extension in the  bluebook is that the economy is operating a little beyond its sustainable level so that inflationary pressures are mounting, and because policy is not now positioned to correct this situation, the imbalance will tend to  worsen over time. Real shortand long-term rates are not  now low by  historical standards, but, as Mike noted, the rise in equity prices and the lack of caution by  credit suppliers are seen as contributing to overall financial conditions that are too easy to contain inflation. The effects of the high stock market are illustrated in  the stock-market shock simulations in  the bluebook. While those simulations dealt

with a stock market drop, they are symmetrical. They suggest that a 25 percent overvaluation of  the market--the ballpark prediction from a  number of models--would, other things equal, raise the equilibrium funds rate by 50 basis points.

In the context of the staff forecast, the degree of stimulus in current policy is probably not large. Indeed, simply fixing the real funds rate, rather than fixing the nominal rate and allowing the real rate to fall with higher inflation over the next few  years, likely would flatten to a considerable extent the upward trajectory in inflation. But it  would not be  enough under the forecast. Without some near-term rise in  the real funds rate to  bring demand back in line with the economy's productive capacity, inflation would tend to  worsen over coming years.

For a  variety of  reasons use of  the core PCE chain weight index in the bluebook charts probably presents an exaggerated picture of  the degree of  underlying deterioration in inflation. Moreover, a core index certainly is suspect as  a proxy for inflation expectations, which are likely built on  observations of  all prices, and  so the real rate would not drop as rapidly as depicted were the nominal funds rate maintained. Nonetheless, the underlying analytical point is still valid; holding the nominal funds rate constant in  the face of climbing inflation, and  presumably

inflation expectations, risks making policy progressively more stimulative. This additional stimulation is only partly offset by the further fiscal consolidation assumed in the staff forecast, so that by the end of  the Greenbook forecast period, the disequilibrium in  monetary policy and the economy is quite evident. The developing situation is reflected as well in results from  Taylor rule-type simulations, which tend to show that the federal funds rate is not misaligned at present, given recent inflation and output, but this rate falls below the levels implied by the rule in 1997 and in 1998 if  the economy follows the path in the Greenbook forecast.

If  the staff is right about the current circumstances, lags in the effect of policy mean that core inflation will edge higher and the  unemployment rate lower in  the next few  quarters, whatever your choice of  monetary policy in  the near-term. If  you share this analysis and assessment and do  not want the longer-term outcome of  the staff forecast, the sooner you get started on tightening, the less disruptive to the economy will the  tightening prove likely to be. Delays would allow underlying inflation pressures to build further and inflation expectations to turn up; the longer this persists, the  more total slack ultimately must be  put into the labor and product markets to achieve the Committee's inflation objectives. This line of  reasoning

might motivate an immediate tightening of  policy, as in the 50 basis points of  alternative C in the  bluebook, or by a smaller amount.

Nonetheless, even if  the staff forecast were seen as correctly identifying the  most likely risks to sustainable expansion, a  number of factors could be seen to militate against the need for an  immediate tightening. For one, as Ted noted, the recent strength in the dollar will help damp aggregate demand and price pressures for a  time. Moreover, some of the pickup in inflation in 1998 in the staff forecast is a  consequence of  an assumed event--the drop in the dollar that year--not primarily related to easy monetary policy. The influence of  the higher dollar in  the near term, along with the still-modest size of  the output gap, implies only a  slow uptrend in core inflation over the next year. If, in addition, food and energy prices are better behaved this year, as the staff forecasts, overall inflation rates will be  damped and  hence significantly higher inflation expectations are unlikely to become imbedded in  wage and price setting over coming quarters.

Financial markets do not seem to  have much concern about an emerging intensification of inflation pressures. Over the near term, their flat-funds-rate expectation may mainly reflect participants' readings of  FOMC intentions based on  your public statements. But, even over the longer

run, most market participants do not seem to see much need for tightening to keep inflation from accelerating: Surveys do not suggest that inflation expectations have moved out of a  narrow range, and the overall slope of  the yield curve is close to its historic average, suggesting that it  mainly reflects a  rising term premium. And the surveys and  markets may turn out to be right; not only have a  number of  measures of core inflation been flat or even declining of late, but many of  the usual early warning signs of  higher inflation have remained quiescent. The Committee may  not be able to rule out the possibility that for reasons we do not fully understand the economy may be  able to produce at  higher levels than we  previously thought without added inflation pressures. In these circumstances, the Committee may  wish to await further information about prospective inflation before deciding that a  firming is needed.

Despite a  "wait and see" policy stance at its last few  meetings, the Committee has also seen the odds as tilted toward mounting inflation pressures forcing the need to tighten at some point. And the Committee may view the information becoming available since December as leaving that presumption intact. Most importantly, the economy in the fourth quarter was expanding at a  rate in excess of  the long-run growth of potential, and increases in compensation have been trending higher, confirming tautness in  labor

markets. In these circumstances, the Committee may see the challenge before it  as likely to be  how to judge when to tighten policy to head off a potential increase in inflation.

That challenge hasn't gotten any easier. Shifting estimates of the relationships between output gaps and unemployment rates to changes in inflation have reduced the value of these key leading indicators of inflation and confidence in forecasts based on  them. And  with real interest rates close to historical averages, the reasoning used in 1994 for a preemptive tightening--that the stance of policy had  become obviously inflationary--would not seem to be  available to guide Committee actions or explain its decisions to the public. The information from the  monetary aggregates may be regaining some value, but perhaps not enough to rely on to change policy, and even Taylor-type reaction functions are backward looking in  some respects and suspect as  well if there is uncertainty about the level of potential.

The difficulty is illustrated by  the Committee's experience last year. Growth in real GDP turned out to be more than one percentage point higher, and the  unemployment rate about 1/4 point lower, than the members anticipated one year ago, when the Committee took its last policy action. This is the kind of surprise that might typically have been

met with a  little leaning against the prevailing winds to minimize the risks of  overshooting. But  uncertainty about underlying relationships, reinforced by  the favorable performance of  core inflation, stayed the Committee's hand.

Based in  part on  the statements of Committee members, many in the market believe that the difficulties of predicting inflation in a  changing world have become daunting enough to have ruled out preemptive monetary policy action. They believe instead that only a  sustained rise in inflation itself--the smoking gun--can trigger a  tightening.

But anticipatory policy has served the economy well in the 1980s and  '90s. consolidating gains in inflation and prolonging business expansions. Despite the uncertainties, the Committee may still be  able to act pre-emptively. Some developments may merit a  policy response because if  sustained they will inevitably lead to  higher inflation. Examples might include continued strong growth that was reducing the unemployment rate appreciably further: signs that labor-cost increases were not going to stop escalating; a  sustained pick-up in  inflation expectations reflected in  prices of financial and real assets as well as in  surveys and private forecasts; and movements in  the usual set of indicators the Committee has used to detect early that strains on industrial capacity were in the offing.

The  more problematic situation to handle preemptively would be  if economic growth settled back but in reality left the level of output beyond potential, producing a  slow, insidious upcreep in costs and prices. With reduced confidence in  measures of resource utilization to predict inflation, it might be difficult to confirm that an inflationary process was in train until it became apparent in actual prices. Once that point had arrived, a  significant increase in inflation could be  underway before policy could reverse it, especially if inflation expectations began to increase. If this is a  concern, the Committee may need to act fairly promptly once signs that the economy is producing at  a  higher than sustainable level begin to emerge but before they were convincing in every respect, being prepared to reverse course if  necessary at some later date. One element that might deter prompt action is concern about excessively strong reactions by  the public and  financial markets to initial tightenings that came as a  surprise. For example, this would be  a  factor to consider with regard to tightening at  the current meeting. If  the Committee intends to act as pre-emptively as possible, hoping to do so before it sees the smoke from the inflation gun, it  might want to consider how it can make its analysis and its intentions as clear as possible to  a  currently unprepared audience.
