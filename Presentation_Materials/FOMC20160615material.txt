Policy Implications

Policy path consistent with objectives is uncertain

Thus, important to communicate that the path

will depend on "realized and expected conditions" relative to objectives

is in no way preset

APRIL 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity appears to have slowed.  Growth in household spending has moderated, although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high.  Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved further but business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and falling prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

JUNE 2016 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March April indicates that  labor market conditions have improved further even as , although growth in economic activity appears to have slowed picked up, the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed .  Growth in household spending has moderated, strengthened. although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high.  Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved further continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have diminished, but business fixed investment and net exports have has been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market. Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have slowed noticeably. Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, only partly reflecting because of earlier declines in energy prices and falling in prices of non-energy imports. Moreover, market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; and some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months have declined .
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriate monetary policy accommodation , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments sees the risks to the economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside .
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.
- 4. In determining the When adjustments to the target range become appropriate, their timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess will depend on the Committee's assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2

percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain remaining , for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.

- 3. Against this backdrop,  The Committee decided today to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent but agreed that a modest increase in the federal funds rate will likely be appropriate in coming months if incoming information confirms the Committee's expectations for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation .  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement strengthening in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on April 27 June 15 , 2016:

- · The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System left unchanged the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 0.50 percent.
- · As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective April 28 June 16 , 2016, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction and to continue reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

Note: In the two panels above, each circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. The red diamonds for each year represent the median of the federal funds rate prescriptions that were derived by taking each participant's projections for the unemployment gap, core PCE inflation and longer-run nominal federal funds rate for that year and inserting them into the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule. The whiskers represent the central tendency of the prescriptions of the non-intertial Taylor (1999) rule using participants' projections. One participant did not submit longer-run projections in conjunction with the June 2016 meeting.
