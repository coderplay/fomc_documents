Qualitative Information and Policy Options

Information from consultations with Federal Reserve System staff

- · Banking organizations have not expressed material concerns about their reserve balances
- · Some banks have maintained high levels of reserve balances as a liquidity buffer
- · Some banks have profited by exploiting the spread between the rate paid on excess reserves and the cost of borrowing
- · Banks thought that they could reduce their reserve balances if they chose
- · Banking organizations have not discussed with System staff the possible effects of increased systemwide reserves

Summary

Policy options

- · Depository institutions should not be significantly adversely affected by the anticipated levels of reserve balances
- · No policy response appears necessary at this time
- · Considerable uncertainty remains
- · Staff will continue to monitor the impact on depository institutions
- · Option 1:  Drain reserves
- · Option 2:  Exclude reserve balances from leverage ratio for all banking institutions
- · Option 3:  Exclude reserve balances from leverage ratio for selected banking institutions
- · Option 4:  Issue supervisory guidance

April FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that the economy has continued to contract, though the pace of contraction appears to be somewhat slower.  Household spending has shown signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Weak sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories, fixed investment, and staffing.  Although the economic outlook has improved modestly since the March meeting, partly reflecting some easing of financial market conditions, economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time. Nonetheless, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.

In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is facilitating the extension of credit to households and businesses and supporting the functioning of financial markets through a range of liquidity programs.  The Committee will continue to carefully monitor the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of financial and economic developments.

June FOMC Statement - Alternative A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing.  Indicators of consumer and business sentiment have risen, and household expenditures have shown further signs of stabilizing; nonetheless , spending remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses continue to cut back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although conditions in financial markets have generally improved, the Committee judges that further monetary policy stimulus is warranted to help ensure that the sharp rise in some longer-term interest rates over recent months does not undermine a recovery in overall economic activity.
- 2. Substantial resource slack is likely to persist here and abroad, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee still sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.
- 3. In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve is employing a wide array of tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate [for an extended period| at least through mid-2010 ].  To provide additional support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to facilitate further improvement in private credit market conditions, the Committee decided to increase the total amount of its large-scale securities purchases. The Committee now anticipates that over the course of this year the Federal Reserve will purchase up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities, up to $200 billion of agency debt, and up to $750 billion of Treasury securities. The Committee will evaluate the timing, composition, and amounts of any additional purchases of securities in view of market conditions, the evolving economic outlook, and the necessity of ensuring that policy accommodation can ultimately be withdrawn smoothly and at the appropriate time. The Federal Reserve will also be monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted in light of financial and economic developments.
