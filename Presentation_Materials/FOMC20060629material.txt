* The vertical axis measures the estimated response of core PCE price inflation after eight quarters to a permanent 10-percent increase in the relative price of energy.  The results are based on 15-year rolling estimation periods. Dates on the horizontal axis denote the end of the estimation window.

- We assume that a permanent ten-percent increase in the relative price of energy would boost core inflation about 0.2 percentage point after eight quarters.
- Models that are forced to assume zero energy-price pass-through have been a little surprised by how high inflation has been in the last few quarters.
- Models that assume a larger pass-through than the one we use judgmentally have been a little surprised by how low inflation has been.
