Short-Run Estimates with Confidence Bands

Notes: The real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the quarterly average of the actual nominal funds rate and the log difference of the core PCE price index over the previous four quarters.  For the current quarter, the nominal funds rate used is the target federal funds rate as of the Bluebook publication date.

Short-Run and Medium-Run Measures

Notes: Confidence intervals and bands reflect uncertainties about model specification, coefficients, and the level of potential output.  The final column indicates the values for the current quarter based on the estimation for the previous Bluebook, except that the TIPS-based measure and the actual real funds rate are the values published in the previous Bluebook.
