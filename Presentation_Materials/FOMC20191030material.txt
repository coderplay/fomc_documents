Non-standard uses of the policy rate tool at the ELB

- · Two non-standard uses of the interest rate tool used at the ELB:
- · Forward guidance
- · Negative interest rate policy
- · Tools have been generally effective in easing financial conditions and stimulating economic activity.
- · Effectiveness has varied across economic and institutional settings.
- · Policy design and communication are important factors underlying these tools' effectiveness.

Variants of forward guidance (FG)

- · FG has broadly taken three forms:  Qualitative, date-based, and outcomebased.
- · Date-based and outcome-based FG generally more effective than qualitative FG.
- · No firm conclusion about the relative effectiveness of date-based versus outcome-based FG
- · Date-based FG in the United States associated with large decline in policy expectations and bond yields.
- · Subsequent outcome-based FG did not result in material shift
- · But outcome-based FG was intended to be consistent with earlier date-based FG.

FG communications considerations

- · Key goal is to avoid conveying more negative economic outlook than intended.
- · Distinguish easing given the outlook from easing in response to changes in the outlook itself.
- · Additional tools can be used to support FG
- · SEP can provide an indication of the Committee's thinking about the course of policy and the economic outlook.
- · Coordinated balance sheet policies may help reinforce FG.
- · Escape clauses can guard against unwanted circumstances.

Key considerations for future use of FG

- · Date-based FG may be appropriate if Committee is reasonably certain that the guidance will not be frequently revised.
- · Outcome-based FG may be appropriate if it conditions on easily measured and communicated outcomes.
- · FG should in general
- · Avoid overly complex and vague language.
- · Clearly define and limit number of escape clauses.

Using FG away from the ELB

- · There is little empirical evidence on the effectiveness of FG away from ELB.
- · A few studies have shown that such FG could be effective in altering expectations about future policy
- · May be possible to use FG to firm the Committee's commitment to return to its inflation target.
- · If successful, could serve to raise inflation expectations.

Negative interest rate policy (NIRP)

- · NIRP implemented by BOJ, ECB, and several other central banks in Europe
- · Evidence suggests that NIRPs have eased financial conditions and supported economic activity on balance.
- · Use of NIRP with other unconventional monetary policy tools makes study of NIRP in isolation difficult.
- · Adverse effects from NIRP on banks and other financial institutions have been limited so far
- · Deposit tiering has helped alleviate pressure on banks' profitability.
- · The effects of NIRP in the United States could differ from those in other countries given institutional differences across financial systems.

Balance Sheet Policy (BSP) options

We consider a variety of options for implementing BSP and for each of these options we summarize the most relevant benefits and costs:

- 1. BSPs already implemented by the Federal Reserve-quantitative easing (QE, including maturity-extension programs);
- 2. Flow-based versus fixed-size asset purchase programs;
- 3. BSPs that place ceilings on interest rates adjusting the balance sheet size as necessary-a form of yield curve control;
- 4. BSPs involving assets other than government bonds.

Benefits and costs of QE

Benefits:

- · Significant pass-through to prices of higher-quality private assets;
- · Increased bank lending and risk tolerance;
- · Faster recovery of the labor market and modestly higher inflation rate than in the absence of QE.

Costs:

- · Communication challenges arising from the novelty of the tool and the use of multiple tools;
- · Some degree of non-productive risk-taking behavior by investors;
- · Some political risks related to the volatility of remittances.

Does QE have diminishing returns?

Evidence available so far suggests that QE marginal benefits did not diminish.

- · Empirical work that controls for investor expectations about BSP finds that QE impacts do not seem to have declined across consecutive programs;
- · Model-based evidence on interaction of BSP with financial constraints shows tighter constraints can either magnify or dampen QE macroeconomic effects;
- · Even in normal times there are collateral constraints than can make QE effective.

Hard to extrapolate such evidence to very low levels of longer-term rates.

- · Duration-risk channel might be weakened amid extended periods at ELB that lower interest rate volatility, making changes to average duration less effective;
- · When long rates are already very low, there is less scope for QE to reduce them.

Benefits and costs of flow-based programs (FBP)

Benefits:

- · State-contingent nature of FBP implies an automatic-stabilizing function-more stimulus when the economy deteriorates, and vice versa;
- · Increased investor confidence in FOMC's ability to make timely policy adjustments could result in faster adjustments in investor expectations;
- · Aligning state contingencies of FBP and FG attenuates risk of the two tools working at cross-purposes.

Costs:

- · Higher investor uncertainty about magnitude and persistence of reduction in supply might delay or diminish its full effect-slower or partial portfolio rebalancing;
- · Risk of ending up with a very large balance sheet;
- · Aligning state contingencies of FBP and FG could increase their complementarity and credibility, likely helping contain FBP's size.

Benefits and costs of yield curve targeting

Rate ceilings (vs. strict targets) do not require policy to tighten when yields decline in response to a worsening economy;

- ම On short rates might reinforce FG's credibility and associated balance sheet expansion would be easier to unwind;
- ම On longer rates would be more relevant for economic decisions of households and businesses but harder to maintain;

Benefits:

- · Particularly effective in reducing interest rate volatility and tail risks in addition to helping maintain a particular level of rates;

Costs:

- · High uncertainty about total amount of asset purchases may delay market responses;
- · It may become costly to defend ceilings toward the end of the program.

BSPs involving assets other than government bonds

- · Purchases of mortgage-backed securities by the Federal Reserve;
- · Corporate bond purchases and 'funding for lending' programs by foreign central banks.

Benefits:

- · Directly target specific economic sectors, hence seem more effective than government bond purchases in improving credit spreads and debt issuance in targeted markets;

Costs:

- · Political risk: Programs could be interpreted as engaging in credit allocation.
- · Some programs would entail taking increased credit risk.

BSPs as a function of economic shocks

Valuable for the FOMC to have a variety of BSP options and employ the ones that best fit the economic situation that it faces.

For instance:

- · Flow-based programs likely better response to a sequence of persistent demand shocks because of automatic-stabilizing function;
- · Short-rate ceilings with FG likely better if those shocks are not expected to persist;
- · Fixed-size program concentrated in longer-term securities likely better response to a one-time large demand shock, as it can activate faster and larger portfolio rebalance.

Options for Repo Operations to Support Control of the Federal Funds Rate

Repo Operations in an Ample Framework :  Repo operations are currently fulfilling an important role in ensuring that the supply of reserves remains ample and in mitigating the risk that money market pressures could adversely affect policy implementation.  Treasury bill purchases will build reserve levels more permanently, and repo operations are set to expire after January 2020.  Even with ample reserves, some form of continued repo operations could provide insurance against unexpected shocks.

Lessons from Recent Experience

- · Repo operations are effective at restoring interest rate control. In September, repo operations were effective at maintaining the federal funds rate within the target range.
- o Operations increased funding to repo markets and reduced pass through to federal funds.
- o Additional reserves eased pressure on banks that had fallen close to their lowest comfortable level of reserves.
- · Determining when to deploy operations, and how to calibrate them, is complex, as money market pressures are not always predictable.
- o Conducting operations only after pressure is evident appears reactive and results in larger operations being required.
- o Determining the operation size and rate that will adequately address pressure is difficult. (Figures 1 and 2)
- · Dealer balance sheet constraints create some limits to effectiveness. This dynamic may result in money market pressures even with large repo operations outstanding.  This may be particularly evident at year end.

Options for Ongoing Repo Operations

- · Modestly-sized operations could provide a high degree of readiness, but require discretion for when to intervene meaningfully.
- · A standing repo facility at a backstop rate could serve as an automatic stabilizer.

Tradeoffs and Policy Considerations

- · Assurance of rate control : Standing facility would provide greater assurance. Discretionary operations rely on judgment to respond to shocks.
- · Stigma : A facility with a rate set such that usage is infrequent is more likely to incur stigma, which could limit effectiveness over time. Repo operations conducted on a discretionary basis may have less stigma. (Figures 3 and 4)
- · Commitment to funding : A standing facility would represent a commitment to expand the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and provide liquidity to primary dealers at their discretion (a discount-window like option, currently only available to banks).
- o Dealers may be incented to take on greater liquidity risk in eligible collateral.
- o Operation parameters (collateral, size limits) could constrain the commitment.

7. Relationship between LRU and SPU

- Persistent forces related to the structure of the economy affect both LRU and SPU
- Transitory factors relevant for price pressures affect only the SPU
- Temporary government policies affecting labor supply (e.g., emergency and extended unemployment insurance)
- Change in skills of job seekers relative to firms' demand (i.e., mismatch)
- Cyclical variation in firms' desired markups
- The wedge between the SPU and LRU may be sizeable and persist long enough to be relevant for monetary policy

Path

How much conviction do you have about that path?

Challenges          Conclusion

- · Foreign recessions preceded by declines in foreign IP growth.
- · Foreign IP growth has fallen more than 2 percent below trend over the past year.
- · But, 14 times outside of recessions IP growth fell 2 percent or more and, on average, GDP growth, remained at trend.

<!-- missing-text -->

(*) During recession episodes, we compute average IP growth in the 12 months prior to the beginning of the recession. For non-recessions, we select all years in which IP growth fell more than 2 p.p. below trend. (**) For GDP , we compute average GDP growth in the four quarters starting in the first quarter of the recession. Shading indicates that countries representing 55% of foreign GDP are classified as in recession:

Path

How much conviction do you have about that path?

Challenges          Conclusion

- · Divergence between manufacturing and services PMIs also sends unclear signal about recession likelihood.
- · Manufacturing PMIs tend to lead services, posing downside risk.
- · But, directionality is not always consistent.

What do you see as key challenges to your future?

Conclusion

- · Thus, the current weakness in manufacturing raises a key challenge to the baseline.
- · Should the drag from trade policy uncertainty and other factors be greater and more sustained.
- · Lower productivity and confidence could significantly reduce foreign GDP.
- · Flight to safety flows could boost the dollar.
- · And, U.S. GDP could weaken notably.

SEPTEMBER 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports have weakened.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain.  As the Committee contemplates the future path of the target range for the federal funds rate, it will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook and will act as appropriate to sustain the expansion, with a strong labor market and inflation near its symmetric 2 percent objective.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Implementation Note for October 2019, Alternatives A and B

Release Date:  October 30, 2019

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on September 18, 2019 October 30, 2019 :

- x The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously   to [ ] lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to 1.80 1.55 percent, effective September 19, 2019 October 31, 2019 . Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 20 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range.
- x As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective October 15, 2019 October 31, 2019 , the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019.  The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.70 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a percounterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will

October 29-30, 2019

continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

- x In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously ] to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate to 2.50 2.25 percent, effective September 19, 2019 October 31, 2019 . In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of [….]

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.
