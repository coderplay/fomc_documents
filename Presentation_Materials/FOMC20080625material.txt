Exhibit 4 Consideration of Long-Term Projections

- · Current three-year horizon for projections does not always reveal your views of:
- o Steady-state characteristics of economy
-  Sustainable rate of unemployment
-  Sustainable rate of output growth
- o Rate of inflation consistent with dual mandate

Alternative approaches

- 1. Extend entire set of projections for four variables and forecast narratives out to five years.
- a. Advantage:  full, coherent presentation
- b. Disadvantage:  burden on participants
- 2. Maintain three-year projection horizon for four variables but add fifth-year projections for output growth, unemployment, and total inflation
- a. Advantage:  less burden on participants
- b. Disadvantage:  less complete explanation of transition to steady state 3. Maintain three-year projection horizon for four variables but add estimates of long-run averages of output growth, unemployment, and total inflation five to ten years ahead
- a. Advantage:  no need for participants to project fourth and fifth years for four variables
- b. Disadvantages:
- i. Less complete explanation of transition to steady state
- ii. Need to forecast long-run demographic and productivity trends

Supervisory Report Concerning Investment Banks and Relate d Policy Issues

Primary Dealer Monitoring Update

June 25, 2008

<!-- missing-text -->

Presentation Overview

-  Objectives and Approach
-  Current Focus at Four Investment Banks
-  Capital
-  Liquidity
-  PDCF (and TSLF) Usage
-  Near-Term Issues

<!-- missing-text -->

Objectives

-  Tied closely to Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF) and FRA 13(3) authority
-  Build the capability to exercise informed judgment about the capital and liquidity positions of the primary dealers given their access to the PDCF
-  Minimize the risk that the availability of financing under the PDCF undermines the incentives for primary dealers to manage capital and liquidity more conservatively

Approach

-  Focus is on the firms that own primary dealers not affiliated with financial holding companies -primarily the four largest investment banks.
-  Limited on-site presence + off-site staff
-  Direct contact with management
-  Information sharing and communication with SEC
-  ...but we are not engaged in traditional bank supervision
-  Current focus at the four investment banks is on capital and liquidity
- à Capital - increasing (but not sole) focus on risk-based capital (RBC)
- à Liquidity - iterative approach

Liquidity Stress Approach

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Iterate with the 4 firms
-  Current scenario:
-  Severe stress but short of full Bear Stearns scenario
-  30 day liquidity horizon
-  NO access to the PDCF
-  Compare and converge assumptions
-  Construct cash flow analysis
-  Relate cash needs under stress to available liquidity (liquidity pool + additional funding sources)

PDCF Usage

-  Bear Stearns has been by far the largest and most regular borrower
-  Until very recently, there were 3 other 'chronic' users
-  Cantor Fitzgerald
-  Countrywide Securities
-  Barclays Capital

Near-Term Issues

-  For how much longer should our monitoring program continue with its current focus in its current form?
-  How do we limit the reputational risk to the Federal Reserve that increases with the length of our onsite presence at the investment banks?
-  If our monitoring program needs to evolve, in which areas should we alter the depth and/or breadth of our activities?

Primary Dealers

Liquidity Facilities and the Prudential Supervision of Investment Banks  and Other Primary Dealers 1 Key Issues for Discussion

Liquidity Facilities

- 1. When and under what circumstances should we decide to extend, modify, or eliminate our current credit facilities for primary dealers (PDCF and TSLF)? Should the timing and circumstances differ for the two facilities?
- 2. If we decide to eliminate one or both credit facilities, how should that be done? How much notice should be provided?  Should the terms of credit extension be gradually tightened prior to closing the facility, or should the facility be closed in one step?  When notice is given, should we give assurances that the closing of the facilities will be delayed if conditions in financial markets warrant?
- 3. Should we seek legislation that would permit us to provide some type of liquidity backstop to primary dealers in the longer term?  Under what conditions should a primary dealer be permitted to draw on such a backstop?  What is the rationale for any such backstop?

Prudential Supervision

- 1. How do we limit the moral hazard risk that our current credit facilities undermine the incentives for primary dealers and the holding companies that own them to manage liquidity and capital to appropriately conservative levels?
- a. On what principles should supervisory expectations for investment banks' capital, liquidity, and risk management be based?  Should these expectations be codified in a formal document?  How? b. To what liquidity standard should the SEC-regulated investment banks be held?  Is it appropriate to expect the firms to maintain liquidity sufficient to withstand a Bear Stearns-type scenario?  Should bankaffiliated primary dealers (and their parent companies) be held to the same liquidity standard as investment banks? 2
- c. Should investment banks be held to the same capital standards as bank holding companies?  What about the leverage ratio?

- 2. In the longer term, can we rely on an MOU with the SEC to provide the prudential supervision that is necessary to limit moral hazard?  Or is legislation needed to enhance the effectiveness of prudential supervision of primary dealers? Is there a need for legislation only if we provide primary dealers with an ongoing liquidity backstop or is legislation needed even if their access is only in unusual and exigent circumstances?
- 3. If legislation is needed, what type of legislation?  Legislation requiring consolidated supervision of investment banks?   By whom?  Should the securities laws be amended to provide the SEC with explicit authority to conduct consolidated supervision of investment banks?  Should all primary dealers and their affiliates be regulated as FHCs?  Are changes to the functional regulation provisions of Gramm-Leach-Bliley needed to make effective consolidated supervision of primary dealers that are part of FHCs?
- 4. If we provide primary dealers with an ongoing liquidity backstop, do we need to alter the criteria for becoming a primary dealer (which have worked well to define appropriate counterparties for desk transactions) to require a primary dealer and its consolidated organization to be subject to effective prudential supervision?
