INTRODUCTION

<!-- missing-text -->

Framework Objectives - Key Goals

Staff will evaluate options for a long-run monetary policy implementation framework that will best achieve a number of key goals:

- 1. Achieving an appropriate degree of control over short-term interest rates including during periods of financial distress and in a manner robust to structural changes in the financial system.
- 2. Enhancing the ability of the Federal Reserve to achieve macroeconomic and financial stability objectives at the zero bound.
- 3. Supporting the System's ability to address liquidity strains in money markets and support overall financial stability.

<!-- missing-text -->

Framework Objectives

In addition, alternative long-run operating frameworks will be evaluated on their ability to:

- 1. Reduce burdens and deadweight losses associated with reserve requirements.
- 2. Promote efficient, active, and resilient money markets and government securities markets.
- 3. Promote an efficient and resilient payment system.

Finally, criteria will be used in the evaluation following from the Committee's discussion of policy normalization principles and plans:

- 1. The framework should involve holding no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively.
- 2. The assets held by the Federal Reserve will consist primarily of Treasury securities.

FOREIGN EXPERIENCE

<!-- missing-text -->

Introduction

-  Main Question:  What can we learn from the foreign experience with monetary policy implementation?
-  Primarily surveyed experience of 9 advanced economy central banks
-  How policy implemented before crisis, how has it evolved since then, and some rationale for those frameworks

<!-- missing-text -->

Interest rate control and transmission

-  No dramatic differences between most central banks' ability to
-  Control short-term money markets
-  Transmit policy to longer-term interest rates
-  But wide variety of differences represent choices on how to achieve that control, reflecting decisions regarding trade-offs along other dimensions

<!-- missing-text -->

Policy rates

-  Nearly all policy rates are overnight rates
-  Some target a market rate (like Fed), but many use an administered rate
-  Even then, most still reference a market rate as important

<!-- missing-text -->

1 The ECB used the Main Refinancing Rate to communicate policy until recently.  More emphasis is now being put on the deposit rate, which is an administered, unsecured overnight rate.

<!-- missing-text -->

Operating regimes

-  Prior to crisis most used 'corridor' regimes to steer rates
-  Few used 'floor' regimes
-  After crisis began, some central banks shifted how they implemented policy.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

1 Conducts draining operations to implement a corridor regime, thereby maintaining a structural surplus.

- 2 Operate narrow corridors with zero or no reserve requirements.

<!-- missing-text -->

Reserve requirements and remuneration

-  Distinctions between corridors and floors has blurred a little
-  Many CBs changed how they remunerate reserves and gave banks choice over how many reserves to hold
-  Floor CBs have introduced 'tiered remuneration'
-  Some negative interest rate policies have tiering as well
-  BOE introduced 'voluntary reserve targets' reducing costs of requirements

<!-- missing-text -->

Money market activity

-  Systems with scarce reserves have robust interbank trading
-  Money market trading still present in floors
-  CBs with non-bank sector also have soggy floors
-  CBs differ on how much they value different types of activity

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Liquidity provision

-  Central banks added counterparties and widened accepted collateral (or already had a broad set)
-  Most expect to keep a broadened policy
-  Main reason during crisis was to provide liquidity to more parts of financial system.
-  CBs also see advantages reducing competitive distortions and the increased information about institutions
-  Broader policy comes with
-  increased operational costs,
-  potential to reduce market activity,
-  and could create moral hazard

<!-- missing-text -->

Liquidity provision (continued)

-  A few central banks distinguish 'liquidity insurance' from monetary policy implementation and emergency lending.
-  Have separate operations for separate objectives
-  BOE:  LI operations have clear criteria for use, broad access, and allow exchange of wider set of collateral for liquid asset or reserves
-  Clarity about the purpose of operations reduces stigma
-  Clarity about when liquidity insurance operations would be used limits contagion during stress events
-  Other central banks prefer more ambiguity about circumstances under which use operations

<!-- missing-text -->

Other features

-  Most central banks think they should be ready to use unconventional policies, and expect to maintain operational readiness
-  Many hope to return to smaller-than-current balance sheets in future
-  But CBs expect higher reserve demand will leave balance sheets larger than before crisis
-  Some noted that exceptionally large balance sheets can complicate relationships with fiscal authorities

<!-- missing-text -->

Adapting to regulation

-  Most central banks still learning about overall effects of regulation
-  Central banks do expect increased demand for reserves
-  Obtaining excess reserves for non-HQLA collateral increases LCR
-  Central banks are complementing regulation differently
-  RBA facilitating, as Australia has low government debt
-  Others limiting collateral to HQLA (SNB) or considering changing costs of reserves to discourage reliance on central bank

The pre-crisis framework

- · Rate control was based on reserve scarcity
- · Liquidity was provided via repurchase agreements with primary dealers and discount window lending to depository institutions
- · The portfolio was not considered a policy tool

Lessons 4 and 5

Lesson 4:

The System was not well-prepared to implement largescale asset purchases once the funds rate hit the zero lower bound.

Lesson 5:

The pre-crisis framework was not sufficiently robust or flexible in the face of significant liquidity stress and disruptions to the monetary transmission mechanisms.

MONEY MARKETS

<!-- missing-text -->

'Money markets'

-  Set of short-term wholesale funding markets
-  Key link in monetary policy transmission
-  Center of many of the problems that arose in the financial crisis

<!-- missing-text -->

Pre-crisis, rates highly correlated

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Easy to implement monetary policy
-  Federal funds rate close to target

<!-- missing-text -->

Rates may be less connected at high frequencies

Overnight Money Market Rates

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Still retain a high degree of pass-through
-  Looser linkages and greater dispersion than pre-crisis

<!-- missing-text -->

Significant changes affecting money markets

-  Monetary policy implementation framework
-  Business practices
-  New regulations

<!-- missing-text -->

Changes to monetary policy implementation

-  Expanded balance sheet
-  Implemented IOER
-  Developed supplementary tools
-  Expanded set of counterparties

<!-- missing-text -->

Federal funds market changed, but still linked

- Bank-to-bank trading down considerably
-   FHLBs lending to DIs
-  Virtually all trades at rates below IOER rate
-  Federal funds rate linked to other money market rates
-  Responds to changes in administered rates

<!-- missing-text -->

ON RRP links policy actions and non-banks

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Market participants suggest ON RRP is a relevant 'comparator rate.'
-  Reduced tri-party repo rate volatility

<!-- missing-text -->

Changes to business practices

-  Many firms may be more cautious in managing credit, interest rate, and liquidity risks since the crisis
-  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceased lending in the federal funds market
-  Withdrawal occurred amid market stresses
-  Reflected a desire to minimize risk exposures

<!-- missing-text -->

New regulations

-  New regulations limit imprudent risk-taking
-  Reforms intended to increase safety and resiliency of financial system
-  Regulations with greatest impact on money markets
-  Expanded FDIC assessment base
-  Money market mutual fund reforms
-  Basel III regulatory changes
-  Supplementary leverage ratio
-  Liquidity coverage ratio
-  Net stable funding ratio

<!-- missing-text -->

The Treasury GCF and tri-party spread has widened

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Absent frictions, rates should be identical
-  Spread reflects institutional frictions
-  Tiering of rates for smaller dealers
-  Borrowing expands larger dealer's balance sheet

<!-- missing-text -->

Future evolution of money markets

-  Structural demand for reserves likely has increased
-  Precautionary and regulatory reasons, as well as changes in business practices
-  Remunerated at market rates
-  Could result in upward pressure on rates sooner
-  Money markets may be more stable now than in the past
-  U.S. money markets operated well during two recent stress episodes
-  Views on stability of money markets may inform judgments on:
-  Size and composition of balance sheet
-  Liquidity provision

<!-- missing-text -->

Summary

-  New regulatory environment and changes in business models will likely have implications for monetary policy framework
-  Some regulatory changes are not yet in place
-  Monetary policy implementation framework
-  Can support and enhance regulatory approach
-  Critical determinant of money market behavior

JUNE 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in economic activity appears to have picked up.  Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished.  Growth in household spending has strengthened.  Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at

auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

JULY 2016 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April June indicates that the pace of improvement in the labor market has slowed while growth in strengthened and that economic activity appears to have picked up has been expanding at a moderate rate .  Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished. Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May; on average, payrolls have risen at a moderate pace in recent months. Although some labor market indicators point to improvement in labor market conditions, the unemployment rate has held steady, on net, since the beginning of the year. Growth in Household spending has been growing strongly strengthened. Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment and residential investment has have been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, only partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Moreover, market-based measures of inflation compensation declined; and most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months remain near their lows .
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriate monetary policy accommodation , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen further .  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. In light of global economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the risks to the U.S. economic outlook as tilted somewhat to the downside.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until the risks to the outlook are more closely balanced and inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future when adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate might become appropriate , the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation , along with risks to the economic outlook .  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions

- will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain ing , for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

Although the unemployment rate has declined, job gains have diminished. Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.  On balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months. Growth in Household spending has been growing strongly strengthened.  Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has continued to improve and the drag from net exports appears to have lessened, but business fixed investment and residential investment has have been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined remain low ; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. Nearterm risks to the economic outlook have diminished. The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
