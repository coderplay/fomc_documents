- · Evaluate using supervisory data and firm's own analysis
- · A rise in rates would reduce the value of assets, and the effect of a sharp rise would be material especially for long-dated securities
- · However, banks can hedge:
- "Natural hedge" arising from the value associated with banks' ability to issue deposits at below-market rates
- Interest rate derivatives
- · Many banks' internal measures suggest an upward shock to rates (a parallel shift of 100 to 200 basis points) would increase banks' valuations
- · However, the effect depends on whether banks can retain deposits at low cost
- In past episodes of policy tightening, core deposits have been fairly stable
- In recent weeks following the expiration of TAG, deposits have held steady

- reduces unemployment 0.2 pp o
- raises inflation 0.1 percent o

The Question

- · What is the risk of a substantial increase in long-term interest rates?
- Defined as an increase that would be big relative to baseline expectations, and so could cause meaningful investor losses
- Consider outcomes in which the 10-year Treasury yield at the end of 2014 reaches levels roughly 100 or 200 basis points above market or staff projections

<!-- missing-text -->

Roadmap

- · Basic decomposition of long-term Treasury yields
- · Use two historical episodes, 1994 and 2003-2004, to illuminate sources of potential risk
- · Use information from four sources to quantify the likelihood of various outcomes for long-term rates at the end of 2014
- · Consider ways current monetary policy tools serve to amplify or reduce the risks
- · Long-term Treasury yields jumped after 1994 tightening and June 2003 rate cut, but edged lower after the 2004 tightening
- · Rate increases in 1994 and 2003 not associated with higher growth or inflation expectations
- Higher policy rate expectations and uncertainty were main features, perhaps reflecting lack of clarity regarding Committee's reaction function
- Initial increase in long-term yields likely amplified by MBS hedging flows

1994 and 2003-04

Note: Based on staff's four-factor term structure model.

Exhibit 3

Assess Current Risks of a Sharp Increase in Treasury Yields

- · Use information from: (1) survey; (2) swaptions; (3) term structure model with ZLB restrictions; (4) FRB/US simulations
- · Both market and staff expect a steady but gradual rise in Treasury yields
- · Risk of rates rising 100 basis points above market or staff projections notable but not elevated
- · The risk to long-term rates appears to be two-sided

Percentage points Mean Forecasts and 70-Percent Confidence Intervals

<!-- missing-text -->

- * The upper and lower bounds plot the averages of the ten highest and the ten lowest forecasts, respectively, for each horizon.

Distribution of Holdings of Long-term Securities

- · Federal Reserve is the second largest domestic MBS holder as of the end of 2012Q3, while GSEs have scaled back their MBS holdings
- · Half of Treasury notes and bonds were held by foreign investors, mostly sovereign investors, while Federal Reserve is the largest domestic holder

<!-- missing-text -->

Implications of Current Policy Environment

- · Enhanced communications should limit movements in long-term rates, although communicating clearly may prove challenging given historically unprecedented policy mix
- · The amplifying effect of MBS convexity hedging may be less pronounced now due to large SOMA holdings, reduced holdings at GSEs, and lower overall extension risks
- · A rise in interest rates may be amplified if SOMA portfolio sales lead to large increases in interest rate implied volatilities

Questions for Discussion of Efficacy and Costs of Asset Purchases

- 1. What is your view of the efficacy in general of asset purchases in supporting economic activity? What is your view of the efficacy specifically of current asset purchases, given the economic and financial environment?
- 2. What are the most significant costs, if any, that concern you in considering the net benefits of current or future asset purchases? Do you see these costs as increasing materially if the current pace of asset purchases continues through the end of the year?
- 3. If you listed any costs in your response to the previous question, do you believe that there are effective ways of avoiding or mitigating those costs?
- 4. Going forward, what do you see as the appropriate path for asset purchases? How would you describe the stopping rule or reaction function that you are employing in making that assessment?

Primary Dealer Balance Sheet Expectations

- · 19 of 21 dealers expect the Committee to reduce the pace of purchases before completing the program:
- Of these, about half expect tapering to begin in the second half of this year, with almost all the rest expecting it to start in 2014:H1
- Most anticipate tapering to last about 6 months
- · About evenly split on whether they expect asset sales during exit
- · Uncertainty about the size of the balance sheet this year and next decreased somewhat but remained high

Note. Primary dealer unemployment rates are interpolated from average Q4 values reported in the survey. A larger dot denotes two observations.

SEP Information on Purchases

- · 12 participants judged that appropriate policy implied a larger amount of purchases than the staff's baseline assumption
- · 4 participants indicated that their balance sheet projections did not materially differ from the staff's assumption
- · Other participants likely saw a smaller volume of purchases as appropriate
- · About half of the participants described appropriate paths for the balance sheet that appeared to imply no tapering, while roughly one third explicitly assumed that purchases would be tapered

JANUARY FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that growth in economic activity paused in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors.  Employment has continued to expand at a moderate pace but the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has shown further improvement.  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  Although strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee will continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations

P

continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January suggests that the pace of economic growth in economic activity paused has picked up in recent months, in large part because of weather-related disruptions and other transitory factors following a pause late last year .  Employment has continued to expand ed at a moderate solid pace but and the unemployment rate remains , though elevated , has declined .

Although strains in global financial markets have eased somewhat, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below close to its 2 percent objective. The Committee sees the risks to both economic growth and inflation as roughly balanced.
