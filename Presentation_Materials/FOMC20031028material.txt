Exhibit 1

Alternative Assessments of the Outlook

1.  The  Balance-of-Risks  Assessment

Against the background  of its long-run  goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth and of the information  currently available, the Committee  believes that the  risks ARE BALANCED  WITH  RESPECT  TO PROSPECTS  FOR BOTH  GOALS / ARE WEIGHTED MAINLY TOWARD  CONDITIONS  THAT MAY GENERATE  HEIGHTENED  INFLATION PRESSURES / ARE WEIGHTED  MAINLY TOWARD  CONDITIONS THAT MAY GENERATE ECONOMIC  WEAKNESS  in the foreseeable future.

2.  The  Current Language

The Committee  perceives that the upside  and downside  risks to the  attainment of sustainable economic growth  for the next few quarters are roughly equal. In  contrast, the probability, though  minor, of an  unwelcome fall  in inflation  exceeds that of a  rise in  inflation from  its already low level.  The Committee  judges that, on  balance, the  risk of inflation  becoming undesirably low remains the  predominant concern for the foreseeable future.

3. Reinhart memo (October 22, 2003)

The  probability of economic growth  running  above its  long-run sustainable pace is BELOW / ABOUT  EQUAL TO / ABOVE that of it falling short over the  next few quarters. Over the same period,  the probability of inflation  rising  is BELOW / ABOUT EQUAL TO / ABOVE  that of it  declining. In  light of  this assessment and  against the  backdrop of its long-run  goals of price stability and  maximum  employment,  the Committee judges that

EITHER

the risk(s) of INCREASING  PRESSURE ON  RESOURCES / DECREASING  PRESSURE  ON RESOURCES / (AND)/ INFLATION  RUNNING  UNDESIRABLY  HIGH / INFLATION RUNNING  UNDESIRABLY  LOW  is (are) the more  pressing concern(s)

OR

THE  RISKS  TO BOTH  OF  ITS  LONG-RUN  GOALS ARE  BALANCED

for  the foreseeable  future.

October 28, 2003

4. Gramlich memo (October 22, 2003)

The probability that economic growth  will proceed  over the  next few  quarters at a rate consistent with the  attainment of maximum  sustainable employment is BELOW  / EQUAL  TO / ABOVE the  probability of it falling short.  Over the same period, the  probability that inflation will  be  undesirably high  is BELOW / EQUAL TO / ABOVE  the probability that it will be undesirably  low.  Overall, the Committee  judges that the risks to the attainment of MAXIMUM SUSTAINABLE  EMPLOYMENT  ARE THE MORE  PRESSING CONCERN / PRICE STABILITY ARE THE  MORE  PRESSING CONCERN  / BOTH  GOALS ARE ABOUT  EQUAL.

Some  Questions

- 1. Do you have  a clear preference  as  to the basic structure  of the assessment  of the outlook?
- 2. Do you want to follow a bilateral  or multilateral  approach  to arrive  at new language?
- 3. How much importance  do you place  on wrapping up this issue quickly?
- 4. When do you want to talk about this next?
