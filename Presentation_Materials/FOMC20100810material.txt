JUNE FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the economic recovery is proceeding and that the labor market is improving gradually.  Household spending is increasing but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts remain at a depressed level. Financial conditions have become less supportive of economic growth on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad.  Bank lending has continued to contract in recent months.  Nonetheless, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time.
- 2. Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and underlying inflation has trended lower.  With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
- 3. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
- 4. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.

AUGUST FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April over recent months has increasingly suggested suggests that the economic recovery in economic activity and the labor market is proceeding at an unsatisfactory pace and that the labor market is improving gradually.  Household spending is increasing only gradually but and remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly is rising less rapidly than earlier in the year, and the contribution of inventory investment to growth is likely to wane . ; however, Investment in nonresidential structures continues to be weak, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts remain at a depressed level.  Financial conditions have become somewhat less supportive of economic growth in recent months, on balance, largely reflecting developments abroad. and bank lending has continued to contract  in recent months.  Nonetheless, Although the Committee still anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability, although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time the near-term outlook for economic activity has weakened .
- 2. Prices of energy and other commodities have declined somewhat in recent months, and Measures of underlying inflation has have trended lower in recent quarters . With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued remain, for some time , below levels that the Committee considers most consistent with its mandate to promote maximum employment and stable prices .
- 3. To support the economic recovery, the Committee will maintain decided to reduce the target range for the federal funds rate at to 0 to ¼ ⅛ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. Consistent with this reduction, the Board of Governors cut the remuneration rates on required and excess reserve balances to 10 basis points effective with the reserve maintenance period beginning August 12. The Committee anticipates maintaining this range for the federal funds rate until resource utilization and underlying inflation have moved appreciably closer to levels consistent with its longer-term objectives.
- 4. To provide additional support for the economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee will maintain the Federal Reserve's holdings of longerterm securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term Treasury securities [ alternatively: in agency mortgage-backed securities].   The Committee  will continue to roll over the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities as they mature.
- 5. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
