Inflation and the Acceleration in Productivity

Effect on Inflation = =

9 = productivity trend

9* moving average of the productivity trend

When q is rising, 9 &gt; q* and there will be downward pressure on inflation.

In terms of the Phillips Curve; this means inflation will be lower at any given unemployment rate that would have been the case with a constant rate of trend productivity growth.

This can be interpreted as implying a decline in the SR or effective NAIRU.

Productivity_and the NAIRU

Simple model_with symmetric response

- (1) W = a + q -b U + p
- (2) p = w = 9
- e (3) p = a - b U + p
- (4) U* = a/b

Model_with asymmetric_response

- (1') w =a + q* - b U + p
- e
- (4') U** = U*

w = rate of increase in nominal labor compensation inflation p =

p = expected inflation

9* = moving average of trend productivity growth

9 = trend productivity growth

U = unemployment rate

U* * = short-run or effective NAIRU

U* = long-run NAIRU
