- * The projected purchases, redemptions and net expansion in the SOMA in 2001 assume:

(1) 5 percent currency expansion (saar) over the second half of the year; (2) no change in outstanding long-term RPs from their current $12 billion level, except for a temporary increase to meet any seasonal increase in currency ahead of the year-end; and (3) no changes in the maturity distribution of new Treasury security issuance and in the Desk's purchases.  Actual purchases in 2001 through May 14 have totaled $28 billion, and redemptions have totaled $12 billion.
