Testing of Reverse Repos: Possible Further Steps

Testing ON RRP Rate Changes

- · Staff recommends modest decreases and increases in ON RRP rate after the October meeting.
- · This test could provide additional information about:
- The effect of the spread to IOER on money markets and demand for ON RRP.
- The effectiveness of the ON RRP rate as a floor for short-term rates.
- · Staff recommends that a schedule of ON RRP rate changes be preannounced.

Testing Term RRPs at Year-End

- · Anticipated year-end pressure due to balance sheet constraints raises two questions:
- 1. Does the Committee desire to take action to address it?
- 2. If so, what action could the Committee take?
- · The Committee may wish to test supplementary tools to improve control over short-term rates.
- If so, staff recommends a series of term RRP operations.
- Would provide opportunity to test utility of supplementary tools prior to liftoff.
- Would increase availability of safe money market instruments ahead of year-end.
- May signal that the Committee is prepared to deploy additional tools if warranted.
- Exercise could be sized to offset anticipated decline in safe money market assets.
- Could announce following this meeting term RRP operations in December to cross year-end.
-  Cumulative size limit of up to $300 billion.
-  Specific operational details to be announced by early December.
- · Alternatively, the Committee may find it desirable to take no action:
- If concerned about appearing to accommodate "window dressing" by banks.
- If comfortable with potentially significant pressure on short-term rates.
- Would provide a second observation of current framework on quarter-ends.
- Could reinforce FOMC's earlier communication.

Forward Guidance

- · Focuses more explicitly on the target range for the federal funds rate.
- · Alternative B:
- Would retain the reference to "considerable time" but start the clock at the end of the asset purchase program "this month."
- Would add language emphasizing the data-dependence of the timing of the first rate increase.
- · Options for updating the forward guidance:
- Could use paragraphs 1 and 2 to update the Committee's assessment of economic conditions.
- Could adjust the reference to "considerable time" as the anticipated timing of liftoff approaches.

October 28-29, 2014

FOMC STATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2014

- inflation expectations have remained 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  On balance, labor market conditions improved somewhat further; however, the unemployment rate is little changed and a range of labor market indicators suggests that there remains significant underutilization of labor resources.  Household spending appears to be rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective.  Longer-term stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators and inflation moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced and judges that the likelihood of inflation running persistently below 2 percent has diminished somewhat since early this year.
- maximum employment and the improvement interest rates, support 3. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in October, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $5 billion per month rather than $10 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $10 billion per month rather than $15 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will end its current program of asset purchases at its next meeting.  However, asset purchases are not on a preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the

P

Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
- 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

The Committee continues to anticipate anticipates , based on its current assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after following the end of its asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.
- 5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after as employment and inflation are near approach mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

DIRECTIVE SEPTEMBER 2014

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions. Beginning in October, the Desk is directed to purchase longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of about $10 billion per month and to purchase agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of about $5 billion per month.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Briefing on possible amendments to the 'Consensus Statement'

Three topics for discussion at this meeting:

-  Clarification of the symmetry of inflation preferences
-  Clarification of the 'balanced approach' monetary policy strategy
-  Clarification of the potential role of monetary policy in promoting financial stability

Symmetry of preferences for inflation

-  Why might symmetry be preferred and communicated?
- o Provides a clear focal point for long-term inflation expectations
- o Facilitates clear communications
- o Fosters transparency and public accountability
-  Why might participants have asymmetric preferences?
- o The costs of inflation may be asymmetric around two percent
- o Possible asymmetries in the dynamics of long-term inflation expectations

'Balanced approach'

-  Balanced approach as a statement about the Committee's loss function
- o Equal weights in the loss function
-  Balanced approach as a statement about the Committee's reaction function
- o Time horizons for returning goal variables to target are similar
- o Conditions for tolerating over- or undershooting a mandate variable
- o Tradeoffs between mandate variables always matter

Financial stability and the Dual Mandate

-  The role of monetary policy in promoting financial stability
- o Macroprudential and supervisory tools are the first line of defense
- o Imprudent to assume that these tools can be consistently relied upon
-  What makes financial instability different from other asymmetric risks?
- o Monetary policy may affect the probability of financial instability
- o Financial instability can reduce the efficacy of monetary policy
-  Responding to incipient instability
- o An episodic phenomenon inducing a temporary response
- o The appropriate response is not always straightforward

Why the current Consensus Statement might be the preferred option

-  The risk that the public might misinterpret any changes
-  The option value of waiting
-  The current Statement is a delicate balance

Questions for the Committee Discussion of the Consensus Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy at the October 2014 Meeting

- 1. Should the Consensus Statement be modified to clarify the symmetry of the Committee's preferences for inflation relative to its 2 percent longer-run objective?  For example, should it be made clearer that inflation below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective is considered to be equally as undesirable as inflation the same amount above that objective?
- 2. Should the Consensus Statement elaborate on the 'balanced approach' language used in paragraph 5, or do you judge that there is no further elaboration which would still encompass the diversity of views among Committee participants regarding their preferences over the dual-mandate goals?
- 2.a  Do you interpret 'balanced approach' as connoting equal weights on the two parts of the dual mandate goals - specifically, that a miss of inflation relative to its longer-run objective is generally as costly in the Committee's objective function as an equal-sized miss in the unemployment rate relative what the Committee judges to be its' mandate consistent level?  If so, should this be stated explicitly in the Consensus Statement?
- 3. Should the Consensus Statement be modified to further clarify the relationship between the objective of financial stability and the dual-mandate goals of price stability and maximum employment, or are you comfortable with the current statement's treatment of financial stability?

If you prefer enhancements,

- 3.a  Should financial stability be included in paragraph 5 in the discussion of the approach the Committee takes in promoting its dual-mandate goals?
- 3.b Should the statement include the recognition that in some circumstances when financial stability appears to be at risk, the stance of monetary policy may have to be adjusted in order to mitigate risks to financial stability?
- 4. Looking ahead, are there other portions of the Consensus Statement that you would like the subcommittee to study during 2015?  Are there revisions to other communications tools or additional tools that the subcommittee should consider on behalf of the FOMC?  For example, do you see promising opportunities to improve the SEP?  Do you believe it is time again to consider a consensus forecast?

Therefore,  the  Committee's  policy  decisions reflect  its  longer-run outlook, and its assessments of the balance risks,  including  risks  to  the  financial  system that could impede the attainment of the Com­ mittee's goals. Inflation, employment, and long-term inter­ est  rates  fluctuate  over  time  in  response  to economic  and  financial  disturbances.    More­ over,  monetary  policy  actions  tend  to  influ­

firmly  an­ The  inflation rate  over  the  longer  run  is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Commit­ tee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate  of  2  percent,  as  measured  by  the  annual change  in  the  price  index  for  personal  con­ sumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.  Communicating this infla­ tion  goal  clearly  to  the public  helps  keep longer-term  inflation  expectations chored,  thereby  fostering  price  stability  and moderate long-term interest rates and enhanc­ ing the Committee's ability to promote maxi­ mum  employment  in  the  face  of  significant economic disturbances.

The maximum level of employment is largely  determined  by  nonmonetary  factors that  affect  the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the labor market.  These factors may change over time  and  may  not be  directly measurable. Consequently,  it  would  not specify  a  fixed  goal  for  employment;  rather, the Committee's  policy  decisions  must be informed  by  assessments  of  the  maximum level  of  employment,  recognizing  that  such assessments are necessarily uncertain and sub­ ject  to  revision.    The  Committee  considers  a wide  range  of  indicators  in sessments. Information about Committee participants'  estimates  of  the  longer-run mal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections. For  example,  in  the  most  recent  projections, FOMC participants'  estimates  of  the  longerrun normal rate of unemployment had a cen­ tral longer-run goal and deviations of employ­ Committee  judges  that promoting them, return to levels judged consistent In  setting  monetary  policy,  the  Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its ment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level.
