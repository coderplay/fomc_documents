NOVEMBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that economic growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year. Nonetheless, recent indicators point to continuing weakness in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has increased at a somewhat faster pace in recent months.  Business investment in equipment and software has continued to expand, but investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation appears to have moderated since earlier in the year as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee continues to expect a moderate pace of economic growth over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further.  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
- 4. The Committee also decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013.
- 5. The Committee will continue to assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and is prepared to employ its tools to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of price stability.

DECEMBER FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September November indicates suggests that economic growth strengthened somewhat in the third quarter, reflecting in part a reversal of the temporary factors that had weighed on growth earlier in the year the economy has been expanding modestly, while global growth appears to be slowing .  Nonetheless Although recent indicators point to continuing weakness some improvement in overall labor market conditions, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has increased at a somewhat faster pace in recent months. continued to advance, but business fixed investment in equipment and software has continued to expand appears to be increasing less rapidly but investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed. Inflation appears to have has moderated since earlier in the year, as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their peaks. and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee continues to expect s that, absent further policy action, a moderate the pace of economic growth would remain modest over coming quarters and consequently anticipates that the unemployment rate will would decline only very gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Moreover, there are significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets. the Committee also anticipates that inflation will would settle, over coming quarters, at levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further. Strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook, and the risks to the outlook for inflation also appear to be tilted to the downside. However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with the dual mandate, the Committee decided today to purchase a further $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities by the end of December 2012 . In addition, the Committee intends to continue its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in September.  The Committee is also maintaining its existing policies of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. These programs should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, provide support to mortgage markets, and help make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.

Exhibit 2:  Mockup of New SEP Narrative

Overview

As shown in figure 2, most participants judged that highly accommodative monetary policy was likely to  be  warranted  over  coming  years  in  order  to promote a stronger economic recovery in a context of  price  stability.  In  particular,  as  shown  in  the upper panel, about two-thirds of participants anticipated that, under appropriate monetary policy, the  target  federal  funds  rate  would  stay  at its current range at least through the end of 2013, and nearly all of those participants expected policy firming to commence  in 2014 or 2015. The remaining participants judged that raising the target  funds  rate  would  be  appropriate  within  the next  two  years  in  order  to  forestall  inflationary pressures. As shown in the lower panel, participants generally agreed that the pace of firming was likely to be gradual and that the target funds rate in the fourth quarter of 2014 would still be  well  below  their  assessments  of  its  longer-run level.

Appropriate Monetary Policy

Most participants anticipated that, under appropriate  monetary  policy,  the  target federal funds  rate  would  stay  at  or  close  to  its  current range of 0 to ¼ percent through the fourth quarter of 2013. In particular, seven participants expected that policy firming would commence during 2014, while  four  others  judged  that  an  increase  in  the target  funds  rate  would  not  be  appropriate  until after  the end of 2014. In contrast, six participants judged that an increase in the target rate would be appropriate  within  the  next  two  years,  and  those participants expected the target rate to be increased to around 1.5 to 4 percent by the fourth quarter of 2014.

Participants  generally  viewed  the  current  weak economic conditions and a moderating outlook for inflation as warranting highly accommodative monetary policy for an extended period, though at some  point  a  reduction  in  accommodation  would become  appropriate  in  order  for  the  recovery  to proceed in the context of price stability. A number of other key factors informed participants' projections  of  the  appropriate  path  for  the  policy rate, including their judgments regarding the extent to  which  current  conditions  deviate  from  longer- run goals and  the mechanisms  through  which policy actions affect economic activity and inflation over time.

Nearly  all  participants  projected  that  the  target federal  funds  rate  in  late  2014  would  still  be substantially below its longer-run level. Most expected that the target rate would converge over time to a value in the interval of about 4.0 to 4.5 percent.  However,  a  few  participants'  longer-run projections  were  a  notch  lower  at  around  3.75 percent, and one participant's projection was about 4.75  percent.  Participants  noted  that  their  longerrun  projections  reflected  their  judgments  of  the mandate-consistent  inflation  rate  as  well  as  their estimates of the longer-run equilibrium level of the real federal funds rate.

Figure  4.E  depicts  the  distribution  of  Committee participants'  judgments  regarding  the  appropriate level  of  the  target  federal  funds  rate  in  the  fourth quarter  of  each  calendar  year  from  2012  to  2014 and  over  the longer run. Participants noted  a number of factors that contributed to the dispersion in these judgments. In particular, those participants who expected that policy firming should commence within the next two years cited the need to forestall inflation pressures, the implications of financial and structural imbalances, and the importance of keeping inflation expectations firmly anchored. In contrast, participants who anticipated a later onset of policy firming generally referred  to  the  slow  pace  of  economic  growth, persistently  low  levels  of  resource  utilization,  the subdued  medium-term  outlook  for  inflation,  and the degree to which monetary policy is constrained by the effective lower bound on the federal funds rate.

Some participants noted that appropriate monetary policy  would  involve  further  clarification  of  the Committee's forward guidance regarding the likely path of the target federal funds rate. A few judged that  further  expansion  of  the  FOMC's  securities holdings could be appropriate to provide additional monetary accommodation, whereas others indicated that the Federal Reserve's balance sheet would  need  to  shrink  substantially  over  coming years  in  conjunction  with  the  process  of  policy firming.

Exhibit 4:  The FOMC's Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy

Following careful deliberations at its recent meetings, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has reached broad agreement on the following principles regarding its longer-run goals and its monetary policy strategy.  The Committee intends to reaffirm these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual organizational meeting each January.

- 1. The FOMC is strongly committed to fulfilling its statutory mandate from the Congress of promoting maximum employment, price stability, and moderate long-term interest rates.  The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible.  Such clarity not only enhances transparency and accountability, which are essential in a democratic society, but also facilitates well-informed decision-making by households and businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, and increases the effectiveness of monetary policy.
- 2. Inflation, employment, and long-term interest rates fluctuate over time in response to economic disturbances.  Moreover, monetary policy actions tend to influence economic activity and prices with a lag.  Therefore, the Committee's policy decisions at each point in time reflect its longer-run goals, its medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks.
- 3. The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the latitude to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee judges that inflation of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate. Communicating this inflation goal clearly to the public helps keep longer-term inflation expectations firmly anchored, thereby fostering price stability and moderate long-term interest rates and enhancing the Committee's ability to promote maximum employment in the face of significant economic disturbances.
- 4. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors, such as the pace of technological innovation and the structure of the labor market, that may change over time and that may not be directly measurable.  Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the maximum level of employment, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision.  The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments, and information about Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rates of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections.  For example, in the most recent projections, FOMC participants' estimates of the longer-run normal rate of unemployment had a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 6.0 percent, roughly unchanged from last January but substantially higher than the corresponding interval several years earlier.
- 5. In setting monetary policy, the Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its longerrun goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level. The Committee follows a balanced approach in promoting these objectives, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.

Exhibit 5:  Questions for Discussion of FOMC Communications Initiatives

1. Enhancements to the Summary of Economic Projections

- a.  In its December 2 memo to the FOMC, the Subcommittee on Communications recommended a particular approach for incorporating policy projections into the Summary of Economic Projections (SEP).  Does that approach seem reasonable, or do you think that a substantially different approach would be preferable?
- b.  Do you concur with the Subcommittee's recommendation to start publishing policy projections in the January SEP?
- c.  Are there any other potential enhancements to the SEP-such as the items that were noted in the concluding paragraph of the December 2 memo-that the Subcommittee should explore over coming months?

2. Statement of Longer-Run Goals and Policy Strategy

- a.  In its December 6 memo to the FOMC, the Subcommittee presented a draft statement regarding the Committee's longer-run goals and policy strategy.  Could you support the adoption of a statement along these lines?  If not, what modifications would be needed to garner your support?
- b.  Do you agree that such a statement should be a 'living and breathing document' that would be reaffirmed, with any appropriate adjustments, at the annual organizational meeting each January?  If so, are there any further aspects of the Committee's longer-run goals and policy strategy that you think should be clarified and communicated over time?
