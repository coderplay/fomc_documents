Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy

Adopted effective January 24, 2012; as amended effective January 27, 201526, 2016

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is  firmly  committed  to  fulfilling  its statutory  mandate  from  the  Congress  of  promoting  maximum employment, stable  prices, and  moderate  long-term  interest  rates.    The Committee seeks to explain its monetary policy decisions to the public as clearly as possible. Such  clarity  facilitates  well-informed decisionmaking  by  households  and  businesses, reduces economic and financial uncertainty, increases  the  effectiveness  of  monetary policy,  and  enhances  transparency  and  accountability,  which  are  essential  in  a  democratic society.

Inflation, employment, and long-term interest  rates  fluctuate  over  time  in  response  to economic  and  financial  disturbances.    Moreover,  monetary  policy  actions  tend  to  influence economic activity and prices with a lag. Therefore,  the  Committee's  policy  decisions reflect  its  longer-run  goals,  its  medium-term outlook, and its assessments of the balance of risks,  including  risks  to  the  financial  system that could impede the attainment of the Committee's goals.

the face of significant economic disturbances. The maximum level of employment is largely determined by nonmonetary factors that affect the  structure  and  dynamics  of  the  labor  market. These factors may change over time and may not be directly measurable.  Consequently,  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  specify  a fixed  goal  for  employment;  rather,  the  Committee's policy decisions must be informed by assessments  of  the  maximum  level  of  employment,  recognizing  that  such  assessments are  necessarily  uncertain  and  subject  to  revision.  The Committee considers a wide range of  indicators  in  making  these  assessments. Information about Committee participants' estimates  of  the    longer-run  normal  rates  of output growth and unemployment is published four times per year in the FOMC's Summary of Economic Projections.  For example, in the most recent projections, the median of FOMC participants'  estimates  of  the  longer-run  normal  rate  of  unemployment  was  4.9  percent. had  a  central  tendency  of  5.2  percent  to  5.5 percent.

The  inflation  rate  over  the  longer  run  is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation.  The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate  of  2  percent,  as  measured  by  the  annual change  in  the  price  index  for  personal  consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserve's statutory mandate.  The Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently  above or below this objective.  Communicating this symmetric inflation goal clearly to the  public  helps  keep    longer-term  inflation expectations  firmly  anchored,  thereby  fostering  price  stability and  moderate  long-term interest  rates  and  enhancing  the  Committee's ability  to  promote  maximum  employment  in

In  setting  monetary  policy,  the  Committee seeks to mitigate deviations of inflation from its  longer-run goal and deviations of employment from the Committee's assessments of its maximum level.  These objectives are generally  complementary.    However,  under  circumstances  in  which  the  Committee  judges  that the  objectives  are  not  complementary,  it  follows a balanced approach in promoting them, taking into account the magnitude of the deviations and the potentially different time horizons over which employment and inflation are projected to return to levels judged consistent with its mandate.

The  Committee  intends  to  reaffirm  these principles and to make adjustments as appropriate at its annual  organizational  meeting each January.

- (b) Federal  Reserve  Bank  representatives. The  representatives  of  the  Federal  Reserve Banks,  and  an  alternate  for  each  representative,  are  elected  by  the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks in accordance with section  12A  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Act  (12 USC  263)  for  annual  terms  commencing  on the date of the first regularly scheduled meeting  of  the  Committee  occurring  on  or  after January 1 of each year.  Prior to the first regularly  scheduled meeting of the Committee on or after January 1 of each year, each member of the Committee  representing  the  Federal Reserve  Banks  shall  cause  a  record  of  the member's  election  and  of  the  election  of  the member's  alternate  to  be  forwarded  to  the secretary of the Committee.  If any question is raised  as  to  the  election  or  eligibility  of  a member  or  alternate,  the  Committee  determines  such  question  before  such  member  or alternate participates in a meeting of the Committee.  In the event a member is absent from  a  meeting  of  the  Committee,  the  member's alternate, in attending the meeting, shall have the same status as the member for whom the alternate is serving.  If a member or alternate ceases to be a president or first vice president  of  a  Federal  Reserve  Bank,  a  successor may  be  chosen  in  a  special  election  by  the boards of directors of the appropriate Federal Reserve  Bank  or  Banks  and  such  successor

serves until the next annual election.

- (c) Oath  of  office. Each  member  of  the Committee  and  each  alternate  take  the  same oath of office as that prescribed by statute to be taken by officers of the United States.

SECTION 3-Chairman and Vice Chairman

At its first  regularly scheduled meeting on or after  January  1  of  each  year,  the  Committee elects a Chairman and a Vice Chairman from among  its  membership.    The  Chairman  presides  at  all  meetings  of  the  Committee  and performs  such  other  duties  as  the  Committee may require.  The Vice Chairman performs the duties  of  the  Chairman  in  the  absence  of  the Chairman.  In the absence of both the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Committee, the Vice Chairman  of  the Board  acts as Chairman  of  the  Committee;  and,  in  the  absence of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of  the  Committee  and  the  Vice  Chairman  of the  Board,  the  member  of  the  Board  present with  the  longest  service  as  a  member  of  the Board acts as Chairman of the Committee.

SECTION 4-Staff

- (a) Selection  of  staff  officers. At  its  first regularly scheduled meeting on or after January  1  of  each  year,  the  Committee  selects, from among the officers and employees of the Board  and  the  Federal  Reserve  Banks,  the following staff officers to serve until the first regularly scheduled meeting on or after January  1  of  the  next  following  year:  secretary, deputy  secretary,  and  one  or  more  assistant secretaries;  general  counsel,  deputy  general counsel,  and  one  or  more  assistant  general counsels;  economists,  one  or  more  of  whom may  be  designated as senior or associate economists or given titles reflecting their areas of  particular  specialization;  and  such  other officers  as  the  Committee  might  wish  from time  to  time.    A  staff  officer  ceases  to  be  an officer of the Committee if he or she ceases to be  employed  by  the  Board  or  by  a  Federal

J

ยง 4

Reserve  Bank  or  if  the  Committee  selects  a successor to that staff officer.

The secretary  keeps  minutes  of  actions  and  records  of  discussions  at  all  meetings  of  the  Committee;  maintains  a  complete record of the actions taken by the Committee upon  all  questions  of  policy  relating  to  open market operations; and records the votes taken in  connection with  the  determination  of  open market  policies  and  the  reasons  underlying each  such  action.    The  secretary  has  custody of  such  minutes  and  records,  and  performs such  other  duties  as  the  Committee  may  require.    In  the  absence  of  the  secretary  of  the Committee,  the  deputy  secretary  or  an  assistant secretary acts as secretary pro tem.
- (c) Economists. The economists prepare for the  use  of  the  Committee  and  present  to  it such information regarding business and credit conditions and domestic and international economic and financial  developments  as  will assist  the  Committee  in  the  determination  of open  market  policies,  and  they  perform  such other duties as the Committee may require.
- (d) General  counsel  and  deputy  and  assistant  general  counsel. The  general  counsel furnishes such legal advice as the Committee may  require.    In  the  absence  of  the  general counsel, the deputy general counsel or an assistant general counsel acts as general counsel pro tem.

The Committee selects a manager and deputy manager of the System Open Market Account. The foregoing shall be satisfactory to the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to  execute  open  market  transactions  for  such account (the 'Selected Bank') and shall serve at the pleasure of the Committee.  The manager  keeps  the  Committee  informed  on  market conditions and on transactions made for such account and renders such reports as the Committee  may  specify.    In  the  absence  of  the manager, the deputy manager acts as manager pro tem.  In the event that the president of the Selected Bank determines that the manager or deputy  manager  is  not  able  to  perform  the duties  of  the  position,  the  Chairman  may  select  a  person  satisfactory to such president to serve as manager or deputy manager (as relevant)  until  the  Committee  and  the  Selected Bank select a replacement manager or (as relevant) deputy manager in accordance with this section.

Federal Open Market Committee-Rules of Procedure

12 CFR 272; as amended effective January 29, 2013

SECTION 272.1-Authority

This part  is issued by the Federal Open Mari ket Committee (the 'Committee') pursuant to the requirement of section 552 of title 5 of the United  States  Code  that  every  agency  shall publish  in  the  Federal  Register  its  rules  of procedure.

SECTION 272.2-Functions of the Committee

The  procedures  followed  by  the  Committee are  designed to facilitate the effective performance of the Committee's statutory functions with respect to the regulation and direction of open market operations conducted by the Federal Reserve Banks and with respect to certain direct  transactions  between  the  Federal  Reserve Banks and the United States.  In determining  the  policies  to  be  followed  in  such operations, the Committee  considers  information  regarding  business  and  credit  conditions and domestic and international economic and  financial  developments,  and  other  pertinent information gathered and submitted by its staff and the staffs of the Board of Governors of  the  Federal  Reserve  System  (the  'Board') and  the  Federal  Reserve  Banks.  Against  the background of such information, the Committee takes actions from time to time to regulate and  direct  the  open  market  operations  of  the Federal  Reserve  Banks.  Such  policy  actions ordinarily are taken through the adoption and transmission to the Federal Reserve Banks of regulations, authorizations, and directives.

SECTION 272.3-Meetings

- (a) Place  and  frequency. The  Committee meets in Washington, D.C., at least four times each  year  and  oftener  if  deemed  necessary. Meetings are held upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or at the request of any three members  of  the  Committee.  Notices  of  calls by the Chairman of the Board to other members are given by the secretary of the Committee in writing, by  telephone,  or  electronic

means.  Requests of any three members for the calling of a meeting shall state the time therefore and shall be filed in writing, by telephone, or  electronic  means  with  the  secretary  who shall forthwith notify all members  of  the Committee  in  writing,  by  telephone,  or  electronic  means.    When  the  secretary  has  sent notices to all members of the Committee that a meeting has been requested by three members and of the time therefore, a meeting is deemed to have been called.  If, in the judgment of the Chairman, circumstances require that a meeting be called at such short notice that one or more  members  cannot  be  present  in  person, such members may participate in the meeting by  telephone  conference  arrangements  or  by electronic means.

- (b) Alternates. Whenever  any  member  of the  Committee  representing  Federal  Reserve Banks shall find that the member will be unable to attend a meeting of the Committee, the member  shall  promptly  notify  the  member's alternate and the secretary of the Committee in writing,  by  telephone,  or  electronic  means, and upon receipt of such notice such alternate shall advise the secretary whether the alternate will attend such meeting.
- (c) Quorum. Seven members, at least one of whom  represents  a  Federal  Reserve  Bank, constitute a quorum of the Committee for purposes  of  transacting  business  except  that,  if there are fewer than seven members in office, then the number of members in office constitute a quorum.  For purposes of this paragraph (c),  members of the Committee include alternates acting in the absence of members. Less than a quorum may adjourn a meeting of the Committee from time to time until a quorum is in attendance.
- (d) Attendance  at  meetings. Attendance  at Committee meetings is restricted to members and alternate members of the Committee, the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks who are not  at  the  time  members  or  alternates,  staff officers  of  the  Committee,  the  manager,  and such  other  advisers  as  the  Committee  may invite from time to time.
- (e) Meeting agendas. The secretary, in consultation with the Chairman, prepares an

J

agenda  of  matters  to  be  discussed  at  each regularly scheduled meeting and the secretary transmits  the  agenda  to  the  members  of  the Committee  within  a  reasonable  time  in  advance of such meeting.  In general, the agendas  include  reports  by  the  manager  on  open market operations since the previous meeting, and ratification by the Committee of such operations; reports by economists on, and Committee discussion of, the economic and financial  situation  and  outlook;  Committee discussion  of  monetary  policy  and  action  with  respect  thereto;  and  such  other  matters  as  may be considered necessary.

SECTION 272.4-Committee Actions

- (a) Actions  at  meetings. Actions  are  taken at  meetings  of  the  Committee  except  as  described below.
- (b) Policy  actions  between  meetings. Special  circumstances  may  make  it  desirable  in the public interest for Committee members to consider  an  action  to  modify  an  outstanding Committee authorization or directive at a time when  it  is  not  feasible  to  call  a  meeting. Whenever, in the  judgment  of  the  Chairman, such  circumstances  have  arisen,  the  relevant information  and  recommendations  for  action are  transmitted  to  the  members  by  the  secretary, and the members  communicate  their votes  to  the  secretary.    If  the  action  is  approved by a majority of the members, advice to  that  effect  is  promptly  given  by  the  secretary to the members of the Committee and to the Federal Reserve Bank selected to execute transactions for the System Open Market Account.    All  communications  of  recommended actions and votes under this paragraph shall be in writing, by telephone, or electronic means; if  the  communication is made orally, the secretary shall cause a written record to be made without delay. An action taken between meetings has the force and effect of an action at a meeting; provided, however, that if a meeting is held before the execution of any operations pursuant  to  the  action,  the  action  is  null  and void unless it is ratified and confirmed by the Committee at such meeting.
- (c) Other  actions  between  meetings. Circumstances may make it desirable in the public interest for Committee members to consider other actions, such  as approval  of the minutes, between meetings.  In these circumstances,  the  relevant  information  and  recommendations for such action are transmitted to the  members  by  the  secretary,  and  the  members communicate their votes to the secretary. All  communications of recommended actions and  votes  under  this  paragraph  shall  be  in writing,  by  telephone,  or  electronic  means;  if the  communication is  made orally,  the  secretary  shall  cause  a  written  record  to  be  made without delay.
- (d) Delegations of authority. In special circumstances, the  Committee  may delegate authority  to  take  an  action,  subject  to  such  instructions or guidelines as the Committee deems  proper.  Such  delegations  of  authority may be made to the Chairman; to a subcommittee  consisting  of  the  Chairman  and  the Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the  Board  (or  in  the  absence  of the Chairman or of the Vice Chairman of the Board  the  members  of  the  Board  designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee the alternate for the Vice Chairman); or to any other member or members of the Committee. An action taken pursuant to such a delegation of authority has the force and effect of an action taken by the Committee.
- (e) Technical  changes  to  Committee  rules. The secretary of the Committee (or the acting secretary) is authorized to make technical corrections, such as spelling, grammar, construction,  and  organization  (including  removal  of obsolete  provisions  and  references),  to  the Committee's rules, regulations, and orders and other  records  of  Committee  action  but  only with the concurrence of the Committee's general counsel.
- (f) Effective  date. Committee  action  ordinarily  is  made  effective  as  of  the  time  it  is taken because the nature of the subject matter and  the  action  taken  is  such  that  the  public interest and the proper discharge of the Committee's responsibilities so require.  Occasion-

ยง 272.4

ally, however, the Committee may specify that an  action  is  to  be  effective  at  some  different time.

SECTION 272.5-Notice and Public Procedure

There ordinarily is no published notice of proposed action by the Committee or public pro- cedure thereon, as described in section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code, because such notice  and  procedure  are  impracticable,  unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.

Resolution Authorizing Certain Actions by Federal Reserve Banks During an Emergency

As amended effective January 27, 2015

The  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  (the 'Committee') hereby authorizes each Federal Reserve Bank to take any or all of the actions set forth below during and following a national security emergency when such Federal Reserve Bank finds itself unable after reasonable efforts to be in communication with the Committee or when the Committee is unable to function. Action(s) under this authorization will be taken by a Federal Reserve Bank only after  reasonable  efforts  have  been  made  to consult  with  the  Chairman  of  the  Committee or  if  the  latter  is  not  available  with  the  Vice Chairman  of  the  Committee  or  if  both  the Chairman  and  the  Vice  Chairman  are  not available, with whatever member of the Board of  Governors  may  be  available  to  serve  as Acting Chairman  as provided for by the Committee's  Rules  of  Organization.

- (j) Representative of the news media refers to  any  person  actively  gathering  news  for  an entity  that  is  organized  and  operated  to  publish or broadcast news to the public.
- (1) The  term  'news'  means  information about  current  events  or  that  would  be  of current interest to the public.
- (2) Examples  of  news-media  entities  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  television  or radio  stations  broadcasting  to  the  public  at large, and  publishers  of  newspapers  and other periodicals (but only in those instances  when  they  can  qualify  as  disseminators of 'news') who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the general public.

- (a) Receipt of requests. The date of receipt for any  request,  including  one  that  is  addressed  incorrectly  or  that  is  referred  to  the Committee by another agency or by a Federal Reserve Bank, is the date the secretary of the Committee actually receives the request.
- (b) Priority  of  responses. The  Committee shall  normally  process  requests  in  the  order they are received.  However, in the secretary's discretion, or upon a court order in a matter to which  the  Committee  is  a  party,  a  particular request may be processed out of turn.
- (c) Expedited  processing. Where  a  person requesting  expedited  access  to  records  has demonstrated  a  compelling  need  for  the  records, or where the Committee has determined to expedite the response, the Committee shall process the request as soon as practicable.
- (1) To demonstrate a compelling need for expedited  processing, the requester shall provide  a  certified  statement,  a  sample  of which  may  be  obtained  from  the  Board's Freedom of Information Office.  The statement, certified to be true and correct to the best  of  the  requester's  knowledge  and  belief, shall demonstrate that-
- (i) the  failure  to  obtain  the  records  on an  expedited  basis  could  reasonably  be expected  to  pose  an  imminent  threat  to the life or physical safety of an individual; or
- (ii) the  requester  is  a  representative  of the  news  media,  as  defined  in  section 271.2, and there is urgency to inform the

J

ยง 271.6

public concerning actual or alleged Committee activity.

- (2) In response to a request for expedited processing,  the  secretary  of  the  Committee shall notify a requester of the determination within 10 working days of receipt of the request.    In  exceptional  situations,  the  secretary of the Committee has the discretion to waive the formality of certification.    If  the secretary of the Committee denies a request for expedited processing, the requester may file an appeal pursuant to the procedures set forth in paragraph (i) of this section, and the Committee shall respond to the appeal within 10 working days after the appeal was received by the Committee.
- (d) Time  limits. The  time  for  response  to requests shall be 20 working days, except-
- (1) in the case of expedited treatment under paragraph (c) of this section;
- (2) where the running of such time is suspended for payment of fees pursuant to section 271.9(b)(2);
- (3) in  unusual  circumstances,  as  defined in  5  USC  552(a)(6)(B).    In  such  circumstances, the time limit may be extended for a period of time not to exceed-
- (i) 10  working  days  as  provided  by written  notice  to  the  requester,  setting forth the reasons for the extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched; or
- (ii) such alternative time period as mutually  agreed  to  by  the  secretary  of  the Committee  and  the  requester  when  the secretary  of  the  Committee  notifies  the requester  that  the  request  cannot  be  processed in the specified time limit.
- (e) Response  to  request. In  response  to  a request that satisfies section 271.5, an appropriate search shall be conducted of records of the Committee in existence on the date of receipt of the request, and a review made of any responsive information located.  The secretary shall notify the requester of-
- (1) the  Committee's  determination  of  the request;
- (2) the reasons for the determination;
- (3) the amount of information withheld;
- (4) the right of the requester to appeal to the Committee any denial or partial denial, as specified in paragraph (h) of this section; and
- (5) in the case of a denial of a request, the name and title or position of the person responsible for the denial.
- (f) Referral to another agency. To the extent  a  request  covers  documents  that  were created  by,  obtained  from,  or  classified  by another agency, the Committee may refer the request  to  that  agency  for  a  response  and  inform the requester promptly of the referral.
- (g) Providing responsive records.
- (1) Copies  of  requested  records  shall  be sent to the requester by regular U.S. mail to the  address  indicated  in  the  request,  unless the  requester  elects  to  take  delivery  of  the documents  at  the  Board's  Freedom  of  Information Office or makes other acceptable arrangements,  or  the  Committee  deems  it appropriate  to  send  the  documents  by  another means.
- (2) The  Committee  shall  provide  a  copy of the record in any form or format requested  if  the  record  is  readily  reproducible  by the  Committee  in  that  form  or  format,  but the Committee need not provide more than one copy of any record to a requester.
- (h) Appeal of denial of request. Any person denied access to Committee records requested under section 271.5 may file a written appeal with the Committee, as follows:
- (1) The  appeal  shall  prominently  display the phrase FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT APPEAL on the first page, and shall be addressed  to  the  Secretary  of  the  Committee,  Federal  Open  Market Committee, 20th and C Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20551; or sent by facsimile to the secretary of the Committee, (202) 452-2921.
- (2) An initial request for records may not be combined in the same letter with an appeal.
- (3) The  Committee,  or  such  member  of the Committee as is delegated the authority, shall  make  a  determination  regarding  any appeal within 20 working days of actual receipt of the appeal by the secretary, and the

- (5) Inter-  or  intra-agency  memorandums. Information  contained  in  inter-  or  intraagency memorandums or letters that would not  be  available  by  law  to  a  party  (other than an agency) in litigation with an agency, including, but not limited to-

- (8) Examination, inspection, operating, or condition reports, and confidential supervisory  information.

- (c) Discretionary  release. Except  where disclosure  is  expressly  prohibited  by  statute, regulation,  or  order,  the  Committee  may  authorize the release of records that are exempt from mandatory disclosure whenever the Committee or designated Committee members determines  that  such  disclosure  would  be  in the public interest.
- (d) Delayed  release. Publication in the Federal  Register or  availability  to  the  public of  certain  information  may  be  delayed  if  immediate disclosure would likely-

SECTION 271.8-Subpoenas

- (a) Advice by person served. If any person, whether or not an officer or employee of the Committee, of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve  System,  or  of  a  Federal  Reserve Bank, has information of the Committee that may not be disclosed by reason of section 271.7  and  in  connection  therewith  is  served with  a  subpoena,  order,  or  other  process  requiring the person's personal attendance as a witness  or  the  production  of  documents  or information  upon  any  proceeding,  the  person should  promptly  inform  the  secretary  of  the Committee of such service and of all relevant facts, including the documents  and information requested and any facts that may be of assistance in determining whether such documents or information should be made available;  and  the  person  should  take  action  at  the appropriate time to inform the court or tribunal  that  issued  the  process,  and  the  attorney for  the  party  at  whose  instance  the  process was issued, if known, of the substance of this part.
- (b) Appearance by person served. Except as disclosure  of  the  relevant  information  is  authorized pursuant to this part, any person who has  information  of  the  Committee  and  is  required to respond to a subpoena or other legal process  shall  attend  at  the  time  and  place

therein mentioned and decline to disclose such information  or  give  any  testimony  with  respect  thereto,  basing  such  refusal  upon  this part.    If,  notwithstanding,  the  court  or  other body  orders  the disclosure of such  information,  or  the  giving  of  such  testimony,  the person  having  such  information  of  the  Committee  shall  continue  to  decline  to  disclose such information and shall promptly report the facts to the Committee for such action as the Committee may deem appropriate.

SECTION 271.9-Fee Schedules; Waiver of Fees

- (a) Fee schedules. The fees applicable to a request  for records  pursuant  to  271.4  and 271.5 are set forth in appendix A to this section.  These fees cover only the full allowable direct costs of search, duplication, and review. No  fees  will  be  charged  where  the  average cost of collecting the fee (calculated at $5.00) exceeds the amount of the fee.
- (b) Payment procedures. The secretary may assume that  a  person  requesting  records  pursuant to section 271.5 will pay the applicable fees,  unless  the  request  includes  a  limitation on fees to be paid or seeks a waiver or reduction  of  fees  pursuant  to  paragraph  (f)  of  this section.
- (1) Advance notification of fees. If the estimated  charges  are  likely  to  exceed  $100, the secretary of the Committee shall notify the  requester  of  the  estimated  amount,  unless  the  requester  has  indicated  a  willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Upon  receipt  of  such  notice,  the  requester may  confer  with  the  secretary  to  reformulate the request to lower the costs.
- (2) Advance payment. The secretary may require  advance  payment  of  any  fee  estimated to exceed $250.  The secretary may also require full payment in advance where a  requester  has  previously  failed  to  pay  a fee in a timely fashion.  The time period for responding to requests under section 271.6(d), and the processing of the request shall  be  suspended  until  the  secretary  receives the required payment.

J

ยง 271.9

- (3) Late  charges. The secretary  may  assess  interest  charges  when  fee  payment  is not  made  within  30  days  of  the  date  on which the billing was sent.  Interest is at the rate prescribed in 31 USC 317 and accrues from the date of the billing.
- (c) Categories  of  uses. The  fees  assessed depend upon the intended use for the records requested.    In  determining  which  category  is appropriate,  the  secretary  shall  look  to  the intended  use  set  forth  in  the  request  for  records.    Where  a  requester's  description  of  the use is insufficient to make a determination, the secretary may  seek additional clarification before categorizing the request.
- (1) Commercial use. The fees for search, duplication, and review apply when records are requested for commercial use.
- (2) Educational,  research,  or  media  use. The fees for duplication apply when records are not sought for commercial use, and the requester  is  a  representative  of  the  news media or an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly  or  scientific  research.    The  first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.
- (3) All other uses. For all other requests, the  fees  for  document  search  and  duplication  apply.    The  first  two  hours  of  search time and the first 100 pages of duplication, however, will be provided free.
- (d) Nonproductive  search. Fees  for  search and review may be charged even if no responsive documents are located or if the request is denied.
- (e) Aggregated  requests. A  requester  may not  file  multiple  requests  at  the  same  time, solely  in  order  to  avoid  payment  of  fees.    If the  secretary  reasonably  believes  that  a  requester is separating a request into a series of requests  for  the  purpose  of  evading  the  assessment of fees, the secretary may aggregate any such requests and charge accordingly.  It is  considered  reasonable  for  the  secretary  to presume  that  multiple  requests  of  this  type made within a 30-day period have been made to avoid fees.
- (f) Waiver or reduction of fees. A request

for a waiver or reduction of the fees, and the justification  for  the  waiver,  shall  be  included with  the  request  for  records  to  which  it  pertains.    If  a  waiver  is  requested  and  the  requester has not indicated in writing an agreement to pay the applicable fees if the waiver request is denied, the time for response to the request for documents, as set forth in section 271.6(d), shall not begin until a determination has been made on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees.

- (1) Standards  for  determining  waiver  or reduction. The secretary shall grant a waiver  or  reduction  of  fees  where  it  is  determined  both  that  disclosure  of  the  information is in the public interest because it is likely  to  contribute  significantly  to  public understanding of the operation or activities of  the  government,  and  that  the  disclosure of information is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.  In making this determination, the following factors shall be considered:
- (i) whether  the  subject  of  the  records concerns  the  operations  or  activities  of the government;
- (ii) whether disclosure of the information is likely to contribute significantly to  public  understanding  of  government operations or activities;
- (iii) whether the requester has the intention  and  ability  to  disseminate  the  information to the public;
- (iv) whether  the  information  is  already in the public domain;
- (v) whether  the  requester  has  a  commercial  interest  that  would  be  furthered by the disclosure; and, if so,
- (vi) whether the magnitude of the identified  commercial  interest  of  the  requester is  sufficiently  large,  in  comparison  with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.
- (2) Contents of request for waiver. A request for a waiver or reduction of fees shall include-
- (i) a clear statement of the requester's interest in the documents;

J

Authorized for Public Release

Class III FOMC - Internal (FR)

ยง 271.9

- (ii) the use proposed for the documents and whether the requester will derive income or other benefit for such use; (iii) a  statement  of  how  the  public  will benefit from such use and from the Committee's release of the documents; (iv) a description of the method by which the information will be disseminated to the public; and (v) if specialized use of the information is  contemplated,  a  statement  of  the  requester's  qualifications  that  are  relevant to that use.
- (3) Burden of proof. The burden shall be on  the  requester  to  present  evidence  or  information  in  support  of  a  request  for  a waiver or reduction of fees.
- (4) Determination by secretary. The secretary shall make a determination on the request for a waiver or reduction of fees and shall  notify  the  requester  accordingly.    A denial may be appealed to the Committee in accordance with section 271.6(h).
- (g) Employee requests. In  connection  with any request by an employee, former employee,  or  applicant  for  employment,  for  records for  use  in  prosecuting  a  grievance  or  complaint  of  discrimination  against  the  Committee, fees shall be  waived  where  the  total charges  (including  charges  for information provided  under  the  Privacy  Act  of  1974  (5 USC 552a)) are $50 or less; but the secretary may waive fees in excess of that amount.
- (h) Special  services. The  secretary  may agree  to  provide,  and  set  fees  to  recover  the costs  of,  special  services  not  covered  by  the

Freedom of Information Act, such as certifying  records  or  information  and  sending  records by special methods such as express mail or overnight delivery.

FOMC Policy on External Communications of Committee Participantsยน

Adopted effective June 22, 2011; as amended effective January 27, 2015

PREAMBLE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

The  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  (the 'Committee') is committed to providing clear and timely information to the public about the Committee's monetary policy actions and the rationale for those decisions.  Indeed, considerable  evidence  indicates  that  central  bank transparency increases the effectiveness of monetary  policy  and  enables  households  and businesses to make better-informed decisions.

Two-way communication with the public is a  crucial  element  in  the  Committee's  monetary  policy  process.    Committee  participants have  regular  contacts  with  members  of  the public as part of the process of gathering the information  the  Committee  needs  to  understand  current  economic  and  financial  conditions.    In  addition,  the  Committee's  public accountability is strengthened by open discussion  of  Committee  participants'  views  about the  economic  outlook  as  well  as  their  judgments about the appropriate  course of  monetary policy.

Therefore,  to  reinforce  the  public's  confidence in the transparency and integrity of the monetary  policy  process,  the  Committee  has established the following principles to govern Committee  participants'  contacts  with  members  of  the  public.    The  Committee  itself maintains  responsibility  for  ensuring  that  all Committee participants-that is, the members of  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  and  the  presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks-abide by these principles. 2

- 1. Committee participants will endeavor to enhance the public's understanding of  monetary  policy.    They  are  free  to  explain  their individual views but are expected to do so in a spirit of collegiality and to refrain from characterizing  the  views  of  other  individuals  on the Committee.  In explaining the rationale for announced  Committee  decisions,  participants will draw on Committee communications and the  Chairman's  press  conference  remarks  as appropriate.
- 2. To foster the ongoing frank exchange of views at Committee meetings, Committee participants will refrain from publicly characterizing  such  discussions  beyond  what  has been  published  in  the  minutes  of  each  Committee meeting.
- 3. To protect the independence of the Committee's  decision-making  process  from short-term political pressures, participants will strive  to  avoid  any  appearance  of  political partisanship  and  will  be  prudent  in  selecting venues for their speaking engagements.
- 4. Committee participants will carefully safeguard  all  confidential  information.     No 3 confidential  FOMC  information  may  be  released except pursuant to Committee instructions  or  with  written  authorization  from  the Chairman and prompt notification to the Committee.
- 5. To  the  fullest  extent  possible,  Committee  participants  will  refrain  from  describing their personal views about monetary policy in

responsibility for maintaining the integrity, dignity, and reputation of the System' and 'should scrupulously avoid conduct that might in any way tend to embarrass the System or impair the effectiveness of its operations.'  The policy in this document focuses specifically on external communications and is binding on all Committee participants.

- 3 The Committee's regulations concerning the designation and handling of confidential FOMC information are set forth in a separate document,
- 'Program for Security of FOMC Information,' available at www federalreserve.gov/monetarypoli cy/files/FOMC_InformationSecurityProgram.pdf.

any meeting or conversation with any individual,  firm,  or  organization  who  could  profit financially  from  acquiring  that  information unless  those  views  have  already  been  expressed in their public communications.

- 6. Committee  participants will strive to ensure that their contacts with members of the public do not provide any profit-making person  or  organization  with  a  prestige  advantage over its competitors.  They will consider this principle carefully and rigorously in scheduling  meetings  with  anyone  who  might benefit  financially  from  apparently  exclusive contacts with Federal Reserve officials and in considering  invitations  to  speak  at  meetings that are sponsored by profit-making organizations  or  that  are  closed  to  the  public  and  the media.
- 7. To  facilitate the effectiveness of the Committee's policy deliberations and the clarity  of  its  communications,  participants  will observe a blackout period on monetary policy communications in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Committee meeting.  The blackout period will begin at midnight Eastern Time seven days before the beginning of the meeting-for example, if the Committee meeting  is  scheduled  to  begin  on  a  Tuesday, the  blackout  period  will  begin  at  the  start  of the preceding Tuesday-and will end at midnight  Eastern  Time  on  the  next  day  after  the meeting-  for  example,  if the Committee meeting  ends  on  a  Wednesday,  the  blackout period will end at the end of Thursday.  During  each  blackout  period,  participants  refrain from expressing their views about macroeconomic  developments  or  monetary  policy  issues in meetings or conversations with members of the public.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

To  assist  Committee  participants  in  understanding  the  application  of  these  principles, the Committee has considered how the principles  should  be  applied  to  some  common  requests  for  public  contact.    For  example,  the following  contacts  would  generally  be  con- sistent with the Committee's policy on external communications, as long as the participant carefully adheres to all of the principles listed above during the contact itself:

- 1. A speech on  a  monetary  policy  topic at a widely-attended event with press in attendance, where the event is organized by a non-profit entity and does not involve fundraising.  Such a speech might be given at an academic  institution, a conference sponsored  by  a  non-profit  organization,  or  a meeting sponsored by a civic or trade association (such as a chamber of commerce or a state or national bankers' association).
- 2. An interview with the press regarding the  participant's  personal  views  on  monetary policy issues.
- 3. A  private  meeting  with  members  of the public-such  as  bankers,  community representatives,  industry  representatives,  or labor representatives-to collect information about the economy without disseminating  any  information  about  the  participant's  personal  views  on  monetary  policy unless  those  views  have  already  been  expressed in their public communications. Whenever  practical,  a  public  information officer or other Federal Reserve staff should be present at such a meeting.

In  contrast,  the  following  contacts  would not  be  consistent  with  the  principles  set  out above:

- 1. Disclosure in any setting of confidential FOMC information.
- 2. Disclosure  or  characterization  in  any setting of the views that others expressed at a Committee meeting.
- 3. A  prediction  about  Committee  action in advance of the Committee announcement of its decision.
- 4. A  private  meeting  with  selected  clients of a regulated entity or financial firm to discuss monetary policy.
- Of  course,  the  foregoing  examples  are  not intended  to  serve  as  an  exhaustive  list,  and hence good judgment will be essential in applying these principles.

FOMC Policy on External Communications of Federal Reserve System Staff ยน

Adopted effective June 22, 2011; as amended effective January 27, 2015

PREAMBLE

In  the  course  of  making  monetary  policy decisions, the Federal Open Market Committee (the 'Committee') makes extensive use of background materials prepared by the staff of the  Federal  Reserve  System,  and  senior  staff give regular briefings at Committee meetings. In  addition,  staff  are  directly  involved  in  the implementation  and communication  of  the Committee's policy decisions.

Federal Reserve System staff have contacts with members of the public in the process of gathering information about current economic and  financial  conditions.    In  addition,  staff synthesize that information using a variety of analytical  methods  and  statistical  tools,  and the continual refinement of these methods and tools is facilitated by  ongoing  interactions with  academic  researchers,  staff  at  foreign central banks, and other outside analysts.  Finally,  staff  play  a  significant  role  in  helping the  public  understand  the  rationale  for  Committee  decisions.    The  principles  described below recognize the importance of these activities  for  monetary  policymaking  and  are  not intended  to  inhibit  the  staff  from  conducting or  broadly  disseminating  economic  research or  from  carrying  out  other  appropriate  communications with members of the public.

To reinforce the public's confidence in the transparency  and  integrity  of  the  monetary policy process, the Committee has established the  following  principles  to  govern  the  public contacts of Federal Reserve System staff who have access to confidential FOMC  information.   The Committee maintains responsi2 bility  for  ensuring  that  all  System  staff  with such access abide by these principles.  Specif-

ically,  the  president  of  each  Federal  Reserve Bank is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality  of  FOMC  information  at  that  Federal Reserve Bank and for the conduct and discretion of that Federal Reserve Bank's staff with regard to the use of that information, and the Chairman fulfills this role for Board staff.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

- 1. Federal  Reserve  staff  play  a  significant role in enhancing public understanding of the Committee's  actions,  thereby  promoting  the effectiveness of monetary policy.  In all communications with the public  regarding  monetary policy issues, members of the staff should refrain  from  publicly  expressing  their  own personal opinions or predictions regarding prospective  monetary  policy  decisions.    In explaining  the  rationale  for  announced  Committee  decisions,  staff  should  draw  on  Committee communications, the Chairman's press conference remarks, and other published materials  as  appropriate.    Whenever  staff  make public  comments  on  monetary  policy,  they should  clearly  indicate  that  those  comments are solely their own responsibility and should not  be  interpreted  as  necessarily  representing the views of the Committee, its principals, or any  other  person  associated  with  the  Federal Reserve System.
- 2. To foster the ongoing frank exchange of views  at  Committee  meetings,  staff  will  refrain  from  characterizing  such  discussionsapart  from  what  has  been  published  in  the minutes  of  each  Committee  meeting-in  any contact with an individual, firm, or organization outside of the Federal Reserve System.
- 3. To protect the independence of the Committee's  decision-making  process  from short-term political pressures, members of the staff of the Board and Federal Reserve Banks will  follow  their  respective  codes  of  conduct regarding partisan political activities and strive  to  avoid  any  appearance  of  political partisanship when  discussing economic  or policy issues with the public.

J

- 4. Staff  will  carefully  safeguard  all  confidential FOMC information. 3 No confidential information  may  be  released  except  pursuant to Committee instructions or with written authorization  from  the  Chairman  and  prompt notification to the Committee.
- 5. Unless  the  information  has  been  made widely  available  to  the  public,  Federal  Reserve staff members will refrain from disseminating  information  outside  the  Federal  Reserve System, such as information about economic  and  financial  conditions  or  about  the methods  and  tools  that  are  currently  being used  to  assess  those  conditions,  that  might allow  an  individual,  firm,  or  organization  to profit financially.
- 6. Staff will strive to ensure that their contacts  with  members of the public do not provide any profit-making person, firm, or organization with  a prestige advantage  over  its competitors.  They will consider this principle carefully and rigorously in considering invitations to speak at meetings sponsored by profitmaking organizations and in scheduling meetings with anyone who might benefit financially from  apparently-exclusive  contacts  with Federal Reserve staff.
- 7. To  facilitate the effectiveness of the Committee's policy deliberations and the clarity  of  its  communications,  staff  will  observe the blackout period on monetary policy communications in conjunction with each regularly scheduled Committee meeting.  The blackout  period  will  begin  at  midnight  Eastern Time seven days before the beginning of the meeting-for example, if the Committee meeting  is  scheduled  to  begin  on  a  Tuesday, the  blackout  period  will  begin  at  the  start  of the preceding Tuesday-and will end at midnight  Eastern  Time  on  the  next  day  after  the meeting-for example, if the Committee

- meeting  ends  on  a  Wednesday,  the  blackout period will end at the end of Thursday.  During  each  blackout  period,  staff  will  refrain from expressing their views or providing analysis to members of the public about macroeconomic or financial developments or about  current  or  prospective  monetary  policy issues unless that information has already been cleared for publication and made widely available  to  the  public  prior  to  the  blackout period.    Staff  will  be  able  to  carry  out  their responsibilities for public dissemination  of published  Federal  Reserve  data  and  System surveys and reports, including answering technical questions specific to a data release. 8.    In  carrying  out  their  official  responsibilities,  Federal  Reserve  staff  engage  in  certain closely-held communications with other parts of  the  U.S.  government,  with  foreign  central banks and governments, and with international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements.  In communicating with individuals from  such  institutions,  staff  may  exchange views on current economic and financial conditions  or  discuss  policy-related  matters  of interest to the Federal Reserve, including nonpublic information, and such communications are  not  subject  to  the  blackout  period  described above.  In all such interactions, however, no confidential FOMC information may be  released except  pursuant  to  Committee instructions or with written authorization from the  Chairman  and  prompt  notification  to  the Committee.

PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

To  assist  Federal  Reserve  System  staff  in understanding the application of these principles,  the  Committee  has  considered  how  the principles should be applied to some common requests for public contact.  For example, the following  contacts  would  generally  be  consistent with the Committee's policy on external communications, as long as the staff member carefully adheres to all of the principles listed above during the contact itself:

J

- 1. A  presentation  at  a  widely-attended meeting, where the event is organized by a non-profit entity and does not involve fundraising.  Such a meeting might be sponsored by  an  academic  institution,  non-profit  organization, or civic or trade association (such as a chamber of commerce or a state or national bankers' association).
- 2. A  private  meeting  with  members  of the public-such  as  bankers,  community representatives,  industry  representatives,  or labor representatives-to collect information  about  current  economic  and  financial  conditions,  without  disseminating  any information  that  is  not  widely  available  to the public.  Whenever practical, at least two Federal  Reserve  staff  should  be  present  at such a meeting.
- 3. A working paper, presentation, or publication  that  evaluates  the  effectiveness of monetary policy actions taken in the past.
- 4. A discussion between Federal Reserve and  Treasury  staff  (including  during  the blackout period) regarding recent economic and  financial developments  in  a  foreign economy,  how  to  interpret  them,  and  their implications for future developments.

In  contrast,  the  following  contacts  would not be  consistent  with  the  principles  set  out above:

- 1. Disclosure  of  confidential  FOMC  information.
- 2. Disclosure  or  characterization  of  the views expressed at a Committee meeting.
- 3. Disclosure of a Committee  participant's  personal  views  on  monetary  policy that have not previously been communicated to the public.
- 4. Public communications  in  which  a Federal Reserve  staff member  expresses personal  opinions  about  prospective  monetary policy decisions.
- 5. A prediction to members of the public about  Committee  action  prior  to  the  Committee's announcement of such decisions.
- 6. A  private  meeting  with  selected  clients of a regulated entity or financial firm to discuss monetary policy.

Of  course,  the  foregoing  examples  are  not intended  to  serve  as  an  exhaustive  list,  and hence good judgment will be essential in applying these principles.  Moreover, whenever staff  are  unsure  about  whether  specific  contacts  with  the  public  would  be  appropriate, they  should  consult  in  advance  with  the  appropriate staff person or with the head of their respective  institution-namely,  the  Chairman in the case of staff at the Board of Governors, and the president in the case of staff at a Federal Reserve Bank.

Class III FOMC - Internal (FR)

Federal Open Market Committee-Statements of Policy 12 CFR 281; as amended effective February 16, 2005

SECTION  281.1-Policy  Regarding  the Government in the Sunshine Act i

On September 13, 1976, there was enacted into law the Government in the Sunshine Act, Pub. L. No. 94-409, 90 Stat. 1241 ('Sunshine Act'), established for the purpose of providing the  public  with  the  'fullest  practicable  information  regarding  the  decision-making  processes of the Federal Governmentโฆwhile protecting  the  rights  of  individuals  and  the ability of the Government to carry out its responsibilities.' ii The  Sunshine  Act  applies only to those federal agencies that are defined in section 552(e) of title 5 of the United States Code  and  'headed  by  a  collegial  body  composed  of  two  or  more  individual  members,  a majority of whom are appointed to such position by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, and any subdivision thereof authorized to act on behalf of the agency.' iii

The Federal Open Market Committee ('FOMC') is a separate and independent statutory  body  within  the  Federal  Reserve  System. In no respect is it an agent or 'subdivision' of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve  System  ('Board  of  Governors').    It was originally established by the Banking Act of 1933 and restructured in its present form by the Banking Act of 1935 and subsequent legislation in 1942 (generally see 12 USC 263(a)).    The  FOMC's  membership  is  composed of the seven members of the Board of Governors and five representatives of the Federal Reserve Banks who are selected annually in accordance with the procedures set forth in section  12A  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Act,  12 USC 263(a).  Members of the Board of Governors  serve  in  an  ex  officio  capacity  on  the FOMC  by  reason  of  their  appointment  as members of the Board of Governors, not as a result  of  an  appointment  'to  such  position' (the  FOMC)  by  the  President.    Representatives  of  the  Federal  Reserve  Banks  serve  on the  FOMC not as a result of  an  appointment 'to such position' by the President, but rather by  virtue  of  their  positions  with  the  Federal Reserve Banks and their selection pursuant to section 12A of the Federal Reserve Act.  It is clear  therefore  that  the  FOMC  does  not  fall within the scope of an 'agency' or 'subdivision' as defined in the Sunshine Act and consequently  is  not  subject  to  the  provisions  of that act.

As  explained  below,  the  act  would  not  require the FOMC to hold its meetings in open session  even  if  the  FOMC  were  covered  by the act. However,  despite  the  conclusion reached that the Sunshine Act does not apply to the FOMC, the FOMC has determined that its procedures and timing of public disclosure already are conducted in accordance with the spirit  of  the  Sunshine  Act,  as  that  act  would apply to deliberations of the nature engaged in by the FOMC.

In the foregoing regard, the FOMC has noted that  while  the  act  calls  generally  for  open meetings  of  multi-member  federal  agencies, 10 specific exemptions from the open meeting requirement are provided to assure the ability of the government to carry out its responsibilities.    Among the exemptions provided is that which authorizes any agency operating under the act to conduct closed meetings where the subject of a meeting involves information 'the premature disclosure of which would-in the case of an agency which regulates currencies, securities,  commodities,  or  financial  institutions, be likely to lead to significant financial speculation  in  currencies,  securities,  or  commodities.' iv

As  to  meetings  closed  under  such  exemption, the act requires the maintenance of either a  transcript,  electronic  recording  or  minutes and sets forth specified, detailed requirements as to the contents and timing of disclosure of certain  portions  or  all  of  such  minutes.    The act permits the withholding from the public of the minutes where disclosure would be likely to produce adverse consequences of the nature described in the relevant exemptions.

The FOMC has reviewed the agenda of its monthly meetings for the past three years and has  determined  that  all  such  meetings  could have  been  closed  pursuant  to  the  exemption dealing  with  financial  speculation  or  other exemptions set forth in the Sunshine Act.  The

ยง 281.1

FOMC  has  further  determined  that  virtually all  of  its  substantive  deliberations could have been  preserved  pursuant  to  the  act's  minutes requirements and that such minutes could similarly  have  been  protected  against  premature disclosure under the provisions of the act.

The FOMC's deliberations are currently reported by means of a document entitled 'Record  of  Policy  Actions'  which  is  released  to the public approximately one month after the meeting  to  which  it  relates.    The  Record  of Policy Actions complies with the act's minutes requirements in that it contains a full and  accurate  report  of  all  matters  of  policy discussed  and  views  presented,  clearly  sets forth  all  policy  actions  taken  by  the  FOMC and  the  reasons  therefore,  and  includes  the votes  by  individual  members  on  each  policy action.  The timing of release of the Record of Policy  Actions  is  fully  consistent  with  the act's provisions  assuring  against  premature release of any item of discussion in an agency's  minutes  that  contains  information  of  a sensitive financial nature.  In fact, by releasing the  comprehensive  Record  of  Policy  Actions to the public approximately a month after each meeting,  the  FOMC  exceeds  the  publication requirements  that  would  be  mandated  by  the letter of the Sunshine Act.

Recognizing the congressional purpose underlying  the  enactment  of  the  Sunshine  Act, the FOMC has determined to continue its current practice and timing of public disclosures in the conviction that its operations thus conducted are consistent with the intent and spirit of the Sunshine Act.

Policy Normalization Principles and Plans As adopted effective September 16, 2014

During its recent meetings, the Federal Open  Market  Committee  (FOMC)  discussed ways to normalize the stance of monetary policy and the Federal Reserve's securities holdings.    The  discussions  were  part  of  prudent planning and do not imply that normalization will  necessarily  begin  soon.    The  Committee continues to judge that many of the normalization  principles  that  it  adopted  in  June  2011 remain  applicable.    However,  in  light  of  the changes in the System Open Market Account (SOMA)  portfolio  since  2011  and  enhancements  in  the  tools  the  Committee  will  have available to implement policy during normalization, the Committee  has  concluded  that some  aspects  of  the  eventual  normalization process will likely differ from those specified earlier.  The Committee also has agreed that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its normalization plans.  All FOMC participants but one agreed on the following key elements of the approach they  intend  to  implement  when  it  becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy:

- ยท The Committee  will determine the timing  and  pace  of  policy  normalizationmeaning steps to raise the federal funds rate and  other  short-term  interest  rates  to  more normal levels and to reduce the Federal Reserve's  securities  holdings-so  as  to  promote  its statutory mandate  of  maximum employment and price stability.
- โ When economic conditions and  the economic  outlook  warrant  a  less  accommodative monetary policy, the Committee will  raise  its  target  range  for  the  federal funds rate.
- โ During  normalization,  the  Federal Reserve intends to move the federal funds rate into the target range set by the Committee  primarily  by  adjusting  the  interest

rate it pays on excess reserve balances.

- โ During  normalization,  the  Federal Reserve  intends  to  use  an  overnight  reverse  repurchase  agreement  facility  and other  supplementary  tools  as  needed  to help  control  the  federal  funds  rate.    The Committee will use an overnight  reverse repurchase agreement facility only to the extent  necessary  and  will  phase  it  out when it is no longer needed to help control the federal funds rate.
- ยท The  Committee  intends  to  reduce  the Federal  Reserve's  securities  holdings  in  a gradual and predictable manner primarily by ceasing  to  reinvest  repayments  of  principal on securities held in the SOMA.
- โ The Committee expects to cease or ter it begins increasing the target range for
- commence phasing out reinvestments  afthe federal funds rate; the timing will depend on how economic and financial conditions and the economic outlook evolve. โ The  Committee  currently  does  not anticipate selling agency mortgagebacked securities as part of the normalization process, although limited sales might be  warranted  in  the  longer  run  to  reduce or  eliminate  residual  holdings.    The  timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public in advance.
- ยท The Committee intends that the Federal  Reserve  will,  in  the  longer  run,  hold  no more securities than necessary to implement monetary policy efficiently and effectively, and that it will hold primarily Treasury securities,  thereby  minimizing  the  effect  of Federal  Reserve  holdings  on  the  allocation of credit across sectors of the economy.
- ยท The  Committee  is  prepared  to  adjust the details of its approach to policy normalization  in  light  of  economic  and  financial developments.

Program for Security of FOMC Information

As amended effective January 27, 201526, 2016

I. INTRODUCTION.

The Program for Security of FOMC Information ('the Program') describes what confidential FOMC information is, how it is classified,  who  has  access  to  it,  how  it  should  be handled, and who is responsible for ensuring that  it  is  protected.    Everyone  with  access  to confidential FOMC information is required to review  and  abide  by  the  rules  described  below.

These security  procedures  are  not  intended to preclude  discussions  within  the  Federal Reserve  of  important  FOMC-related  issues, including  the  general  reasons  for  the  Federal Open Market Committee's (the 'Committee') decisions.  Such discussions may be conducted  for research  purposes  or  for preparing briefings and other information for Committee members,  but  care  should  be  taken  that  all discussion  participants  have  the  appropriate level  of  authorization  if  confidential  information is being shared.

II. DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL FOMC INFORMATION.

Confidential  FOMC  information  includes all  privileged information that comes into the possession  of  the  governorsBoard  members, Federal  Reserve  Bank  presidents,  or  Federal Reserve  System  staff  in  the  performance  of their duties for, or pursuant to the direction of, the Committee.  Such information covers, but is  not  limited  to,  expressions  of  policy  views at Committee  meetings,  reasons for those views, votes of the Committee, and staff forecasts.  The information that must be kept confidential may be in any form.  It includes not only paper  documents,  but  also  electronic messages  and  files,  recordings,  notes,  oral briefings, and discussions relating to confidential FOMC matters.

III. CLASSIFICATION OF CONFIDENTIAL FOMC INFORMATION.

There  are  three  security  classifications  for confidential  FOMC  information.    The  first two  classifications-'Class  I  FOMC -Restricted Controlled (FR)' and 'Class II FOMC -Restricted  (FR)'-apply  to  very  sensitive FOMC  information.    Class  I  FOMC  information must be handled at least as securely as material classified by  the Federal  Reserve Board  as  'Restricted  Controlled  (FR).'    Access to Class II information is somewhat less restrictive  than  access  to  Class  I.    It  must  be treated at least as securely as material classified  by  the  Federal  Reserve  Board  as  'Restricted  (FR).'    The  classification  'Class  III FOMC -Internal (FR)' applies to less sensitive information that still requires confidential treatment.    It  must  be  handled  at  least  as  securely  as  material  classified  by  the  Federal Reserve Board as 'Internal (FR).'  (See Section VI below for handling requirements.)

Information in these classifications must be kept confidential until it is released to the public by the Chairman or by the Committee secretary pursuant to Committee instructions.  All questions related to the classification, distribution,  or  handling  of  documents  should  be  directed to the FOMC Secretariat.

A. 'Class  I  FOMC  -  Restricted  Controlled (FR).'

This classification is generally applied to information  that  includes  policymaker  input,  e.g.,  information  related  to  monetary policy decisions at meetings, nonpublic views expressed by policymakers on likely future policy, and identification of meeting participants  who  express  particular  views. Class I information includes, but is not limited to:

- 1. Monetary Policy: Strategies and Alternatives ('Tealbook, Book B').
- 2. Minutes of Committee meetings, including drafts.
- 3. Committee  meeting  recordings  and transcripts.
- 4. Portions of Committee meeting participants'  prepared  remarks  that  include material from Class I documents such as Tealbook,  Book  B;  and  other  monetary policy alternatives under consideration.

- 5. Submissions  by,  or  on  behalf  of, policymakers  in  the  Summary  of  Eco-
- nomic Projections process. 6. Special memoranda or reports
- deemed  particularly  sensitive,  including materials  that  might  otherwise  carry  a Class  II  designation  (e.g.,  a  report  from the  manager  containing  information  on sensitive foreign exchange operations).

B. 'Class II FOMC -Restricted (FR).'

This classification is generally applied to Board staff forecasts prepared for the Committee  and  to  information  about  open market operations.  Class II information includes, but is not limited to:

- 1. Economic and Financial Conditions: Current Situation and Outlook ('Tealbook,  Book  A'),  and  Board  staff projections or assumptions relating to interest rates.
- 2. Reports of the manager on domestic and foreign open market operations.
- 3. Information on Desk operations posted  on  confidential  portions  of  the 'MarketSource'  website  of  the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
- 4. Other materials on economic and financial developments (including foreign), special memoranda, tables, and charts less sensitive  than  those  in  Class  I,  including briefing  materials  containing  Class  II  information that are produced and circulated within the Board or individual Federal Reserve Banks.

C. 'Class III FOMC - Internal (FR).'

This classification is generally applied to less-sensitive  background  information  prepared by Board staff to support policy discussions.    Class  III  information  includes, but is not limited to:

- 1. Tealbook Data Sheets.
- 2. Committee meeting agendas.
- D. Security  Classification  Downgrading of FOMC Information.

FOMC information loses its security classification when the Committee releases it to the  public.    Class  II  information  is  downgraded to Class III six months after the relevant  Committee  meeting.    Additionally,

Tealbook, Book B; and monetary policy alternatives documents are downgraded from Class I to Class II six months after the relevant Committee meeting, and from Class II to Class III one year after the relevant meeting.

IV. ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL FOMC INFORMATION  WITHIN  THE  FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.

Staff  access  to  confidential  FOMC  information, which includes Class I, Class II, and Class III information, requires prior authorization. Before  gaining  access  and  annually thereafter,  all  Federal  Reserve  System  personsstaff  members,  including  office  support staff, must receive, review, and agree to abide by  the  rules  for  handling  confidential  information that are referred to in this document.

At  each  Federal  Reserve  Bank,  the  president,  or  the  research  director  on  the  president's  behalf,  is  responsible  for  designating those individuals persons to be given access to each class of information.  At the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute  open  market  transactions  (the  'Selected Bank'),  the  manager  of  the  System  Open Market  Account  ('SOMA')  may  also  designate  staff  on  behalf  of  the  president.    At  the Board,  that  responsibility  is  assumed  by  the Chairman  or  the  Committee  secretary  on  the Chairman's  behalfChairman's  designees  and by Board members for their assistants.  Access at the Selected Bank and the Board of Governors is limited on a strict 'need-to-know' basis. Access  at  the  other  Federal  Reserve Banks  is  also  limited  on  a  strict  'need-toknow'  basis  and  is  subject  to  the  numerical limits  noted below.  In complying with these limits,  Federal  Reserve  Banks  may  designate different individuals persons to have access to different  documents.    For  example,  one  slot could be filled by designating an international economist  as  having  access  to all special memoranda  relating  to  foreign  currency  operations, and a domestic economist as having access to other Class I and Class II memoranda.    At  each  institution,  access  to  Class  I,

Class  II,  and  Class  III  information  should  be reviewed carefully at least once every year.

- A. Access to 'Class I FOMC -Restricted Controlled  (FR)'  materials  at  Federal  Reserve  Banks  other  than  the  Selected  Bank (and  the  Federal  Reserve  Bank  that  serves as  the  backup  site  for  Open  open  Market market  Operationsoperations)  is  restricted to the president and first vice president and to  seven  other  Federal  Reserve  Bank  personnel as well as a limited number of office support staff.
- B. Access to 'Class II FOMC - Restricted (FR)' materials at Federal Reserve Banks other than the Selected Bank (and the Federal  Reserve  Bank  that  serves  as  the backup  site  for  Open  open  Market  market Operationsoperations)  is  restricted  to  the president  and  first  vice  president  and  to eleven other Federal Reserve Bank personnel  as  well  as  a  limited  number  of  office support staff.
- C. Access to 'Class III FOMC - Internal (FR)' information is limited on a 'need-toknow' basis, but no specific limit is set on the number of individuals persons who may have access to such information at each location.
- D. The lists  of  all  persons,  including  office  support  staff,  who  are  authorized  to have access to Class I, Class II, or Class III information  are  to  be  generated  and  transmitted  to  the  FOMC  Secretariat  annually, after  the  first  regularly  scheduled  Committee meeting  of the year (at which  any changes to the Program would typically be considered).    Over  the  course  of  the  year, changes  resulting  from  new  staff  assignments should also be transmitted.  Records of  individuals'  agreements  to  abide  by  the rules  described  in  the  Program  should  be maintained at each institution.  Such records would  include individuals' signatures or electronic equivalent.
- E. To facilitate the preparation of special analyses  and  briefings  within  the  System, eligible staff may be granted ad-hoc access to  Class  I  and  Class  II  information  on  a

strict  'need-to-know'  basis  for  a  specific and limited period of time.  Such ad-hoc access  may  be  granted  by  the  president  of  a Federal Reserve Bank or a research director on  his/her  behalf  or  by  the  secretary  for Board  staff.    Staff  granted  ad-hoc  access must review and agree to abide by the rules described  in  the  Program  before  receiving access.    The  FOMC  Secretariat  should  be advised  that  such  access  has  been  given, and records of the access and related agreement  should  be  maintained  at  each Federal Reserve Bank.

- F. The  Chairman  may  make  ad-hoc  exceptions to this section that are either more or  less  restrictive  for  particular  documents being circulated or for other confidential information.
- G. In  order  to  provide  secure  and  rapid document delivery,  access  to  selected  confidential  FOMC  information  is  given  electronically through the Secure Document System  ('SDS').    SDS  access  is  restricted at  each  Federal  Reserve  Bank  to  the  president and first vice president and up to seven other Federal Reserve Bank personnel.  The Desk  at  the  Selected  Bank  has  access  for four additional users at that Federal Reserve Bank.    The  president  of  each  Federal  Reserve Bank may delegate to the research director the responsibility for selecting users, monitoring  compliance  with  SDS  guidelines,  and  communicating  with  the  FOMC Secretariat when changes in usage or other issues occur.  Access to SDS for Board staff is  authorized  by  the  secretary  on  behalf  of the  Chairmana  designee  of  the  Chairman and monitored by the FOMC Secretariat.
- H. Eligibility  for  access  to  confidential FOMC information for non-US citizens  is, in  all  cases  (including  under  IV.E),  governed by 12 CFR 268.205 and by this Program .    ( A summary of this rule,  as  it  pertains to FOMC information, is appended to this document as 'Attachment 1.')  Eligibility is determined based on a number of factors  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  country of origin, immigration status, length of residency, and employment  history) and in

many cases may require a background check.

I. Individuals  Persons  who  are  not  employees may not be given confidential FOMC  information  unless  all  the  requirements of this section IV, including citizenship  requirements,  are  met  and  a  designee of  the  Chairmanthe  secretary  gives  prior approval.

V. ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL FOMC INFORMATION OUTSIDE THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM.

Access to classified FOMC  information outside the Federal Reserve System is limited as follows:

- A. Confidential  FOMC  documents  generally are made available to the public after a lag of about five years.  Such availability is subject to staff review (including consultation with the Chairman or the Committee where  appropriate)  for  the  purpose  of  redacting  any  materials  that  are  still  deemed to  be  sensitive  after  five  years.    For  example,  confidential information obtained from or  about  particular  individuals  persons  or businesses, foreign governments and central banks,  and  international  institutions  that  is deemed sensitive after the five-year lag will be protected.  In addition, national security classified information that may be contained in  FOMC  documents  remains  confidential until it is declassified.  The principal objectives  of  the  Committee's  policy  of  withholding sensitive information after the fiveyear  lag  are  to  preserve  the  Committee's ability to collect needed information, to allow its representatives to participate in sensitive discussions and report on them to the Committee, to avoid disclosures that would adversely affect U.S. international relations, and  to  comply  with  the  applicable  laws governing the disclosure of confidential information.
- B. Staff  officers  of  the  Committee,  and those  designated  by  the  Chairman,  are  authorized  to  transmit  pertinent  information on  System  foreign  currency  operations  to

appropriate  officials  of  the  Treasury  Department.

- C. The  Chairman  may  make  ad-hoc  exceptions to this section that are either more or  less  restrictive  for  particular  documents or for other confidential information.

VI. HANDLING OF CONFIDENTIAL FOMC MATERIALS.

To assure the necessary confidentiality, it is important  that  special  care  be  exercised  in minimum requirements for handling confidential FOMC and Federal Reserve information are described in  the  Federal  Reserve  Board's  'Information tionsGuide'  document  (copies  of  summary tachment  2-A'  and  'Attachment  2-B,'  are handling FOMC  materials. The Classification &amp; and Handling Specifica appendices  of  this  document,  labeled  'Atattached for convenience and are also available as pages 25 27 34-36 at: (spweb frb.gov/sites/IT/Content/Pages/FISM A/documents/Information%20Classification% 20and%20Handling%20Standard.pdfspweb.fr b.gov/sites/IT/Content/Pages/FISMA/docume nts/Appendix J_Information Classification and Handling Standard.pdf).  As noted in Section III above, confidential FOMC  information must be treated at least as securely as information in the corresponding Federal Reserve Board  category.    The  following  requirements are highlighted here:

- A. In addition to ensuring that the materials  themselves  are  made  available  only  to staff members who have been given access to them, the information they contain should be discussed with such persons only.
- B. Persons who no longer have access to confidential FOMC  information,  whether because of a job change within the Federal Reserve,  employment  outside  the  Federal Reserve, or retirement, must release custody of all confidential materials in their possession  and  remain  subject  to  all  the  prohibitions relating to the disclosure of FOMC information that is still confidential.
- C. The  distribution  to  the  Committee  of all documents, other than the manager's re-

ports, should be handled through the FOMC Secretariat.

- D. In addition, to facilitate the identification  of  Class  I  and  Class  II  FOMC  information,  the  appropriate  coversheet  should be placed on all such documents that are to be circulated.  (The Tealbook is distinctive in  appearance  and  meets  this  requirement without  an  additional  cover  page.)    The most up-to-date coversheets are available on the FOMC Secretariat's web site: (fweb.rsma.frb.gov/dma/fomc/).

VII.  ONGOING RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTAINING CONFIDENTIALITY.

- A. The  president  of  each  Federal  Reserve Bank is responsible for ensuring the confidentiality  of  FOMC  information  at  that  Federal Reserve Bank and for the conduct and discretion of that Federal Reserve Bank's staff with regard  to  the  use  of  the  information.    The Chairman  fulfills  this  role  at  the  Board.    No confidential  FOMC  information  may  be  released except pursuant to Committee instructions  or  with  written  authorization  from  the Chairman and prompt notification to the Committee.
- B. At  each  institution  (Board  or  Federal Reserve Bank), the basic principles and rules of  confidentiality  shall  be  reviewed  at  least once a year with every individual person who has access to confidential FOMC information. In  addition  to  annual  circulation  of  the  Program for  Security  of  FOMC  Information,  institutions  may  implement  further  procedures in support of information security.
- C. If  any Committee participant or Federal Reserve  System  staff  person  becomes  aware of  an  incident  in  which  FOMC  information security  rules  may  have  been  breached,  that individual  person  should  promptly  alert  the FOMC Secretariat.  The secretary and or the Committee's  general  counsel  will,  perform  a review of  the  incident,  with  appropriate  consultation  with  the  Chairman,  and  with  the president of the relevant Federal Reserve Bank  promptly  refer  all material potential breaches to the Board's inspector general and

request an investigation of the incident.  The results of such reviews will be reported to the Chairman,  who  will  inform  the  Committee about  these  matters  and  investigations,  those results  as  appropriate.    In  light  of  review  re sults, the general counsel will determine whether to request the Board's inspector gen eral  to  perform  an  investigation  of  the  inci dent.

- D. If  a  staff  person  at  the  Federal  Reserve Board has been found to be responsible for a breach  of  FOMC  information  security,  the Chairman will determine the consequences for that  individualperson.    If  a  staff  person  at  a Federal  Reserve  Bank  has  been  found  to  be responsible for a breach of FOMC information security, the president of that Federal Reserve Bank will determine the consequences for that individual  person  and  will  inform  the  Chairman  of  that  determination.    If  a  Committee participant  has  been  found  to  be  responsible for  a  breach  of  FOMC  information  security, the Committee will determine the consequences  for  that  participant.    The  Inspector General  will  contact  law  enforcement  agencies  whenever  an  investigation  indicates  that criminal statutes may have been violated.

VIII. COMMITTEE MEETING ATTENDANCE.

- A. Except  by  approval  of  the  Committee, attendance  at  Committee  meetings,  including conference calls, is limited to:
- 1. Governors Board members and Federal  Reserve  Bank  presidents  and  any  other alternate  members.    In  the  absence  of  a president, a substitute Federal Reserve Bank officer  designated  by  the  president  or  the Federal Reserve Bank's board of directors.
- 2. Committee officers.  In the absence of an  associate  economist  from  a  Federal  Reserve Bank, one substitute designated in advance  by  the  president,  with  notice  to  the FOMC Secretariat.
- 3. The  manager  of  the  SOMA.    In  the manager's  absence,  a  substitute  designated by the manager or the president of the Se-

ยง VIII

lected Bank, with notice to the FOMC Secretariat.

- 4. One  adviser  or  one  substitute  designated in advance, with notice to the FOMC Secretariat,  by  each  president  who  is  not currently a member of the Committee.
- 5. One  first  vice  president  of  a  Federal Reserve Bank.  This designee would be in addition to those listed above.  The FOMC Secretariat  maintains  a  rotational  schedule based on nominations from Federal Reserve Banks.
- 6. One assistant to the manager (such as the deputy manager), FOMC Secretariat assistance, and a limited number of additional

members of System staff designated by the Chairman.

- B. Attendance  may  be  limited  further  by the  Chairman  if  a  meeting,  or  portion  of  a meeting, gives rise to unusual sensitivity problems.

Attachment 1

Attachment 1 NON-CITIZEN ELIGIBILITY FOR ACCESS TO FOMC INFORMATION Summary of 12 C.F.R. 268.205

Access  to  all  FOMC  information  is  governed  under  the  Program  for  the  Security  of FOMC Information.  Under these rules, U.S. citizens are eligible for access to all levels of FOMC information (Class I, II, and III).   As 1 explained below, eligibility for access to FOMC  information  for  non-citizens  depends on  the  individual's  person's  job,  citizenship status, residency and other requirements.  The Committee applies the same requirements for access  to  its  information  that  the  Board  applies  when granting access to sensitive information of the Board. 2

As a general matter, a non-citizen is eligible for  access  to  FOMC  information  in  only  one of two ways-as a Protected Individual or as an Eligible  Employee .    Protected  Individuals, defined  below,  are  treated  similarly  to  citizens, and are eligible for all levels of FOMC information. Eligible Employees, defined below,  are  initially  eligible  for  access  based on  their  country  of  origin,  but  may  subsequently be eligible for a higher level of access if they meet certain criteria.  Non-citizens who are  neither  Protected  Individuals  nor  Eligible Employees  may  not  be  granted  access  to FOMC information.

1. Protected Individuals 3

- A 'Protected Individual' is a person who is a lawful permanent resident (that is, holds a  'green  card')  and  who  has  taken  certain steps toward becoming a U.S. citizen. Those steps require that the person either :
- A. Sign  a  declaration  of  intent  to  become a U.S. citizen and file for U.S. citizenship  within  six  months  of  becoming eligible to do so,

or

- A. Be an employee of the Federal Reserve System  (FRS)  since January 1, 2006;
- B. File for citizenship before requesting access to FOMC information; and
- C. Pass a background check acceptable to the Board.
- A green card holder who does not qualify under one of these criteria is not a Protected Individual,  and  therefore  is  eligible  for  access only if he or she is an Eligible Employee (see below).

2. Eligible Employees

To  be  an  Eligible  Employee,  the  noncitizen  must  be  employed  in  a  position  at the Board or Federal Reserve Bank that requires a Ph.D. in economics or finance.  If the non-citizen is employed in such a position, his or her eligibility for access  is granted in two stages.

A. Initial  Eligibility :    Eligibility  in  the initial stage depends on whether the non-

J

Attachment 1

citizen's  country  of  origin  is  on  the  current 'country list,' which is a list of countries  whose citizens may be hired by appropriated  federal  agencies  under  federal legislation (see the current country list below). 4

- i. If the non-citizen is from a country on the country list, he or she is eligible initially for Class II access.
- ii. If  the  non-citizen  is  not  from  a country on the country list, he or she is eligible  initially  only  for  Class  III  access.
- B. Higher  Eligibility : In  the  second stage  of  eligibility,  a  non-citizen  can  become  eligible  for  access  to  information one level higher (i.e., a non-citizen from a country  list  country  can  become  eligible for  Class I  access  and  a  non-citizen  who is not from a country list country can become eligible for Class II access).  A noncitizen is eligible for this next level of access if he or she has:
- i. Resided  in  the  United  States  for six years;
- ii. Been employed with the FRS for two years;

iii. Been  recommended  for  a  higher level of access by his or her division director; and

- iv. Passed  a  background  check  acceptable to the Board.

- C. To exchange, at market prices, in connection  with  a  Treasury  auction,  maturing Eligible  Securities  in  the  SOMA  with  the Treasury,  in  the  case  of  Eligible  Securities that  are  direct  obligations  of  the  United States  or  that  are  fully  guaranteed  as  to principal  and  interest  by  the  United  States; and
- D. To exchange, at market prices, maturing Eligible Securities in the SOMA with an

- A. Such securities lending must be:
- i. At  rates  determined  by  competitive bidding; ii. At  a minimum  lending  fee  consistent with the objectives of the program; iii.

arrangements have no pre-set size limits.  Any new swap arrangements  shall  be  referred  for review  and  approval  to  the  Committee.    All swap  arrangements  are  subject  to  annual  review and approval by the Committee.

- 3. All transactions in foreign currencies undertaken  under  paragraph  1.A  above  shall, unless  otherwise  expressly  authorized  by  the Committee, be at prevailing market rates.  For the purpose of providing an investment return on  System  holdings  of  foreign  currencies  or for the purpose of adjusting interest rates paid or received in connection with swap drawings, transactions with foreign central banks may be undertaken at non-market exchange rates.
- 4. It shall be the normal practice to arrange with foreign central banks for the coordination of  foreign  currency  transactions.    In  making operating  arrangements  with  foreign  central banks  on  System  holdings  of  foreign  currencies, the Selected Bank shall not commit itself to  maintain  any  specific  balance,  unless  authorized by the Committee.  Any agreements or  understandings  concerning  the  administration of the accounts maintained by the Selected Bank with the foreign banks designated by the Board of Governors under section 214.5 of Regulation N shall be referred for review and approval to the Committee.

Such investments may include buying or selling outright obligations of, or fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, a foreign government or agency thereof; buying such securities under agreements for repurchase of such securities; selling such securities under agreements  for  the  resale  of  such  securities; and  holding  various  time  and  other  deposit accounts  at  foreign  institutions.    In  addition, when appropriate in connection with arrangements to provide investment facilities for foreign  currency  holdings,  U.S.  government  securities may be purchased from foreign central banks  under  agreements  for  repurchase  of

such securities within 30 calendar days.

- 6. All  operations  undertaken  pursuant  to the  preceding  paragraphs  shall  be  reported promptly to the Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the 'Subcommittee') and the Committee. The  Subcommittee  consists  of  the  Chairman and  Vice  Chairman  of  the  Committee,  the Vice  Chairman  of  the  Board  of  Governors, and  such  other  member  of  the  Board  as  the Chairman may designate (or in the absence of members  of  the  Board  serving  on  the  Subcommittee,  other  Board  members  designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, the  Vice  Chairman's  alternate).    Meetings  of the  Subcommittee  shall  be  called  at  the  request of any member, or at the request of the manager, System Open Market Account ('manager'),  for  the  purposes  of  reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the manager on other matters relating to the manager's responsibilities.  At the request of any member of the Subcommittee, questions arising from such reviews and consultations  shall  be  referred  for  determination to the Committee.

As amended effective January 27, 2015

In conducting operations pursuant to the authorization and direction of the Federal Open Market  Committee  (the  'Committee')  as  set forth in the Authorization for Foreign Currency  Operations  and  the  Foreign  Currency  Directive, the Federal Reserve Bank selected by the Committee to execute open market transactions  (the  'Selected  Bank'),  through  the manager, System Open Market Account ('manager'), shall be guided by the following procedural understandings with respect to consultations  and  clearances  with  the  Committee,  the  Foreign  Currency  Subcommittee (the  'Subcommittee'),  and  the  Chairman  of the  Committee,  unless  otherwise  directed  by the  Committee.    All  operations  undertaken pursuant  to  such  clearances  shall  be  reported promptly to the Committee.

- 1. For  the  reciprocal  currency  arrangements  authorized  in  paragraphs  2.A  of  the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations:
- A. Drawings must be approved by the Subcommittee (or by the Chairman, if the Chairman believes that consultation with the  Subcommittee  is  not  feasible  in  the time  available)  if  the  swap  drawing  proposed by a foreign bank does not exceed the  larger  of  (i)  $200  million  or  (ii)  15 percent  of  the  size  of  the  swap  arrangement.
- B. Drawings must be approved by the Committee  (or  by  the  Subcommittee,  if the Subcommittee believes that consultation with the full Committee is not feasible in the time available, or by the Chairman,  if  the  Chairman  believes  that  consultation  with  the  Subcommittee  is  not feasible in the time available) if the swap drawing  proposed  by  a  foreign  bank  exceeds the larger of (i) $200 million or (ii) 15  percent  of  the  size  of  the  swap  arrangement.
- C. The manager shall also consult with the Subcommittee or the Chairman about proposed swap drawings by the System.
- D. Any changes in the terms of existing swap  arrangements  shall  be  referred  for review  and  approval  to  the  Chairman.

Reducing Aggregate Capacity of the ON RRP Facility

Gretchen Weinbach January 26, 2016

Exhibit 1

Two key takeaways relevant for calibrating capacity of ON RRP facility

- 1. Market confidence in sufficient headroom over time is important for rate control
- ยท We don't know how large headroom needs to be
- ยท Having very elevated capacity at liftoff may have contributed to its success
- ยท Capacity likely can be lower than $2 trillion
- ยท May need more headroom now than the $150 billion that typically prevailed during testing phase
- 2. Demand for ON RRPs could trend up over time...
- ยท With changes in financial regulations (money funds, banks)
- ยท With rise in general level of interest rates (ZLB effects; international capital flows)
- ยท Overall, future demand is uncertain

January 26, 2016

299 of 337

Exhibit 2

Three illustrative options for reducing aggregate capacity of ON RRP facility

<!-- missing-text -->

High-level policy tradeoffs

- ยท May prefer a high cap (option 1) if you:
- Want to limit need to increase cap over time
- See high cap as important for rate control
- Are not very concerned about surge risk in near term, or potential footprint
- Or see it as prudent first step in reducing cap over time
- ยท May prefer a low flexible cap (option 2) if you:
- Do not see high cap as important for rate control
- Want to mitigate surge risk in near term
- Are willing to increase cap over time as necessary
- ยท May prefer a low hard cap (option 3) if you:
- Are not willing to increase cap over time
- Are concerned about near-term surge risk
- Also have footprint concerns

January 26, 2016

300 of 337

Exhibit 3

Timing of reduction -- what constitutes "fairly soon"?

- ยท If judge rate control sufficient and likely sustained with lower cap, could reduce in March
- Might reduce concerns about exposure to surge risk...
- And perhaps also about footprint-related issues
- ยท Or could want to gain more experience with policy normalization first
- ยท Or wait until some upcoming calendar events (March quarter-end; April tax season) pass

Adjusting RRPs for calendar effects

- ยท Recommend continuing to provide sufficient RRPs at quarter-ends
- ยท Under any of the options, calendar effects could be accommodated

Near-term communications about RRPs

- ยท January minutes:
- Capacity reduction:  Will note topic was discussed; could help lay groundwork for future decision
- Calendar effects:  Could convey intention to ensure sufficient RRP capacity at March quarter-end
- ยท January directive:
- Eliminates reference to term RRPs; that resolution has expired

January 26, 2016

301 of 337

Exhibit 4

Questions for go-round

- 1. Approach:  What is your preference among the options discussed in the memo for reducing the capacity of the ON RRP facility and why? (Or do you 1 prefer another option?)
- 2. Quarter-end:  Do you have a preferred approach for handling quarter-end (or other calendar-based) pressures via temporary increases in the cap on ON RRPs, offering term RRPs, or both?
- 3. Communications:  How would you explain to the public the change in the capacity of the facility and the Committee's plans for managing capacity going forward?
- 4. Timing:  When do you believe it would be appropriate to reduce the capacity of the facility from its current level?

Authorized for Public Release

317 of 337

FEDERAL RESERVE press release

<!-- missing-text -->

For release at 2:00 p.m. EST

January 27, 2016

As part of its annual organizational meeting actions, the Federal Open Market Committee reaffirmed its 'Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy,' with a revision to clarify that it views its inflation objective as symmetric, and with an updated reference to participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate in the most recent Summary of Economic Projections (December 2015).

In October 2014, in preparation for the annual reaffirmation, the Committee discussed the potential benefits of amending the statement to clarify that its inflation objective is symmetric. As indicated in the minutes of that meeting, there was general agreement on the symmetry of the objective.  Following further Committee discussion regarding the most appropriate way to express this clarification, the statement has been amended to indicate that the 'Committee would be concerned if inflation were running persistently above or below' its 2 percent objective.  All but one participant supported the amended statement.

The Committee first adopted the statement at its January 2012 meeting and has reaffirmed it, with appropriate revisions, at its annual organizational meetings each January.

Voting for the statement were: Janet L. Yellen, Chair; William C. Dudley, Vice Chairman; Lael Brainard; Stanley Fischer; Esther L. George; Loretta J. Mester; Jerome H. Powell; Eric Rosengren; and Daniel K. Tarullo.  Voting against was James Bullard, who agreed the Committee's inflation goal is symmetric, but believed the Committee's concern should be primarily focused on expected future deviations of inflation from the goal.

DECEMBER 2015 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft.  A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced.  Inflation is expected to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective.  Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to ยผ to ยฝ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR JANUARY 2016

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October December suggests that the pace of expansion in economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace slowed late last year .  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed .  A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing job gains  and declining unemployment, , shows further improvement and confirms that underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low declined further ; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down are little changed, on balance, in recent months .
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further. In light of recent global economic and financial developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the labor market and inflation as tilted [ slightly ] to the downside. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. With inflation anticipated to remain below 2 percent longer than previously projected, and in light of the risks to Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to at ยผ to ยฝ percent. The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting to support further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and

international developments. In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal. The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

ALTERNATIVE B FOR JANUARY 2016

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace growth slowed late last year .  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at solid moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed .  A range of recent labor market indicators, including ongoing strong job gains  and declining unemployment, shows further improvement and confirms that , points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources has diminished appreciably since early this year.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longerrun objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports. Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low declined further ; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have edged down are little changed, on balance, in recent months .
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will continue to expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Overall, taking into account domestic and international developments, the Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as balanced.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely. The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.
- 3. The Committee judges that there has been considerable improvement in labor market conditions this year, and it is reasonably confident that inflation will rise, over the medium term, to its 2 percent objective. Given the economic outlook, and recognizing the time it takes for policy actions to affect future economic outcomes, the Committee decided to raise maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to at ยผ to ยฝ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative after this increase, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Proposal for Fan Charts in the Summary of Economic Projections

- ๏ท Proposed approach based on median SEP forecasts and historical RMSEs
- ๏ท Other approaches considered

Proposed approach

- ๏ท Fan charts reporting median SEP forecasts and symmetric confidence intervals based on historical RMSEs (Exhibit 1)
- o Intervals for 70 percent confidence, not 90 percent
- o Constructed from information already available
- o Relatively easy to explain
- ๏ท Implementation issues
- o Conceptual differences
- ๏ง Appropriate policy in SEP vs. modal policy in RMSEs
- ๏ง But RMSEs should provide reasonable, approximate measures of uncertainty around the median projections
- o Fan chart for the funds rate
- ๏ง Appropriate policy vs. modal projections
- ๏ง Omitting the funds rate would emphasize this distinction
- ๏ง However, including the funds rate would help to emphasize uncertainty and data dependence

Other approaches considered

- ๏ท Historical distributions of forecast errors instead of RMSEs
- o Would not require assumptions of symmetry or normality and could capture asymmetries
- o Could be more difficult to explain, and limited data may preclude reliably representing relevant asymmetries
- ๏ท Simulations of an econometric model
- o Structural approach that could allow for asymmetries
- o Could be more difficult to explain, and would require agreement on a model and policy rule
- ๏ท Subjective assessments of uncertainty and risks
- o Could capture the judgments that contributed to the policy decision and allow the fan charts to reflect assessments of appropriate policy
- o The reporting requirements could be onerous, with concerns about translation from the subjective to the quantitative, and the charts could be difficult to explain
