Financial Stability Implications of a FRFA ON RRP Facility

Potential Benefits and Costs

Three Recent Flight-to-Quality Episodes

- · The provision of a new, risk-free liquid asset could support financial stability by crowding out private, seemingly safe "money-like" liabilities
- · During crises, rapid take-up at the ON RRP facility could magnify flight-to-quality flows and contribute to a decline in the availability of short-term funding

Possible Amplification Effects

- · Cash that would have moved into liquid deposits could go into the ON RRP facility
- · Prime MMFs could experience larger outflows
- · Availability of short-term funding could decline more quickly
- · Additional flight-to-quality flows might occur
- · The financial stability implications would depend in large part on the firms that lose funding
- · September 2008 and the debt-ceiling standoffs of 2011 and 2013
- · Investors ran from short-term vehicles that embedded liquidity and credit risk
- · Safe-haven inflows were quite large, although destinations varied

Potential Mitigants

- · Lower ON RRP rate
- Probably not a reliable stand-alone tool
- · Caps on usage
- Individual vs. aggregate caps
- Rigid vs. flexible caps
- · Optimal cap design depends on risk assessment
- Fixed aggregate caps likely limit liquidity disruptions most
- Flexible individual caps allow larger supply of safe assets in a crisis and with greater certainty
- Flexibility likely increases operational cost

Exhibit 4 (Last) Discussion Questions Authorized for Public Release

- 1. Should the Committee continue to target the federal funds rate during the period of normalization?
- 2. If the Committee were to shift away from a federal funds rate target, what alternative rate or rates might be preferable?  In particular, would you support the development, in the near term, of a more robust measure of the overnight, unsecured bank funding rate to serve as a target?  Could it be desirable to target an administered rate instead of a market rate?
- 3. What is your assessment of the possible benefits and costs of relying on a fixed-rate, full-allotment ON RRP facility during normalization and over the longer run?  If you think it might be appropriate to use ON RRPs to help implement monetary policy during normalization, what factors do you think should be considered in determining the appropriate spread, if any, between the ON RRP rate and the IOER rate?
- 4. Many of the approaches considered in memo 1 would be expected to leave the targeted rate (whether the existing federal funds rate or another market rate) below the IOER rate.  How large a divergence between the targeted rate and the IOER rate and how much day-to-day variation in that divergence would be acceptable to you?
- 5. Some of the approaches discussed in memo 1 could generate large net interest expense for the Federal Reserve (to the extent that the IOER rate was high relative to market rates, or term draining tools were used to drain a large quantity of reserves at rates well above IOER rate or the ON RRP rate).  How comfortable are you with the possibility of incurring such observable additional costs?
- 6. If further testing were to suggest that all of the approaches to normalization discussed in memo 1 could be implemented successfully and provide satisfactory control over interest rates, which approach would you prefer at this time?  Why?  Are there any that you would eliminate from further consideration at this time?
- 7. How much additional testing, and with regard to which of the tools, do you think would be most helpful?  In particular, are you comfortable with the proposed near-term testing plan for the TDF? Do you think that the additional testing for both the ON RRPs and for term operations that were discussed in memo 2 likely would be useful, taking account of the communication risks?

- · Term premiums rise by 120 basis points more than expected first half of 2015, and investment grade bond spreads widen by 70 basis points.
- · Triggering event is pull-forward by investors of eventual tightening of conventional monetary policy and effects on the market values of fixed income portfolios.
- · The effect on the unemployment rate peaks at three-tenths in 2016 and moderates to two-tenths by 2018, while effect on GDP peaks at 80 basis points and also ebbs a bit.
- · However, pockets of vulnerabilities could be more disruptive.  Corporate bond market could become highly illiquid.  Such an event would be more consequential, although effects mitigated by moderate leverage and by subdued amounts of assets funded with short-term debt.

MARCH FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions.  Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.  Inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will continue to improve gradually, moving toward those the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. The Committee currently judges that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions.  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in April, the Committee will add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  The Committee's sizable and still-increasing holdings of longer-term securities should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative, which in turn should promote a stronger economic recovery and help to ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with the Committee's dual mandate.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months and will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  If incoming information broadly supports the Committee's expectation of ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and inflation moving back toward its longer-run objective, the Committee will likely reduce the pace of asset purchases in further measured steps at future meetings.  However, asset purchases are not on a

preset course, and the Committee's decisions about their pace will remain contingent on the Committee's outlook for the labor market and inflation as well as its assessment of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
- 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.
- 7. With the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance.  The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.

FOMC STATEMENT-APRIL 2014 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March indicates that growth in economic activity slowed sharply during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions , but suggests that it is picking up .  Labor market indicators were mixed but on balance showed further improvement.  The unemployment rate, however, remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment continued to advance, but business fixed investment edged down, while the recovery in the housing sector remained slow.  Fiscal policy is restraining economic growth, although the extent of restraint is diminishing.

However, it recognizes that inflation persistently below its 2 percent objective could pose risks to economic performance, and it is monitoring inflation developments carefully for evidence that inflation will move back toward its objective over the medium term.
- 3. The Committee currently judges has become somewhat less confident that there is sufficient underlying strength in the broader economy to support ongoing improvement in labor market conditions and to return inflation to 2 percent over the medium run .  In light of the cumulative progress toward maximum employment and the improvement in the outlook for labor market conditions since the inception of the current asset purchase program, the Committee decided to make a further measured reduction in the pace of its asset purchases.  Beginning in April For this reason , the Committee decided to maintain the current pace of its asset purchases and await additional information bearing on the outlook for economic activity, the labor market, and inflation.  The Committee will continue to add to its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $25 billion per month rather than $30 billion per month, and will add to its holdings of longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $30 billion per month rather than $35 billion per month.

- 6. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March indicates that growth in economic activity slowed during the winter months, in part reflecting adverse weather conditions is picking up as the effects of unusually severe winter weather and other transitory factors fade .

The Committee continues to anticipate, based on its assessment of these factors, that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the current target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.
- 6.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.
- 7. With the unemployment rate nearing 6½ percent, the Committee has updated its forward guidance.  The change in the Committee's guidance does not indicate any change in the Committee's policy intentions as set forth in its recent statements.
