Material for Briefing on Governance Issues Associated with Liftoff

Ellen E. Meade April 28, 2015

Governance Issues Associated with Liftoff

Decisions at Commencement of Normalization Process

-  Stance of policy:  New target range for the federal funds rate
-  Settings for administered rates:  ON RRP and IOER rates

Early Days after Liftoff Announcement

-  May take several days for some participants in money markets to assess and adapt to the new market environment
-  Pre-arrange staff briefings-daily for perhaps first two weeks following liftoff
- o Participants could ask questions
- o Briefings could be readily converted into joint meetings of the Committee and Board
-  If liftoff process does not proceed as planned, scheduled briefings replaced by joint videoconference meetings

Governance Arrangements after the First Two Weeks

-  Small operational adjustments to administered rates
-  Could be helpful if effective federal funds rate lies persistently outside new target range
-  Two possible approaches for governance of decisions

Approach 1:  All Decisions by Vote

-  Joint videoconference meetings
-  All policymakers involved in discussion of changes
-  FOMC votes on changes to ON RRP rate and Board approves changes to IOER rate
-  Possible alternative format using SDS comments and notation voting
- o Might be most appropriate for relatively straightforward adjustments that had been previously discussed

Approach 2:  Delegation of Authority to the Chair

-  Subject to limitations established by FOMC and Board
-  Ensures Federal Reserve can respond quickly if conditions warrant
-  Chair could make adjustments to administered rates if necessary to keep federal funds rate in new target range
- o Perhaps 5 or 10 basis points
-  Could help separate decisions on policy stance from small technical adjustments

Questions for Discussion of Governance Issues Associated with Liftoff

- 1. Are you comfortable with a governance approach in the first two weeks following liftoff that would  involve pre-scheduled  staff  briefings  on  financial  market  developments  and  the effectiveness of policy implementation? These briefings could be cancelled or converted to FOMC and/or Board meetings as appropriate.
- 2. What are your views regarding the governance approach for possible intermeeting adjustments of the ON RRP rat and/or IOER rate that might become necessary after the first two weeks following liftoff? Would you favor an approach in which such intermeeting adjustments to the ON RRP rate or the IOER rate require a vote of the FOMC or Board, respectively, or would you favor an alternative approach that would delegate to the Chair authority to make modest intermeeting adjustments of the ON RRP rate and/or IOER rate in order to keep the funds rate from moving persistently outside the target range established by the FOMC?

- · Rely on paragraphs 1 and 2 to speak to the Committee's assessment of  criteria for liftoff.

Shaping Expectations for the Timing of Liftoff

- · Alternative B:
- o Underutilization of labor resources little changed.
- o Retains expectation that inflation will rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.
- o Some, but not all, of  the recent weakness is transitory.
- o No time-based guidance.
- · Alternative C:
- o Some labor market indicators suggest underutilization continued to improve.
- o Inflation no longer declining.
- o Economic slowdown "largely" due to transitory factors.
- o Economic conditions may or likely will soon warrant an increase in the target range.
- · Alternative A:
- 0 Underutilization of labor resources "little changed."
- 0 Inflation "continued to run well below the Committee's longer-run objective."
- 0 Risks to outlook for economic activity and the labor market "tilted to the downside."
- 0 Inflation could run substantially below 2 percent "for a protracted period."
- 0 More stringent precondition for the initiation of policy firming.

MARCH 2015 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic growth has moderated somewhat.  Labor market conditions have improved further, with strong job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  A range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.  Household spending is rising moderately; declines in energy prices have boosted household purchasing power.  Business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow and export growth has weakened.  Inflation has declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely reflecting declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of energy price declines and other factors dissipate. The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  Consistent with its previous statement, the Committee judges that an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate remains unlikely at the April FOMC meeting.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.  This change in the forward guidance does not indicate that the Committee has decided on the timing of the initial increase in the target range.
- 4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
- 5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after

employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

March 2015 Directive

Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster maximum employment and price stability.  In particular, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
