- 4 .  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial ′ developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability. The stance of policy will depend on the incoming data and their implications for the outlook as well as the cumulative progress toward the Committee's objectives since the program began in September.  The paths for the economy that the Committee sees as relatively more likely involve inflation moving back toward its 2 percent objective over time and further improvement in labor market conditions supported by moderate growth that picks up over the next several quarters as the near-term restraint from fiscal policy and other headwinds diminishes.  If the economy develops broadly along these lines, the Committee currently anticipates that it would be appropriate to reduce the monthly pace of its asset purchases later this year and, so long as conditions continue to improve about as expected, reduce the pace of purchases in measured steps through the first half of next year, ending purchases about mid-year.  If conditions improve faster than expected, the pace of asset purchases could be reduced somewhat more quickly.  If the outlook becomes less favorable, on the other hand, or if financial conditions are judged not to be consistent with further progress in labor markets, reductions in the pace of purchases could be delayed.  Indeed, if necessary, the Committee would be prepared to employ all of its tools, including an increase in the pace of purchases for a time, to promote a return to maximum employment in a context of price stability. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.

MAY FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the

Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

FOMC STATEMENT-JUNE 2013 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions have shown some improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but manufacturing activity has slowed and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Inflation has been running somewhat below the Committee's longer-run objective, even apart from temporary variations that largely reflect fluctuations in energy prices.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with In pursuing its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks takes a balanced approach to foster ing maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace, and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate,  The Committee also anticipates that and inflation over the medium-term likely will run at or below move up to its 2 percent objective, or [ even ] modestly higher for a time . Nonetheless, the Committee continues to see downside risks to the economic outlook.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at does not remain below the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. In addition, the Committee now intends to rely upon paydowns of principal rather than sales of agency mortgage-backed securities when it eventually becomes appropriate to reduce its holdings of those securities. Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

When the Committee decides to eventually begin  to remove s reduce policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and price stability . In particular, the Committee expects that when the time comes to reduce policy accommodation, it will be appropriate to do so gradually in order to foster strong growth in employment and inflation of at 2 percent , or [ even ] modestly higher for a time .

However, in light of the improvement in the outlook for the labor market since the Committee began its current asset purchase program last September, the Committee decided to continue purchasing purchase additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 [ $35 ] billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 [ $35 ] billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.

When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.
