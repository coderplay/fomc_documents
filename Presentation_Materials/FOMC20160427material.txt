Material for Briefing on The Linkages Among Monetary Policy, Macroprudential Policy and Financial Stability

Jeff  Fuhrer, Joe Haubrich and Joe Peek April 26, 2016

Key features of  financial instability

- 1. Rapid growth of debt
- 2. Rapid asset price appreciation
- · Future bouts of instability will occur, even with improved regulations
- -Strong capital buffers and other structural tools will make the system more resilient
- -But will not eliminate instability

Exhibit 2

How to mitigate financial instability 1. Macroprudential tools: Evidence on Efficacy

- · If  macroprudential tools are fully effective, little need to consider using monetary policy to address financial instability
- · But the effectiveness of  macroprudential tools is uncertain
- · Evidence on cyclical tools used by advanced foreign economies (AFEs)
- -Most countries choose not to use monetary policy to address financial instability
- -Macroprudential tools may be effective in slowing borrowing. Effects on price appreciation are less clear.

Experience with LTV caps

<!-- missing-text -->

Sources: OECD (Canada, Spain, Sweden house price indexes), Singapore Housing and Development Board (Singapore price index), Haver Analytics, Cerutti et al (2015, dating of  loan-to-value caps).

- · Caps don't reliably stop or slow house price appreciation
- · Perhaps because implementation has been too timid?

How to mitigate financial instability 2. Monetary policy (MP)

Exhibit 5

- · Can MP slow or avoid instability and crises?
- -Can policymakers detect unsustainable increases in debt and asset prices early enough?
- -Can monetary policy reliably affect asset prices and debt accumulation?
- -These are also challenges for macroprudential policy
- · Will use of  monetary policy to address financial instability cause too much collateral damage to the economy?
- -Svensson (2015): Cost of damage done to the economy greater than benefit in improved financial stability

Interactions between monetary and macroprudential policy

- · Long-run goals coincide, plus or minus
- · Short-run goals, tools differ
- · Some coordination is likely necessary
- -Minimum: Take into account effects of  each other's actions in setting policies
- -More coordination would be helpful, given the feedbacks

<!-- missing-text -->

Monetary and macroprudential interactions: Institutional implications

- · Same committee, or different committees?
- -Within the same institution, or different institutions?
- · UK model
- -Separate committees within the same institution
- -High-level overlap in membership fosters collaboration and fairly tight coordination of  policies
- · Whatever the structure, strong cooperation would likely be helpful

Exhibit 7

What to conclude?

- · Uncertainty about macroprudential tools means we must consider monetary policy as a tool
- -But we view it as a less-reliable 'third resort'
- · We can rely most on building resilience-increasing capital buffers, conducting stress tests, as we have done
- · Macroprudential tools would be the first cyclical resort to combating financial instability
- -But we need to do more to build our confidence in macroprudential tools

A 'to-do' list to improve confidence in macroprudential tools

- · Expand the available set of  macroprudential tools.
- · Shorten implementation lags where possible.
- · Add to extant research on the effectiveness of  tools and new transmission channels.
- · Consider better coordination of  monetary and macroprudential policies.
- · Assess the potential for regulatory arbitrage, and developing strategies to mitigate it.
- · Establish independence of macroprudential regulators.

Financial Vulnerability and Monetary Policy: The Empirical Evidence

8

FEDERAL RESERVE BANK of NEW YORK

Tobias Adrian, Nina Boyarchenko, Richard Crump, Matthew Plosser

April 26, 2016

Exhibit 1: Two Views

1) Monetary policy and financial stability are separate

- o Transmission of monetary policy is via interest rates
- o Policy expectations summarize all market information
- o Risk premia are constant or exogenous

2) Monetary policy and financial stability interact

- o Monetary policy impacts risk taking of financial intermediaries
- o Risk taking determines financial conditions and vulnerabilities
- o Financial vulnerabilities matter for macroeconomic outcomes

¾ The second view is the risk-taking channel of monetary policy

- o We review existing and new evidence

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 2: Credit Channel of Monetary Policy

- o A lower short-term policy interest rate spurs lending and spending in pursuit of price stability and full employment
- o The credit channel features an amplification mechanism beyond the interest rate channel, but does not incorporate risk taking of financial institutions
- o Jordà, Schularick, and Taylor (2013, 2015) find sizable effects of lower short-term interest rates on mortgage credit and house prices
- o Moreover, credit growth can threaten financial stability:
- o A one standard deviation higher credit growth associated with three percent lower GDP in crises
- o However, increasing interest rates preemptively to slow credit or house price growth involves tradeoffs

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 3: The Risk-Taking Channel of Monetary Policy

1) Monetary policy influences risk taking of financial institutions

- o Risk taking determines leverage and maturity transformation, which are vulnerabilities for the system

2) Risk premia are endogenous and time varying

- o Pricing of risk determines financial conditions

3) Endogenous risk taking increases downside risk to real activity

- o Financial vulnerabilities create risks to the dual mandate

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 4: Existing Evidence on the Risk-Taking Channel

A number of studies have examined different dimensions of risk taking in the banking sector, finding that:

- o U.S. banks ease lending standards and charge smaller premiums to riskier borrowers during periods of easy monetary policy
- o Paligorova and Santos (2012), Maddaloni and Peydró (2011)
- o U.S. banks' ex-ante risk taking is negatively associated with increases in short-term policy interest rates
- o Dell'Ariccia, Laeven and Suarez (2016)
- o Nonbank financial intermediation tends to expand when monetary policy is expansionary
- o Adrian, Moench and Shin (2010)

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 5:

Variability and FOMC Announcements 1994-2007

Absolute two-day change

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 6: Measuring Financial Vulnerability

- o We use Adrian and Brunnermeier's CoVaR to measure vulnerability
- o CoVaR is defined as the Value-at-Risk of the entire financial system conditional on the distress of a particular financial institution
- o CoVaR as a summary measure correlates strongly with leverage, maturity transformation, and other measures of vulnerability
- o Financial vulnerabilities can create systemic risk - the risk that the intermediation capacity of the financial system becomes impaired

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 7: Vulnerability and FOMC Announcements

We estimate the sensitivity of bank equity returns on FOMC announcement days to the expected path of interest rates, measures of risk premia, and CoVaR

- o A 25 basis point increase in the expected path of interest rates on an announcement day lowers bank equity returns by 36 to 50 basis points
- o A 15 percent increase in the risk premium on an announcement day lowers bank equity returns by 8 to 13 basis points
- o Comparing the most and least vulnerable banks, the decline in bank returns is 20 to 24 percent larger for either of these increases
- o Our results thus show that there are significant interactions between the monetary policy announcements, the evolution of risk and risk premia, and the performance of relatively vulnerable institutions

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 8: Conclusion

- o The empirical evidence is consistent with the risk-taking channel of monetary policy transmission:
- o Easier policy can increase risk taking, compress risk premia, and thus could create vulnerabilities
- o These findings suggest further work to quantify the effect of risk taking on downside risk to the dual mandate

- · Often rationalized with 'risk-taking channel' of monetary policy
- -Low interest rate leads to high leverage
- -High leverage incentivizes high-risk projects
- -A blunt tool, but 'gets in all the cracks'
- -Augment Taylor rule with credit variable

If you would like to comment, it would be helpful if you would address some or all of the following questions:

- 1. Among economists there is a growing agreement that macroprudential policy measures are the primary instruments through which policymakers should promote financial stability and address any such concerns. In light of this emerging consensus,
- a. Do you view the set of macroprudential tools available to policymakers in the United States as sufficient to ensure financial stability most of the time?
- b. Would you draw any distinctions between  the sufficiency and efficacy of  tools available for addressing 'through-the-cycle' risks and tools available for addressing risks that are more cyclical (or time-varying)?
- c. Does the dispersion of responsibilities for regulation of the different sectors of the U.S. financial system, or other challenges associated with coordination of macroprudential actions, factor significantly in your assessment of the sufficiency and efficacy of macroprudential tools?
- 2. Given your assessment of the sufficiency and efficacy of macroprudential tools,
- a. Would you support using the stance of monetary policy to pursue financial-stability goals, even if such efforts would imply deviations from the FOMC's dual mandate for some time?
- b. If so, what conditions do you view as most likely to call for such monetary policy adjustments, and do you view such conditions as likely over the next several years?

- (2) Establish the investment objectives for foreign reserves portfolio: liquidity, safety, return
- (3) Determine funding needs: estimate $8 billion across both SOMA and ESF
- (4) Establish constraints based on policymakers' willingness to bear risk: establish minimum cash allocation; set eligible issuers, diversification, and liquidity constraints; establish maximum expected shortfall
- (5) Formulate an asset allocation given these funding needs and investment risk preferences: benchmark allocation that reflects policymakers' risk tolerances

MARCH 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months.  Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at

auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

APRIL 2016 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March suggests indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months slowed . Growth in household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and declined. Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved further; however, but business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation picked up in recent months; however, it has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, only partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in falling prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriately accommodative monetary policy, growth in economic activity will expand at pick up to a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to sees downside risks to the economic outlook and is closely monitor ing inflation , developments indicators of longer-term inflation expectations, and global economic and financial developments closely.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced.
- 4. In determining the When adjustments to the target range become appropriate, their timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess will depend on the Committee's assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a

manner that will , for some time, warrant only gradual increases in maintaining the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below at levels below those that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March suggests indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months appears to have slowed . Growth in household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate moderated , and although households' real income has risen at a solid rate and consumer sentiment remains high. Since the beginning of the year, the housing sector has improved further; however, but business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.

The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments closely.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path

of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

APRIL 2016 ALTERNATIVE C

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March suggests indicates that labor market conditions have improved further even as growth in economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace despite the global economic and financial developments of recent months appears to have slowed .  Household spending has been increasing at a moderate rate, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft.  A range of recent indicators, including strong job gains, points to additional strengthening of the labor market.  Inflation picked up in recent months has stepped up since last year ; however, though it has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting largely because of earlier declines in energy prices and in falling prices of non-energy imports.  Marketbased measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.

The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  However, global economic and financial developments continue to pose risks. The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for both economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced but is monitoring global economic and financial developments. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
