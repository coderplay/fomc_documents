Do Markets Understand Data Dependence?

Key Considerations

- · Is uncertainty regarding economic outlook appropriately reflected in degree of uncertainty regarding timing of liftoff?
- · Are interest rates appropriately sensitive to incoming economic information?
- · Do investors appreciate data dependence of the pace of tightening after first move?

Alternatives A, B, and C

Alternative B:

- · Economic conditions and the outlook:
- Economy is expanding moderately.
- Underutilization of labor resources diminished somewhat.
- Inflation still running below 2 percent, but "energy prices appear to have stabilized."
- · Some progress on criteria for policy firming.
- · The Committee's decision remains data dependent.

Alternative C:

- · Appreciable progress toward policy normalization.
- · Uses language closely tied to Committee's criteria:
- "Some improvement in labor market conditions;" no mention of underutilization.
- Expresses greater confidence in inflation outlook.

Alternative A:

- · Little further progress toward policy firming.
- · Risks to economic activity, labor market, and inflation weighted to the downside.
- · Would use all tools "to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years."

Alternative C ′ and Operational Note

Alternative C : Forward Guidance for Adjusting the Federal Funds Rate ′

- · In response to economic and financial developments and their implications for the outlook so as to promote objectives.
- · Expects economy to evolve in a manner that warrants gradual increase.
- · However, adjustments will be data driven.

Communication of Operational Details:

- · Postmeeting statement focused on the federal funds rate decision.
- · Advantages of a separate document on operational tools:
- Avoids possible distractions.
- Useful if intermeeting adjustments to implement an unchanged policy stance.
- Consolidates information without highlighting governance differences.
