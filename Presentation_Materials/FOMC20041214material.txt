Exhibit 1 Market  Developments  and Policy Expectations

Yields and Stock Prices

<!-- missing-text -->

'Nominal  yields derived from smoothed  yield curve  based on off-the-run securities. TIPS yields based on smoothed  yield curve.

Desk Survey of Primary Dealers

- * Unanimously expect 25-basis-point firming today.
- * Unanimously  expect retention  of balanced risks and "measured pace" language.
- * Apparently  none expects signal of a pause today.

Longer-term  Policy Expectations

- * Two dealers expect a pause in February and seven in March.
- * Futures quotes can  be read  as implying a pause in March and a move  roughly every other meeting  over the  rest of year.
- * Blue Chip  consensus consistent with two pauses  before Fall  2005.

Exhibit 2 Case  For Firming  Policy

Arguments  For  Firming  Policy Today

- * Expansion seems well  entrenched, with labor market conditions improving  gradually
- * Concern  about a buildup of inflationary pressure
- - possible slowing of productivity growth
- - actual  inflation has risen
- -anecdotal information  on price pressures
- -inflation surprises to the upside of market expectations
- - short-term  inflation expectations up
- -dollar depreciation
- * Real federal funds  rate well below most  estimates of its equilibrium  level

Arguments  For Alternative  B

-211111

Arguments  For Alternative C

Policy firming can now  proceed at slower pace:

- * Some output gap remains;  not closing rapidly
- * Significant  reduction in policy accommodation already accomplished
- * Unusual  business caution may persist

Recent  pace of tightening should be  maintained:

- * Substantial  remaining policy accommodation
- * Policy works with long lags
- * Signs of pressure  on inflation and inflation  expectations
- * Buoyant attitudes toward  risk in financial markets

Appendix 3:  Materials used by Mr. Reinhart

Exhibit 1

Arguments  For and Against Expediting the Release  of the Minutes:

For:

Against:

- * Provide more timely  and nuanced information  to the public
- * Convey the  range  of views within  the Committee
- * The  policy  statement  could potentially  be  shortened
- * Lead  to undue  market attention  to the  minutes
- * Complicate the Committee's deliberations
- * Lead  to the  minutes becoming more  sanitized and unhelpful  over time
- * May be operationally difficult

Schedule  for the Experiment with Expediting the Release  of the Minutes

<!-- missing-text -->

Changes in the Production of the Minutes

- * Contracted with a private  firm to produce  a transcript  quickly
- * Distributed  drafting responsibilities  among more  staff
- * Provided  more systematic  feedback  on comments  in the  final  week
- * Developed a procedure  for secure voting
- * Collaborated  with  staff in Public  Affairs  and the FRBNY  to assess the likely  financial  market reaction  to the minutes

Exhibit 2

Lessons  Learned

- 1. Using more resources  to produce  and distribute  the  minutes  soon after the  meeting is  helpful.
- 2. Not all participants  were  familiar  with all  the  rules  governing the drafting of the  minutes.
- 3. The expedited  schedule  poses  the risks  that:
- a. Not all  members will  be  able  to vote  by the  deadline.
- b. The  schedule  may be  too tight  to guarantee  achieving a consensus.
- 4. Friday  afternoon  is a  terrible  time to  release the  minutes.

Untested Aspects

The  experiment was  conducted  during a period  in which:

- 1. There were  no significant  disagreements  among members  about the overall  direction  of policy.
- 2. There were  no  intermeeting  conference  calls.

The  experiment  stopped  short of actually releasing  the  statement  early, implying that:

- 3. It is  unclear  how much increased  scrutiny more  timely minutes will receive  or  how members  will  adjust their  editing behavior.
- 4. It  is  unclear how  the public  will  react to  conditional  statements.

Exhibit 3

Three  Possibilities  for Today's Meeting

1. Vote  today to expedite  the release  of the minutes

If  so,  I  recommend  beginning  expedited release  with the minutes  of the  February 2005  meeting and adopting a  schedule  of releasing the minutes of regular  meeting three weeks  after the  day of the policy decision.

- * By beginning with the  February meeting, the decision  would be noted in the  minutes of today's meeting, which would  be released after  the February  meeting and thus give  the public advance  notice  of the new policy.
- * Adding  a  few  days  to the  schedule  by  releasing the minutes after  three weeks  would:
- o Give  staff more  time to draft and participants  more  time to  comment.
- o Position the release  in the middle  of the week, which would be  less likely  to  cause difficulties.

2. Extend the experiment

If so,  I  recommend  shifting to a three-week  schedule  because  it seems  more sustainable.

3. Stop  the experiment

If  so,  I  recommend  continuing approximately  the same  production and distribution  schedule  so  that the minutes  are  prepared while the memory  of the  meeting is  still  fresh.
