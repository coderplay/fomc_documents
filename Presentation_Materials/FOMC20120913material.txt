AUGUST FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year.  Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Business fixed investment has continued to advance.  Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year.  Despite some further signs of improvement, the housing sector remains depressed.  Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline, and longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually.  Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee anticipates that inflation over the medium term will run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  In particular, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through late 2014.
- 4. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

SEPTEMBER FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June August suggests that economic activity decelerated somewhat over the first half of this year has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months .  Growth in employment has been slow in recent months, and the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending has been rising at a somewhat slower pace than earlier in the year continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment has continued to advance appears to have slowed .  Despite some further signs of improvement,  The housing sector remains has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level .  Inflation has declined since earlier this year, mainly reflecting lower prices of crude oil and gasoline been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently . and Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up very gradually likely would not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions .  Consequently, the Committee anticipates that the unemployment rate will decline only slowly toward levels that it judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term will likely would run at or below the rate that it judges most consistent with its dual mandate its 2 percent objective .
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate close to 2 percent , the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy decided today to begin a new asset-purchase program . Specifically, the Committee now intends to purchase [ $750 billion ] of longer-term Treasury securities and [ $500 billion ] of agency mortgage-backed securities by early 2014, a combined pace of about [ $75 ] billion per month.  These increases in its securities holdings should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on regularly review the size and composition of its balance sheet in light of economic and financial developments and will provide additional accommodation as needed remains prepared to make adjustments as appropriate to promote a stronger economic recovery and sustained improvement in labor market conditions in a context of price stability.

- 4. This new asset-purchase program replaces the previously announced maturity extension program.  In particular, the Committee is ending its sales of shorterterm Treasury securities and reinstituting its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. The Committee also decided to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the conclusion of this asset-purchase program. In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through late 2014 mid-2015 .

Note:  If policymakers decide that it is appropriate to reduce the remuneration rate on reserve balances, the Board of Governors would issue an accompanying statement that might read:

In a related action, the Board of Governors voted today to reduce the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances from 25 basis points to 15 basis points effective with the reserve maintenance period that begins on September 20, 2012.

Statement Regarding Transactions in Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities and Treasury Securities

On September 13, 2012, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to begin purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) at a pace of [$30 | 40] billion per month. The FOMC also directed the Desk to continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of Treasury securities as announced in June and to maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency MBS in agency MBS.

The FOMC noted that these actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $[75 | 85] billion each month, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.

Purchases of Agency MBS

The purchases of additional agency MBS will begin tomorrow, and are expected to total approximately $[17 | 23] billion over the remainder of September. Going forward, details associated with the additional amount of MBS to be purchased each month will be announced on or around the last business day of the prior month.

Consistent with current practice, the planned amount of purchases associated with reinvestments of principal payments on holdings of agency securities that are anticipated to take place over each monthly period will be announced on or around the eighth business day of the prior month. The next monthly reinvestment purchase amount was also published today, and can be found here: http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/ambs/ambs_schedule.html.

The Desk anticipates that the agency MBS purchases associated with both the additional asset purchases and the principal reinvestments will likely be concentrated in newly-issued agency MBS in the To-Be-Announced (TBA) market, although the Desk may purchase other agency MBS if market conditions warrant.

Consistent with current practices, all purchases of agency MBS will be conducted with the Federal Reserve's primary dealers through a competitive bidding process and results will be published on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website. The Desk will also continue to publish transaction prices for individual operations on a monthly basis.

Frequently Asked Questions associated with these purchases will be released later today.
