The Foreign Currency Subcommittee (the 'Subcommittee') must direct the Selected  Bank  in  advance  to  execute  the operation  if  the  Subcommittee  believes that consultation with the Committee is not feasible in the time available.
- ii. The Committee authorizes the Subcommittee to direct the Selected Bank in advance  to  execute  the  operation  if  it would  result  in  the  overall  volume  of standalone  spot  and  forward  transactions

RECIPROCAL CURRENCY ARRANGEMENTS, AND STANDING DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCY LIQUIDITY SWAPS

- 5. The  Committee  authorizes  the  Selected Bank to maintain reciprocal currency arrangements  established  under  the  North  American Framework Agreement, standing dollar liquidity  swap  arrangements,  and  standing  foreign currency liquidity  swap  arrangements  as  provided  in  this  Authorization  and  to  the  extent

Federal Open Market Committee-Rules of Procedure

12 CFR 272; as amended effective [September 20, 2016]

§ 272.3

Federal Open Market Committee-Rules of Procedure

SECTION 272.1-Authority

This part  is issued by the Federal Open Market i Committee (the 'Committee') pursuant to the requirement  of  section  552  of  title  5  of  the United  States  Code  that  every  agency  shall publish in the Federal Register its rules of procedure.

SECTION 272.2-Functions of the Committee

The procedures followed by the Committee are designed to facilitate the effective performance of the Committee's statutory functions with respect  to  the  regulation  and  direction  of  open market  operations  conducted  by  the  Federal Reserve Banks and with respect to certain direct transactions between the Federal Reserve Banks and the United States.  In determining the policies to be followed in such operations, the Committee considers information regarding business  and  credit  conditions  and  domestic and international economic and financial developments, and other pertinent information gathered and submitted by its staff and the staffs of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Board') and the Federal Reserve Banks. Against the background of such information, the Committee takes actions from time to time to regulate and direct the open market operations of the Federal Reserve Banks. Such policy actions ordinarily are taken through the adoption  and  transmission  to  the  Federal  Reserve Banks of regulations, authorizations, and directives.

SECTION 272.3-Meetings

- (a) Place  and  frequency. The  Committee meets in Washington, D.C., at least four times each  year  and  oftener  if  deemed  necessary. Meetings are held upon the call of the Chairman of the Board or at the request of any three members of the Committee. Notices of calls by the  Chairman of the Board to other members are given by the secretary of the Committee in writing, by telephone, or electronic means.  Requests of any three members for the calling of a  meeting  shall  state  the  time  therefore  and

shall be filed in writing, by telephone, or electronic means with the secretary who shall forthwith  notify  all  members  of  the  Committee  in writing,  by  telephone,  or  electronic  means. When the secretary has sent notices to all members of the Committee that a meeting has been requested  by  three  members  and  of  the  time therefore,  a  meeting  is  deemed  to  have  been called.  If, in the judgment of the Chairman, circumstances require that a meeting be called at such  short  notice  that  one  or  more  members cannot be present in person, such members may participate in the meeting by telephone conference arrangements or by electronic means.

- (b) Alternates. Whenever any member of the Committee representing Federal Reserve Banks shall find that the member will be unable to attend a meeting of the Committee, the member shall promptly notify the  member's alternate and the secretary of the Committee in writing,  by  telephone,  or  electronic  means,  and upon receipt of such notice such alternate shall advise the secretary whether the alternate will attend such meeting.
- (c) Quorum. Seven members, at least one of whom represents a Federal Reserve Bank, constitute a quorum of the Committee for purposes of transacting business except that, if there are fewer than seven members in office, then the number  of  members  in  office  constitute  a quorum.    For  purposes  of  this  paragraph  (c), members of the Committee include alternates acting in the absence of members. Less than a quorum may adjourn a meeting of the Committee from time to time until a quorum is in attendance.
- (d) Attendance  at  meetings. Attendance  at Committee meetings is restricted to members and alternate  members of the Committee, the presidents of Federal Reserve Banks who are not at the time members or alternates, staff officers of the Committee, the manager, and such other  advisers  as  the  Committee  may  invite from time to time.
- (e) Meeting agendas. The secretary, in consultation with the Chairman, prepares an agenda of matters to be discussed at each regularly scheduled meeting and the secretary trans-

Appendix 2

§ 272.3

mits the agenda to the members of the Committee within a reasonable time in advance of such meeting.    In  general,  the  agendas  include  reports by the manager on open market operations since the previous meeting, and ratification by the Committee of such operations; reports by economists on, and Committee discussion of, the economic and financial situation and  outlook;  Committee  discussion  of  monetary policy and action with respect thereto; and such other matters as may be considered necessary.

- (f) Foreign Currency Subcommittee. Meetings  of  the  Foreign  Currency  Subcommittee (the 'Subcommittee') shall be called at the request of any Subcommittee member, or at the request of the manager. for the purposes of reviewing recent or contemplated operations and of consulting with the manager on other matters relating  to  the  manager's  responsibilities.    At the request of any member of the Subcommittee,  questions  arising  from  such  reviews  and consultations a matter before the Subcommittee shall be referred for determination to the Committee.

SECTION 272.4-Committee Actions

- (a) Actions at meetings. Actions are taken at meetings of the Committee except as described below.
- (b) Policy actions between meetings. Special circumstances  may  make  it  desirable  in  the public interest for Committee members to consider an action to modify an outstanding Committee authorization or directive at a time when it is not feasible to call a meeting.  Whenever, in the judgment of the Chairman, such circumstances  have  arisen,  the  relevant  information and recommendations for action are transmitted  to  the  members  by  the  secretary,  and  the members communicate their votes to the secretary.  If the action is approved by a majority of the members, advice to that effect is promptly given by the secretary  to  the  members  of  the Committee and to the Federal Reserve Bank selected  to  execute  transactions  for  the  System Open Market Account.  All communications of

Appendix 2

recommended actions and votes under this paragraph  shall  be  in  writing,  by  telephone,  or electronic means; if the communication is made orally, the secretary shall cause a written record to be made without delay. An action taken between meetings has the force and effect of an action at a meeting; provided, however, that if a meeting is held before the execution of any operations pursuant to the action, the action is null and void unless it is ratified and confirmed by the Committee at such meeting.

- (c) Other  actions  between  meetings. Circumstances may make it desirable in the public interest  for  Committee  members  to  consider other actions, such as approval of the minutes, between meetings.  In these circumstances, the relevant information and recommendations for such action are transmitted to the members by the  secretary,  and  the  members  communicate their  votes  to  the  secretary.    All  communications of recommended actions and votes under this paragraph shall be in writing, by telephone, or  electronic  means;  if  the  communication  is made orally, the secretary shall cause a written record to be made without delay.
- (d) Delegations of authority. In special circumstances, the  Committee  may delegate authority to take an action, subject to such instructions  or  guidelines  as  the  Committee  deems proper.  Such  delegations  of  authority  may  be made to the Chairman; to a subcommittee consisting of the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Committee and the Vice Chairman of the Board (or in the absence of the Chairman or of the Vice Chairman of the Board the members of the Board designated by the Chairman as alternates, and in the absence of the Vice Chairman of the Committee the alternate for the Vice Chairman); or to any other member or members of the Committee.  An action taken pursuant to such a delegation of authority has the force and effect of an action taken by the Committee.
- (e) Technical  changes  to  Committee  rules. The secretary of the Committee (or the acting secretary) is authorized to make technical corrections, such as spelling, grammar, construction,  and  organization  (including  removal  of obsolete  provisions  and  references),  to  the Committee's rules, regulations, and orders and

time.

- (f) Effective date. Committee action ordinarily is made effective as of the time it is taken because the nature of the subject matter and the action taken is such that the public interest and the  proper  discharge  of  the  Committee's  responsibilities  so  require.    Occasionally,  however, the Committee may specify that an action is to be effective at some different

SECTION  272.5-Notice  and  Public  Procedure

There ordinarily is no published notice of proposed action by the Committee or public procedure thereon, as described in section 553 of title 5 of the United States Code, because such notice and procedure are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.

JULY 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market strengthened and that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate.  Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.  On balance, payrolls and other labor market indicators point to some increase in labor utilization in recent months.  Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  Nearterm risks to the economic outlook have diminished.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

September 20-21, 2016

SEPTEMBER 2016 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June July indicates that the labor market strengthened has continued to strengthen and that growth of economic activity has been expanding at a moderate rate has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year .  Job gains were strong in June following weak growth in May.  On balance, payrolls and have been solid in recent months, on average, but other labor market indicators , including the unemployment rate, point to some increase little change in labor utilization in recent months.  Household spending has been growing strongly but business fixed investment has been remained soft.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, only partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; most survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the appropriate stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators conditions will strengthen further .  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise gradually to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of past declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook have diminished.  The Committee continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments.
- 3. Against this backdrop, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee judges that an increase in the target range will not be warranted until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future when adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate might become appropriate , the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation , along with risks to the economic outlook .  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain ing , for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
