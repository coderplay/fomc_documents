Policy Implementation Long-Run Monetary Frameworks

by Carolyn Shen and Alex Thorp Patricia Zobel, Sam Schulhofer-Wohl, Zeynep Senyuz, and Brian Doyle Exhibits November 7, 2018

(1) Key Takeaways

Banks' liquidity management practices have changed markedly since the crisis

At current rates relative to IOER, minimum reserve demand is likely higher than pre-crisis, but much lower than the peak reserve level of $2.8 trillion

-  Estimate from the SFOS suggests minimum reserve demand of around $800 billion o Currently no broad-based signs of unmet
- reserve need; staff will continue to monitor

In environments with a higher opportunity cost of holding reserves, banks would likely reduce reserve holdings to some degree

Questions for Discussion

- you see as the tradeoffs between remaining in a framework like the current your views on the appropriate choice of framework? 1. What do one, with abundant excess reserves, versus moving to a framework with limited excess reserves? How does the level of reserves that would ultimately be necessary in each framework affect
- bank funding rate (OBFR), a repo rate, and the general level of short-term rates (GLOSTR)? 2. In your preferred framework for policy implementation, what interest rate(s) would you prefer to target?  What do you see as the important tradeoffs in choosing among the range of possible target rates discussed in the staff background memos-the effective federal funds rate (EFFR), the overnight Treasury

- · Already, we expect China's growth to slow noticeably.
- · Even weaker growth would be expected to slow broader EME performance as well.

EME: Won't Get Fooled Again

- · Common view is that U.S. monetary policy tightening hurts EMEs.
- · But not every tightening cycle slows EME growth or leads to capital outflows.

EME: Take the money and run?

- · What is the impact on EMEs if our Tealbook baseline is realized?

Model Description

- · 4 regions - U.S., AFE, Emerging Asia (less vulnerable), Latin America (more vulnerable)
- · Allow currency depreciation to:
- · Boost inflation expectations.
- · Raise borrowing costs of vulnerable EMEs.

Calibrate

- market expectations. · Use Blue Chip consensus as starting point to capture
- TB unemployment · Then add shocks to U.S. aggregate demand to generate forecast       higher U.S. policy rates than markets.

Examine impact on foreign economies

EME: Good times, Bad times

- · Higher path of U.S. interest rates pushes down currencies abroad.
- · Foreign long-term rates also rise, especially in Latin America.
- · For AFEs and less vulnerable EMEs the boost to trade from the exchange rate outweighs the cost of higher interest rate.
- slight. · For vulnerable EMEs, the reverse is true but the drag on GDP is
