June FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April suggests that the pace of economic contraction is slowing.  Conditions in financial markets have generally improved in recent months.  Household spending has shown further signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but appear to be making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.

The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late. However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve will buy up to $300 billion of Treasury securities by autumn.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that the pace of economic contraction has abated significantly .  Conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further in recent weeks .  Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses appear to have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales but are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing.
- 2. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
- 3. With the anticipated economic recovery likely to be weak initially and inflation expectations well-anchored, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of Treasury securities to $450 billion, up from the previously announced amount of as much as $300 billion. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities. The Committee anticipates completing the full amounts of its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities by year-end . The Committee will also buy up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of this year. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  [The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. | The Committee anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintaining the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2010 ].

August FOMC Statement - Alternative B

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out .  Conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further in recent weeks .  Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.

August FOMC Statement - Alternative C

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out and that downside risks are diminishing . Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. Meanwhile, conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks .  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will continue to contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.
- 2. The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
- 3. In view of the improved economic outlook, the Committee has judged that some reduction in overall monetary stimulus is appropriate.  The Committee now expects that its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and agency debt will cumulate to about $1 trillion and about $150 billion, respectively, somewhat less than the previously announced maximum amounts. The Federal Reserve is nearing completion of its purchase of roughly $300 billion of Treasury securities. To promote a smooth transition in markets as its purchases of Treasury securities, agency debt, and agency MBS come to an end, the Committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions.  Consistent with these adjustments, the Committee now expects that its purchases of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October, and it continues to anticipate that its purchases of agency debt and MBS will be completed by the end of the year. The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Federal Reserve is carefully monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.  The Committee now anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant maintenance of the current 0 to ¼ percent range for the federal funds rate at least through the end of this year .
