- o Reduce (add) positions with high (low) volatility in a pro-cyclical way
- o Heterogeneity of investment horizons and volatility triggers
- o Assets under management much smaller than those of managed funds

(26) Policy Considerations

- 1. Staff asses that a 5 basis point technical adjustment to Interest on Required Reserves (IORR) and Interest on Excess Reserves (IOER) rates would be appropriate at this time, lowering both rates to 2.35 percent. If implemented, IOER would be 15 bps below the top of the target range and 10 bps above the bottom of the range and ON RRP.
- 2. A technical adjustment would provide time for the FOMC to learn more about the effects of distributional frictions on money market rates, and whether the gentle slope steepens further as reserves fall to new lows.
- 3. This would reduce the spread between IOER and ON RRP to 10 bps, the smallest since the introduction of the ON RRP facility. If it becomes appropriate in the future to further lower the IOER rate to foster trading in the federal funds market well within the target range, the Committee might first consider where to set the ON RRP offer rate relative to the range.
- 4. If a technical adjustment is implemented, this would be the first time such an adjustment would occur without a simultaneous increase in the target range. Even so, a change at this time, rather than between meetings, would have the benefit of concurrent communications at the Chair's press conference emphasizing the change as a technical adjustment and not a change in the stance of policy.

*The Desk conducted a purchase of the new Single Security UMBS TBA contract for June settlement. This operation was done separately from the regular monthly small value agency MBS purchases.

**For monthly Agency MBS reinvestment periods where principal receipts are below the cap, the Desk will conduct up to $300 million of small value outright purchases, though due to our operational planning timeline, purchases for the next intermeeting period are only scheduled through May 13th as this point. Monthly reinvestment periods run from the 10th business day of the current month to the 9th business day of the following month.

***The date and amount of the rollover is dependent on the small value Treasury outright sale scheduled for May 15th.

A GRUV-Y Literary Interlude

- · April 30, 1859, marked the first installment of Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities.'
- · 'It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way.'
- · Dickens:  Confused or two-handed?
- · Global Risk, Uncertainty, and Volatility (GRUV) network shares research and thinking on sources, measurement, and impact of uncertainty.
- · Two important international-related sources of uncertainty:
- · Foreign economic growth
- · Trade policy

A Tale of Foreign Economic Uncertainty

<!-- missing-text -->

Effect of U.S. Uncertainty

- · Higher U.S. uncertainty associated with a decline in IP.
- · Decline is more pronounced and statistically significant for shock to real economic uncertainty.
- · All measures weigh on equity prices.

<!-- missing-text -->

Foreign Uncertainty Pass-through to U.S.

· Foreign real economic uncertainty has significant negative effect on U.S. IP.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Shows change in log U.S. IP following a one-standard deviation change in foreign REU or global EPU. Order of variables in VAR for REU: (VIX, Foreign REU, U.S. REU, log S&amp;P500 index, Fed Fund Rates, log U.S. Employment, log U.S. CPI, log U.S. IP). Sample 1973m5 to 2018m12. Order of variables in VAR for EPU: (Foreign EPU, U.S. EPU, log S&amp;P500 index, Fed Fund Rates, log U.S. Employment, log U.S. CPI, log U.S. IP). Sample 1997m1 to 2018m12. Bootstrapped 68% Confidence Bands.

A Tale of Trade Policy Uncertainty

- · World GDP, IP, and imports have slowed sharply.
- · And trade policy uncertainty (TPU) has soared.
- · What is the quantitative impact of the spike in uncertainty?

<!-- missing-text -->

Three Approaches to Assessing TPU Effect

- (1) Aggregate VAR - extend TPU to capture variation in the 1960s and 1970s.
- (2) Firm-level Regressions - exploit sizable firm-level variation.
- (3) DSGE model w/tariffs, retaliation, and uncertainty - assume lengthy anticipation of tariff hikes and general rise in uncertainty.
- =&amp;gt; Approaches differ but results are remarkably consistent - modest drag.
- (1) Aggregate VAR: VAR on news-based TPU, investment, import tariffs, and other standard macroeconomic variables (1960:Q12018:Q3); two-std shock to TPU.
- (2) Firm-level regression: manufacturing firms (2015:Q1-18:Q4). Effect on firm investment of rise in TPU from zero to median of all firms with positive TPU. Aggregate investment effect is equal to the firm-level response (-24%), times the share of firms hit by high TPU in 2018 (10%), times the asset share of manufacturing firms in total U.S. fixed assets (43%).

Why such concern about TPU?

- · Hit to investment can be large
- · For specific industries
- · For individual firms
- · That said, this and other evidence suggest that, so far, the rise in TPU is unlikely to explain the bulk of the global slowdown in trade and GDP.

- Would need to avoid false sense of pessimism about economic outlook.

MARCH 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the labor market remains strong but that growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter.  Payroll employment was little changed in February, but job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation has declined, largely as a result of lower energy prices; inflation for items other than food and energy remains near 2 percent.  On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation have remained low in recent months, and surveybased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.  The Committee continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee will be patient as it determines what future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR APRIL/MAY 2019

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January March indicates that the labor market remains strong but and that growth of economic activity has slowed from its rose at a solid rate in the fourth quarter.
