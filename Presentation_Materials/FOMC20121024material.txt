Exhibit 3

Draft threshold language

Alternative 1

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as until the unemployment rate exceeds falls below 6½ percent, provided that inflation at a one- to two-year horizon is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.   In determining the time horizon over which it maintains a highly accommodative [ stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider the pace of improvement in labor market conditions, and other indicators of economic and financial conditions activity and prices. | The Committee may determine that the current target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate for even longer based on the pace of improvement in labor market conditions and other indicators of economic activity and prices. ] When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with maintaining continued satisfactory progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.

Alternative 2, referencing realized inflation rather than projected inflation

To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as until the unemployment rate exceeds falls below 6½ percent, provided that the 12month growth rate of the price index for personal consumption expenditures is inflation at a one- to two-year horizon is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored. A transitory increase in inflation owing to fluctuations in the prices of energy or other volatile components of the price index would not necessarily by itself warrant an increase in the target range. [ In determining the time horizon over which it maintains a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider the pace of improvement in labor market conditions, and other indicators of economic and financial conditions activity and prices. | The Committee may determine that the current target range for the federal funds rate is appropriate for even longer based on the pace of improvement in labor market conditions and other indicators of economic activity and prices. ]  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with maintaining continued satisfactory progress toward maximum employment in a context of price stability.

Questions for FOMC Discussion on Quantitative Thresholds

- 1. Do you think it would be beneficial to express the Committee's forward guidance on the funds rate using numerical thresholds?
- 2. If the Committee were to incorporate such thresholds into the forward guidance:
- a. Should the thresholds replace the date-based guidance or be combined with the date-based guidance?  If you think they should be combined, would you do that routinely or only as a transition when the thresholds are first introduced?
- b. What variables should the thresholds reference?   Regarding inflation, should the thresholds reference actual inflation or a projection?  What should the numerical values be for the variables used?
- c. In what way, if at all, should the language indicate that the Committee may tighten policy before any thresholds are crossed?
- d. In what way, if at all, should the Committee provide guidance about the timing of liftoff after a threshold is crossed and the likely course of policy after the initial increase in the funds rate target?

SEPTEMBER FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that economic activity has continued to expand at a moderate pace in recent months. Growth in employment has been slow, and the unemployment rate remains elevated. Household spending has continued to advance, but growth in business fixed investment appears to have slowed.  The housing sector has shown some further signs of improvement, albeit from a depressed level.  Inflation has been subdued, although the prices of some key commodities have increased recently.  Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  Furthermore, strains in global financial markets continue to pose significant downside risks to the economic outlook.  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month.  The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgagebacked securities.  These actions, which together will increase the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee also decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate are likely to be warranted at least through mid-2015.

Review of the Consensus Forecast Initiative Exhibit 1

Key lessons from the consensus forecast exercises

- A consensus forecast would necessarily go beyond the Committee's postmeeting policy statement (as it is currently designed) by outlining the Committee's intentions over the next several years.
- Reaching a consensus on the appropriate medium- and longer-term policy path could be extremely difficult.
- Presenting a consensus medium- and longer-term policy path could lead to communications challenges.
- Exercises also revealed some important production-related challenges.
- Impossible to guarantee the production of a forecast that incorporates the Committee's policy decision in time for the Chairman's press conference.
- Participants appear to be unclear about how they should determine whether they support the proposed consensus outlook.

Avenues for further exploration?

Possible enhancements to the SEP

- Explore the possibility of formally voting on the medium- and longerterm policy path and incorporating the resulting decision into the postmeeting statement.
- Examine the feasibility of conditioning the consensus forecast on market expectations for policy.
- Publish projections under a set of 'bracketing' policy alternatives.
- Include medians of the projections of participants who voted for or otherwise supported the policy action.
- Distinguish voters from non voters -in the SEP.
- Publish the full matrix of SEP submissions, with or without attribution.

Given the limited information provided in FOMC statements about the likely future paths of the  edera   unds ra e and the ba ance shee , how should those paths on which a f l f t l t consensus forecast would be conditioned be selected from among the wide range of paths that are consistent with the FOMC statement?
- B. Should a consensus forecast be conditioned on the policy decision taken at the meeting, even though this would require that publication of the consensus forecast be pushed back to some significant period of time after the meeting?  Or should the forecast be conditioned on a policy assumption that would allow publication immediately following the meeting, but does not necessarily reflect the policy decision taken at the meeting?
- C. Does asking participants whether they broadly endorse the forecast (perhaps subject to specific qualifications) or, alternatively, have essentially different views, provide sufficient clarity about the support for the consensus forecast?  Does support for the policy decision taken a  the mee ng ( t ti i.e. ting  or the po cy dec s on-or,  or nonvoting partic pan s, f li i i f i t , vo indicating support for the decision) imply endorsement of the consensus forecast, and vice versa?
- D. Would the Committee endorse producing a consensus forecast at each FOMC meeting?

2.  Questions pertaining to possible enhancements of the SEP

If the Committee were to pursue enhancements of the SEP instead of a consensus forecast, which of the following steps would you support?

- A. Publishing the median projection of voters supporting the statement.
- B. Publishing the scatterplot of the combinations of unemployment and inflation expected to prevail at the time of first increase of the federal funds rate.
- C. Publishing information about whether a particular projection was made by a current voting member.
- D. Publishing additional information related to balance sheet actions (such as the time and/or conditions at which asset purchases are expected to end, or a path for the size of the balance sheet).

Questions for Discussion (continued)

2.  Questions pertaining to possible enhancements of the SEP (continued)

- E. Releasing with the SEP the full matrix of multivariate projections, with or without the names associated with individual multivariate forecasts.
- F. Circulating among FOMC participants individual SEP submissions with the names of tic pan s attached. i t par
- G. Releasing additional information, and if so, what and when.

3.  Assessment of the direction of the consensus forecast initiative

In your view, should the Committee aim to publish a consensus forecast, including a narrative explaining its economic rationale and a diversity-of-views section, or should it aim to enhance the SEP?

With respect to your preferred outcome, what other types of exercises should the Committee undertake before it released new information to the public?  In what timeframe do you expect the Committee would be ready  o go public? t
