13. Why the Yield Curve Inverts in the Baseline Forecast

In the baseline forecast:

- · The unemployment rate is below its natural rate (U*), and needs to come back up to U*.
- · Otherwise, inflation would remain above 2 percent.
- · In order to raise the unemployment rate, our policy rule boosts the funds rate above the 10-year rate.
- · During the period when the unemployment rate is rising, GDP growth is projected to be positive but low…
- o … and only relatively modest negative shocks would be sufficient to tip the economy into recession.

There are multiple ways the baseline projection could be wrong…

Each  red diamond  is the median value, for the indicated  year,  of the set of prescriptions  for  the  federal  funds  rate  that  are generated  by  inserting  into the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule each participant's projections of core PCE  inflation and the unemployment  rate along  with  the  participant's  projections  of  the  longer-run  nominal  federal  funds  rate  and  longer-run  unemployment  rate. The  green  squares  are  the  medians  of  prescriptions  generated  using  the  inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule. The  red  and  green whiskers  show  the  central tendency,  for each year, of the prescriptions  that result from  using the non-inertial Taylor (1999)  rule  and  the  inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule,  respectively.

- Funds rate at lower end of range of longer-run estimates.
- Longer-run estimates are uncertain.
- Federal funds rate has moved up, asset purchase effects have been waning.
- Assessment of stance increasingly uncertain.

AUGUST 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Household spending and business fixed investment have grown strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
