Uncertainty, Risks, and Policy Choices

Current Areas of Uncertainty

Uncertainty and Policy Strategies

- lower than you currently estimate? * Is u
- How much resource pressure will be required to return inflation to 2 percent?
- Could prolonged, tight resource utilization lead to financial instability or a rapid increase in inflation?
- What is the probability of achieving a "soft landing"?

* Uncertainty and Misperception about u

- * Previous research: if u is uncertain, appropriate to focus more strongly on stabilizing inflation.
- This strategy has less force in current circumstances; baseline outlook has:
- Significant undershooting of unemployment and inflation.
- A very flat short-run Phillips curve.

Additional Considerations

- Could inflation expectations erode?
- Is the loss function symmetric?
- Is undershooting unemployment less costly than overshooting?
- Could low unemployment lead to the emergence of financial stability risks or hysteresis effects?
- * Level of u consistent with stable inflation.
- Two key parameters of the Phillips curve:
- Resource utilization-inflation link.
- Persistence of movements in inflation.
- Three policy strategies.
- Tradeoffs depend on prevalence of supply shocks.

Steeper Phillips Curve

- Under any strategy, unemployment undershooting generates a larger shift up in inflation.
- Inflation below 1 percent or above 4 percent unlikely.
- But moving inflation closer to target is costly in terms of unemployment.
- A balanced-approach rule outperforms a rule that responds strongly to inflation.

Policy Implications

- Alternative  B:
- Acknowledges downside inflation miss;
- With a strong labor market and stable inflation expectations, gradual path of rate hikes remains appropriate.
- Alternative A:
- More forceful policy response to low inflation appropriate.
- Alternative C:
- Need to slow employment and real activity to sustainable rates.

FOMCSTATEMENT SEPTEMBER 2017

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in July indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising moderately so far this year.  Job gains have remained solid in recent months, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.  On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and the measure excluding food and energy prices have declined this year and are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longerterm inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria have devastated many communities, inflicting severe hardship.  Storm-related disruptions and rebuilding will affect economic activity in the near term, but past experience suggests that the storms are unlikely to materially alter the course of the national economy over the medium term.  Consequently, the Committee continues to expect that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor market conditions will strengthen somewhat further. Higher prices for gasoline and some other items in the aftermath of the hurricanes will likely boost inflation temporarily; apart from that effect, inflation on a 12-month basis is expected to remain somewhat below 2 percent in the near term but to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1 to 1- 1/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting some further strengthening in labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

- 5. In October, the Committee will initiate the balance sheet normalization program described in the June 2017 Addendum to the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.
