Policy Issues and Market Expectations

Three Significant Issues

State-Contingent Plan

- · Whether to provide a contingent plan for bringing the purchase program to a close
- · How to allocate reductions in purchases across Treasuries and MBS
- · Whether to change the forward guidance for the federal funds rate

<!-- missing-text -->

Source: Morgan Stanley, Bloomberg, and July Primary Dealer Survey.

Possible Changes to the Forward Guidance for the Federal Funds Rate

- · Lower the unemployment rate threshold
- · Add an inflation floor
- · Provide information on the federal funds rate path after liftoff
- · Benefits
- · Could clarify that the Committee agrees with and endorses the Chairman's recent statements
- · Automatic adjustment of market expectations
- · Possible drawback
- · If the economy performs poorly, the result could be a very large purchase program or a need to reduce purchases for reasons not emphasized in the plan

JUNE FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions have shown further improvement in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further, but fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but longerterm inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall. The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives.
- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the

Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy, the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.

FOMC STATEMENT-JULY 2013 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May June suggests that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate modest pace in recent months . Although some labor market conditions indicators have shown further improvement, in recent months, on balance, but the unemployment rate remains elevated.  Household spending and business fixed investment advanced, and the housing sector has strengthened further been strengthening , but mortgage rates have risen somewhat and fiscal policy is restraining economic growth.  Partly reflecting transitory influences, inflation has been running below the Committee's longer-run objective, but even though longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pick up from its recent pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the downside risks to the outlook for the economy and the labor market as having diminished since the fall , but a substantial tightening of financial conditions would pose a risk to the economic outlook .  The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely will run at or below its 2 percent objective recognizes that the persistence of very low inflation could pose risks to economic performance, but it anticipates that, with appropriate policy accommodation, inflation will move up to its 2 percent objective over the medium term, and possibly slightly higher for a time.
- 3. To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee decided to continue purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month and longer-term Treasury securities at a pace of $45 billion per month.  The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction.  Taken together, these actions should maintain downward pressure on longerterm interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative.
- 4. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months.  The Committee will continue its purchases of Treasury and agency mortgage-backed securities, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate, until the outlook for the labor market has improved substantially in a context of price stability.  In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will continue to take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases as well as the extent of progress toward its economic objectives. The Committee's decisions regarding asset purchases are not on a preset course and will continue to be contingent on the incoming data. Specifically, as the Chairman has outlined, if the economy evolves about as expected, the Committee anticipates moderating the pace of its securities

purchases later this year, but continuing purchases until the unemployment rate is about 7 percent, economic growth is sufficient to support continuing solid job gains, and inflation is moving back toward its 2 percent longer-run goal. The Committee is prepared to increase or reduce the pace of its purchases as necessary to maintain appropriate policy accommodation as the outlook for the labor market or inflation changes.

- 5. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee expects that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and currently anticipates that maintaining this exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ [ 6 | 5½ ] percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longerterm inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.  In determining how long to maintain a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy after a threshold has been crossed , the Committee will also consider other information, including additional measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent. Specifically, so long as inflation remains near the Committee's longerrun objective and inflation expectations remain well anchored, increases in the federal funds rate, once they begin, are likely to be gradual until the economy is nearing maximum employment.

- 5 .  To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, ′ the Committee decided to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee expects today reaffirmed its view that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy , including very low short-term interest rates and ongoing, substantial Federal Reserve holdings of longer-term securities, will remain appropriate for a considerable time after the asset purchase program ends and the economic recovery strengthens.  In particular, the Committee and currently anticipates that this continues to anticipate that the current exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as the unemployment rate remains above 6½ percent, inflation between one and two years ahead is projected to be no more than a half percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.
