- · If the stock market crashes, the extent of monetary stimulus that could be put in place immediately might be less than desired.
- · Worse, falling inflation would cause real rates to rise while the nominal funds rate is stuck at zero, exacerbating the situation.
- · In this example the economy can recover because the baseline path incorporates enough potential stimulus to offset a major shock.
- · But if the baseline outlook for the funds rate had been flat at its current level, the unemployment rate would have remained high and deflation would have set in.

Exhibit 2 The Economics of the Zero Bound

- · Key assumptions for our analysis:
- /G3c monetary policy affects real activity primarily through its ability to alter the real funds rate, and thereby influence asset prices through arbitrage
- /G3c 'quantity' effects of monetary policy are not that important
- /G3c inflation displays inertia and depends on expectations and resource utilization
- · Under such conditions, the zero bound:
- /G3c limits the magnitude of the monetary stimulus immediately available to offset shocks
- /G3c leads to an erosion in monetary stimulus as inflation falls
- /G3c destabilizes the economy if the erosion problem is severe enough - a deflationary trap
- · Practical importance of the stability threat depends on several factors:
- /G3c responsiveness of output and inflation to changes in the real funds rate
- /G3c magnitude and persistence of disturbances to the economy
- /G3c responsiveness of monetary policy to changes in output and inflation
- /G3c extent of average maneuvering room - inflation target plus R*

Exhibit 3

Quantitative Implications of the Zero Bound for Economic Stability

- · Goal - estimate the effect on average economic performance of lowering the target rate of inflation (which makes the zero bound more of a constraint on policy)
- · Approach - simulate the FRB/US model under rational expectations, subject to shocks like those experienced over the past 35 years
- · Policy assumption - the Taylor rule
- /G3c I  = R*  + t t /G42 t + .5 GAP  + .5 ( t /G42 t -/G42 *)
- /G3c I is the nominal funds rate, R* is the equilibrium real rate, GAP is the output gap, /G42 is the four-quarter rate of core inflation, and /G42 * is the inflation target.

Main Lessons from Stochastic Simulation Analysis

- · At low target rates of inflation, the funds rate falls to zero frequently.
- · Because policy is often constrained, economic performance deteriorates for inflation targets below 2 percent or so.

Average Macroeconomic Performance Under the Taylor Rule

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1. Deep recessions defined as downturns during which the unemployment rate peaks at or above 7-1/2 percent (2-1/4 percentage points above the long-run NAIRU in the simulations).

Exhibit 4

Policy Design in a Low Inflation Environment - More Responsive Rules

More responsive rules:

- · Adjust the funds rate by more than the Taylor rule following a change in output.
- · May also be more responsive to movements in inflation, if desired.

Advantages:

- · Inflation tends to be closer to target when shocks hit, making deflation less likely.
- · Policy moves more quickly and thereby limits the severity of recessions, making deflation less likely.

Economic Performance Under Rules With Alternative Degrees of Responsiveness 1

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1. Output gap coefficient equals 1.0 in the more responsive rule,  0.5 in the Taylor rule.

Potential Drawbacks of More Responsive Rules

- · Heightened funds rate variability and more frequent policy reversals
- · Greater risk of policy mistakes because of data errors and supply-side mismeasurement
- · Increased risk of confidence crisis if investors become unnerved by Fed 'impotence'

Exhibit 5

Another Policy Option - Asymmetric Responsiveness

Asymmetric rules (illustrative example):

- · Under most conditions respond according to the Taylor rule.
- · But if the Taylor rule wants a funds rate below 1 percent, drop immediately to zero.

Advantages:

- · Reduces the stabilization costs associated with the zero bound.
- · Minimizes funds rate variability and the frequency of policy reversals.

Economic Performance Under the Taylor and Asymmetric Funds Rate Rules

<!-- missing-text -->

- 1. Asymmetric rule is the same as the Taylor rule, except that when the Taylor rule prescribes a nominal funds rate below 1 percent, the asymmetric rule reduces the funds rate immediately to zero.

Potential Drawbacks of Asymmetric Rules

- · To be effective, investor expectations must correctly incorporate the implications of asymmetric behavior.
- · But asymmetric rules may be difficult to understand in practice.

Exhibit 6

Price-Level Targeting and Other Policies that Promise Above-Average Inflation in the Future

Price-level targeting and similar strategies:

- · Pledge to keep the funds rate unusually low following a zero bound episode in order to keep inflation above average for a time.
- · Automatic under price-level targeting, because bygones are not bygones - any fall in the price level below target must be made up later.

Advantages:

- · By creating the expectation that the future stance of policy will be 'easy' for a time, real bond rates today are reduced during zero bound episodes.
- · As a result, the severity of recessions and the risk of deflation decreases.
- · Research indicates potential effectiveness.

Disadvantages:

- · Such strategies imply periodically taking 'unusual' actions, such as allowing inflation to drift well above its long-run target.
- · For this reason, the public may doubt the likelihood that the central bank will actually deliver on its promises, rendering the strategy ineffective.

Exhibit 7 Main Lessons

- · In low inflation environments, the nominal funds rate falls to zero frequently.
- · Usually this only delays economic recovery because most disturbances are sufficiently transitory and moderate in magnitude.
- · But the economy can become severely destabilized if significant deflation sets in.
- · Monetary policy can mitigate the effects of the zero bound in several ways:
- /G3c Aim for a long-run average rate of CPI inflation that is not too low.
- /G3c Respond relatively aggressively to movements in output and inflation.
- /G3c Pursue policies that promise higher inflation following zero bound episodes.
- · FRB/US analysis suggests no advantage in 'keeping your powder dry.'

Monetary Policy at the Zero Bound on Nominal Interest Rates

Marvin Goodfriend Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond January 29, 2002

Quantitative Monetary Policy at the Zero Bound

- · Usually, open market operations constrained to accommodate demand for monetary base at opportunity cost spread between intended funds rate and zero bound
- · Monetary base free to expand further at the zero bound
- · Central bank can pursue quantitative monetary policy at the zero bound

2

Narrow and Broad Liquidity

- · To appreciate power of quantitative policy at the zero bound--distinguish between narrow and broad liquidity services
- · Narrow liquidity services provided by the medium of exchange allow banks and the public to economize on transactions costs
- · At zero interest, narrow liquidity is no longer scarce and that channel of monetary transmission is exhausted

Broad Liquidity Services

- · Broad liquidity services are not exhausted, and provide the leverage for quantitative monetary policy
- · Broad liquidity is a service yield provided by assets according to how easily they can be turned into cash either by sale or by serving as collateral for external finance

3

4

Broad Liquidity Services (2)

- · Broad liquidity services are valued because they minimize the exposure of households and firms to the external finance premium
- · The existence of an external finance premium gives rise to a demand for broadly liquid assets variously referred to as-precautionary savings, a liquid buffer stock, or self-insurance

Expanding Broad Liquidity

- · Quantitative policy must expand broad liquidity to be stimulative at the zero bound
- · Open market purchases of short-term bonds would not expand broad liquidity much
- · Open market purchases of long-term bonds, other assets could increase broad liquidity
- · Broad liquidity could be created by monetizing a government budget deficit

5

6

The Transmission Mechanism

- · The portfolio rebalancing channel--
- · Increase in broad liquidity reduces the marginal implicit broad liquidity services yield on monetary assets
- · Portfolio balance requires a similar fall in the explicit yield on non-monetary assets
- · Prices of non-monetary assets bid up to restore the required return differential.

7

The Transmission Mechanism (2)

- · Higher asset prices raise desired consumption out of current income
- · Higher asset prices relative to their cost of production revive investment
- · Reduced saving rate and increased investment demand raise employment
- · Higher utilization rates and profits raise asset prices further

8

The Transmission Mechanism (3)

- · The credit channel--
- · Higher asset prices raise collateral values, increase net worth, and raise bank capital
- · The external finance premium comes down
- · Credit spreads narrow, bank lending revives, spending rises as cost of borrowing against future income prospects falls

Implementation Problems

- · Injection of monetary base can provide impulse to get recovery going
- · Self-sustaining recovery requires confidence that base money will be expanded as much and for as long as needed
- · To acquire such credibility, must overcome perception of central bank concern with inflationary risk of high money growth

10

9

Implementation Problems (2)

- · Relatively small changes in bank reserves suffice to support interest rate policy
- · At the zero bound, policy must exert its effect through broad liquidity
- · This will require large-scale injections of base money, substantially increasing the size of the central bank balance sheet

11

Fiscal Support for Quantitative Policy

- · Full credibility for quantitative policy at the zero bound requires more support from the fiscal authorities than usual
- · There might not be enough long bonds to buy in order to expand the monetary base; central bank could buy other assets, but...
- · Either way, capital losses might leave central bank with insufficient assets to reverse excess base money

12

Fiscal Support for Quantitative Policy (2)

- · Fiscal authorities could provide the central bank with additional government debt to sell to drain excess base money
- · Alternatively, fiscal authorities could agree to run a budget deficit at the central bank's request as means of injecting broad liquidity

13

Fiscal Support for Quantitative Policy (3)

- · Central bank could monetize short-term debt issued to finance the deficit, and withdraw excess base money later by selling that debt to the public
- · In any case, the government must accept that quantitative policy actions at the zero bound could significantly increase government debt in the hands of the public

14

Fiscal Support for Quantitative Policy (4)

- · An inadequate commitment by the fiscal authorities to support the central bank could block the use of quantitative policy at the zero bound
- · A prearranged agreement could enable quantitative policy to act credibly, flexibly, and effectively at the zero bound

15

16

Other Policy Options

- · Do nothing unusual
- · Commit to holding the funds rate at zero
- · Buy foreign exchange/depreciate the exchange rate
- · Expand credit policy
- · Pursue deliberately inflationary policy

Do Nothing Unusual

- · Keep funds rate at zero without increasing the monetary base more than necessary
- · Contraction likely deeper than usual
- · Two risks of more protracted downturn--
- · Distressed banking system, less elastic inside supply of broad liquidity than usual
- · Policy vacuum encourages ill-advised fiscal actions

17

Commit to Holding the Funds Rate at Zero

- · Central bank would write options on future short rates to give itself an incentive to keep rates down
- · Advantage, acts directly on long rates
- · Disadvantage, at best small effect
- · Credibility doubtful given overwhelming pressure to take interest rate policy actions deemed correct at a point in time

18

Buy Foreign Assets/Depreciate the Exchange Rate

- · Different, but both make use of openness
- · Could buy foreign government securities to help increase broad liquidity--
- · Authorized to do so, but exchange rate risk
- · Depreciate exchange rate--
- · Conventional policy instrument, but US large, not that open, might export deflation and recession without helping itself much

Expand Credit Policy

- · Expand DW lending or buy private debt
- · Reduce private credit spreads and help finance credit-constrained firms
- · Wide latitude to lend to banks on collateral, need legislation to buy private debt
- · Central bank would make a poor financial intermediary--use to stabilize financial markets but not for general policy stimulus

20

19

Expand Credit Policy (2)

- · Quantitative monetary policy would facilitate intermediation
- · Would reduce external finance premium by raising collateral values and net worth
- · Central bank could improve the flow of credit without becoming financial intermediary itself

21

Pursue Deliberately Inflationary Policy

- · Quantitative monetary policy could stimulate economy at zero bound without creating inflation or expected inflation
- · Unleashing inflation would buy little and could be counterproductive
- · Temporary inflation would be desirable to reverse prior deflation that raised real value of nominal debt

22

Pursue Deliberately Deflationary Policy (2)

- · Committing to a path for the price level could help avoid deflation, and build credibility for reflation if deflation occurs
