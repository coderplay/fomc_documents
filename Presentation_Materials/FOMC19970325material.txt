FOMC NOTES - PRF March 25, 1997

Mr.  Chairman:

I will be  referring to  the package of  color charts distributed at the table.

Since your last meeting, market expectations have shifted:

- Here in the U.S., the economy is  perceived to be  stronger and there are pronounced expectations for an  increase in rates by  the Committee;
- In  Germany, there is  a  sense that the economy is less weak than previously feared,and lingering expectations for  an ease in rates by  the Bundesbank have been unwound;
- In  Japan, despite the current pace of economic activity, the dominant presumption among market participants continues to be that the economy will slow in  the months ahead.

Looking at the first page of charts, you  can  see that U.S. short-term forward rates have been moving higher since midFebruary, punctuated by  the Chairman's Humphrey-Hawkins testimony and the retail sales figures.

German forward rates rose more gradually, as data releases pointed toward a  moderate recovery and increasing confidence in forecasts of 2  percent plus growth for the year.

Japanese forward rates rose off their very low  levels toward the  end of  the period. This shift --  which was much  more pronounced in  the Euro-Yen futures contract --  may only reflect year-end noise or  could reflect a  more significant questioning of the  entrenched assumption that the Japanese economy will slow.

At  the top  of  the second page: you  can see that U.S. and German long-term rates have been backing up.

Despite rising yields in  most bond markets, Japanese 10-year rates declined during the  period --  reaching a  new  historic low of 2.19 percent on  March 17th --  but now just recently backed-up off these lows.

- Although there has been the strong presumption that the Japanese economy will slow in  the  months ahead, as  a consequence of  the increased consumption tax  and decreased government outlays in  the new  fiscal year,

there is  at least some possibility that --  as the authorities keep saying --  the forces of the autonomous recovery will be  sustained.

- The recent strong data, coupled with the Bank of Japan's apparent willingness to  let the call money rate drift up  above the Discount Rate in  recent days are putting at least something of  a  risk in  the market that the economy may indeed sustain its  momentum into the new fiscal year and  that a  BoJ rate increase might not be too  far  off.
- This morning the  Bank of Japan, through inaction, left the  market in  surplus, but call is still trading above the  ODR.
- Last summer, you  may  recall, it was  widely assumed that the Bank of  Japan would follow any increase in  rates by the  Federal Reserve.
- Thus, year-end, window-dressing demand for  JGB's may  be obscuring the  risks of  a  rising rate environment that are creeping at the short-end.

At  the bottom of  the page, you  can see that the dollar came off its highs against both the mark and  the  yen.

- The  yen  showed more of a  direct reaction to  Secretary Rubin's changed rhetoric and  the  G-7 statement, as the market braced itself for intervention. The  expectation of heavy repatriation flows also helped strengthen the  yen a bit. But these flows did  not  materialize --  at least to  the extent feared --  and  as  this became apparent and as the threat of intervention faded, the yen  has been gently weakening during March.
- Dollar-mark showed hardly any  response to the G-7 statement. The  moderation of the  dollar's rise against the mark reflected the somewhat improved German outlook as  well as the unwinding of short-mark positions into other European markets, as the probabilities of an  on-time EMU  declined.
- It is  worth pausing to  note the  two-pronged nature of the markets' assessment: the  German economy may  be somewhat stronger than previously thought, but it  does not --at least at  present --  appear to  be strong

- enough to  enable Germany's fiscal performance to encourage much optimism that EMU  can  occur on  target and  on  schedule.

Turning to  the third page: you can see what I  think are noteworthy differences in  asset market behavior.

- In  the top  panel, you  can  see four U.S. equity indices: the Dow  Jones Industrial Average, the S&amp;amp;P 500, the  Russell 2000 and  the  NASDAQ composite and, for  perspective, the  German DAX  and  Japanese Nikkei --  all re-indexed to  January 1st, as they traded through last Friday.
- While the Dow  and  the S&amp;amp;P 500 --  depicted in  the darker green lines --  have retreated from the  peaks they reached after your last meeting, they are still trading well above where they started the year.
- Other segments of  the market, however, represented by  the Russell 2000 and  the NASDAQ, have lost all of the gains they registered in  January and  are  now  in  negative territory on the year.

In  the  bottom panel you can  see:

- Three indices of corporate debt, and  Canadian 10-year government bonds, expressed in  terms of the  basis point changes in their spreads to  comparable U.S. Treasury yields since the start of  the year.
- (In  the box  you  can also see the  absolute level of these spreads at the start of the  year, at your last meeting, and last Friday.)
- It surprised me  to  see that these spreads all narrowed in March, at the very time that market participants were increasingly expecting a  firming in  policy by  the Committee and  Treasury yields were backing up.
- To  a  great extent, the narrowing in  these spreads reflects the back-up in  Treasury yields and  the resilience in  corporate issues and  the Canadian bond.
- While some lag in  the adjustment of  corporate yields to Treasuries is not uncommon, the extent of their resilience is  being noted in  the markets.
- There are some indications that the  brokerage houses are encouraging investors to  move into corporate debt as  a "safer" alternative to  the stock market --  reaching for yield by  placing a  heavier weight on  corporate debt.

- Such strategies are frequently linked to  the widespread view that, if  the Committee raises rates today, it is unlikely that this would begin a  tightening sequence of more than 50 or  75  basis points.
- Thus, there are many who see the anticipated degree of tightening as being unlikely to induce a  recession and, therefore, unlikely to  erode significantly the profitability of  major corporations or  to  trigger a deterioration in  the quality of corporate credit.
- The divergent performance of the  major stock indices and  of  the small cap indices could also reflect a defensive positioning on  the part of investment managers, favoring the  more-liquid, lower risk, blue chips.
- Yesterday's simultaneous rally in  the Dow  and decline in  the  NASDAQ appears to  be  consistent with such a  pattern.
- Also consistent with the  pattern of fixed-income market trading, 10-year Canadian government bond spreads have rallied since the start of the  year, and  have been trading below the 10-year Treasury since your last meeting --reversing their more typical spread over Treasuries.

Turning to  domestic operations: We  completed 6 billion in coupon purchases in  five separate passes between February 14th and  March 12th, addressing some of the  building reserve needs.

- Spreading these purchases out over several weeks, and announcing the quantities purchased after the conclusion of each operation, has done as  much as I had  hoped to  reduce the sometimes-disturbing impact of  our  outright purchases on the  market.

On  many days during the period, the funds market traded on  the soft side.

- You can  see this on  page 4,  where the top  panel shows the daily range, and  the bottom panel the standard deviation around the daily effective, from the start of  the year. In between you can  see the  period average effective rates.
- The softness since the end  of  January appears to  be  a  byproduct of the high excess holdings banks acquired early in the  maintenance periods since your last meeting, as we provided additional reserves to  deal with heavy payment-flow days which happened to  fall at the start of these periods.

- This soft tendency pretty much disappeared beginning with the  March 17th corporate tax  payment date a  week ago  Monday.
- On  that date, the Treasury account came in  2  and  half billion higher than our estimates, but the pressure on the funds market was minimal.
- On  the following day, however, we  had  an  impressive 6  billion dollar miss in  the Treasury balance, as tax payments exceeded our forecasts. This miss left only 12.4 billion in  operating balances --  a  new record low, well surpassing the previous low  of 15.3 billion.
- Only late in the day did  this significant shortfall exert upward pressure on  the market, bringing the funds rate up  to  a  high of 10  percent and leading to  adjustment borrowing at the window of about 1 billion.
- As  we  often observe, the impact of firm conditions on  one  day lingered, and  the funds rate traded with a  firm tone following these misses.
- In the last few  days, the funds rates has come under some upward pressure from widespread expectations of  an increase in  rates at  this meeting.

Looking forward, I would like to request that the Committee again approve an  increase in  our intermeeting leeway from 8  to  12 billion for the same reasons I mentioned at  your last meeting.

- We  have allowed needs to  grow and  we  find ourselves comfortable working with these larger needs. But  with another extended inter-meeting period of  almost two  months, the risks that the future will not conform to  our forecasts could cause needs to  grow larger yet.
- I  think it likely that we  would undertake a  bill pass early in  the  period for  between 4  and  6  billion and I  would like the additional 6 billion in leeway to  provide room for:
- the possibility of additional outright operations to meet the large remaining needs;
- --the risks that needs grow  even more than expected; and
- - -the risk that

On  a  separate topic, members of  the Committee have received copies of  our  annual reports on  open market and foreign currency operations and I  hope you  have also received a  copy of  my memorandum.

As  I  mentioned, I would like to  include in  the public version of  the Desk's annual report on  open market operations the appendix which contains the detailed listing of the System's holdings of  each issue of securities.

- I  hope that doing this will help market participants better understand the publicly-available amounts of  each issue and further remove any lingering mystery from our  outright operations.
- I  had  been under the impression that this had  never been done; however, Norm recalled that the  Board's annual report had  included a  listing of  coupon issues until 1981, but we have been unable to  ascertain why  this was discontinued.

Mr. Chairman, we  had  no  foreign exchange interventions during the  period.

Thus, I  will need two votes from the Committee:

- One for  approval to increase the intermeeting leeway to  12 billion; and
- --One  to  ratify the  Desk's domestic operations.
- I  also hope the  members of  the Committee will not object to my  proposal that we  re-establish the tradition of  publishing a end-of-year snap-shot of SOMA's securities holdings, despite a 16-year hiatus.
- I would be  happy to answer questions you  may  have about this proposal or  any  other aspect of  my  report.

FOMC Briefing

Michael J.  Prell

March 25, 1997

I thought I might begin by  recounting an  interesting experience I had last week. At a  dinner for new Reserve Bank directors, I found myself sitting between a  small-town banker and a big city industrialist. They were carrying on  a  debate that captured nicely some of  the issues before you  today.

The  banker started by  saying that the  businesses he'd been talking with were reporting that labor markets had gotten really tight and that they were granting bigger pay  increases and intended to pass their higher costs along in price hikes. He  thought that a  Fed tightening step now  would reduce the risks of  greater pain later. The industrialist then proceeded to recount how  his firm was requiring suppliers to  trim prices year after year and was telling workers that, if  they didn't like taking lump sum  payments in lieu of  base-pay increases, the company would just move operations to  Utah or  Mexico; in  his view, there was no risk of a  pickup in inflation in  this new, open economy where the Internet gives firms and customers instant information about the best prices--and even what is  tantamount to an electronic auction market. From his perspective, real interest rates are already high and an  increase would needlessly sacrifice opportunities for real growth.

I  suppose that one would have to characterize our Greenbook forecast as  being more aligned with the banker's traditional view than with the industrialist's "new age" view. We  take that position with some nervousness, but I must emphasize that our nervousness isn't onesided. For, while we grant that the industrialist has a  point, we also see grounds for worrying that we  may be  entering a  more inflationary boom than is described in  our baseline scenario.

On  the latter score, it's clear that the economy has been quite strong thus far this year. Moreover, one is hard-pressed to identify any imminent threats to at least moderate growth in  coming quarters. To be  sure, the January trade figures, which came out after the Greenbook was completed, were quite weak--but that was basically confirmation of  our projection for the sector. Meanwhile, there's no inventory overhang to damp production in  the near term. The recent

surge in  consumer demand appears to  have been supported mainly by rapid increases in  jobs and labor income; people have not  had to  drain their savings accounts and, instead, wealth has continued to accumulate.

It doesn't take  much of  a  stretch of  the  imagination to transmute these comments regarding the limited risks of  a  major shortfall in  growth into a  description of  a  meaningful economic boom. Although the stock market has been wavering of  late, we  wouldn't rule out the possibility that share prices might move appreciably higher; there's still a  lot of  liquidity, as the commentators say. And, while we're not uncomfortable with the notion that people will tend to keep their capital gains tucked away for future college tuitions or retirement, it's not hard to envision their opening their purses a  bit wider for current consumption or to  buy  a  bigger residence or a vacation home. Stronger household spending would in  turn have accelerator effects on business fixed investment--which might, in any event, be  driven to  higher levels than  we've forecast by  the rapid obsolescence of  existing equipment and the incipient wave of enthusiasm in  office and hotel construction. And, of  course, any greater strength in  final demand is likely to  generate pressures to build inventories more substantially.

All things considered, then, we  think that it's quite reasonable for you  to factor into your thinking the notion that it probably will require at least some tightening of  financial conditions to rein in aggregate demand and prevent resource utilization rates-particularly labor utilization--from moving appreciably higher. But that leads to  the other key  question for policy: Need one be concerned about higher utilization, or  should one stay on  the sidelines and applaud it?

As you  know, we're projecting only a  mild further acceleration of  compensation over the course of  1997 and '98. And  we have the core CPI accelerating but a  smidge this year and then only to 3-1/4 percent in 1998. Still, this is a  change in the direction of the underlying trend, and it implies the risk of  a  building inflationary momentum over time that might necessitate a  more wrenching correction to  halt.

It's certainly possible that we're being too pessimistic about inflation, but we  don't see it as probable that we're way off

the mark in  the broad sweep of  our assessment. Perhaps even in a tighter labor market, workers would be  sufficiently intimidated by  the risk of  jobs being moved that they  wouldn't seek a bigger piece of  the pie. That hypothesis seems difficult to  maintain, however, in the face of  indications that wages have in  fact been accelerating. And there are only so  many people in  Utah willing to  work at the currently prevailing wage. Although a  strong dollar might make substitution of foreign workers or suppliers a more attractive alternative than we've anticipated, one wonders how far that process can go  before the international financial markets become uneasy about mounting U.S. trade deficits; indeed, we  have built in some downward pressures on the dollar on  these grounds.

If one discounts that story, then, stable inflation with tighter labor markets would appear to require either that firms give up some of  their profits to  workers or  that they accelerate their productivity improvements. There may  be hints of  a  squeeze on profitability in  the occasional anecdote, but on the  whole, to date, there is not much to suggest that this phenomenon has taken on  macrosignificance. Nonetheless, our forecast does anticipate that the erosion of  margins will become important in  damping the transmission of rising unit labor costs to prices.

More interesting, perhaps, is  the latter possibility--that is, that productivity gains can  be enlarged. One might think that the opportunities in  this regard would diminish cyclically, but there is some hint in  the recent behavior of  wages, prices, and profits that firms may  have found ways of  stepping up their pace of  productivity improvement. Perhaps this is a  sign that firms are now reaping the benefits of  technology investments that seemed to  be eluding them earlier. Optimism in  this regard has not proven particularly wise in the past, but  we  have in a  sense made a  small allowance for a productivity boost by  forecasting increases in output per hour in 1997-98 that considerably exceed the measured average of  the past several years--a pattern that runs counter to  what might be expected on  the basis of  cyclical norms.

In  short, we  may be in a  new age, but we don't yet find compelling evidence that we  should toss into the  wastebasket our fundamental framework of  analysis. We've made adjustments over the past year--for example, by lowering our NAIRU assumption and by

discounting the published weak productivity figures--to take what we hope is judicious account of  the surprises we've been experiencing in the behavior of  inflation. Thus, we  feel our forecast presents a reasonably balanced picture of  the prospects for inflation, should growth follow the course we've predicted.

The bottom line is that, if  you're feeling uncomfortably uncertain, we're definitely sharing your pain. Nonetheless, we  do believe that the  Greenbook is on  pretty solid ground in  suggesting that policy tightening is likely to  be  needed at some point to avert an  upturn in  inflation.

FOMC Briefing

Donald L.  Kohn

As  Mike noted at the end  of  his briefing, under the staff forecast the Committee will have to tighten at some point. The question for today's meeting is has that point arrived? Put another way--you've had  an  asymmetrical directive for about nine months, is it time to deliver?

One approach to this question is to ask  what is different now  than at the last few  meetings that might tip the scales to tightening. That is, do the data in  hand now suggest a  sufficiently greater risk of  inflation to justify an  immediate tightening, or, do recent developments still look ambiguous enough to  justify retaining a  wait and see posture. In  broad terms, a  key difference now  is that economic growth has unexpectedly exceeded the estimated growth of  potential in recent quarters, and quite possibly may continue to do so. At  the same time, however, high output growth has not raised actual resource utilization rates, and price increases have remained subdued, with remarkably few  early signs of  potential price acceleration.

The case for standing pat rests importantly on these latter observations. First, the unemployment and capacity utilization rates held steady over the second half of 1996 and early 1997 in  the face of  even more rapid economic growth than the staff projects for the  quarters

ahead. To  be sure, this resulted from a  substantial and unexpected increase in labor force participation and possibly   pickup in  productivity  owth, which are  always a gr difficult to predict. It's possible that, with economic growth expected  to  slow, further  uch gains,  even if  more s moderate, could continue to  hold down resource utilization for some time.

Second, at relatively low  unemployment rates, there has been little evident increase in inflationary pressures. In  labor markets, compensation did not  accelerate much in the second half of the  year; by some measures, it slowed. And core inflation actually declined. Because of the low inflation, the  Taylor rule suggests that policy now is roughly in line with your past responses to realized output gaps and inflation rates--responses that have been reasonably successful in  damping output cycles and reducing inflation.

The unexpectedly favorable inflation outcomes suggest continuing uncertainties about the level and rate of change in  the economy's potential, and  about the interaction of  that potential with prices. Under these conditions, before  it  tightened  he  Committee might  wish to see  more t definitive indications that inflation is likely to pick up absent such a  tightening. Such indications might include a further decline in  the unemployment rate or a  rise in capacity utilization to confirm that growth is, in  fact,

unsustainable. Presumably the Committee would also be looking for evidence that tight labor or  product markets were leading to  higher inflation. A  further acceleration of compensation, especially if it  were squeezing profit margins, would fit in  this latter category, as would lengthening lead times or increases in  prices at earlier stages of production. In  financial markets, money and credit growth at--or certainly above--recent rates might be  viewed as confirmation that monetary policy was too accommodative to check the growth of  spending.

With policy unchanged, the economy will be  allowed to produce marginally more than if  the funds rate is raised, and that output might be consistent with sustainable growth. Even if  it  is not--if it turns out that policy does need to tighten--waiting may  not do much lasting damage to inflation, provided that the Committee responds promptly to rising resource utilization or  accelerating costs and that inflation expectations do  not increase appreciably. Some comfort in  that regard may  be  taken from the fact that inflation expectations of  households and businesses seem firmly anchored, and, in  the near-term, the expected decline in  overall CPI inflation this year should help to keep them from rising very much. And increasing costs may be  at least partly absorbed for  a  while in  narrowing profit margins.

In  sum, the case for policy remaining unchanged is based importantly on looking at how  growth, resource utilization, and inflation have interacted in  the immediate past and awaiting new  information indicating that this pattern will not persist. By contrast, the case for tightening is built on projected increases in resource utilization and rising inflation pressures under a  forecast of  continuing strong aggregate demand, combined with the presumption that, based on experience over a  longer run, some of  the unusually favorable elements that have elevated aggregate supply and restrained inflation in the immediate past are not likely to be  carried forward for very long into the future. Even if Committee members do not anticipate a  major pickup in  inflation under unchanged policy, they may see the  higher possibility of  persistently strong demand as  materially raising the risk of  accelerating prices.

One reason demand might be expected to remain quite strong, absent a  tightening in policy, is that, in  many respects, the financial conditions that produced the  abovetrend growth of  the last few quarters remain in  place. For example, the recent rise in  long-term interest rates has carried them only to levels that are equal to or even below those that prevailed through much of last spring and summer. Moreover, part of  the rise has been predicated on  an  expected tightening of policy, and real rates would decline if policy remained unchanged. The  dollar has been strong, and

this is an  important reason for the forecasted slowing of economic growth, but on  the other side, the stock market also is  higher than it  was through 1996.

Moreover, credit supply conditions remain quite accommodative. To  be sure, there are a  few signs that investors have begun to think more seriously about risks: the prices of  technology and small capitalization stocks have fallen substantially, inflows to junk  bond mutual funds are  way off in recent weeks, the  yields on securities of emerging market economies have backed up relative to the United States, and spreads of  rates on  large business loans at  banks may  have ticked up  from very low  levels. Nonetheless, exuberance and complacency do not seem to be  washing out of the markets to a  degree that would raise the effective cost of  finance significantly and  work to slow spending. Risk spreads in most markets remain unusually low, as Peter showed, price-earnings multiples are still high, and flows of  money and credit fairly strong. Bank credit, in particular, has picked up in recent quarters and is feeding through to  faster M3 growth. M2  also has grown fairly rapidly on average in recent months. Some outside observers have been putting considerable weight on the recent behavior of  money as a  signal that the Committee needs to tighten. I'd  hesitate to give it quite that degree of emphasis, especially with M2  growth moderating a  bit this year. But the recent growth of  money does seem  more consistent with

the 6  percent growth of  nominal GDP estimated for the fourth and first quarters than with the under 5  percent growth in the Committee members' forecasts for 1997. More broadly, ample flows of  money and credit do tend to confirm the absence of  developing liquidity and credit constraints on spending.

If  tightening is  needed, the  longer it  is delayed-that is, the longer the economy operates beyond its sustainable potential--the more substantial the offsetting correction in economic activity required if  the Committee is to  keep inflation from ratcheting higher. To the  extent the Committee wishes to focus on  its longer-term goal of  reducing inflation further, the arguments for tightening would seem to  be strengthened. Even if  the Committee is not seeking additional disinflation in  the near term, or is not sure how  low  it  would like eventually to see inflation fall, so long as  the longer-term inflation objective is below the current rate, the Committee would probably view an increase in inflation as  more costly than a  decrease. In  this context, the notion of getting some added assurance that inflation would not rise would be  all the  more justified.

The  financial market reaction to a  25 basis point tightening should be subdued. As  Peter noted, it is largely built into the  yield curve. Indeed, not  tightening could unsettle financial markets as participants reassessed their reading of  the signals coming out of  the Federal Reserve. A

25 basis point firming may induce markets to extrapolate further such actions, especially as it  would represent a shift in direction. This tendency should be  limited in the current circumstances, however, because the recent minutes and testimonies have reported your view that policy is probably not greatly out of  alignment and  because the last string of  downward moves was only 75 basis points.

In  the past, Committee members have considered whether larger steps would reduce the unsettling effects on markets of  waiting for the next shoe to drop. If  the Committee were reasonably confident that at least 50  basis points of  tightening will ultimately be  needed, it  might consider the larger step. It  would get the desired degree of restraint into the markets more quickly, and it  would likely leave the market expecting the Federal Reserve to  be on  hold for a  while, damping market reactions to incoming data over the next few  months. At  the same time, however, it also would surprise markets and could be  read as a message that the Committee is quite concerned about the inflationary potential in  the current situation, leading market participants to raise their estimates of the cumulative tightening that may  be  forthcoming.

A  staff study distributed to the Committee in  late 1994 found that 25 basis point tightenings did tend on average to  have a  little more impact on longer rates rela-

tive to the size of the tightening than did larger tightenings, perhaps because of  the uncertainty created. That is, a  50 basis point tightening would have slightly less than twice the effect of  a  25 point move. Although it is difficult to generalize because of  the  wide range of experience, it does seem likely that in current circumstances the total market reaction to 50 basis points would be substantially larger than to 25. If the Committee were concerned about the strength of  the market response and the possibility that sharp corrections in  stock and bond markets could engender their own self-reinforcing dynamic for a while, 25 basis points would seem to  be a  safer approach, even if  more were thought eventually to  be  needed, accepting the strong possibility that before long markets would begin building in another near-term tightening.

Finally, if the Committee tightens, it needs to consider whether it should retain the asymmetry in the current directive or shift to a  symmetric directive. Retaining the asymmetry would seem to imply the Committee had a  strong conviction that even after tightening a  substantial risk of rising inflation remained and  more tightening would be  needed. Asymmetry would also seem to  mean that the Committee saw that risk as still large enough to  trigger further action soon--that the Committee envisioned a  fairly steep trajectory for firming. Going to a  symmetrical directive might suggest a more cautious approach to further action, perhaps in light of  the continued good inflation performance.
