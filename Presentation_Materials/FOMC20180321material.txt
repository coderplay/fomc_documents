Exhibit  1.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: The  data  for  the  actual  values  of  the  variables  are  annual. The  percent  changes  in  real  GDP  and  inflation are measured  Q4/Q4. Projections  for the unemployment  rate  are  for  the average civilian unemployment  rate  in  the fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP or the  unemployment  rate.

Note: Updated  March  Tealbook  values  are  reported. The  percent  changes  in  real  GDP  and  inflation  are  measured Q4/Q4.  Projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of the  year  indicated. One  participant  did  not  submit  longer-run  projections  for  the  change  in  real  GDP,  the  unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction  with  the December  12-13,  2017, meeting, and one participant did not submit  such  projections  in  conjunction  with  the  March  20-21,  2018,  meeting.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: In the two panels above, each circle indicates the value (rounded  to the nearest 1 8 / percentage  point) of an individual  participant's  judgment  of  the  midpoint  of  the  appropriate  target  range  for  the  federal  funds  rate  or  the appropriate  target  level  for  the  federal  funds  rate  at  the  end  of  the  specified  calendar  year  or  over  the  longer  run. The red  diamonds  for  each  year  represent  the  median  of  the  federal  funds  rate  prescriptions  that  were  derived  by  taking  each participant's  projections  for  the  unemployment  gap,  core  PCE  inflation,  and  longer-run  nominal  federal  funds  rate  for that year and  inserting  them  into  the  non-inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule. The  whiskers  represent  the  central  tendency  of the  prescriptions  of  the  non-inertial  Taylor  (1999)  rule  using  participants'  projections. One  participant  did  not  submit a longer-run projection for the federal funds rate in conjunction with the December  12-13, 2017, meeting, and one participant  did  not  submit  such  a  projection  in  conjunction  with  the  March  20-21,  2018,  meeting.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines  in  the  top  panel  show  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the percent  change  in  real  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  from  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter of the year  indicated. The  confidence  interval  around  the  median  projected  values  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  and  is based  on  root  mean  squared  errors  of  various  private  and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years;  more information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2  of  the  Summary  of  Economic  Projections  (SEP).  Because  current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments of the uncertainty and risks around  their projections; these current assessments are summarized  in the lower  panels. Generally  speaking,  participants  who  judge  the  uncertainty  about  their  projections  as  'broadly  similar' to the average  levels of the past 20 years would  view  the  width  of  the confidence  interval  shown  in  the  historical fan chart  as  largely  consistent  with  their  assessments  of  the  uncertainty  about  their  projections. Likewise,  participants  who judge  the  risks to their projections  as  'broadly  balanced'  would  view  the  confidence  interval  around  their  projections as approximately  symmetric. For definitions of uncertainty  and  risks in economic  projections, see the box  'Forecast Uncertainty'  in  the  SEP.

Note: The  blue  and  red  lines are based  on  actual  values  and  median  projected  values,  respectively,  of  the  Committee's  target for the federal funds  rate at the end  of the year indicated. The  actual  values  are the midpoint  of  the target range; the median  projected values are based on either the midpoint  of the target range or the target level. The  confidence  interval around  the median  projected  values  is based  on root mean  squared  errors  of various private and  government  forecasts  made  over  the  previous  20  years. The  confidence  interval  is  not  strictly  consistent  with  the projections  for  the  federal  funds  rate,  primarily  because  these  projections  are  not  forecasts  of  the  likeliest  outcomes  for the federal funds rate, but rather projections of participants' individual assessments  of appropriate  monetary  policy. Still, historical  forecast  errors  provide  a  broad  sense  of  the  uncertainty  around  the  future  path  of  the  federal  funds  rate generated  by  the  uncertainty  about  the  macroeconomic  variables  as  well  as  additional  adjustments  to  monetary  policy that  may  be  appropriate  to  off set  the  eff ects  of  shocks  to  the  economy.

The  confidence  interval  is  assumed  to  be  symmetric  except  when  it  is  truncated  at  zero-the  bottom  of  the  lowest target range  for the federal funds  rate that has been  adopted  in  the past by the Committee. This truncation  would not be intended  to indicate the likelihood of the use of negative  interest rates to provide  additional  monetary  policy accommodation  if  doing  so  was  judged  appropriate. In such  situations,  the  Committee  could  also  employ  other  tools, including forward guidance and large-scale asset purchases, to provide additional accommodation. Because current conditions may  diff er from those that prevailed, on average, over the previous 20 years, the width  and shape  of the confidence  interval  estimated  on  the  basis  of  the  historical  forecast  errors  may  not  reflect  FOMC  participants'  current assessments  of  the  uncertainty  and  risks  around  their  projections.

* The  confidence  interval is derived from forecasts of the average level of short-term  interest rates in the fourth quarter  of the year indicated;  more  information  about  these  data  is  available  in  table  2  of  the  Summary  of  Economic Projections. The  shaded  area  encompasses  less  than  a  70  percent  confidence  interval  if  the  confidence  interval  has  been truncated  at  zero.

JANUARY 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.  Gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid, and the unemployment rate has stayed low.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to move up this year and to stabilize around the -Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1 1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby -supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR MARCH 2018

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen remained strong and that while growth in economic activity has been rising at a solid rate moderated . Job gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid strong in recent months , and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment appear to be expanding at a moderate pace. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriate monetary policy accommodation , economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to move up this year -and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1 1/2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby -supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation. A temporary period of inflation modestly above 2 percent would be consistent with the Committee's symmetric inflation objective and may be needed to ensure that longer-run inflation expectations are consistent with that objective.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE B FOR MARCH 2018

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid moderate rate. Job gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid strong in recent months , and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Recent data suggest that growth rates of household spending and business fixed investment have moderated from their strong fourth-quarter rates readings. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have continued to run below 2 percent.   Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; surveybased measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace in the medium term and labor market conditions will remain strong.  Inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to move up this year -in coming months and to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term. Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain raise the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1 1/2 -to 1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.

ALTERNATIVE C FOR MARCH 2018

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate. Job gains in employment, household spending, and business fixed investment have been solid strong in recent months , and the unemployment rate has stayed low. Household spending and business fixed investment have been growing at solid rates, on average, in recent quarters. On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have increased from their lows last summer but have continued to run below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have increased in recent months but remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability. The economic outlook has strengthened in recent months. The Committee expects that, with further gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity and employment will expand at a moderate pace and labor market conditions will remain strong sustainable rates in the medium term .  Inflation on a 12 month basis is expected to move up this -year in coming months and then to stabilize around the Committee's 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, but the Committee is monitoring inflation developments closely.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain raise the target range for the federal funds rate at 1-1/4 to 1 1/2 -to 1-3/4 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected inflation developments relative to its symmetric inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant further gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run. However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
