- o Term RRPs will not add to interest rate control
- · Incremental interest cost of providing term RRP

Instruction to Desk to conduct term RRPs would be added to implementation note, released concurrent with March statement

JANUARY 2016 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year.  Household spending and business fixed investment have been increasing at moderate rates in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed.  A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen.  Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook.
- 3. Given the economic outlook, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation. This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.  The Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  However, the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data.
- 5. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency

mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction, and it anticipates doing so until normalization of the level of the federal funds rate is well under way.  This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.

MARCH 2016 ALTERNATIVE A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December January suggests that labor market conditions improved further even as economic growth slowed late last year economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace .  Household spending and business fixed investment have has been increasing at moderate rates a solid moderate rate in recent months, and the housing sector has improved further; however, business fixed investment and net exports have been soft and inventory investment slowed.  A range of recent labor market indicators, including strong job gains, points to some additional decline in underutilization of labor resources strengthening of the labor market .  Inflation has picked up in recent months; however, it continued to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices and in prices of nonenergy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation declined further remain near historically low levels ; some survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance, in recent months declined further .
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee currently expects that, with gradual adjustments in the stance of appropriately accommodative monetary policy, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace and labor market indicators will continue to strengthen. However, global economic and financial developments in recent months pose downside risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market. Inflation is expected to remain low in the near term, in part because of the further earlier declines in energy prices, but to rise to 2 percent over the medium term as the transitory effects of declines in energy and import prices dissipate and the labor market strengthens further.  The Committee is closely monitoring global economic and financial developments and is assessing their implications for the labor market and inflation, and for the balance of risks to the outlook. In light of continued low readings from measures of longer-term inflation compensation and expectations, the Committee judges that the risks that inflation will fail to rise to 2 percent over the medium term have increased.
- 3. Given the economic outlook and associated risks , the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at ¼ to ½ percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting further improvement in labor market conditions and a return to 2 percent inflation. The Committee anticipates that it will not increase this target range until inflation moves closer to 2 percent on a sustained basis and the risks to the economic outlook are more closely balanced.
- 4. In determining the When adjustments to the target range become appropriate, their timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess will depend on the Committee's assessment of realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum

- employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  In light of the current shortfall of inflation from 2 percent, the Committee will carefully monitor actual and expected progress toward its inflation goal.
