Review of Meeting Format

- ·  Did the extra time enhance the discussion?  Did it allow for more interaction among participants?
- ·  Were the economic and policy discussions effectively separated this time?  Is that separation one that is worth preserving?
- ·  How did this format affect (if at all) the Committee's ability to provide input to the formulation of the statement, both before and during the meeting?
- ·  Any suggestions for changes to the two-day format?
- ·  The next meeting will of necessity be only one day.  Does the experience of yesterday and today suggest any format changes to consider for oneday meetings?
