Discussion of Liftoff Tools and Possible Liftoff Options

<!-- missing-text -->

J

Extending Normalization Principles and Plans to Operational Liftoff Strategy

- · Policy Normalization Principles and Plans
- · Provided high level outline of approach.
- · Did not provide details on exactly how tools will be used at liftoff and beyond.
- · Tradeoff in Developing Detailed Liftoff Strategy
- · Maximizing the odds that liftoff proceeds smoothly.
- · Minimizing risks associated with aggressive use of individual tools.

J

Illustrative Options

ON RRP and Term RRP as Substitutes?

· Illustrative Option 1

- · Term RRP appeared to substitute for ON RRP at year end. -
- · If this were true more generally, term RRP might be a useful way to manage takeup in ON RRP operations.
- · Term RRP might help reduce financial stability risks.
- · But…
- · Term RRP operationally more complex than overnight RRP.
- · Heavy use of term RRP could distort rates in term markets.
- · Could entail communications issues.
- · Temporary increase in ON RRP cap to $600 billion.
- · Term RRP may be used after liftoff to provide upward pressure on rates and manage size of ON RRP.
- · Could be attractive if…
- · Financial stability and footprint risks of temporary increase in cap are viewed as relatively modest.
- · Policymakers confident that Federal Reserve can assure that the temporary increase in ON RRP cap does not become long lived. -
- · Costs or communications issues associated with term RRP viewed as significant.

· Illustrative Option 2

- · Temporary increase in ON RRP cap to $400 billion.
- · Term RRP used prior to liftoff to keep ON RRP can from binding.
- · Could be attractive if…
- · Sizable temporary increase in ON RRP cap viewed as presenting significant financial stability risks or as a signal that large ON RRP program likely to be long lived. -
- · Confident that term RRP can be used to manage size of ON RRP program.
- · Costs and communications issues associated with term RRP viewed as manageable.

J

Other Possible Steps

- · Other Possible Steps
- · Adjust spread of IOER over ON RRP.
- · Adjust IOER and ON RRP relative to the target range for the federal funds rate.
- · Employ term deposits.
- · Communications
- · The FOMC may wish to consider communicating some elements of its operational liftoff strategy in advance to provide more clarity to the public about its intentions and to demonstrate its preparedness for a smooth liftoff.
- · Such communications could be included in minutes, the Chair's post meeting press conference -remarks, speeches, testimony.

J

Issues with Interest Payments on Reserves

- · Current methodology applies a single rate over entire maintenance period.
- · Possible Options
- · Change the length of the maintenance period to 7 days.
- · Calculate interest payments based on IOER in effect at the end of a reserve maintenance period.
- · Change the calculations to focus more on balances held on an individual day and the IOER rate in effect that day.

J

Issues for Discussion

- · How should greater ex ante certainty of a smooth liftoff be balanced with concerns regarding the potential size of an -ON RRP program or more aggressive use of other policy tools?
- · What are your general views of the options presented in the Illustrative Approaches memo?
- · Would a significant temporary increase in the ON RRP cap at the time of liftoff be desirable?
- · Would conducting term RRPs in size either in advance of liftoff or immediately thereafter be attractive?
- · Are other possible adjustments discussed in the memo attractive, such as narrowing the spread of IOER to the ON RRP rate, adjusting the IOER and ON RRP rates relative to the target range for the federal funds rate, or making use of term deposits.
- · Are there any other steps that you think should be taken to support a smooth liftoff?
- · Would you find it useful to conduct additional testing of term RRP apart from quarter end dates as a way to learn more -about the degree of substitution between ON RRP and term RRP?

Briefing on the Timing of Liftoff and the Pace of Tightening

Ed Nelson January 27, 2015

Authorized for Public Release

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Timing and Pace of Policy Normalization: Memos sent to the Committee on January 16, 2015

Issues Concerning the Timing and Pace of Policy Firming

-  Expectations for the overall trajectory of the federal funds rate are more important than the precise date at which firming commences.
-  Participants' December SEP paths for the federal funds rate feature more-gradual tightening than the prescription of the noninertial Taylor 1999 rule.
- o May indicate preference for smoothing, concerns about downside risks, or perceived benefit of letting unemployment temporarily fall below natural rate.
- o Gradualism could be costly if taken too far (undesirably-large increase in inflation, financial instability).

Stochastic Implications of Alternative Strategies for the Beginning of Policy Normalization

-  Evaluate performance of two alternative firming strategies, 'earlier-and-gradual' versus 'later-and-steep,' in response to a range of shocks.
-  Little difference between the two strategies in terms of the values they generate for a policymaker loss function.
-  Earlier-and-gradual policy has higher probability of return to ELB; later-and-steep has higher probability of rapid rate increases.

FOMC Deliberations Prior to the Initial Tightening of Monetary Policy in 1994, 1999, and 2004

-  In all cases, the decisions to tighten monetary policy were data-dependent.
-  Expanded communications toolkit left financial markets better prepared for policy firming in 1999 and 2004 than in 1994, when the market reaction was sizable.

Foreign Experience with Liftoff from the Effective Lower Bound

-  No case in which policy firming was too late or otherwise insufficient.
-  For Japan and Sweden, undue weight may have been assigned to factors other than inflation and economic activity.  Policy firming was subsequently reversed.
-  Canadian experience more orderly, perhaps because firming was gradual and keyed to macroeconomic developments.

Options for Evolving the Statement Language in Preparation for Liftoff

-  An orderly transition from the effective-lower-bound policy to the tightening phase is clearly desirable, and communications can contribute to such a transition.
-  The memo suggests language for successive FOMC statements to facilitate this transition.

Questions for the Committee Discussion of Liftoff Timing and the Pace of Policy Firming

- 1. How should the Committee, in its decisions about the path of the federal funds rate, weigh the risks of lifting off prematurely versus the risks of waiting too long to lift off?
- 2. At your expected time of liftoff, what developments would you need to see in the data to be reasonably confident that inflation will move back toward the Committee's 2 percent longer-run objective over time?  What information would undermine that confidence?
- 3. Do you think the suggestions for how the statement language might evolve in advance of liftoff that were included in the staff memo, 'Options for Evolving the Statement Language in Preparation for Liftoff,' are useful for conveying the Committee's policy intentions?  Do you have alternative suggestions?

FOMC STATEMENT DECEMBER 2014

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in October suggests that economic activity is expanding at a moderate pace.  Labor market conditions improved further, with solid job gains and a lower unemployment rate.  On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources continues to diminish.  Household spending is rising moderately and business fixed investment is advancing, while the recovery in the housing sector remains slow.  Inflation has continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting declines in energy prices.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation have declined somewhat further; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators moving toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee sees the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  The Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of lower energy prices and other factors dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate.  In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expectedtoward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial developments.  Based on its current assessment, the Committee judges that it can be patient in beginning to normalize the stance of monetary policy.  The Committee sees this guidance as consistent with its previous statement that it likely will be appropriate to maintain the 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate for a considerable time following the end of its asset purchase program in October, especially if projected inflation continues to run below the Committee's 2 percent longer-run goal, and provided that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.  However, if incoming information indicates faster progress toward the Committee's employment and inflation objectives than the Committee now expects, then increases in the target range for the federal funds rate are likely to occur sooner than currently anticipated.  Conversely, if progress proves slower than expected, then increases in the target range are likely to occur later than currently anticipated.

The Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain such conditions.  The Committee directs the Desk to maintain its policy of rolling over maturing Treasury securities into new issues and its policy of reinvesting principal payments on all agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities.  The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.  The System Open Market Account manager and the secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
