- · Output gap rising to nearly 3 percent
- · Inertial Taylor rule calls for funds rate to rise to 4¾ percent

Two risks that staff funds rate projection is too high

- · Risk 1: Current resource utilization could be significantly lower than the staff estimates.
- · Risk 2: Economy's self-correcting forces when activity is well above potential could be significantly stronger than staff assumes.

Indicators of tight labor market

<!-- missing-text -->

Staff forecast of domestic profits

<!-- missing-text -->

Foreign Outlook

- · Falling oil prices, weaker-than-expected data, and tightening financial conditions have raised concerns about the health of foreign economies.
- · We've revised down our forecast for foreign economies since the last Chart Show in June, but expect that foreign economies will grow near potential going forward.
- · Foreign economies faced formidable downside risks and have limited policy space.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Economic conditions weaker, but not weak

- · While data have been disappointing, they seem consistent with most foreign economies achieving growth close to potential.
- · Some areas of concern including the euro area.
- · One little caveat:  recessions are hard to predict! But at least the data aren't screaming that a slowdown abroad is imminent.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Financial conditions tighter but still accommodative

- · While financial conditions have tightened in both AFEs and EMEs since September, the drag to foreign output is likely to be moderate.
- · Indexes of financial stress have only moved up slightly.
- · Structural VAR suggests moderate effects from recent increase in financial stress.

AFE Financial Stress Index

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Limited policy space

- · Real interest rates in the euro area, UK, and Japan are expected to remain in significantly negative territory through 2020.
- · Then edge up to long-run level of 0-1 percent (Holsten-Laubach-Williams).
- · Monetary policy would have limited ability to offset shocks that cause a persistent tightening of financial conditions, and fiscal space also limited.

<!-- missing-text -->

Brexit: a graceful exit?

- · Baseline assumption is that the UK and EU will cobble together a plan for an orderly transition to a close economic partnership post-Brexit.
- · However, the government faces huge challenges in gaining support for its plan.
- · The Irish border issue appears an intractable sticking point.
- · If the government's plan is not approved, outcomes include:
- · Second  referendum.
- · No-deal Brexit.
- · No-deal Brexit would roil financial markets and plunge U.K. into a recession.

Italy's fiscal standoff with EU

- · The Italian government - under threat of EU sanctions - has indicated willingness to aim for smaller budget deficit.
- · Financial conditions have eased, but still much tighter than earlier in the year.
- · A prolonged growth slowdown could make government debt unsustainable and hurt Italy's weak banks.
- · We expect the government and EU will keep the situation contained, but there is a significant risk of escalation into a full-blown financial crisis.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

EME risks

- · Laundry list of perennial risks
- · Hard landing in China.
- · Financial crises in vulnerable EMEs.
- · Latin America continues to look fragile, including Mexico.
- · Mexico's new populist government appears to be moving to less market-friendly policies.

Tariffs and trade tensions

- · Since start of year new tariffs have been imposed on 13 percent of U.S. imports.
- · These actions as well as foreign retaliation projected to depress the level of U.S. GDP about 0.2 percent and boost consumer prices 0.15 percent.
- · Some concessions from China, but Administration pressing for rapid progress in opening China's markets.
- · We assume the new USMCA will be passed to replace NAFTA, but outcome is not assured.

Newspaper Index of Trade Policy Uncertainty

<!-- missing-text -->

- ‡ We assume retaliation on two-thirds of U.S. exports. All others simulations assume full retaliation.
- *These actions raise the tariff rate on the same $180 billion of U.S. imports.

<!-- missing-text -->

Front-running of imports and falling exports

- · While the aggregate value of imports from China has increased markedly in recent months, this may reflect front-running.
- · Appears buyers were advancing purchases due to concerns tariffs would be imposed.
- · Exports to China have fallen sharply.

<!-- missing-text -->

Some evidence that tariffs are raising prices

- · Import prices from China (which are measured pre-tariff) have been flat since October.
- · Producer prices have risen faster in U.S. manufacturing sectors heavily dependent on imports affected by recent tariffs.

Import Prices from China

<!-- missing-text -->

Effects of tariffs on producer prices

<!-- missing-text -->

Tariffs, consumer prices, and monetary policy

- · Larger and more broad-based increase in tariffs could put more upward pressure on consumer prices.
- U.S.imports from China subject to recent tariffs of $180 billion
- · Could confront policymakers with tradeoff between stabilizing output and inflation.
- · Plausible that tariffs on intermediate inputs and capital goods may have smaller effects on inflation than tariffs on final consumption goods.
- · Most of the recent tariffs on China have been on intermediate and capital goods.

<!-- missing-text -->

The type of import being tariffed matters

- · SIGMA simulation compares effects of alternative unilateral tariffs:
- · Broad based rise in tariffs on all imports - consumer and capital goods.
- · Tariffs only on imported capital goods.
- · Simulation highlights that effects on consumer prices may depend heavily on composition of the tariffs.

SIGMA simulations: 10% rise in tariffs

Considerations for Future Statement Language

- Changes in June and September have already cut back on forward guidance.
- Under SEP outlook, "further gradual increases" would likely need to be removed at next hike.
- Might reintroduce thought from previous language that "the actual path of the federal funds rate will depend on the economic outlook as informed by incoming data."

NOVEMBER 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined.  Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2 to 2-1/4 percent.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Implementation Note for December 2018 Alternative A

Release Date:  December 19, 2018

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November 8 December 19 , 2018:

-  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously [ ] to maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 2.20 percent, effective November 9 December 20 , 2018.
-  As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective November 9 December 20 , 2018, the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.00 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

-  In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously   to approve the establishment of the primary credit rate [ ] at the existing level of 2.75 percent.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

More information regarding open market operations and reinvestments may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on November 8 December 19 , 2018:

-  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously [ ] to maintain raise the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 2.20 to 2.40 percent, effective November 9 December 20 , 2018.
