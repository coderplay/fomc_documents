Statement Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

After extensive deliberations and thorough review of experience to date, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans to implement monetary policy over the longer run.  Additionally, the Committee is revising its earlier guidance regarding the conditions under which it could adjust the details of its balance sheet normalization program.  Accordingly, [all] participants agreed to the following:

- x The Committee intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which the quantity of reserves is sufficient to ensure that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates, and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required.
- x The Committee continues to view changes in the target range for the federal funds rate as its primary means of adjusting the stance of monetary policy.  However, the Committee is prepared to adjust any of the details for completing balance sheet normalization in light of economic and financial developments.  Moreover, the Committee would be prepared to use its full range of tools, including altering the size and composition of its balance sheet, if future economic conditions were to warrant a more accommodative monetary policy than can be achieved solely by reducing the federal funds rate.

DRAFT: Revised Policy Normalization Principles and Plans

In light of its discussions at previous meetings and the ongoing progress in normalizing the size of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings, the Committee judges that it is appropriate at this time to provide additional information regarding its plans for the size of its securities holdings and the transition to the longer-run operating regime.  At its January meeting, the Committee noted that it intends to continue to implement monetary policy in a regime in which the quantity of reserves is sufficient to ensure that control over the level of the federal funds rate and other short-term interest rates is exercised primarily through the setting of the Federal Reserve's administered rates and in which active management of the supply of reserves is not required. The January statement on monetary policy implementation and the balance sheet normalization plans and principles listed below together revise and replace the Committee's earlier Policy Normalization Principles and Plans.

- x The appropriate longer-run level of reserves consistent with efficient and effective policy implementation in this framework is below current levels.  To ensure a smooth transition to this longer-run reserve level, the Committee intends to slow the pace of reserve decline over coming quarters.  Provided that the economy and money market conditions evolve as expected, the Committee will conclude the reduction of its aggregate securities holdings in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) at the end of [June | September | December] 2019. The average level of reserves at this point will likely still be somewhat above the level of reserves necessary to efficiently and effectively implement monetary policy.
- o Thereafter, the Committee currently anticipates that it will likely hold the size of the SOMA portfolio roughly constant for a time.  During such a period, persistent gradual increases in currency and other non-reserve liabilities would be accompanied by corresponding gradual declines in reserve balances to a level consistent with efficient and effective implementation of monetary policy.
- o When the Committee judges that reserve balances have declined to this level, the SOMA portfolio will hold no more securities than necessary for efficient and effective policy implementation.  Once that point is reached, the Committee will begin very gradually increasing its securities holdings to keep pace with trend growth of the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities in order maintain the appropriate level of reserves in the system.
- x The Committee will continue to allow its holdings of agency mortgage-backed securities to decline, consistent with the aim of holding primarily Treasury securities in the longer run.  Beginning in [July 2019 | October 2019 | January 2020], principal payments received from agency mortgage-backed securities will be reinvested in Treasury securities [, subject to a maximum amount of $20 billion per month; any proceeds in excess of that maximum will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities].  It continues to be the Committee's view that limited sales of agency

mortgage-backed securities might be warranted in the longer run to reduce or eliminate residual holdings. The timing and pace of any sales would be communicated to the public well in advance.

Questions for Discussion

- 1. Would you support an FOMC statement at the conclusion of the January meeting indicating that it has reached a decision that it will continue to implement monetary policy over the longer-run in the current framework?
- 2. In connection with the decision regarding the operating framework, what are your views regarding the proposed transition plan for slowing the pace of reserve decline by specifying a date for the end of balance sheet reduction?  If you support specifying a date, which date would you prefer?
- 3. As part of that transition plan, would you like to retain the redemption cap for agency MBS after the conclusion of the reduction in the SOMA portfolio?  (Retention of the cap would imply that any residual portion of principal payments from agency MBS above the $20 billion cap in any given month would be reinvested in agency MBS.)

DECEMBER 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Household spending has continued to grow strongly, while growth of business fixed investment has moderated from its rapid pace earlier in the year.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy remain near 2 percent.  Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance. Although market-based measures of inflation compensation have moved lower in recent months, survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.

The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term as the most likely outcomes . In light of global economic and financial developments and muted inflation pressures, the Committee judges that the risks to the economic outlook are tilted to the downside and that it will be patient as it determines what, if any, adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate may be appropriate to support these outcomes. The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.

The Committee judges that some further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  The Committee judges that risks to the economic outlook are roughly balanced, but will continue to monitor global economic and financial developments and assess their implications for the economic outlook.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Implementation Note for January 2019 (all Alternatives)

Release Date:  January 30, 2019

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) in its statement on December 19, 2018 January 30, 2019 :

-  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously [ ] to raise maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to at 2.40 percent, effective December 20, 2018 January 31, 2019 . Setting the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 10 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds market at rates well within the FOMC's target range.
-  As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective December 20, 2018 January 31, 2019 , the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing during each calendar month that exceeds $30 billion, and to continue reinvesting in agency mortgage-backed securities the amount of principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month that exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

-  In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously   to approve a 1/4 percentage point increase in [ ] the establishment of the primary credit rate to at the existing level of 3.00 percent, effective December 20, 2018.  In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Boston, Cleveland, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, and San Francisco.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

More information regarding open market operations and reinvestments may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.
