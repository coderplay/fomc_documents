Distributional Considerations

Rising inequality may contribute to challenges posed by ELB:

- ◦ Lower r* though increased net supply of savings
- ◦ Worse economic downturns once ELB is reached if more households live paycheckto-paycheck

Model simulations of two versions of a New Keynesian model:

- ◦ RANK: perfect insurance against individual earnings risk
- ◦ Inequality plays no role in macroeconomic dynamics
- ◦ HANK: imperfect insurance, liquidity constraints
- ◦ Larger share of liquidity-constrained households makes economy more sensitive to shocks
- ◦ Stronger multiplier effects exacerbate recessions once policy rate hits ELB
- ◦ Average unemployment is 0.6 percentage points higher in HANK compared to RANK, and the standard deviation of unemployment is almost twice as large

Distributional Effects of Monetary Policy

Cost of business cycles are not borne equally

- ◦ Those hit the hardest in a downturn also benefit more in a strong economy, but historically not enough to offset negative effects of recessions
- ◦ Monetary policy strategies that reduce frequency/severity of recessions likely to decrease inequality in the long run

Monetary policy also has short-run distributive effects

Looser monetary policy, in the short run:

- ◦ Benefits most working age households, in particular borrowers and the working poor
- ◦ May be less popular among many (upper-) middle class retirees because of losses in interest income

Last page

Performance of Alternative Strategies in RANK and HANK models

We evaluate strategies in which policy rate depends on current output gap and average inflation over some horizon:

- ◦ After a severe demand shock, inflation make-up strategies remain effective even in the economy with liquidity-constrained households
- ◦ Stabilization gains are larger in the model with liquidity constraints (HANK) compared to the model without these constraints (RANK)
- ◦ Inflation make-up strategies reduce average unemployment rate by 0.4 to 0.5 pp in the model with liquidity constraints
- ◦ In practice, such a reduction in unemployment would almost certainly be larger for particularly vulnerable subgroups

Takeaways from Fed Listens Initiative

Fourteen public events

- ◦ Outward-facing piece of your review
- ◦ Engaged the public directly on issues pertaining to dual mandate
- ◦ Different in focus from System's usual community engagement activities

Representatives of underserved communities generally saw the current strong labor market conditions as providing significant benefits

- ◦ Primarily employment opportunities
- ◦ Concern about ramifications of the next downturn for newly hired workers

Perspectives from Business

Business representatives saw current labor market conditions as presenting challenges

- ◦ Partnering with workforce development agencies or community colleges to devise training programs or specialized curriculums
- ◦ Greater willingness of firms to employ individuals who would not have been considered in less favorable labor market conditions

Business representatives generally did not report increasing wages as a means of attracting and retaining workers

- ◦ Offering new training or education programs; adding or augmenting health care, other benefits
- ◦ Possibly reflects growing emphasis on 'workplace culture'

Perspectives on Interest Rates, Inflation, and Communications

Low interest rate environment

- ◦ Businesses and CDFIs saw as beneficial
- ◦ LMI communities generally have little or no access to conventional credit
- ◦ Wealthier retirees have seen decline in interest income

Little discussion of inflation relative to discussion of labor market

- ◦ Acknowledgement that inflation is low
- ◦ Businesses emphasized importance of stable and predictable inflation
- ◦ Retirees, LMI communities voiced specific concerns

Communications

- ◦ Fed could better tailor its messages to different audiences
- ◦ Little or no understanding of policymakers' concerns about too-low inflation

What, me worry?

- · Haunted by prospect of failing to predict next global recession.
- · We have marked down our forecast for this year repeatedly.
- · But little evidence that global recession is imminent, and probability of recession is still moderately low.

Green shoots?

- · Tentative signs of recovery, but one needs 20/20 vision to see.
- · Manufacturing PMIs turning up, albeit still at a depressed level.

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Trade tensions have lessened - we hope.

- · Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) eased since summer, largely on increased hope of successful 'phase one' trade talks with China.
- · Our daily measure of TPU spiked up in early December, but has since subsided.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Share of articles in major newspapers that mention uncertainty and an additional trade-policy-related word. Source: Caldara, Dario, et al. 'The economic effects of trade policy uncertainty.' Journal of Monetary Economics (2019).

Growth appears to have bottomed out in some key economies.

- · Euro area and Chinese growth in Q3 stayed at Q2 pace.
- · Emerging Asia ex. China solid except for Hong Kong.
- · Latin America still struggles.

<!-- missing-text -->

Current Outlook

- · Foreign growth bottoms out in current quarter and moves up next year.
- · Pick up reflects expected strengthening in manufacturing, reduced trade uncertainty, rebound in Hong Kong, and accommodative policies.
- · 2016 also looked bleak, but turned out better than expected.

<!-- missing-text -->

Policy rates to stay low.

- · Canadian and U.K. inflation near 2 percent targets.
- · Inflation far from targets in euro area and Japan, and hence policy rates expected to stay very low.
- · Policy rates don't rise much in the U.K. and Canada, either.

<!-- missing-text -->

Why won't ECB and BoJ ease further?

- · Worries about effect of low rates on banks, insurance companies, and pension funds.
- · Concerns low rates and low profitability might encourage reach for yield and financial excesses.
- · Concerns of depressive effect on households' interest income and sentiment.
- · Outlook is for steady growth.

Impact of low-for-long interest rates on financial stability in AFEs?

- · Review experience over past decade, when interest rates near zero.
- · Focus on two important dimensions of risk-taking and financial stability:
- o Asset valuations.
- o Non-financial sector leverage.

Equity prices abroad too high? Generally, no.

- · Low rates motivated some, not great deal, of spending borrowing, and valuation excesses in AFEs.
- · Doesn't mean further low rates pose no financial stability risk.
-  Aggregate data may obscure risk-taking at micro level.
-  Hangover from GFC may have restrained credit.
-  Causality may run from low risk-taking to low interest rates.

Note: Updated December Tealbook values are reported. The percent changes in real GDP and inflation are measured Q4/Q4. Projections for the unemployment rate are for the average civilian unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of the year indicated. One participant did not submit longer run projections for the change in real GDP, the unemployment rate, or the federal funds rate in conjunction with the September 17-18, 2019, meeting, and one participant did not submit such projections in conjunction with the December 10-11, 2019, meeting.

Note: In these two panels, each blue dot indicates the value (rounded to 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate, or the appropriate target level for that rate, at the end of the specified year or over the longer run. Each green diamond is the median value, for the indicated year, of the set of prescriptions for the federal funds rate that are generated by inserting into the Taylor (1993) rule each participant's projections of core PCE inflation and the unemployment rate along with the participant's projections of the longer-run nominal federal funds rate and longer-run unemployment rate. The green whiskers show the central tendency, for each year, of the prescriptions that result from using the Taylor (1993) rule.

Monetary Policy Considerations

<!-- missing-text -->

Scenarios Expected to Call for a Rate Change

- Desk surveys asked for scenarios leading to rate change by the end of 2020.
- Scenarios likely to lead to easing:
- Tepid or slowing growth.
- Low inflation.
- Slower hiring.
- Trade-related developments.
- Scenarios likely to lead to tightening:
- Favorable trade developments.
- Inflation moving above 2 percent objective.

Measures of Longer-Run Inflation Expectations

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

<!-- missing-text -->

Policy Alternatives

- Alternative B
- Current policy stance is appropriate to support a favorable economic outlook.
- Need to monitor global developments and muted inflation pressures.
- Alternative A highlights inflation remaining below 2 percent as a risk.
- Alternative C presents contingency language for a scenario in which a rate hike is likely imminent.

OCTOBER 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in September indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity has been rising at a moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has remained low.  Although household spending has been rising at a strong pace, business fixed investment and exports remain weak. On a 12-month basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy are running below 2 percent.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  In light of the implications of global developments for the economic outlook as well as muted inflation pressures, the Committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  This action supports the Committee's view that sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective are the most likely outcomes, but uncertainties about this outlook remain.  The Committee will continue to monitor the implications of incoming information for the economic outlook as it assesses the appropriate path of the target range for the federal funds rate.
- 3. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.

Decisions Regarding Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement the monetary policy stance announced by the Federal Open Market Committee in its statement on October 30, 2019 December 11, 2019 :

-  The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously   to [ ] lower maintain the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances to at 1.55 percent, effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019 .
-  As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective October 31, 2019 December 12, 2019 , the Federal Open Market Committee directs the Desk to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 percent.  In light of recent and expected increases in the Federal Reserve's non-reserve liabilities, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase continue purchasing Treasury bills at least into the second quarter of next year 2020 to maintain over time ample reserve balances at or above the level that prevailed in early September 2019. The Committee also directs the Desk to conduct continue conducting term and overnight repurchase agreement operations at least through January of next year 2020 to ensure that the supply of reserves remains ample even during periods of sharp increases in non-reserve liabilities, and to mitigate the risk of money market pressures that could adversely affect policy implementation.  In addition, the Committee directs the Desk to conduct overnight reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 1.45 percent, in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a per-counterparty limit of $30 billion per day.

The Committee directs the Desk to continue rolling over at auction all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities and to continue reinvesting all principal payments from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities received during each calendar month.  Principal payments from agency debt and agency mortgagebacked securities up to $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in Treasury securities to roughly match the maturity composition of Treasury securities outstanding; principal payments in excess of $20 billion per month will continue to be reinvested in agency mortgage-backed securities.  Small deviations from these amounts for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee also directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed securities transactions.'

-  In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted [ unanimously   to approve a 1/4 percentage point decrease in ] the establishment of the primary credit rate to at the existing level of 2.25 percent, effective October 31, 2019.  In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of Minneapolis and San Francisco.

This information will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement monetary policy.

More information regarding open market operations and reinvestments may be found on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's website.
