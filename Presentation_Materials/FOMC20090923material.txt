Exhibit 1 Effects of Elevated Reserve Balances

Aggregate reserve balances of DIs

Two possible concerns

<!-- missing-text -->

Leverage ratios

- x The subject of a staff memo and briefing at the June meeting.
- x Aggregate bank capital appears to be sufficient given the projected increase in reserve balances
- x Anticipated increase in reserve balances is now smaller
- x But we don't know how large a buffer banking organizations want over regulatory norms

Reasons for elevated balances

- x Large inflows of funds last fall
- x Relatively unattractive riskadjusted returns on alternative assets
- x Weak loan demand
- x Large commercial banks chose to hold high balances as a liquidity buffer
- x High levels of reserve balances could put pressure on leverage ratios, leading banks to reduce bank credit
- x Banks' efforts to reduce their balances could put downward pressure on interest rates and lead to an easing of credit standards and terms

Consultations

- x To examine the second concern, staff consulted with four banking organizations:
- o Two large commercial banks
- o One large U.S. branch of a foreign banking organization
- o One key processing bank
- x The institutions account for 35 percent of reserve balances and 17 percent of bank credit

Response to further inflows of balances

- x The large commercial banks indicated balances could rise before they would take action
- x The other two firms said they would offset any addition
- x Possible actions:
- o Run off some managed liabilities
- o Purchase safe, short- and intermediate-term securities
- o No change in lending

Plans for reducing balances

- x Reductions were expected to leave balances above pre-crisis levels
- o Interest on reserves
- o Increased concern about liquidity
- x The organizations' anticipated timing of reductions in reserve balances differed widely

Implications for financial markets

- x Tension between projected increases in reserves and potentially decreasing demand
- x Asset returns will have to adjust to leave banks willing to hold the existing stock of reserves
- o Rates on shorter-term funding instruments likely to fall
- o Yield on securities that are close substitutes for reserves should decline
- o No change in lending standards

Simulation results

<!-- missing-text -->

Exhibit 2 Policy Implications

Intended methods for reducing balances

- x Pay down borrowings in wholesale markets
- x Allow some large time deposits to run off
- x Increase lending in interbank and other wholesale markets
- x Increase purchases of safe, shortand intermediate-term securities
- x Generally no changes in lending terms and standards

Implications for the economy

- x These are the intended consequences of quantitative easing
- x The size of the resulting effects on rates and on the economy is quite uncertain
- x In the staff forecast, these effects are assumed to be quite small
- x Constructed an alternative simulation assuming the effects are large

What if this analysis is wrong?

- x Could provide more stimulus o Some members may see additional monetary stimulus as potentially beneficial
- x Could contribute to higher expected and actual inflation
- x The Committee might decide to tighten policy sooner or more rapidly than would otherwise have been the case

Material for Briefing on Proposed TAF and TSLF Schedules

Brian Madigan September 22, 2009

DRAFT:   PRESS RELEASE - September 24, 2009

The Federal Reserve on Thursday announced schedules for operations under the Term Auction Facility (TAF) and the Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) through January 2010 and other information related to those facilities.

These schedules are consistent with the intention indicated in the Federal Reserve's June 25 press release to gradually scale back these facilities in response to continued improvements in financial market conditions.

As noted in previous announcements, the Federal Reserve remains prepared to expand its liquidity provision should financial market conditions deteriorate materially.  If significant market strains appear likely to develop over year-end, the announced schedules may be modified to accommodate expanded operations.

Detailed schedules are attached.

Term Auction Facility

Under the TAF, to date the Federal Reserve has reduced offered amounts from a peak of $150 billion per auction to $75 billion per auction as conditions in wholesale markets for unsecured credit have continued to improve.  Under the schedules announced Thursday, the Federal Reserve will continue to offer $75 billion per auction of 28-day funds through January to help ensure that an adequate volume of funding is available in the period leading up to year-end and over year-end.  Reductions in the sizes of those 28-day operations are expected to resume early next year.  The amounts offered under the existing cycle of auctions of 84-day funds will be reduced to $50 billion effective in October and to $25 billion in November and December, and the maturities of those operations will be reduced.  The purpose of shortening the maturities is to align the maturity dates of those operations with the maturities in the cycle for 28-day funds. With the completion of that transition, the auction schedule will be converted by early next year to a single cycle of 28-day funds offered every 28 days.

Over the next several months, the Federal Reserve will assess whether to maintain a TAF on a permanent basis.  A permanent TAF could take a variety of forms.  For example, under one approach, a relatively small amount of funds would be made available in ordinary circumstances, but the facility could be expanded rapidly in conditions of extraordinary market stress.  Under an alternative approach, the TAF would be deactivated when market conditions have improved sufficiently but would remain available for use in conditions of increased market stress.  The Federal Reserve will soon publish a request for public comment on a range of possible structures for a permanent TAF.

Term Securities Lending Facility

As announced on June 25, the Federal Reserve has discontinued Schedule 1 TSLF operations and TSLF Options Program operations.  It has also reduced the frequency and size of its Schedule 2 TSLF operations.  Consistent with recent further improvements in conditions in secured financing markets, the amounts offered in TSLF auctions will be scaled back further from their current size of $75 billion.  As indicated in the attached schedule, TSLF offerings will

be reduced to $50 billion in the October auction and to $25 billion in the November, December, and January auctions.

Possible Year-end Operations

The Federal Reserve is prepared to temporarily increase the sizes of TAF and TSLF operations or conduct additional off-cycle operations with terms that span year-end in order to address transitory market strains.

August FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June suggests that economic activity is leveling out.  Conditions in financial markets have improved further in recent weeks.  Household spending has continued to show signs of stabilizing but remains constrained by ongoing job losses, sluggish income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing but are making progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee continues to anticipate that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth in a context of price stability.

The prices of energy and other commodities have risen of late.  However, substantial resource slack is likely to dampen cost pressures, and the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  As previously announced, to provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve will purchase a total of up to $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year.  In addition, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities.  To promote a smooth transition in markets as these purchases of Treasury securities are completed, the Committee has decided to gradually slow the pace of these transactions and anticipates that the full amount will be purchased by the end of October.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

September FOMC Statement - Alternative A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August indicates that economic activity is leveling out , and conditions in financial markets have improved somewhat further.  Businesses have made progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. However, household spending is sluggish, job losses are ongoing, and credit remains tight.  Although the Committee continues to anticipate a resumption of economic growth in a context of price stability, absent further policy action the economic recovery could be relatively weak, with slack in resource utilization diminishing quite slowly .
- 2. Inflation has fallen considerably over the past year.  With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
- 3. To promote a sustained economic recovery and higher resource utilization, the Committee has decided to provide additional monetary stimulus by increasing its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced amount of as much as $1.25 trillion, and to extend these purchases through the second quarter of 2010.  As previously announced, the Federal Reserve is in the process of buying $300 billion of Treasury securities by the end of October and up to $200 billion of agency debt by the end of the year.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that low levels of resource utilization and subdued inflation are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities, in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted.

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in August suggests that a recovery in economic activity has begun . Conditions in financial markets have improved further. Consumer spending seems to be stabilizing but has yet to show sustained strength . Activity in the housing sector has increased. Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment and staffing , though at a slower pace; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales. The Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will support a strengthening of economic growth in a context of price stability.
- 2. With inflation expectations apparently well anchored , the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.
- 3. In view of improving economic and financial market conditions, the Committee now plans to purchase a total of about $1 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $150 billion of agency debt, somewhat less than the previously announced maximum amounts.  To promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee will gradually slow the pace of its purchases until their expected completion by the end of the year. As previously announced, the Federal Reserve 's purchases of $300 billion of Treasury securities will be completed by the end of October. The Federal Reserve is monitoring the size and composition of its balance sheet and will make adjustments to its credit and liquidity programs as warranted. So long as inflation remains well contained, the Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at its exceptionally low level of 0 to ¼ percent until it has greater assurance that the economic recovery will be sustained .  The Committee will continue to evaluate timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

DIRECTIVE -AUGUST FOMC MEETING

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt, agency MBS, and longer-term Treasury securities during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions.  The Desk is expected to purchase up to $200 billion in housingrelated agency debt and up to $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the year.  The Desk is expected to purchase about $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of October, gradually slowing the pace of these purchases until they are completed.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
