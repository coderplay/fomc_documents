Policy Considerations

- Case for acting early:
- Still not far away from ELB, respond early to emerging weakness.
- Trade policy uncertainty may already affect economic outlook.
- Return of inflation to 2 percent more protracted.
- Case for waiting for more information:
- Change in policy stance now could increase pessimism.
- Respond to economic and financial developments that are sustained.

Alternative B

- Waiting for a few more weeks to assess the effects of heightened uncertainty may be prudent.
- Emphasis on uncertainties, willingness to act leave impression you are ready to ease in July.
- Supported by notable downshift in dots, risk assessments.

MAY 2019 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information  received since the Federal Open Market Committee  met in March indicates that the labor market remains strong and that economic activity rose at a solid rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months,  and the unemployment  rate has remained low.  Growth of household spending and business fixed investment  slowed in the first quarter.  On a 12-month  basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy  have declined and are running  below 2 percent.  On balance, market-based measures of inflation compensation  have remained low in recent months,  and survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory  mandate,  the Committee  seeks to foster maximum employment  and price stability.  In support of these goals, the Committee  decided to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee  continues  to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market  conditions, and inflation near the Committee's  symmetric  2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.  In light of global economic and financial developments and muted  inflation pressures, the Committee  will be patient as it determines what future adjustments  to the target range for the federal funds rate may  be appropriate to support these outcomes.
- 3. In determining  the timing  and size of future  adjustments  to the target range for the federal funds  rate, the Committee  will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum  employment  objective and its symmetric  2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,  including  measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

ALTERNATIVE  A FOR JUNE 2019

- 1. Information  received since the Federal Open Market Committee  met in March May indicates that the labor market  remains strong and that economic activity rose is rising at a solid moderate rate.  Job gains have been solid, on average, in recent months,  and the unemployment  rate has remained low. Although growth of household spending and appears to have picked up from earlier in the year, indicators  of business fixed investment  slowed in the first quarter have been soft .  On a 12-month  basis, overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have declined and are running  below 2 percent.  On balance, Market-based measures of inflation compensation  have remained low in recent months,  and declined; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory  mandate,  the Committee  seeks to foster maximum employment  and price stability.  In support of these goals light of heightened uncertainties about the economic outlook and muted  inflation  pressures , the Committee  decided to maintain lower the target range for the federal funds rate at to 2 to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent. The Committee also decided to conclude  the reduction  of its aggregate securities holdings  in the System Open Market Account at the end of July; thereafter, reinvestments will occur as specified in the Committee's statement of Balance Sheet Normalization  Principles  and Plans. With these actions, the Committee  continues to view sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market  conditions, and inflation near the Committee's  symmetric  2 percent objective as the most likely outcomes.   In light of global economic and financial developments and muted  inflation pressures, The Committee  will be patient as it determines what future is prepared  to adjustments  to the target range for the federal funds rate may be as appropriate to support these outcomes.
- 3. In determining  the timing  and size of future  adjustments  to the target range for the federal funds  rate, the Committee  will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum  employment  objective and its symmetric  2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information,  including  measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

Implementation Note for June 2019 Alternative A

Release Date:  June 19, 2019

Decisions Regarding  Monetary Policy Implementation

The Federal Reserve has made the following decisions to implement  the monetary  policy stance announced  by the Federal Open Market Committee  in its statement  on May 1, 2019 June 19, 2019 :

- · The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  voted   unanimously [ ] to set lower the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances at 2.35 to 2.10 percent, effective May 2, 2019 June 20, 2019 .  Setting  the interest rate paid on required and excess reserve balances 15 basis points below the top of the target range for the federal funds rate is intended to foster trading in the federal funds  market at rates well within the FOMC's target range.
- · As part of its policy decision, the Federal Open Market Committee  voted to authorize and direct the Open Market Desk at the Federal Reserve Bank  of New York, until instructed otherwise, to execute transactions in the System Open Market Account  in accordance with the following domestic policy directive:

'Effective May 2, 2019 June 20, 2019 , the Federal Open Market Committee  directs the Desk to undertake  open market operations as necessary to maintain  the federal funds  rate in a target range of 2 to 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 percent, including overnight  reverse repurchase operations (and reverse repurchase operations with maturities of more than one day when necessary to accommodate  weekend, holiday, or similar trading conventions) at an offering rate of 2.25 2.00 percent, in amounts  limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright  in the System  Open Market Account that are available for such operations and by a percounterparty  limit of $30 billion per day.

Effective May 2, 2019, The Committee  directs the Desk to continue roll ing over at auction the amount  of principal payments  from the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities maturing  during each calendar month  that exceeds $15 billion.  The Committee  directs the Desk , and to continue  reinvesting in agency  mortgage-backed  securities the amount  of principal payments  from the Federal Reserve's holdings of agency  debt and agency mortgage-backed  securities received during  each calendar month  that exceeds $20 billion.  Small deviations from these amounts  for operational reasons are acceptable.

The Committee  also directs the Desk to engage  in dollar roll and coupon swap transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement  of the Federal Reserve's agency mortgage-backed  securities transactions.'

- · In a related action, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System voted   unanimously [ ] to approve the establishment  of a 1/4 percentage point decrease in the primary credit rate at the existing level of 3.00 percent to 2.75 percent, effective June 20, 2019 . In taking this action, the Board approved requests to establish that rate submitted  by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of [ … ] .

This information  will be updated as appropriate to reflect decisions of the Federal Open Market Committee  or the Board of Governors regarding details of the Federal Reserve's operational tools and approach used to implement  monetary  policy.

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Standing, Fixed-Rate Open Market Repo Facility

Nathaniel Wuerffel, Laura Lipscomb, Steve Spurry

A standing, fixed rate repo facility could support different monetary policy objectives depending on the design parameters. Different design parameters also lead to different policy issues and tradeoffs.

Key design parameters and effects

- · Rate - the lower the fixed rate is set, the more often the facility would serve as a backstop to privately traded rates, and the more actively the facility would be used
- · Counterparties - transacting with primary dealers would more directly affect repo markets, transacting with banks would more directly affect their reserve demand and unsecured markets
- · Securities - broader eligibility range could encourage shift in counterparty portfolios

Key policy considerations

- · Reliability of access in different states of firm health - degree of certainty about availability would likely affect bank demand for reserves versus other HQLA
- · Potential for stigma - pricing that incents regularity of usage may lessen stigma risk, but result in more active operations and potential disintermediation

19.  A Problem for Policymakers

- Long-run expectations appear to be anchored at a level consistent with underlying inflation below 2 percent.
- Achieving the FOMC's inflation goal therefore requires pushing activity above potential indefinitely.
- If expectations weren't anchored, they could move toward 2 percent.
- However, unanchored expectations could have adverse consequences for economic stabilization.

20.  A Simple Model-Based Exercise

Use a model to compare outcomes under anchored and unanchored expectations.

- Scenario 1: Long-run expectations are fixed at 1.8 percent.
- Scenario 2: Long-run expectations are derived from a forecasting rule. (In each period, agents use recent data to re-estimate their rule.)

Allow shocks to hit the economy, and evaluate outcomes using a loss function.

- A policy rule that reacts to deviations of inflation from a specified target; and,
- A discounted quadratic loss function for policymakers.

Note: Relative loss is median loss for case shown scaled by median loss under fully anchored case.

24. Some Caveats

- Model is extremely stylized, and ignores many potentially relevant considerations (ELB, credibility).
- Results might not hold up in a richer model, or one that makes different assumptions about how expectations are formed.
- In practice, it is not clear how to induce agents to start revising their long-run expectations, or what else might result from doing so.

Three scenarios for future trade policy

- 'Good deal' scenario: U.S. and China roll back most tariffs, and no additional tariffs.
- Baseline scenario: a 'ceasefire' where tariffs remain at current levels with no further hikes.
- 'Escalation' scenario: 25 percent tariff on remaining imports from China, all imports from Mexico.

Interest Rates: Low for long

- · Foreign central banks likely to keep interest rates low for years to come.
- · Reinforced by continued quiescence of inflation.
- · Raises the question of whether low-for-long interest rates pose financial stability risks, particularly in the corporate sector.

- · U.S. non-financial business investment: nonfinancial corporate business gross fixed capital formation (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Haver Analytics).
- · U.S. non-financial corporate net lending: gross saving less gross fixed investment; gross saving is equal to the after-tax operating surplus of firms plus investment income less interest and dividends paid (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Haver Analytics).
- · U.S. non-financial corporate net buybacks: negative of the change in the stock of outstanding corporate equity liabilities (Source: Bureau of Economic Analysis, Haver Analytics).
- · U.S. non-financial corporate leverage: mean leverage ratios across firms, weighted by assets of each firm; the firm's leverage ratio is a sum of the book value of total debt divided by book value of total assets. (Source: Staff calculations based on S&amp;amp;P Capital IQ, Compustat).
- · Default rates of leveraged loans: original issuance amount of loans that defaulted over the previous twelve months divided by the total outstanding amount. The sample is comprised of the S&amp;amp;P/LSTA leveraged loan index, made up primarily of nonfinancial corporates but also including a small amount (~5%) of financial borrowers (Source: S&amp;amp;P LCD).
