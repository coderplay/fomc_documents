JUNE FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April indicates that the economic recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly than the Committee had expected.  Also, recent labor market indicators have been weaker than anticipated.  The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan.  Household spending and business investment in equipment and software continue to expand. However, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed.  Inflation has picked up in recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions.  However, longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, the Committee expects the pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters and the unemployment rate to resume its gradual decline toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate.  Inflation has moved up recently, but the Committee anticipates that inflation will subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate.  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions-including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period.  The Committee will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer-term Treasury securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings.  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate.
- 4. The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will act as needed to best foster maximum employment and price stability.

AUGUST FOMC STATEMENT-ALTERNATIVE A

- 1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in April June indicates that the economic growth so far this year recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, though somewhat more slowly has been considerably slower than the Committee had expected.  Also, recent Indicators suggest a deterioration in overall labor market conditions in recent months, have been weaker than anticipated and the unemployment rate has moved up . Financial conditions have become more restrictive. The slower pace of the recovery reflects in part factors that are likely to be temporary, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan.  Household spending has flattened out, investment in nonresidential structures is still weak, and the housing sector remains depressed   However, . and business investment in equipment and software continue  to expand.  However, investment in nonresidential s structures is still weak, and the housing sector continues to be depressed. Temporary factors, including the damping effect of higher food and energy prices on consumer purchasing power and spending as well as supply chain disruptions associated with the tragic events in Japan, appear to account for only some of the recent weakness in economic activity. Inflation has picked up earlier in the year recent months, mainly reflecting higher prices for some commodities and imported goods, as well as the recent supply chain disruptions. More recently, inflation has moderated as prices of energy and some commodities have declined from their earlier peaks. However, Longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The unemployment rate remains elevated; however, The Committee now expects the a somewhat slower pace of recovery to pick up over coming quarters than it did at the time of the previous meeting and anticipates that the unemployment rate to resume its gradual will decline only gradually toward levels that the Committee judges to be consistent with its dual mandate. Moreover, downside risks to the economic outlook have increased. Inflation has moved up recently, but The Committee also anticipates that inflation will settle, over coming quarters, at subside to levels at or below those consistent with the Committee's dual mandate as the effects of past energy and other commodity price increases dissipate further .  However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.
- 3. To promote the ongoing economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at levels consistent with its mandate, the Committee decided today to keep the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee continues to currently anticipate  that economic conditions-including low rates of resource s utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run-are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013 for an extended period.

- 4. In order to provide greater support for the economic recovery, the Committee also decided to adjust the composition of its securities holdings.  Over the next 12 months, the Committee will purchase $400 billion of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 7 years to 30 years and sell an equal amount of Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 3 years or less.  Lengthening the average duration of the Federal Reserve's securities portfolio should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates in private credit markets and thereby support growth in private demand for goods and services. The Committee also will complete its purchases of $600 billion of longer term Treasury securities by the end of this month and will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings and, going forward, will use the proceeds to purchase only Treasury securities with remaining maturities of 7 years to 30 years .  The Committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings further if needed as appropriate.
- 5. The Committee will monitor carefully assess the economic outlook in light of incoming information and financial developments and will act as needed employ its policy tools as appropriate to promote a stronger pace of economic recovery in a context of price stability best foster maximum employment and price stability.
