Predicted Recoveries

Methodology

- We look at the experience of a large number of countries over the past 40 years during recessions and recoveries.
- Using regression analysis, we find that:
- Deeper recessions are typically associated with faster recoveries and
- Longer recessions tend to be associated with slower recoveries.
- Using these relationships, we can compare a predicted recovery path, based on the depth and duration of the recessions following the Global Financial Crisis, with what actually occurred.

Possible Enhancements to the Survey of Economic Projections

The current version of the Survey of Economic Projections:

- · Does a good job conveying the diversity of views among participants.
- · Does not necessarily illuminate the "collective" view of future economic conditions and appropriate policy.
- · Provides almost no information on the likely future course of the asset purchase program.
- · Does not prominently display information on the uncertain nature of the outlook.

In our memo, we considered several enhancements:

- · Publish medians (possibly for some sub-set of participants)
- · Distinguish members' (or non-dissenting members') policy assessments
- · Include fan charts
- · Provide additional information on the Federal Reserve balance sheet

Publishing Medians

- · Medians are a simple statistic to summarize the "center" of any collection of forecasts (e.g.  participants, members, non-dissenting members).
- · Medians of non-dissenting members would provide the best picture of the thinking underlying the policy decisions.
- · Internal coherence is not guaranteed by medians, but this would be less of a problem for a group with more homogenous views.
- · Operationally, the differences in medians across groups were generally not large, and the choice may be of second-order importance.
- · Medians were quite robust to changes in membership.

In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1/4 percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the appropriate level of the target federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run. from

Fan charts:

- · Convey uncertainty.

Additional Enhancements

Fan charts require a decision on method:

- · Put forecast differences into perspective.
- · Display the likely accuracy of the projections better than the table.

Balance Sheet Issues

Clarification on these issues is difficult because:

- · The Committee does not hold a common view regarding costs, efficacy, tradeoff.
- · The issues are complicated.
- · The asset-purchase program has many dimensions, which further hinders both agreement and clear explanation.

Some possible enhancements to communication include:

- · New questions could be added to the SEP.
- · The minutes could be used to communicate the Committee's views.
- · The Chairman and others could give speeches and testimonies to clarify issues.
- · Historical forecast accuracy
- · Stochastic simulations
- · Individual Committee assessments

Questions for the SEP Enhancements Discussion

- 1. Should the medians of projections be presented in the SEP?  If so, should the SEP show the medians of the projections of all participants, of the voting members, and/or of the members voting for the policy decision at a given meeting?
- 2. Should the figure summarizing participants' assessments of appropriate monetary policy distinguish between the projections of voters and other participants, or between voters supporting the policy decision and other participants?
- 3. Should the SEP illustrate uncertainty about future real activity and inflation by publishing fan charts centered on the median of projections chosen in question 1 above?  If so, what method should be used to construct them -  historical forecast errors, stochastic simulations, or participant-supplied probability estimates?  If stochastic simulations are used, should they be based on FRB/US alone or on several different models?
- 4. Should the SEP report fan charts for the federal funds rate?  If the charts are based on stochastic simulations, what policy rule should be used?
- 5. Should the SEP provide information about participants' expectations for the evolution of the FOMC's balance sheet policies?  If so, what specific information should be provided in the SEP?  If you do not consider the SEP a suitable vehicle for communicating participants' expectations concerning balance sheet policies, is there another means for communicating these expectations that you would suggest?
