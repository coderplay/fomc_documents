Optimal  Monetary  Policy: A First Pass

Defining  "Optimal" Policy

- * FOMC desires to limit squared deviations of:
- -inflation from  a target level
- -unemployment  rate from  its equilibrium  level
- * FRB/US is the correct characterization of the economy.
- * The  "optimal" policy is conditional  on the  model  and the objectives assumed.

"Optimal" and  Estimated  Policy Rules

Why Is the  "Optimal" Policy So Aggressive?

- * This finding hinges on three  key assumptions:
- 1.  Expectations formed  as if  FOMC following  historical  policy rule.
- 2. FOMC  knows the structure of the economy with certainty.
- 3. No measurement  error in macroeconomic  data.
- * We evaluate the implications of relaxing each  assumption  in subsequent exhibits.

Exhibit 3 Forward-Looking  Expectations

Implications of Forward-Looking  Behavior

- * Private agents will expect the initial response  of the federal funds rate to be followed by additional  policy changes.
- * Expectations will be  incorporated into current  asset prices  and economic decisions.
- * Inertial  response  can have an  immediate  and sizable impact  on economic variables.

- * None of the factors alone seems  to fully explain the observed smoothness of the federal  funds rate.
- * Caveat: These factors likely interact.

Other Considerations

- * Policymakers face uncertainty about structure of model.
- *  Economy may demonstrate  large, discrete responses.
- *  FOMC  may be concerned about financial fragility.

Institutional Aspects

* Policy decisions are  made by a committee.

* FOMC  might seek to avoid reversals.

Monetary Policy  Inertia

Two  Types of Monetary Policy  Inertia

There is a widespread view  among academic  and central bank economists  that monetary policy  is slowly  adjusted in  response  to information about the economy. Such  behavior is often  called  "policy  inertia," "gradualism," or "interest rate smoothing."

It is  important  to distinguish types  of monetary policy  inertia that operate at different horizons:

Short-term policy  inertia:

- * A week-to-week partial  adjustment  of the policy  interest rate. For example,  cutting the funds  rate by two 25-basis-point moves  separated by several  weeks instead  of reducing it all  at once by 50 basis points.
- * Breaking up a large  interest rate  movement into smaller changes may help reduce any adverse  reactions  in  financial markets;  however, this motive appears to  operate at a very short horizon.
- * Such short-term partial  adjustment  is often apparent,  but it  is essentially  unrelated to policy inertia  at a quarterly  frequency.

Quarterly policy  inertia:

- * A quarter-to-quarter  partial adjustment  of the federal funds  rate.  For example,  if the Fed wanted to  increase the funds  rate by a percentage point,  it would raise  the rate by only about 20 basis points  per quarter  for the next few quarters.
- * Quarterly monetary policy  inertia  is the conventional  interpretation  of the estimated monetary  policy rules that are widespread  in the economics  literature.  For example, Clarida,  Gali, and Gertler  (2000, pp.  157-158) describe their empirical estimates  of Fed behavior as ". . . suggesting considerable  interest rate  inertia:  only  between 10% and 30% of a change  in  the  [desired  interest rate]  is  reflected in the Funds  rate within the quarter  of  the change." [emphasis added]
- * My discussion below refers only to the  issue of quarterly  gradualism  in monetary policy  actions.

Although  many have argued that quarterly policy  inertia is an important empirical result, my analysis,  in contrast, suggests  that the federal  funds rate is  not adjusted gradually over several  quarters but that the Fed responds  promptly to a wide variety of economic developments.

Apparent Evidence  for Quarterly Policy  Inertia

Policy  inertia-the view  that the funds rate is  adjusted at a very sluggish  pace over several quarters-is apparently supported by numerous estimates of monetary policy  rules.

- * These policy rules take  a partial  adjustment form, where  the  current funds  rate  can  be expressed  as a weighted  average  of last quarter's actual  rate and the current quarter's desired  funds rate. The parameter p-which indicates the amount of inertia-is the weight on last quarter's funds rate level:

funds ratet  = P x funds rate t  -1 + (1 p) x desired  unds rate t f .

- * With quarterly data,  many  estimates  put about a  ¾  weight on the lagged  funds  rate (p = .75)  and a … weight  on the desired rate. The usual  interpretation  of this partial adjustment  is that the  Fed adjusts the funds  rate  only 25  percent toward  its desired level  in  each  quarter-a very  sluggish policy response.

For example,  the FOMC Financial Indicators packet contains two estimated  monetary policy  rules: one with  and one without policy  inertia.

- * Both rules  set the  desired  funds rate  on the basis  of  the Taylor rule,  that is,  in  response to current readings  on the  output gap  and inflation rate:
- * The estimated Taylor rule with inertia follows the  actual  funds rate path much  more closely than the estimated rule  without inertia,  which apparently  supports  gradualism.

desired  funds ratet  = C x  output  gapt + P  x inflationt.

<!-- missing-text -->

Evidence  against Quarterly Policy Inertia from  the Yield  Curve

A key  implication  of policy  inertia: Future funds rate movements  are very predictable.

- * With sluggish  partial  adjustment, if the funds  rate typically is  adjusted  by only 25 percent toward  its desired  target  in  a given quarter, then the remaining 75 percent of the adjustment will  be expected to occur in future  quarters.
- * Therefore,  a  significant amount of policy inertia implies  a significant  amount of predictive  information in financial  markets about the future  path of the funds rate.

In fact,  funds rate predictability is  far lower than quarterly policy  inertia implies.

- * If  the Fed  slowly adjusted  the funds  rate  (if,  for example, p = .75), then a regression of actual changes in the funds  rate on predicted  changes  from  financial markets (eurodollar or fed  funds futures) would yield a good  fit (i.e.,  a moderately high R 2 ).
- * Many researchers  have examined  this regression  and found little predictive information about the funds rate  in financial markets  beyond the next few months. For example,  eurodollar futures have essentially no ability to predict the quarterly change  in the funds  rate three  quarters ahead  (an R 2 of zero).
- * The chart below gives the  actual path of the funds  rate during the past three years and various  expected paths as of the middle  of each  quarter (based on  fed funds futures). Although the funds rate gradually  fell  in 2001,  market participants  anticipated  few of these declines  at a  6- to 9-month horizon,  as they would have under policy inertia.

<!-- missing-text -->

The Illusion  of Monetary Policy  Inertia

How can the estimates of sluggish  partial adjustment (specifically  p = .75)  be explained  given the low  amount of funds rate predictability in  financial markets?

Answer:  The Fed's reaction to information  and events  outside the scope  of the Taylor rule could  be incorrectly interpreted as sluggish  policy  adjustment.

- * The case  for gradualism  is that the  Taylor rule without  inertia appears to fit poorly because there are large persistent deviations of the actual  funds rate  from the rule. The Taylor rule with inertia  explains these persistent deviations  as a sluggish  response to output and inflation.
- * However, an alternative explanation  is  that the Taylor  rule is an  incomplete description  of Fed policymaking and that the  Fed responds  to other persistent variables  besides current  output and  inflation. Under this interpretation,  the Fed does not exhibit quarterly policy  inertia.
- * These two explanations are difficult to distinguish  through direct estimation; however, the low predictability of the  funds rate indicates  the  absence  of  inertia.

What "other persistent variables" does  the Fed react to so  that the funds rate deviates  from the Taylor rule (and induces  the illusion  of monetary policy  inertia)?

Answer:  The Taylor rule takes into account current output and inflation; however,  the Fed also  responds to  other information about the economy  including variables that affect the outlook and credit and financial  flows.

- * During  1992 and  1993,  when the funds  rate was  persistently below the Taylor rule recommendations,  Chairman Greenspan  stressed the reaction  of the Fed to a credit crunch:  "In  an endeavor to defuse  these  financial strains,  we moved short-term  rates lower in  a long series of steps that ended  in the  late summer  of 1992,  and we  held them at unusually low  levels through the end  of 1993-both  absolutely  and, importantly,  relative to  inflation."
- * For the period during  late  1998,  Governor Meyer described  policy  this way:  "There are three developments,  each of which,  I believe, contributed to this decline in  the funds  rate  relative to Taylor rule prescription.  The first event was the dramatic financial  market turbulence,  following the Russian  default and  devaluation.  The decline  in the federal  funds rate was,  in my  view, appropriate  to offset the  sharp deterioration  in financial  market conditions,  including wider  private  risk spreads, evidence  of tighter underwriting  and  loan terms  at banks,  and sharply reduced liquidity  in financial  markets."

Two Unresolved  Questions

1.  How  should  the Fed's monetary policy  decision-making  process  be modeled?

- * The Taylor rule is an incomplete  description of Fed behavior, and more research  is required  to characterize  other influences  and determinants  of policy.  Adding partial adjustment  to the policy rule  is not a solution;  instead, partial  adjustment  is  a misspecification  that substitutes  for clearer  understanding  of  the policy process.
- * A closely  related  question is,  What kind  of loss  function should represent Fed behavior?  Currently, the policymaker-perfect-foresight  (PPF) path  in the Bluebook uses a  loss function  that assumes the Fed  would be  equally displeased with:  (1) an unemployment  rate one percentage  point above  the natural  rate,  (2)  an inflation  rate one percentage  point above target, and (3)  a  100-basis-point  decrease  in the  quarterly average  funds  rate.  These  equal  weights place  an implausibly high  penalty on funds rate volatility. However, without a substantial  penalty on funds rate  volatility, the PPF path does not match the  recent historical  path of the  funds rate,  so the high penalty  may be another misspecification  that is  compensating for some  unknown flaw in  our calculations  of optimal policy.
- * If  policy over the  past two  decades  has been  close to optimal, then an important element  is missing from  the current  specifications  used by economists to construct optimal  monetary policy.
- 2. Should  the Fed deviate  from its historical  behavior and become  more aggressive  in changing the funds rate?
- * It  may  be that our economic  models-without  interest  rate smoothing  in the  loss function-are  basically correct  in finding  that under an optimal  policy, the Fed should be more  aggressive  in  reacting  to economic  news.
- * The analysis  above suggests  that the Fed has not been  sluggish  in reacting  to economic  developments:  It has likely  set the  funds rate equal  to its  desired rate in each  quarter. However, there remain questions about whether  the desired rate should react more  forcefully  to economic  news, that is, whether the Fed has been  too timid.
