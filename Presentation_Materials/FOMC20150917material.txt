Exhibit 1 Questions and Strategies

Key Questions

- How much might the choice of reinvestment strategy matter for economic outcomes?
- How much might the choice of reinvestment strategy affect the path of the federal funds rate?
- Can reinvestment strategies linked to the federal funds rate improve economic outcomes when the ELB is binding?

"Trigger" Strategies

- Full reinvestment of principal payments from Treasury securities and MBS would continue until the federal funds rate reaches the trigger (1 or 2 percent), then stop permanently.
- Three key features:
- o State dependent: end of reinvestment depends on economic outlook.
- o Links reinvestment to level of the policy rate.
- °  Conditionality is limited: triggers imply that reinvestment ends permanently once trigger is reached.

Exhibit 4

Implications of Alternative Reinvestment Strategies for an Adverse Scenario

<!-- missing-text -->

Key Implications of  Trigger Strategies

- Balance sheet stimulus under trigger in adverse scenario comes from an expectations channel:
- o Reinvestment is tied to policy rate, which is expected to remain low.
- A "calendar- based" strategy that simply delayed reinvestment for a couple of years after liftoff would provide much less economic stimulus in adverse scenarios
- The trigger strategy only provides noticeable stimulus if  the adverse shock occurs before the policy rate reaches the trigger.

Exhibit 5 Options for Statement Language on Reinvestment Policy

Alternative C Options

- Continue Reinvestments
- 0 "until normalization of  the level of  the federal funds rate is well under way"
- -Qualitatively consistent with trigger strategies.
- -Might be interpreted as suggesting that reinvestment would not cease until the Committee had increased the federal funds rate more than a few times.
- -Public might conclude that reinvestment could continue for a long time if the economic outlook deteriorated.
- -Qualitative language would leave some ambiguity about how high the funds rate would have to rise to end reinvestment, though policymakers could clarify through communications.
- 0 "at least during the early stages of normalization of  the level of  the federal funds rate"
- -Might be interpreted as indicating that the Committee intends to cease reinvestment after a few hikes in the policy rate.
- -Probably suggests that policymakers place a high priority on beginning to normalize the balance sheet fairly soon.
- -However "at least" would likely suggest that the Committee wanted to retain some option to continue reinvestment.

FOMCSTATEMENT JULY 2015

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in June indicates that economic activity has been expanding moderately in recent months.  Growth in household spending has been moderate and the housing sector has shown additional improvement; however, business fixed investment and net exports stayed soft.  The labor market continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment. On balance, a range of labor market indicators suggests that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year.  Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports.  Market-based measures of inflation compensation remain low; survey-based measures of longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable.
- with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum with appropriate policy 2. Consistent employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that, accommodation, economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, with labor market indicators continuing to move toward levels the Committee judges consistent with its dual mandate.  The Committee continues to see the risks to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly balanced.  Inflation is anticipated to remain near its recent low level in the near term, but the Committee expects inflation to rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term as the labor market improves further and the transitory effects of earlier declines in energy and import prices dissipate.  The Committee continues to monitor inflation developments closely.
- 3. To support continued progress toward maximum employment and price stability, the Committee today reaffirmed its view that the current 0 to ¼ percent target range for the federal funds rate remains appropriate. In determining how long to maintain this target range, the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.  The Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate when it has seen some further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.
- 4. The Committee is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities and of rolling over maturing Treasury securities at auction. This policy, by keeping the Committee's holdings of longer-term securities at sizable levels, should help maintain accommodative financial conditions.
- 5. When the Committee decides to begin to remove policy accommodation, it will take a balanced approach consistent with its longer-run goals of maximum employment and inflation of 2 percent.  The Committee currently anticipates that, even after employment and inflation are near mandate-consistent levels, economic conditions may, for some time, warrant keeping the target federal funds rate below levels the Committee views as normal in the longer run.

Desk Statement for September 2015 Alternative C

Statement Regarding Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements

During its meeting on September 16-17, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorized and directed the Open Market Trading Desk (the Desk) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, effective September 18, 2015, to undertake open market operations as necessary to maintain the federal funds rate in a target range of ¼ to ½ percent, including overnight reverse repurchase operations (ON RRPs) at an offering rate of 0.25 percent and in amounts limited only by the value of Treasury securities held outright in the System Open Market Account (SOMA) that are available for such operations.

To determine the value of Treasury securities available for such operations, several factors need to be taken into account, as not all Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA will be available for use in ON RRP operations.  First, some of the Treasury securities held outright in the SOMA are needed to conduct reverse repurchase agreements with foreign official and international accounts.   Second, some Treasury 1 securities are needed to support the securities lending operations conducted by the Desk. Additionally, buffers are needed to provide for possible changes in demand for these activities and for possible changes in the market value of the SOMA's holdings of Treasury securities.

After estimating the effects of these factors, the Desk anticipates that around $2 trillion of Treasury securities will be available for ON RRP operations to fulfill the FOMC's domestic policy directive.   In the highly unlikely event that the value of bids received in 2 an ON RRP operation exceeds the amount of available collateral, the Desk will allocate awards using a single-price auction based on the 'stop-out' rate at which the overall size limit is reached, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at this rate awarded on a pro rata basis at the stop-out rate.

The operations will be open to all eligible RRP counterparties, will settle same-day, and will have an overnight tenor unless a longer term is warranted to accommodate weekend, holiday, and similar trading conventions.  Each day, individual counterparties are permitted to submit one proposition in a size not to exceed $30 billion and at a rate not to exceed the specified offering rate.  The operations will take place from 12:45 p.m. to 1:15 p.m. (Eastern Time).  Any changes to these terms will be announced with at least one business day's prior notice on the New York Fed's website.

The results of these operations will be posted on the New York Fed's website.  The outstanding amount of RRPs are reported on the Federal Reserve's H.4.1 statistical release as a factor absorbing reserves in Table 1 and as a liability item in Tables 5 and 6.
