William English, Brian Madigan, and Brian Sack

Subject: Redemption of Treasury Securities Under Alternative Approaches

In yesterday's discussion of the redemption strategy for the Federal Reserve's holdings of Treasury securities, several FOMC members raised the possibility of running down our holdings of longer-term securities while continuing to reinvest in shorter-term issues.  The table below summarizes the amount of redemptions achieved under several potential strategies along these lines.

March FOMC Statement

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is stabilizing. Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly. However, investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have been flat at a depressed level, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth. Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.
- 2. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
- 3. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve has been purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt; those purchases are nearing completion, and the remaining transactions will be executed by the end of this month. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
- 4. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has been closing the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgagebacked securities and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

April FOMC Statement-Alternative A

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is showing signs of improving . Although growth in household spending has picked up recently, it is likely to remain constrained by high unemployment, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly; however, investment in nonresidential structures is declining and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Housing starts have edged up but remain at a depressed level.   While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.
- 2. Although longer-term inflation expectations have remained stable, recent data suggest inflation has been trending down in response to substantial resource slack. The Committee anticipates that inflation is likely to be quite subdued for some time.
- 3. To promote a more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee anticipates maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent for an extended period -until economic conditions such as appreciably higher rates of resource utilization, increasing inflation pressures , or rising inflation expectations warrant a less accommodative monetary policy .  The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
- 4. [To gradually reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet and return it to a more normal composition over time, the Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account.  The Committee is continuing to roll over maturing Treasury securities.]
- 5. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgagebacked securities ; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

April FOMC Statement-Alternative C

- 1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in March indicates that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the labor market is improving . Though investment in nonresidential structures is declining, housing starts have edged up, growth in household spending has increased, and business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth. With economic recovery under way, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization.
- 2. Although energy prices have risen on balance in recent months, inflation has remained subdued. The Committee will adjust the stance of monetary policy as necessary over time to ensure that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored and that inflation outcomes are consistent with price stability.
- 3.   The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to 1/4 percent and now anticipates that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time .
- 4. The Committee will maintain its approach of not reinvesting the proceeds of maturing agency debt and payments on mortgage-backed securities held by the System Open Market Account.  In addition, on May 3 the Committee will stop reinvesting the proceeds of maturing Treasury securities.  To further reduce the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet, and to return the balance sheet to a more normal composition, the Committee anticipates that it will soon begin gradual sales of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities.  The timing and pace of such sales will depend on evolving economic and financial conditions. The Committee will continue to monitor the economic outlook and financial developments and will employ its policy tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.
- 5. In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has closed all but one of the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis. The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgagebacked securities ; it closed on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.
