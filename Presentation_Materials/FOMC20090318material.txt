Effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchases (LSAPs)

Supply Effects on Bond Yields

- · FOMC memo (Cabana, et al., December 5) reviewed economic literature.
- -$500 billion purchase of long-term Treasuries could reduce 10-year Treasury yield 20 to 100 basis points.
- -Also lower long-term private yields.
- · Public and private long-term yields historically have been highly correlated.
- -In recent months, these correlations have declined.

LSAP Risks

LSAPs and Monetary Policy Flexibility

- · Marketable assets do not constrain policy stance.
- -Asset purchases stimulate activity.
- -Asset sales restrain activity.
- · Outright sales could lead to a financial loss.
- · Use as collateral to drain reserves still under development.

LSAPs and Fiscal Revenue

- · LSAPs significantly increase Federal Reserve net income.
- -MBS yield 4-1/4%.
- -Reserves pay 1/4%.
- · LSAPs increase Federal Reserve leverage.
- · LSAPs increase maturity mismatch.

Strategies

Assets under Consideration

January FOMC Statement

The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.

Information received since the Committee met in December suggests that the economy has weakened further.  Industrial production, housing starts, and employment have continued to decline steeply, as consumers and businesses have cut back spending.  Furthermore, global demand appears to be slowing significantly.  Conditions in some financial markets have improved, in part reflecting government efforts to provide liquidity and strengthen financial institutions; nevertheless, credit conditions for households and firms remain extremely tight.  The Committee anticipates that a gradual recovery in economic activity will begin later this year, but the downside risks to that outlook are significant.

In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent months and the prospects for considerable economic slack, the Committee expects that inflation pressures will remain subdued in coming quarters.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.

The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  The focus of the Committee's policy is to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that are likely to keep the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet at a high level.  The Federal Reserve continues to purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand the quantity of such purchases and the duration of the purchase program as conditions warrant.  The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.  The Federal Reserve will be implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.

The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments and to assess whether expansions of or modifications to lending facilities would serve to further support credit markets and economic activity and help to preserve price stability.

March 17-18, 2009

Alternative A

- 1.  Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January indicates that the economy is undergoing a severe contraction and that the outlook for the next several quarters has worsened.  Job losses, declining equity and housing wealth, and tight credit conditions have weighed on consumer sentiment and spending.  Weaker sales prospects and difficulties in obtaining credit have led businesses to cut back on inventories and fixed investment.  U.S. exports have slumped as a number of major trading partners have also fallen into recession.  Although the near-term economic outlook is weak, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, together with fiscal and monetary stimulus, will contribute to a gradual resumption of sustainable economic growth.
- 2.  In light of increasing economic slack here and abroad, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued.  Moreover, the Committee sees some risk that inflation could persist for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.
- 3.  In these circumstances, the Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote economic recovery and to preserve price stability.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and anticipates that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing an additional $500 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $1 trillion this year; at least half of this total will be acquired by June. The Committee also decided to boost its purchases of agency debt securities; it now anticipates purchasing $200 billion of such issues this year. Moreover, to help improve conditions in private credit markets, the Committee decided to purchase $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. The Federal Reserve has launched the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses and anticipates that the range of eligible collateral for this facility is likely to be expanded to include other financial assets.  The Committee will continue to monitor carefully the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet in light of evolving financial market developments, and it will be assessing whether a faster pace of asset purchases would be helpful in improving credit market conditions and supporting economic activity .

To provide greater support to mortgage lending and housing markets, the Committee decided today to increase the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet further by purchasing an additional $750 billion of agency mortgage-backed securities, bringing its total purchases of these securities to $1.25 trillion this year, and to increase its purchases of agency debt this year by $100 billion to a total of $200 billion. The Committee also is prepared to purchase longer-term Treasury securities if evolving circumstances indicate that such transactions would be particularly effective in improving conditions in private credit markets.
