Suggested questions for Committee discussion of zero-lower-bound issues

Federal funds target rate

- 1. As a general matter, when it appears likely that the federal funds rate will be constrained by the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates, should the Committee quickly move the target federal funds rate toward the zero bound, or should it 'keep its powder dry' by reducing the target federal funds rate toward zero only gradually?
- 2. Do you think that reducing the target federal funds rate to zero would impose significant costs on financial markets or institutions?  If so, what costs concern you most?  In view of the potential costs and benefits of a zero or near-zero federal funds rate, what do you see as an appropriate minimum for the target federal funds rate?
- 3. Do you see significant benefits from communications strategies designed to indicate:
- a) that the Federal Reserve intends to hold the target federal funds rate at a very low level until specified conditions are judged to obtain?
- b) that the Committee sees a sizable risk that inflation in coming quarters could be appreciably lower than is consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate, and that the Committee will act to mitigate that risk?
- c) that in order to foster low short-term real interest rates and thus promote a resumption of economic expansion, the Federal Reserve will be willing to accept higher rates of inflation in the next few years than it normally would find desirable?

Are there other approaches to providing information to the public about the future course of monetary policy that you see as promising?

Nonstandard policy tools

- 4. Do you see advantages to increasing the Committee's purchases of federal agency debt and mortgage-backed securities beyond the levels already announced?  Do you see advantages to initiating large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury securities? Should purchases of agencies or Treasuries be explicitly conditional in some way on market or economic conditions?  If so, should the relevant conditions be announced in advance?
- 5. Do you see substantial further expansion of credit backstop facilities under the authority of Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act (e.g., the CPFF or the TALF) as likely to be beneficial in current circumstances?
- 6. Do you see other nonstandard policy tools as likely to be particularly effective in current circumstances?  What tools do you see as potentially most useful?
- 7. When employing nonstandard policy tools, how would the Committee most appropriately formulate its directive to the Desk?  Would you favor specifying objectives for quantities of assets to be purchased, for levels of interest rates other than the federal funds rate, or for interest rate spreads?
- 8. When employing nonstandard policy tools, what communications approaches would be most effective in explaining the Committee's use of such tools to markets and the public?

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Material for FOMC Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives

Brian Madigan December 16, 2008

October FOMC

- 1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to 1 percent.
- 2.  The pace of economic activity appears to have slowed markedly, owing importantly to a decline in consumer expenditures. Business equipment spending and industrial production have weakened in recent months, and slowing economic activity in many foreign economies is damping the prospects for U.S. exports. Moreover, the intensification of financial market turmoil is likely to exert additional restraint on spending, partly by further reducing the ability of households and businesses to obtain credit.
- 3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.
- 4.  Recent policy actions, including today's rate reduction, coordinated interest rate cuts by central banks, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen financial systems, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth. Nevertheless, downside risks to growth remain. The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.

December 15-16, 2008

Draft Statement Alternative A

- 1.  Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined. Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.
- 2.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished quickly.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters [and sees some risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.]  [In support of its dual mandate, the Committee will seek to achieve a rate of inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures, of about 2 percent in the medium term.]
- 3.  In current circumstances, the Committee judged that it was not useful to set a specific target for the federal funds rate.  As a result of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity facilities, the federal funds rate has declined to very low levels, and the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rates near zero for some time.
- 4.  The focus of policy going forward will be to continue to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that entail the use of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet.  In particular, as previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve will continue to actively consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.
- 5.  In related actions, the Board of Governors today approved a 75 basis point decrease in the primary credit rate to 1/2 percent and established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 1/4 percent.  In approving the reduction in the discount rate, the Board acted on requests submitted by the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .

December 15-16, 2008

Draft Statement Alternative B

- 1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to establish a target range for the federal funds rate of 0 to 1/4 percent.
- 2.  Since the Committee's last meeting, labor market conditions have deteriorated, and the available data indicate that consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined. Financial markets remain quite strained and credit conditions tight. Overall, the outlook for economic activity has weakened further.
- 3.  Meanwhile, inflationary pressures have diminished quickly.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters [and sees some risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term.]
- 4.  The Federal Reserve will employ all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.  In particular, the Committee anticipates that weak economic conditions are likely to warrant near zero exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time.
- 5. The focus of policy going forward will be to continue to support the functioning of financial markets and stimulate the economy through open market operations and other measures that entail the use of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities and as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities.  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve continues to consider possible additions to and expansions of its liquidity facilities, as well as other means of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity. The Federal Reserve will continue to actively consider ways of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.
- 6.  In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 75-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 1/2 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .  The Board also established interest rates on required and excess reserve balances of 1/4 percent.

December 15-16, 2008

Draft Statement Alternative C

- 1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 50 basis points to ½ percent.
- 2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace of economic activity has slowed further and the near-term outlook has worsened.  Labor market conditions have continued to deteriorate, and consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production have declined.
- 3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters [and sees some risk that inflation could decline for a time below rates that best foster economic growth and price stability in the longer term].
- 4.  In these circumstances, the Committee's primary concern is the downside risks to the economy.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully and will use all available tools to promote the resumption of sustainable economic growth and to preserve price stability.
- 5.  In particular, as previously announced, over the next few quarters the Federal Reserve will purchase large quantities of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets, and it stands ready to expand its purchases of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities as conditions warrant.  The Committee is also evaluating the potential benefits of purchasing longer-term Treasury securities. Early next year, the Federal Reserve will implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.  The Federal Reserve continues to consider possible additions to and expansions of its liquidity facilities, as well as other means of using its balance sheet to further support credit markets and economic activity.
- 6.  In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 50-basis-point decrease in the discount rate to 3/4 percent. In taking this action, the Board approved the requests submitted by the Boards of Directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of . . .
- 7. In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity facilities, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to average somewhat below the ½ percent target.

December 15-16, 2008

Draft Statement Alternative D

- 1.  The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent.
- 2.  Reflecting in part the intensification of the financial strains earlier in the fall, the pace of economic activity appears to have slowed further, and the near-term outlook for growth has deteriorated.  Moreover, the downside risks are significant.  However, policy actions taken in recent months, including reductions in short-term interest rates to very low levels, extraordinary liquidity measures, and official steps to strengthen the financial system, should help over time to improve credit conditions and promote a return to moderate economic growth.  As announced previously, the Federal Reserve will purchase a large volume of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities to provide support to the mortgage and housing markets and thus to broader economic activity.  Early next year, the Federal Reserve will also implement the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to help facilitate the extension of credit to households and small businesses.
- 3.  In light of the declines in the prices of energy and other commodities and the weaker prospects for economic activity, the Committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters to levels consistent with price stability.
- 4.  In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity facilities, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to average significantly below the target rate for some time.  The Committee will monitor economic and financial developments carefully in light of recent policy actions and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability.

Draft Directive Alternative A

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  Over the intermeeting period, the Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agencyguaranteed MBS, with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector.  By the end of the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS.  The Committee has suspended setting a target for the federal funds rate, and it anticipates that the reserve conditions associated with its open market operations and the liquidity programs put in place by the Federal Reserve will result in exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rates near zero. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Draft Directive Alternative B

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range of 0 to 1/4 percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector. By the end of the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Draft Directive Alternative C

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee has established a target for the federal funds rate of 1/2 percent.  In view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to average somewhat below the 1/2 percent target rate.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase GSE debt and agency-guaranteed MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to the mortgage and housing markets.  The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of conditions in primary mortgage markets and the housing sector. By the end of the second quarter of next year, the Desk is expected to purchase up to $100 billion in housing-related GSE debt and up to $500 billion in agency-guaranteed MBS. The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.

Draft Directive Alternative D

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  The Committee has maintained its target for the federal funds rate at 1 percent, but in view of the large volume of reserves provided by the Federal Reserve's various liquidity programs, the Committee recognizes that the federal funds rate is likely to average somewhat below the 1/2 percent target rate.
