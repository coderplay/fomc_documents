January FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but investment in structures is still contracting and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls.  Firms have brought inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  While bank lending continues to contract, financial market conditions remain supportive of economic growth.  Although the pace of economic recovery is likely to be moderate for a time, the Committee anticipates a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.

With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter.  The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced.  In addition, the temporary liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central banks will expire on February 1.  The Federal Reserve is in the process of winding down its Term Auction Facility:  $50 billion in 28-day credit will be offered on February 8 and $25 billion in 28-day credit will be offered at the final auction on March 8.  The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

March FOMC Statement-Alternative A

- 1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in January suggests that economic activity has continued to strengthen and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by high unemployment , modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Business spending on equipment and software has risen significantly   However, . investment in nonresidential structures is still contracting , housing activity continues to be sluggish, and employers remain reluctant to add to payrolls. In light of the weakness in labor markets and prospects for a subpar economic recovery, the Committee judges that further monetary stimulus is warranted.
- 2.   With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
- 3.   To provide further support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to promote a more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee decided to extend its program for purchasing agency mortgage-backed securities. The previously announced purchases of $1.25 trillion of those securities will be executed by the end of this month, and the Committee now anticipates that an additional $150 billion of such securities will be purchased during the second quarter .  The Federal Reserve has been purchasing about $175 billion of agency debt, and those transactions will be executed by the end of this month .  The Committee will continue to evaluate its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.  The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
- 4.   In light of improved functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve has been closing the special liquidity facilities that it created to support markets during the crisis . The only remaining such program, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility , is scheduled to close on June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and on March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for some time [, at least through the end of the second quarter] .

- 4.

Over coming months, the Federal Reserve will continue to test its tools for draining reserves.  In due course, those operations will be scaled up to drain more significant volumes of reserve balances, and then the Federal Reserve will increase the interest rate paid on reserves and its target for the federal funds rate.  The Committee anticipates that any sales of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings would be gradual and would not occur until after policy tightening is under way and the economic recovery is sufficiently advanced. The Committee will monitor the economic outlook and financial developments in determining the timing and sequence of its measures for policy firming and will employ its tools as necessary to promote economic recovery and price stability.

The Committee will also be assessing the possibility of gradual sales of the Federal Reserve's securities holdings to accomplish further reductions in the size of its portfolio.

DIRECTIVE

The directive from the January meeting and draft language for the March directive are provided below.

JANUARY FOMC MEETING

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent.  The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions. The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter. The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near completion.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The Committee directs the Desk to engage in dollar roll transactions as necessary to facilitate settlement of the Federal Reserve's agency MBS transactions to be conducted through the end of the first quarter, as directed above.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
