Alternative Target Rates

- · In some scenarios, linkage of federal funds rate to other short term rates -could be loosened.

Selected Short-Term Interest Rates; June 1, 2008 to present

- -But apparently not so far.
- · Alternative market rates include…
- -Libor, eurodollar, repo rates
- -Institutional factors could affect choice
- -Response of rates to shocks could differ
- · IOER rate could be used as primary policy instrument
- -Monitor a collection of money market rates (similar to BoE).
- -Still questions about connection between IOER and market rates
- -Governance issues in determination of IOER rate

Foreign Experience with Interest on Reserves

- · Most policy rate floors are effective
- But somewhat less so in U ited Kingdom -n
- -Foreign experience (like U.S. experience) indicates that effectiveness of floor depends on scope of access to central bank accounts
- · Central banks with 'floor systems' have been able to tighten policy by raising IOER or deposit rate even with substantial excess reserves.
- -Norges Bank has tightened policy with high reserves.
- · Caveat
- -Experience in other countries may be an imperfect guide to likely outcomes in the United States.

See 'Interest on Excess Reserves as a Monetary Policy Instrument:

The Experience of Foreign Central Banks,' by David Bowman, Etienne Gagnon, and Mike Leahy .

<!-- missing-text -->

Long Run Balance Sheet -Management Issues

- · Long run policy implementation framework -
- -Move away from mandatory reserve requirements?
- -Adopt corridor or floor system?
- · Long run size of the balance sheet -
- -Could be used actively to pursue macro objectives
- it on of the b lance sheet i · Long run compos -a
- -Return to Treasuries only?
- -Shorten average maturity to increase liquidity?

Alternative Sequencing Strategies

Alternative Sequencing Strategies

(from 'Strategies for Sequencing the Use of Reserve Draining Tools and Changes in Policy Rates,' Clouse and Hilton)

<!-- missing-text -->

Criteria for Choosing Among Sequencing Strategies

- - Degree of confidence about using IOER rate by itself to control short term rates. -
- - Possibility of other benefits from draining reserves.
- - Expected time frame for draining significant reserves without complications.
- - Communications challenges with early reserve drain strategy.
- - Costs and risks of draining operations which could prove unnecessary.

Possible Questions for Committee Discussion of Strategies for Removing Policy Accommodation

- 1. Over the next year, how should asset sales be used as part of the exit strategy?
- lative y rapid sa es (say, over $200 b llion) l l ---Re i
- ---Very gradual sales over the next year ($0 to $200 billion)
- ---Redemptions only
- ---State contingent sales (and/or purchases)
- 2. How should redemptions of existing SOMA holdings proceed over the next year?
- ---Redeem all agency and MBS and no Treasuries
- ---Redeem all agency and MBS and some Treasuries
- ---Redeem all agency and MBS and all Treasuries
- ---Redeem some agency and MBS and no Treasuries
- ---Redeem nothing
- 3. How should the use of reverse repos (RRPs) and term deposits (TDs) be sequenced relative to an increase in the IOER rate?
- ---Use RRPs and TDs only if necessary after an increase in the IOER rate (ex post contingent strategy) -
- ---Use RRPs and TDs before an increase in the IOER rate (ex ante strategy) -
- ---Use RRPs and TDs concurrent with increase in IOER rate
- 4. In order to ensure that that increases in the IOER rate provide a sufficient tightening of money market conditions, what volume of reserves (if any) should be drained in advance of the first IOER increase?
- 5. What structure for the Federal Reserve balance sheet would you favor in the long run?
- ---All Treasuries, spread across all maturities (as in previous practice)
- ---All Treasuries, but concentrated in bills and short term coupons -
- ---Treasuries, agencies, and MBS
- ---Other: ________
- 6. How concerned are you that the characteristics of the federal funds rate as an operating target will deteriorate significantly? Do ou see strong advantages in retaining a market interest rate as an operating target? Do you see other interest rates as y particularly suitable replacements for the funds rate as an operating target?
- 7. Will the Committee need to determine its longer run operating framework far in advance in order to implement an effective exit -strategy from the current period of extraordinary policy accommodation?

December FOMC Statement

Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating. The housing sector has shown some signs of improvement over recent months.  Household spending appears to be expanding at a moderate rate, though it remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit.  Businesses are still cutting back on fixed investment, though at a slower pace, and remain reluctant to add to payrolls; they continue to make progress in bringing inventory stocks into better alignment with sales.  Financial market conditions have become more supportive of economic growth.  Although economic activity is likely to remain weak for a time, the Committee anticipates that policy actions to stabilize financial markets and institutions, fiscal and monetary stimulus, and market forces will contribute to a strengthening of economic growth and a gradual return to higher levels of resource utilization in a context of price stability.

With substantial resource slack likely to continue to dampen cost pressures and with longer-term inflation expectations stable, the Committee expects that inflation will remain subdued for some time.

The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.  To provide support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to improve overall conditions in private credit markets, the Federal Reserve is in the process of purchasing $1.25 trillion of agency mortgage-backed securities and about $175 billion of agency debt.  In order to promote a smooth transition in markets, the Committee is gradually slowing the pace of these purchases, and it anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets.

In light of ongoing improvements in the functioning of financial markets, the Committee and the Board of Governors anticipate that most of the Federal Reserve's special liquidity facilities will expire on February 1, 2010, consistent with the Federal Reserve's announcement of June 25, 2009. These facilities include the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility.  The Federal Reserve will also be working with its central bank counterparties to close its temporary liquidity swap arrangements by February 1.  The Federal Reserve expects that amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back in early 2010.   The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30, 2010, for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31, 2010, for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

January FOMC Statement-Alternative A

- 1.   Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in December suggests that economic activity has continued to pick up and that the deterioration in the labor market is abating.  Household spending is expanding at a moderate rate but remains constrained by a weak labor market, modest income growth, lower housing wealth, and tight credit. Business spending on equipment and software appears to be picking up, but investment in structures is still contracting and firms remain reluctant to add to payrolls. Recent data indicate that housing activity remains sluggish and the level of foreclosures continues to be elevated.  In light of the weakness in labor markets and prospects for a subpar economic recovery, the Committee judges that further monetary stimulus is warranted.
- 2. Energy prices have risen in recent months, but core inflation has remained low. With substantial resource slack continuing to restrain cost pressures and longer-term inflation expectations stable, inflation is likely to be subdued for some time.
- 3.   To provide further support to mortgage lending and housing markets and to promote a more robust economic recovery in a context of price stability, the Committee decided to expand its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to a total of $1.5 trillion, up from the previously announced amount of $1.25 trillion; the Committee anticipates that these transactions will be executed by the end of the third quarter.  The Federal Reserve is also in the process of purchasing about $175 billion of agency debt, and the Committee anticipates that those transactions will be executed by the end of the first quarter.  The Committee will continue to evaluate the timing and overall amounts of its purchases of securities in light of the evolving economic outlook and conditions in financial markets. The Committee will maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 0 to ¼ percent and continues to anticipate that economic conditions, including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations, are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period.
- 4.   In light of improve d functioning of financial markets, the Federal Reserve will be closing the Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, and the Term Securities Lending Facility on February 1, as previously announced . In addition, the temporary liquidity swap arrangements between the Federal Reserve and other central bank s will expire on February 1. The amounts provided under the Term Auction Facility will continue to be scaled back, with $50 billion in 28-day credit to be offered at the next auction on February 8; the Federal Reserve expects to offer $25 billion in 28-day credit on March 8 and will consider whether to conduct further auctions beyond that date .  The anticipated expiration dates for the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility remain set at June 30 for loans backed by new-issue commercial mortgage-backed securities and March 31 for loans backed by all other types of collateral.  The Federal Reserve is prepared to modify these plans if necessary to support financial stability and economic growth.

DIRECTIVES

DECEMBER FOMC MEETING

The Federal Open Market Committee seeks monetary and financial conditions that will foster price stability and promote sustainable growth in output.  To further its long-run objectives, the Committee seeks conditions in reserve markets consistent with federal funds trading in a range from 0 to ¼ percent. The Committee directs the Desk to purchase agency debt and agency MBS during the intermeeting period with the aim of providing support to private credit markets and economic activity. The timing and pace of these purchases should depend on conditions in the markets for such securities and on a broader assessment of private credit market conditions. The Desk is expected to execute purchases of about $175 billion in housing-related agency debt and about $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of the first quarter of 2010.  The Desk is expected to gradually slow the pace of these purchases as they near completion.  The Committee anticipates that outright purchases of securities will cause the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet to expand significantly in coming months.  The System Open Market Account Manager and the Secretary will keep the Committee informed of ongoing developments regarding the System's balance sheet that could affect the attainment over time of the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and price stability.
