Monetary Policy Options at the Effective Lower Bound: Assessing the Current Policy Toolkit

Hess Chung and Bernd Schlusche Exhibits by Sofia Baig July 31, 2018

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Exhibit 1: Some Monetary Policy Options at the ELB

What is the probability of the ELB?

- Roughly 40 percent chance that the ELB will bind over the next 10 years (FRB/US, asymmetric rule).
- ELB binds around 15 percent of the time in the long run.

Can forward guidance provide additional policy accommodation at the ELB?

- An illustrative scenario depicting a severe recession.
- Implementing unemployment rate thresholds near or below the natural rate or inflation thresholds near or above target can speed up the recovery.
- These policies lower the median unemployment rate when the ELB binds by around 1/4 percentage point and raise the median inflation rate by as much as 40 basis points.

Exhibit 2: Balance Sheet Policy Options at the ELB

Can balance sheet policies improve macroeconomic outcomes at the ELB?

- Examine two balance sheet policies: a maturity extension program (MEP) and an LSAP.
- Balance sheet measures can help support an economic recovery.
- Example: An LSAP program of $85 bn/month in Treasury securities reduces the median unemployment rate when the ELB binds by about 1/4 percentage point and raises the median inflation rate by about 20 basis points.

Takeaways

- There is a material risk that the ELB will bind in the future.
- The current monetary policy toolkit can offset only some of the effects of a significant recession.
- Long lags in the transmission of policy imply that unconventional policies should be deployed rapidly in the event of an incipient recession.
- Estimates of the macroeconomic effects are subject to considerable uncertainty.

Exhibit 3: Discussion Questions

- How concerned are you that the effective lower bound (ELB) could limit attainment of the Committee's maximum employment and price stability objectives in future economic downturns?
- In your view, how effective would forward guidance - explicit communication about the future path of the policy rate - and balance sheet policies of the type previously used by the Committee be in providing additional policy accommodation at the ELB?  Are there other existing policy tools to be considered as options for dealing with the ELB?  Should the Committee communicate in advance how it would intend to use its policy toolkit when and if the ELB constrains policy?
- Should the Committee evaluate alternative monetary policy strategies, i.e., strategies that would require changing the Committee's Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, in order to address the risk that the ELB may prevent the attainment of its maximum employment and price stability objectives?

JUNE 2018 FOMC STATEMENT

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined.  Recent data suggest that growth of household spending has picked up, while business fixed investment has continued to grow strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent. Indicators of longer-term inflation expectations are little changed, on balance.
- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions, and inflation near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.

ALTERNATIVE A FOR JULY/AUGUST 2018

- 1. Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in May June indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid strong rate.  Job gains have been strong, on average, in recent months, and the unemployment rate has declined stayed low . Recent data suggest that growth of Household spending has picked up, while and business fixed investment has continued to grow have grown strongly.  On a 12-month basis, both overall inflation and inflation for items other than food and energy have moved close to 2 percent.

- 2. Consistent with its statutory mandate, the Committee seeks to foster maximum employment and price stability.  The Committee expects that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate the current stance of monetary policy will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, and strong labor market conditions,  and Inflation . is expected to move modestly above 2 percent for a time and then run near the Committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term.  Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced.
- 3. In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise maintain the target range for the federal funds rate to at 1-3/4 to 2 percent.  The stance of monetary policy remains accommodative, thereby supporting strong labor market conditions and a sustained return to period of inflation modestly above 2 percent inflation. This inflation outcome should help ensure that longer-term inflation expectations are consistent with the Committee's symmetric objective of 2 percent inflation.
- 4. In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its maximum employment objective and its symmetric 2 percent inflation objective.  This assessment will take into account a wide range of information, including measures of labor market conditions, indicators of inflation pressures and inflation expectations, and readings on financial and international developments.
