Option 1: Proposed Resolution on Term RRP Testing over the End of the Second Quarter of 2015

'During the period of June 18, 2015, to June 29, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of term reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities.  Such operations shall: (i) mature no later than July 8, 2015; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation.  Such operations may be for forward settlement.  The System Open Market Account manager will inform the FOMC in advance of the terms of the planned operations.  The Chair must approve the terms of, timing of the announcement of, and timing of the operations.  These operations shall be conducted in addition to the authorized overnight reverse repurchase agreements, which remain subject to a separate overall size limit authorized by the FOMC.'

Option 2: Proposed Resolution on Term RRP Testing over Quarter-ends through January 29, 2016

'During each of the periods of June 18 to 29, 2015; September 18 to 29, 2015; and December 17 to 30, 2015, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) authorizes the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to conduct a series of term reverse repurchase operations involving U.S. government securities.  Such operations shall: (i) mature no later than July 8, 2015, October 7, 2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively; (ii) be subject to an overall size limit of $300 billion outstanding at any one time; (iii) be subject to a maximum bid rate of five basis points above the ON RRP offering rate in effect on the day of the operation; (iv) be awarded to all submitters: (A) at the highest submitted rate if the sum of the bids received is less than or equal to the preannounced size of the operation, or (B) at the stop-out rate, determined by evaluating bids in ascending order by submitted rate up to the point at which the total quantity of bids equals the preannounced size of the operation, with all bids below this rate awarded in full at the stop-out rate and all bids at the stop-out rate awarded on a pro rata basis, if the sum of the counterparty offers received is greater than the preannounced size of the operation.

ON RRP capacity issues

Options for initial aggregate ON RRP capacity

Communications about initial capacity

Option 1: Temporarily elevate initial cap

- o Sensitive to financial stability and footprint concerns
- o If insufficient interest rate control, increase the cap

Option 2: Suspend cap for a short period; establish cap at end of brief period

- o Substantial capacity to start

Monthly Reserve balances

<!-- missing-text -->

- o March minutes report capacity at liftoff "temporarily elevated"
- o Ahead of liftoff or at liftoff announce initial capacity
- -Early: provide markets with further clarity of liftoff strategy
- -At liftoff: evaluate developments as they evolve

Going forward

- o In the longer run, use of the ON RRP facility could be expected to wane, which would make elimination of ON RRPs straightforward
- o If usage remains well below the cap, that cap could be reduced with little effect on market rates, so long as "headroom" remains sufficient
- o If usage is high, substantial use of other tools may be needed to provide rate support
- o The Committee will need to weigh tradeoffs between efficacy and costs for these tools
- o Clear public communication about the ON RRP cap could avoid sending an unintended signal

Questions for the Normalization Tools Discussion

- 1. What are your general views of the two options for the initial setting of the aggregate cap on ON RRP capacity discussed in the March 6, 2015, memo entitled, 'More Steps towards Finalizing the FOMC's Operational Preparations for Liftoff'?  Those options are:
- a. establishing a temporary elevated cap at liftoff and adjusting it later as appropriate or, alternatively,
- b. operating for a brief initial period without a cap and then imposing a cap based on observed take-up on ON RRP operations after liftoff
- 2. What are your general views regarding strategies that the Committee could use to reduce ON RRP take-up after liftoff while maintaining appropriate interest rate control?  (These strategies are discussed in the March 6, 2015, memo entitled, 'Lowering the ON RRP Facility Cap after Liftoff.')

Proposed March Minutes Language

[Participants] agreed to augment the Committee's Policy Normalization Principles and Plans by providing the following additional details regarding the operational approach the FOMC will use when it becomes appropriate to begin normalizing the stance of monetary policy. 1

When economic conditions warrant the commencement of policy firming, the Federal Reserve will:

-  Continue to target a range for the federal funds rate that is 25 basis points wide.
-  Set the rate of interest on excess reserves (IOER) equal to the top of the target range for the federal funds rate and set the offering rate associated with an overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility equal to the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate.
-  Allow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be temporarily elevated to support policy implementation.  Adjust the IOER rate and the parameters of the ON RRP facility, and use other tools such as term operations, as necessary for appropriate monetary control, based on policymakers' assessments of the efficacy and costs of their tools.  The Committee expects to reduce the available capacity of the facility fairly soon after it commences policy firming.

Percent

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Projections of change  in real gross domestic  product  (GDP)  and  projections  for both measures  of inflation are percent changes from the fourth  quarter  of  the previous  year  to  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. PCE  inflation  and  core  PCE  inflation  are  the  percentage  rates of change  in, respectively, the price index for personal  consumption  expenditures  (PCE)  and  the  price  index  for  PCE  excluding  food  and  energy. Projections  for  the  unemployment  rate  are  for  the  average  civilian  unemployment  rate  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  the  year  indicated. Each  participant's projections  are  based  on  his  or  her  assessment  of  appropriate  monetary  policy. Longer-run  projections  represent  each  participant's  assessment  of  the rate  to which  each  variable  would  be  expected  to  converge  under  appropriate  monetary  policy  and  in  the  absence  of  further  shocks  to  the  economy. The  December  projections  were  made  in  conjunction  with  the  meeting  of  the  Federal  Open  Market  Committee  on  December  16-17,  2014.

- 1. The  central  tendency  excludes  the  three  highest  and  three  lowest  projections  for  each  variable  in  each  year.
- 2. The  range  for  a  variable  in  a  given  year  includes  all  participants'  projections,  from  lowest  to  highest,  for  that  variable  in  that  year.
- 3. Longer-run  projections  for  core  PCE  inflation  are  not  collected.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: Definitions of variables are in the general note to the projections table. The data for the actual values of the variables are annual.

<!-- missing-text -->

Note: In the upper panel, the height of each bar denotes the number of FOMC participants who judge that, under appropriate monetary policy, the first increase in the target range for the federal funds rate from its current range of 0 to 1 4 / percent will occur in the specified calendar year. In December 2014, the numbers of FOMC participants who judged that the first increase in the target federal funds rate would occur in 2015, and 2016 were, respectively, 15, and 2. In the lower panel, each shaded circle indicates the value (rounded to the nearest 1 8 / percentage point) of an individual participant's judgment of the midpoint of the appropriate target range for the federal funds rate or the appropriate target level for the federal funds rate at the end of the specified calendar year or over the longer run.
