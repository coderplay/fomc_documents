Material for Briefing on FOMC Participants' Economic Projections

Brian Madigan April 29, 2008

<!-- missing-text -->

1. Projections of real GDP growth, PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are fourth-quarter-to-fourthquarter growth rates, i.e. percentage changes from the fourth quarter of the prior year to the fourth quarter of the indicated year. PCE inflation and core PCE inflation are the percentage rates of change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures and the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, respectively. Each participant's projections are based on his or her assessment of appropriate monetary policy. The range for each variable in a given year includes all participants' projections, from lowest to highest, for that variable in the given year; the central tendencies exclude the three highest and three lowest projections for each variable in each year.

For details on the multitude of complex definitions, rules, carryover provisions, etc., see the 135 page Reserve Maintenance Manual

Demand: Reserve Requirements

-  DIs meet reserve requirements by holding
-  currency in vaults and ATMs
-  reserve balances at a Federal Reserve Bank
-  balances at a correspondent bank
-  No remuneration, so DIs try to reduce required to the  eve  o  vault cash and ba ances they l l f l reserves would hold if there were no requirements
-  sweep programs reduce reservable deposits
-  only 1,500 of 17,000 DIs need to hold reserve balances
-  required reserve balances ≈ 0.1% of total deposits

Demand: Contractual Clearing Balances

-  Many DIs want working balances larger than their required reserve balances
-  to clear Fedwire and other payments
-  to provide a cushion against overnight overdrafts
-  Thousands of DIs hold contractual clearing balances
-  accrue 'earnings credits' at 80% of 3-month T-bill rate
-  credits can be used only to offset fees for priced services

Required Reserve Balances &amp; Contractual Clearing Balances

<!-- missing-text -->

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Role of Required and Contractual Balances

-  Establish a predictable lower bound on periodaverage demand for balances
-  levels of required &amp;amp; contractual balances are set before each reserve maintenance period
-  Averaging provision, carry-over, &amp;amp; clearing band make demand for balances interest elastic -
-  until final day of maintenance period

Demand: Excess Reserves

-  Large DIs seek to hold zero excess reserves on avg.
-  but level varies widely from day to day, reflecting volume of Fedwire payments
-  Small DIs hold $1.5 billion of ex. res. on avg.
-  may need a cushion against overdrafts but not use priced services, so contractual clearing balance unappealing
-  Total balances (required + clearing + excess) vary between $10 and $25 billion per day in normal times; wider variation since August

Daylight Credit Reduces Demand for Balances

-  Fedwire processes &amp;gt; 0 5 million interbank payments . (with a value of ≈ $2.5 trillion) per day
-  Rather than holding large non-interest-bearing balances at the Fed, DIs make heavy use of daylight credit to clear interbank payments.
-  sum of end-of-minute overdrafts averages ≈ $60 billion per day
-  Proposed revision to PSR Policy may further reduce demand for balances
-  Fed now charges 36 basis points/yr for daylight credit
-  proposal would make collateralized daylight credit free

Supply of Balances

-  Desk's tries to keep S = D to keep ffr = target
-  Desk seeks to offset changes in autonomous factors and discount window credit that affect supply of balances
-  also seeks to accommodate changes in demand
-  Outright purchases/sales, plus 14- &amp;amp; 28-day repo, supply a base of balances &amp;lt; projected demand
-  Temporary open market operations add (or drain) balances almost every day
-  Desk trades with 20 primary dealers
-  interbank markets distribute balances

Supply: Autonomous Factors and D.W. Credit

-  Unanticipated changes in autonomous factors can make supply of balances differ from projected level
-  currency in circulation
-  float
-  Treasury balance (Treasury deposits at FRBs)
-  foreign repo pool
-  Unexpected changes in PDCF credit also can make supply of balances differ from projection
-  Changes in TAF credit are known in advance, and offset

Supply: Temporary Open Market Operations

-  Desk executes repo almost every day
-  Size typically from $2 billion to $20 billion
-  Maturities from 1 to 7 days, depending on persistence of projected need
-  Daily o.m.o. are in addition to 14-day &amp;amp; 28-day repo
-  Replacing maturing repo with larger repo adds to supply of balances
-  Replacing maturing repo with smaller repo (or none) reduces supply of balances
-  Reverse repo to drain balances are rare

How well does our current approach work?

-  In normal times, current approach usually keeps effective funds rate close to target
-  But current approach allows larger deviations during periods of stress in interbank markets

Effective FFR minus Target: Normal Times vs. Market Turmoil

<!-- missing-text -->

April 30, 2008

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Equilibrium in the Federal Funds Market (1)

-  DIs' demand for balances varies from day to day, reflecting reserve requirements, clearing balance commitments, and volume of payments
-  In morning, fed funds usually trade at or near target rate because DIs expect Desk to supply enough b lances  o make ffr t target a ≈
-  a firm or soft rate signals excess demand or supply
-  Desk conducts open market operation to make day's projected supply = forecast of quantity demanded

Equilibrium in the Federal Funds Market (2)

-  As day progresses, autonomous factors and demand are realized; banks make and settle payments and trade fed funds; and actual ffr is determined
-  Desk cannot adjust S of balances late in day, so if realized S ≠ actual D, ffr will deviate from target
-  because balances are not remunerated, an excess supply can push ffr down to zero in the afternoon
-  reluctance to borrow means an excess demand can cause ffr to rise above primary credit rate in the afternoon
-  a small volume of trades at very low or very high rates can make effective (daily average) ffr deviate from target

Burdens Imposed by Current Approach

-  Reserve requirements, deposit reports, zero interest on balances impose unnecessary burdens on society
-  Reserves tax from zero interest on required reserve balances ≈ $380 million in 2006, $340 million in 2007
-  Sweep programs and other methods DIs use to minimize reserves tax waste real resources
-  High costs to collect/process deposit data and to monitor/ensure compliance with complex rules for required reserves and contractual clearing balances

Strengths &amp; Shortcomings of U.S. Approach

-  Usually keeps funds rate close to target in normal times  but allows occasional large deviations
-  Allows larger and more frequent deviations from target during periods of market stress
-  Large deviations reflect: projection errors; reluctance to borrow; no remuneration o f ba ances;  nability  o adjus l i t t supply of balances late in day
-  Even sophisticated market participants find current approach hard to understand, somewhat opaque
-  Reserve requirements &amp;amp; zero interest on balances impose burdens, but are not needed to hit ffr target

Core Structural Elements

- 
- Balance Targets: Mandatory, Voluntary, or None
-  Bands Around Target Balances
-  Maintenance Period: Single or Multiple Day
-  Funds Rate Corridor
-  Upper Bound: Standing Lending Facility
-  Lower Bound: Interest on Excess Reserves (or Redeposit Facility)

Possible Limitations: Stigma and the Standing Lending Facility

-  Standing lending facility should, in theory, place a cap on the federal funds rate.
-  But stigma may impair the effectiveness of the cap.
- P ten a y underm nes effectiveness o  sys ems tha  re y heav y ti ll i f t t l il  o on standing lending facility.
-  Disadvantages institutions that are the least inclined to borrow.

<!-- missing-text -->

Multiple- and Single-Day Systems

 Multiple Day Systems

-  Options 1 and 2
-  Intraperiod arbitrage to stabilize the funds rate

 Single-Day Systems

-  Options 3-5
-  Standing facilities and rates of remuneration to stabilize the funds rate.

Option 1: Remunerate Required and Excess Reserve Balances

Key Structural Features

-  Standing lending facility sets upper bound on funds rate
-  Interest on excess reserves sets lower bound on funds rate
-  Mandatory requirements and two-week maintenance period

How it Should Work

-  Downward sloping demand curve on last day of maintenance period
-  Demand curve on earlier days in the period relatively flat at the target rate over a wide range.
-  Banks can substitute balances across days of the maintenance period
-  Desk adjusts supply of balances each day to address daily demands and maintenance-period average needs.

Opt on 2: V luntary B lance Targets i o a

Key Structural Features

-  Voluntary Balance Target
-  Multiple-day Period (between FOMC meetings)
-  Relatively narrow target band
-  Funds Rate Corridor

How it Should Work

- Bas c mechan cs s m ar  o option 1 i i i il t 
-  Longer maintenance period should allow more scope for substitution of balances across days of the period
-  Might require less fine-tuning of daily balances but…
-  Key question is the magnitude of voluntary requirements
-  Low level could limit scope for substitution and arbitrage

<!-- missing-text -->

Page 29 of 52

Option 3: Simple Corridor

Key Structural Features

-  No target balance
-  Narrow symmetric funds rate corridor

How It Should Work

-  Downward sloping demand for reserves within the corridor
-  Demand for reserves stems from precautionary motive to avoid overnight overdrafts
-  Staff would estimate daily demand at the target rate
-  Desk would supply daily balances to meet estimated demand at target rate
-  Demand curve could be rather steep
-  Funds rate could be volatile within the corridor

<!-- missing-text -->

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Opt on 4: Floor w th High B lances i i a

Key Structural Features

-  No target balance
-  Asymmetric funds rate corridor
-  Remuneration rate set just below target funds rate
-  High balances to keep funds rate near the floor of the corridor

How it Should Work

-  Desk provides an ample supply of balances each day ($50 billion)
-  Funds rate should trade near the lower bound of the corridor
-  Fluctuations in reserve factors should have little impact on funds rate
-  Could reduce daylight overdrafts
-  Potential for strategic behavior?
-  Minimal costs in holding large reserve position

<!-- missing-text -->

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

Option 5: Voluntary Daily Target with Target Band

Key Structural Elements

-  Voluntary Daily Balance Target
-  Relatively wide target band
-  Upper bound on full remuneration of balances
-  Penalty for shortfalls
-  Wide funds rate corridor

How it  Should Work

-  Demand curve relatively flat within the target band
-  But downward sloping near the boundaries of the target band.
- Des  supp es ba ances each day c ose k li l l  to the midpoint of the target band.
-  Key Questions:
-  How large would aggregate level of targets be?
- ?  How wide to set target band

<!-- missing-text -->

Class I FOMC - Restricted Controlled (FR)

General Issues

-  Competitive issues
-  Restrictions on payment of interest on demand deposits
-  Appropriate setting of remuneration rate
-  Somewhat below target rate to reflect risk premium
- 
- Governance: FOMC and Board Roles
-  FOMC target rate and Board-determined remuneration rate
-  Transition
-  Moving from current system to new system could be complicated

Assessment of Different Options: Objectives

-  Reduce burdens and deadweight losses
-  Enhance monetary policy implementation
-  Promote efficient and resilient money markets and government securities markets
- Promo e an effic en  and resilien  paymen s sys em t i t t t t 

Option 1: Remunerate Required and Excess Reserve Balances

 Advantages:

-  Easy to implement given where we are now
-  Tested basic framework that would represent an improvement over the status quo

 Disadvantages:

- R ta ns curren  admns ra ve burdens i t i i t ti  e
-  Limited flexibility in reserve averaging parameters
-  Open Issues
-  Uncertain by how much required reserve balances would rise

Option 2: Voluntary Balance Targets

-  Advantages:
-  Significant reduction in administrative burdens
-  Also a tested basic framework
-  Offers more flexibility in reserve targets
-  Disadvantages:
-  Retains some administrative burden, for both DIs and FRS
-  Open issues:
- Identify ng a sys em o  vo un ary  arge s tha  y elds suffic en i t f l t t t t i i t  balances and is administratively workable

Option 3: Simple Corridor

 Advantages:

-  Eliminates administrative burdens of reserve requirements/targets and reserve maintenance periods
-  Should keep funds rate within a narrow corridor

 Disadvantages:

-  Funds rate would be more volatile within the corridor
-  Heavy use of standing facilities under a narrow corridor increases role of Fed as market intermediary

 Open issues:

-  Would our lending facility be sufficiently effective in limiting rates on the upside?
-  May need a better ability to make late-day reserve adjustments

Option 4: Floor with High Balances

 Advantages:

- Elim nates admnstrat ve burdens o  reserve i i i i f  requirements/targets and maintenance periods
-  Sharply reduces account management burden on DIs
- S bstantial balance sheet/reserve mo ements may ha e little  u v v impact on rates (although a possible double-edged sword)

 Disadvantages:

-  A radical change from the current framework, with limited experience of other central banks upon which to base informed judgments

 Open issues:

-  Implications for reserve demand and the functioning of the interbank market, under both normal circumstances and periods of stress

Option 5: Voluntary Daily Target with Clearing Band

 Advantages:

-  Significant reduction in administrative burdens
-  Reserve smoothing parameters (voluntary target levels and bands) may be very flexible
-  Disadvantages:
- R ta ns some admns ra ve burden,  or b th DIs and FRS i i i t ti f  e o
-  Limited experience with some features of this framework
-  Open issues:
-  Identifying a system of voluntary targets that yields sufficient balances and is administratively workable

Overall Assessment Against Objectives

1. Reduce burdens and deadweight losses

-  All options eliminate the reserve tax, either by remunerating required reserves or eliminating requirements
-  But some options have fewer administrative burdens than others
- 2. Enhance monetary policy implementation
-  All options set a floor for the fed funds rate, and most introduce additional features to help control rate volatility
- B t some op ons may have more flexible parame ers tha ti t t  u could be adjusted during periods of stress

Overall Assessment Against Objectives

- 3. Promote efficient and resilient money markets and government securities markets
-  Most options would still rely on active short-term markets for the distribution of liquidity
-  But there are possible differences in the Fed's role as market intermediary, and in the impact on the interbank market
- 4. Promote an efficient and resilient payments system
-  All options are consistent with proposed PSR policy changes
-  But some could yield a higher level of reserves than others as an alternative to daylight credit

Interest on Reserves in a Broader Context

-  Consider as part of process of improving  overall monetary policy framework
-  Current system works well during normal times
-  Less robust during times of stress

Weaknesses of Current Monetary Policy Framework

-  Volatility of the federal funds rate
-  PCF rate not a binding ceiling
-  Potential loss of control of federal funds rate after large reserve adds
- Lim ed ability  o cons ra n upward pressure  n  erm it t t i i t  funding rates

Implications for Interest on Reserves

-  Consider in tandem with changes to overall framework
-  Be willing to make significant adjustments to facilitate monetary policy implementation and market robustness
-  Options 1 and 2 eliminate reserve tax distortions and Option 2 eliminates most of regulatory burden
-  Option 2 has several advantages:
-  Less regulatory burden, voluntary
-  Averaging dampens shocks
-  Considerable experience with this type of frameworksimilarities with the contractual clearing program
-  Bank of England has been using it successfully

Implications for Interest on Reserves

-  But other proposals go further in altering fundamental framework
-  Option 5 is potentially more robust than Option 3 or Option 4:
-  Flexible in that number of parameters that can be djus ed-width o  corridor and s ze o  vo un ary reserve t f i f l t a band
-  As a result, it could be adjusted readily in response to ience and/or changes  n marke  conditions i t exper
-  But less empirical evidence available as no other central bank has adopted such a model

Recommendation - Interest on Reserves

-  Reserve maintenance periods have advantages and disadvantages
-  Smoothing reduces volatility, but shocks get dispersed through the reserve maintenance period
-  Single day systems, reserve shocks do not persist
-  Recommendation: Develop best proposal within each broad class
-  Focus on Options 2 and 5

<!-- missing-text -->

-  Identify workable systems of voluntary targets for reserves, needed for either option 2 or 5
-  Set clear objectives for aggregate size and distribution across DIs
-  Determine how such a system would be applied to a heterogeneous banking system
-  Critically assess relative merits of maintenance periods vs. daily clearing bands as a source of reserve management flexibility
-  and optimum sizes of maintenance period and clearing band width
-  Define the optimal width of a rate corridor under both options
-  understand implications for rate dynamics and the functioning of the interbank market under normal conditions and during times of stress
-  Assess compatibility of either option with possible changes in counterparties and collateral for central bank credit operations
