MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring   a  package  of ix b to s colored  harts  ith  a  peach  FOMC c w Class  II over. [Statement--see  pendix.] c Ap

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The dollar/yen cline  rom  May  5 through his de f t morning  is s  sharp s  I  recall  major xchange  rate  ver oving. Is y memory faulty  r  is a a a e e m m o this    quite  xtraordinary  ift? a e sh

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  it  s xtraordinary. m orry  hat    don't  now precisely w i e I' s t I k ho it ompares  with  large  ovements in he  past,  ut   think  he hift  ver his  eriod f everal c m t b I t s o t p o s days  now exceeds he  dollar/yen ve  during ebruary  1994  after  he linton/Hosokawa t mo F t C disagreement  n  trade.    can't call  ny  larger  ove over he ast   years. o I re a m t l 5

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do we have  any  evidence hat  he ank of apan t t B J was selling S.  Treasuries  n  this  eriod? U. i p

MR. FISHER.  No.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In  other  ords, ou  are ot icking  p  evidence f w y n p u o official  tervention    the ata r  other  ources f nformation, d  as  far s  you  can  see,  he in in d o s o i an a t currency  rice  hange  is trictly   result  rivate  arket  forces. p c s the ofp m

MR. FISHER.  That  goes  one  step urther an  ould  be  comfortable  ith. et f th Iw w L me try o  explain  hat  I  only inted  t n y statement, mely, he mpact n  the  dollar t w h a i m na t i o of

intervention    the ank of hailand  nd  other  sian  central  anks.-    will ry o e  pithy by B T a A b I t t b about  this.   hink  he implest  xample  is o  take he ong Kong dollar  ut  only  as  a It t s e t t H b hypothetical  se;  hat  urrency  id  not ome under uch pressure  n his  eriod.  s you ca t c d c m i t p A know, Hong Kong runs  a  peg  to  the .S.  dollar.  f  20  billion,  r xample, oves from U I $ fo e m Hong Kong to  Japan  and  the eg  is aintained,  he ne  thing hat  e know will appen  is p m t o t w h that he  dollar  ill  o  down  against  he en. Now, if  e extrapolate  at  o hailand  ust  or t w g t y w th t T j f purposes f  an  example, hat  ountry uns  a  peg  against    currency  ndex n hich  the ollar o t c r a i i w d has  a  roughly 0  percent  eight. hen  the hai  authorities  fend heir  urrency,  unds 8 w W T de t c f flow  out f hailand o  repay everaged  inancing  n  Tokyo.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Since  we know the articular  ys  when the  dollar p da was under  real ension, d  I resume  that  e at east d  the  benefit  f ome judgment rom t an p w l ha o s f market  sources,  f  ot  officially,  o  when a  lot  f he ntervention  d  related vements i n as  t o t i an mo of  funds as occurring, n  we trace  uch  intervention   he ctual  ays  in hich  the ollar w ca s tot a d w d was particularly k against  he  yen? wea t

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  the  dollar's  akness  occurred n  the ays  when the  Bank of we o d Thailand nitially ervened  n ize,  ay 6 and  7,  but ot  so  much in he  days  that  ollowed. i int i s M n t f May  6  and  7  were  days  when the ank of hailand's fense f ts  urrency  as building B T de o i c w up,  although  here  ere  indications  at  hey ad  been  defending  heir  urrency  or   while t w th t h t c f a

on  a  modest  scale. t  as at he tart  f hat  eek of ay  5 to   that ailand nnounced I w t s o t w M 9 Th a some disappointing  recasts r ts  udget  and  economic  growth  for he  coming  year. fo fo i b t Pressures  egan  to uild  n  their  urrency,  nd  the xchange  market  activities e  thought b b o c a e wer to  be  related  hat. tot

It oesn't  ecessarily  ve  to  happen  immediately.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. d n ha MR. FISHER.  No,  no.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. What happens  is hat  ortfolio  justments  tart t p ad s to cascade--

MR. FISHER.  Yes,  precisely.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. And it  akes   few  days  at east  or hat  o ork its t a l f t t w way through.  lot f t  s ssentially  tomatic  ecause ndividuals  ve  no  particular  sire A o i i e au b i ha de to  sell  ollar  oldings, t hey nd  up  with  a  maldistribution hich  they ave  to  adjust, d h bu t e to  w h and  that  s hat  has  been  happening. overnor  Rivlin. i w G

MR. FISHER.  That  we all  eed  to  go  back  to  the rawing oard  on  forecasting n d b taxes,  nd  I ill ot  pretend  o  be  the xpert  n  that  ubject.    think  ur rojection oblems a w n t e o s I o p pr were  universal--New  ork,  the oard, nd  the reasury. one of s  had  it ight.  ike Prell Y B a T N u r M may be  able o  offer  ore  insights to  his  han .

So,  that  s   major  area or tudy. f i a f s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do we have  sufficient  gional  ata o elp  us re d t h locate  s  we go  along here  an  excess reasury alance s oming  from? a w T b i c

MR. FISHER.  No,  we do not. here  is   rather  isappointing  ability   ake he T a d in tot t Treasury ax nformation  nd  quickly  erive tatistics  t  e would find seful. t i a d s tha w u

We  have  daily  nformation  some regional i on characteristics  he ax eceipts,  d  we know from  the tatistics ncome  where  there re of t t r an s of  i a big  capital-gains  xpayers  nd  what  may change.  Has anyone  been  able o  infer  nything ta a t a from  the egional  attern? r p

MR. PRELL.  I  am not  aware  that  nyone  has  tried at;  t  s n  interesting  ea. t a th i i a id I sounds  like    lot  f ork. a o w

MR. PRELL.  I  am not  sure hat  e have  that  uch free omputer  space ight t w m c r now! We  can  check  into t. i

MR. FISHER.  The other art f our  question,  overnor  Rivlin--or  e ther art p o y G th o p of  my answer--is  hat    was very leased  hat ur  announcing he uantity  f Ps helped he t I p t o t q o R t market  get   quicker  andle n  how far ff  e all ere  on  our orecasts,  d  that    think  as a h o o w w f an I w a  help. e  did  operate  wice n  one  day  on  two  occasions.  hat  was  not o ine-tune e W t i T t f th rates  ut ecause  of he aucity  f ropositions   had  from  the  dealers  nd  how far ff  e b b t p o p we a o w were  going  to e  unless  e tried   add  some  reserves  y  going ack  into he arket.  I  think b w to b b t m the  dealer  ommunity responded ather  ell  to hat  n  terms f ot  thinking  e were  flying c r w t i o n w off he  handle. he  added  flexibility he esk  was helpful.    think  he ools  orked  fairly t T to  t D I t t w well.  The first me  we had  a  big iss  in ropositions,    id  occur o e that  t  ight  be  nice ti m p it d t m i m to  be  able o o  foreign  xchange  swaps  to  inject serves  hen there  as a  paucity  f t d e re w w o collateral.  on't  hink  t  as really  ecessary, t hat  hought t east  rossed y mind. I  d t i w n bu t t a l c m CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR. PARRY. Throughout  this  eriod,  asn't  here vidence f   reduced  appetite p w t e o a for .S.  securities    Japanese nvestors d  some speculation at he inistry  f inance U by i an th t M o F actually d  played   role n his  educed  appetite? ha a i t r

MR. FISHER.  Anecdotally,  at  the esk have  heard  the  same stories. ave we D I  h not  been  able o  see hat  n ny  data nyone  has  shown me,  but here  re ome lags n  this t t i a a t a s i process.

MR. PARRY. There  will  e  data n  that? b o

MR. FISHER.  There  will e  some data n  that.    have  heard t aid y  a  number b o I i s b of eople hose views  on  the arkets   respect  hat  hey hink  he ery  sharp ovement in p w m I t t t t v m the  dollar/yen ans that  .S.  Treasuries  re ow at ttractive  vels  or apanese nvestors me U a n a le f J i to  purchase n  the rinciple  at  hey ave  taken osses  nd  it  s one. I  think  hat  he et o p th t h l a i d t t n impact  of hese  ovements has  been  to  produce  a  fairly od  two-way  market.  Clearly, t m go there as some aggressive  erbal ntervention, h  public nd  private,    the art  f he w v i bot a on p o t Ministry f inance.  I  think hat  s egrettable, en he  nature f he olatility  as o F t i r giv t o t v it h engendered.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Mr.  Hoenig.

MR. HOENIG. Peter,  n  your  statement, u  said hat  ou  thought  here  ere i yo t y t w more adjustments  o  come in  the ollar/yen. on't  now if  hat  ad  to  do  with ortfolio t d I  d k t h p adjustments.  an you  elaborate   that  ust    little? C on j a

MR. FISHER.  I ust  ean that  his  s nly n  initial  und  of arket  expectations j m t i o a ro m that he ank of apan  may start  ightening metime  later  his  ear. ifferentials ain t B J t so t y D rem rather  ide  against  en  fixed-income  ssets.   o  not ean to  draw  a  perfect  nalogy rom w y a Id m a f this,  ut n  1994  the ommittee  started ising  ates  n ebruary nd  we all  emember  the b i C ra r i F a r

Orange  County  bloodbath  n ecember. That  was a  full  hirteen nths  after  ong ond i D t mo l b yields  tarted  ack  up  in  October nd  November of  1993. There  are ifferent s tob a d mark-to-market  onventions  n  Japan.  Some institutions ot  have  to; hey an  just  old c i do  n t c h their  ixed-income  ssets  t istoric  st. thers ave  to  mark  to arket.  We  have  a  more f a a h co O h m mark-to-market  inancial stem  than he apanese. hat  does  not ean the  losses  n  Japan f sy t J T m i are  not uried here  omewhere. They are, ut hey o  not  come to  the ore s  quickly. b t s b t d f a Foreigners  ho borrow  at  low  interest  tes  n apan  are  subject   a  mark-to-market w ra i J to discipline.

MR. JORDAN. Mike,  the tory  ou  tell  bout he ast nd  your  concerns bout s y a t p a a the  future  re onsistent  th   supply ide urprise--a  oductivity  ock.  In  a  passive  ense, a c wi a s s pr sh s what  happens  is hat  e accommodate the xisting mand because e peg  a  nominal t w e de w interest  te  hile he  natural  ate--the  al  ate--is  ifting   during he eriod. e  see  not ra w t r re r sh up t p W only  an acceleration   ominal  spending rowth  but n oney and  credit  rowth  to  go  along inn g i m g

MR. PRELL.  You are  talking  bout  the atural  ate f nterest,  resume. a n r o i I  p

MR. JORDAN. Right.

MR. PRELL.  I  guess  one  could nterpret  at  I  have  said bout he tocks f i wh a t s o capital  oods  and  so  on  as  implying   lower atural  ate  oing orward. ne could  look t g a n r g f O a this  rom  various  antage oints.  hether, ndeed, ne  should iew  the evelopment  of f v p W i o v d surprisingly  rong rowth  over  the ast ear s  a  favorable  upply hock,    am not ure. st g p y a s s I s There  certainly  e  some elements n  the icture  hat upport  hat  iew.

MR.  KOHN. President  ordan,  n  thinking  bout he eal  ate  elative    its J i a t r r r to equilibrium   natural  evel,  don't  elieve  hat    real  ate    bit  elow  its  quilibrium vel, or l I b t a r a b e le as  apparently  t  as een, ould be  inconsistent  th he taff recast.   fact,  t s erfectly i h b w wi t s fo In i i p

So,  I  do  not hink he taff recast quires  he p wo t t s o re t equilibrium  ate  o rop  back  down again.  In  fact,  he taff recast  onsistent  th he r t d t s o isc wi t equilibrium te eing  a  bit  bove  where real  ates  re ight  ow. ra b a r a r n

MR. JORDAN. I  am not lear  n  that.    understand  hat  our ramework  is c o I t y f different,  t  if  rowth  in ominal  demand accelerates    a  rate f  percent,   it  id n he bu g n to o 8 as d i t first arter, at  are  the ynamics  that  ill ut uch  growth  in  half  nless  ou  say  the urge qu wh d w c s u y s is ll  tatistical  or  nd  it  ill nwind  itself? t  if  he ynamics  of our  adjustment a s err a w u Bu t d y process nclude  n  accommodation  in ehavior o  the ncrease  n ominal  demand,  what i a b t i i n causes he  second  difference  urn egative? t tot n

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Can I  answer  that?  I  think  here  re wo  factors t a t that, ken  together, e onsistent  th  your  framework.  One involves  nventories.    e ta ar c wi i Ifw have  a  buildup n nventories at  s ncapable  f eing ustained  t he ame rate,  do  not i i th i i o b s a t s we have  to ave  a  change  in  the ctual  nterest  te  ersus  he atural  ate  or he rowth  process h a i ra v t n r f t g to  turn own. What we have  here s n  adjustment  rocess  hat  s ot  affected   the d i a p t i n by differential  ween  the  actual  nd  the atural  ate. econdly,  here  s   serious  uestion  ere bet a n r S t i a q h about  seasonal  djustments.  f rowth  in ominal  demand was significantly  her, a I g n hig seasonally justed,   the irst arter  ecause he eather as warmer  than  usual,  nd  such ad in f qu b t w w a growth  was unusually  ow  in  the econd uarter, u  would not e  looking or n  explanation l s q yo b f a in  the eal  orld.  I uspect  hat  he ombination f oth f hose actors  s nough  to xplain r w s t t c o b o t f i e e

the  full  hift  he ominal  GDP.  I  do  not  know that  or   fact, t t  s ertainly  ing n  the s int n f a bu i i c go i right  irection. d

MR. JORDAN. For  confirming  vidence f hat,  would  expect o  see  slower e o t we t money and  bank  credit  rowth  emerge  in  this  eriod.  t  least  he taff ojection,  ake t, g p A t s pr I  t i is that  e are  going o  get hat.  ome  of he urge ever as  real  ecause t eflected d w t t S t s n w b i r ba seasonals  nd  an  inventory  uildup hat  ill  o  away.  To  be  sure hat  nterpretation  ight, a b t w g t i is r we would  need  in  a  sense o  accommodate a  much slower rowth  of oney and  credit; t g m otherwise  e missed  it. w

MR.  PRELL.  Barring ome shift  n  the emand for oney--this  s lmost s i d m i a tautological--we  uld  expect o  see  slower oney growth  with he oderation n  nominal o t m t m i GDP  expansion hat  e are nticipating.  t  our  forecast   a  sense ays  that,   an t w a Bu in s on intermediate-term  sis  ather  han  looking  uarter-to-quarter  defining  ovements in ba r t q and m natural  ates  f nterest   hat  ense,  e have  the ctual  ate  oo ow  relative  he atural r o i int s w a r t l tot n rate  o ring s  back  to quilibrium tween  actual  nd  potential tput.  n  other erms,  e t b u e be a ou I t w have  an  ongoing  gap  between  the atural  nemployment rate  nd  the ctual  nemployment n u a a u rate nd some tendency or nflation    pick p. a f i to u

MR. KOHN. In  our udgment,  resident  ordan,  e are  seeing  ome slowing n j P J w s i money growth  in  recent  onths  when we abstract om  the ccumulation  f alances  or he m fr a o b f t payment  of axes. n  looking  hrough hat ind f hing nd  taking  ccount f he act  hat t I t t k o t a a o t f t we have  essentially  o-growth  forecast r 2  in ay, we think hat  he  rate f rowth  in a  n fo M M t t o g that  ggregate  as  in  fact  ecelerated ouple f ercentage  oints  rom  the irst   he a h d a  c o p p f f tot second  quarter.

MR. JORDAN. As you  know,  we use  MZM to  monitor ow these hings  appen h t h because  it oes  not ave  the weep  problem.  It rew  at   rate  f  percent  n  the irst arter, d h s g a o 8 i f qu right  n here ith ominal  GDP.

- Turning  to  the ational  conomy,  the isk  hat  nflationary ssures  re  building n e r t i pre a seems  to e to  have  increased  ince ur  March meeting.

With  these  ndicators esenting    fairly iform icture  f xcessive  ressure  n i pr a un p o e p o resources, elieve  here s ood  reason o  be  worried bout  the rend f nflation   he I  b t i g t a t o i int future.  iven  this  ituation,   key  question  s hether eal  DP  is ikely   slow  enough G s the i w r G l to and  for   long nough  period  f ime  to liminate flationary  essures.  ike  the a e o t e in pr L Greenbook,  our  forecast r he urrent  uarter  hows  a  rather  harp lowing f rowth; ur fo t c q s s s o g o estimate  s   percent  or he urrent  uarter.  t ertainly  uld  not e  surprising    see  such  a i 2 f t c q I c wo b to pause  in ctivity llowing  he  torrid ce  of he  first arter.  ooking  to he econd  half  f a fo t pa t qu L t s o the  year,  e expect rowth  to ome in  at round  the rend ate  f   percent.  his ould  still w g c a t r o 2 T w leave he nemployment rate t ust  nder  5 percent  t he nd  of  1997. t u a j u a t e

On the  national  conomy,  the  first me  we got   look t   Greenbook  forecast r e ti a a a fo 1997 was in  September  1995--that's  e ay the iming sually  uns. t  that  ime, e had  a th w t u r A t w 5-3/4 ercent  ederal  unds ate, d  the rojection owed nominal  spending rowth  of ess p f f r an p sh g l

That  conclusion  ay be de i at t d m right,  ut f  t  s,  he nteresting stion  s hy.

Another  considerable side isk  n  the reenbook  forecast  s hat  he  projected up r i G i t t increase  n  the abor  orce articipation e  ill ot appen.

ramifications  r he  national onomy or  even  for he  District  onomy as  a  whole. fo t ec t ec Of course,  art f ts  ffect  ill e  reversed  ecause,  hile  wealth as  been  destroyed, onomic p o i e w b b w h ec activity  nds o ick p as  replacement  ctivity  curs. here  also ere  significant  sses  n te t p u a oc T w lo i some of  the attle rds  around  the istrict  e  to  the evere inter  his  ear,  nd  that  s c he D du s w t y a i a double-edged  henomenon as  well ecause, or hose eople  who did ot  lose attle,  ices p b f t p n c pr have  improved  recently.

At  our  recent  irectors'  eting nd  also t  a  meeting f ur dvisory  ouncil, d me a a o o a c a couple  of hings  f nterest  me up.

That  is ot ew; it  s ust s a v v t l m n n i j a confirmation. ey also  indicated,  d  I  think  t s air  o  say, hat  here  ave  been  some Th an i i f t t t h signs hat  age and  now price  ressures e  becoming  a  bit  ore generalized an ormerly t w p ar m th f was the  case. usiness eople re  still  ry  wary and  talk    good  deal bout ow competitive B p a ve a a h the  business  nvironment  s,  ow difficult    s o  raise  rices, d  how cautious  hey  are e i h it i t p an t about  doing  that.  t  the ame time,   think  hey ill  dmit hat  rice  ncreases e  perhaps A s I t w a t p i ar becoming  more commonplace than  was  formerly he ase  in  the istrict. t c D

With  regard o he  national onomy,  I ill trike  couple  of amiliar emes.

This  growth  plays ut n i th a b a o i quite ow  office  acancy ates, rticularly  the oston  metropolitan ea;  he  low  vacancy l v r pa in B ar t rates  ave  spread rom  downtown Boston  all  he  way out o  Route  495.

Turning  to  the ational  cene,    am impressed   bit  y  the one f omewhat quiet n s I a b t o s desperation   the reenbook forecast.  hings  are eally  uite  ood,  but e seem to e in G T r q g w b frustrated    our  inability    gauge  either e trength  f he conomy,  even  into  he urrent by to th s o t e t c quarter,   the  quiescence  f nflation.  ere  are   lot  f uestions.  ne of hem  is hen the or o i Th a o q O t w current  ombination f ery  favorable  rends  ill  ome to  an  end.

Just  s  important  s  these wo  questions  s hich  of hese eversals    trend,  f  hey o a a t i w t r to i t occur,  ill appen  sooner. n  my view  anyway,  the ikelihood  hat  esource  tilization l w h I l ist r u wil begin  to ite  efore he  strength  f he conomy wanes. It s rue hat  he urrent  conomic b b t o t e i t t t c e

The same factors g c an ma persist at  ave  caused ur  projections  conomic  growth  to  be  off  he ark  fairly th h o ofe t m consistently  rough  1996  and  1997. I  must  say  that    remain  agnostic  bout hether rowth th I a w g will low  in  line  ith  the reenbook  forecast,   east  ithout ome shock o  the conomy s w G atl w s t e that  o  one  is orecasting   resent. n f atp

We, along  with  others, ve  been  wrong about nflation.    have  underestimated ha i We the otential  he  economy to  grow at  a  solid  ace  without he sual ottlenecks sociated p oft p t u b as with  tight  esources. t ould be  comforting  o  think  hat  his  an  continue, t ere   am r I w t t t c bu h I also gnostic.  f  we think  bout ur  estimates  f abor  arket  tightness t s  a  point  ut s  a a I a o o l m no a b a range  of ncertainty  at  s airly de  around  a  central  endency nd  we consider  oth he u th i f wi t a b t experience  f  the ate 980s  and  the urrent  ata,    am drawn at east  o he roposition at o l 1 c d I l t t p th we have  not ad  sufficient  nstraint    resources  ong  enough  to  produce he moking  gun h co on l t s of  a  real  nflationary rease.  ut  I o  not hink  e are  very ar way from  this, rticularly i inc B d t w f a pa given  the  continued  abor  arket ightness ojected  n he  Greenbook  and  elsewhere. l m t pr i t

So,  despite  he ecent  ndications    slowing xpansion,  think he isks  re  still t r i ofa e I t r a strongly  symmetric.  If  nything, e  Greenbook  likely  nderstates  th  growth  and a a th u bo inflation.

Over  the ast  ew  months, he conomy has  seemed to e  handling  he ightness l f t e b t t of labor  arkets  remarkably  ell.

In  the .S.  economy,  a  forecast  he acroeconomy cannot gnore onsumer U oft m i c spending,  ut  I'm ot  sure hat  he rospects  or uch  spending ave  changed  much.

It oes  seem  to  me that  ith his  airly rong  utlook, e  risk  oes  remain  on  the d w t f st o th d upside ith  respect  o  inflation.   s ard  to udge  how long  employers an  continue  o w t Iti h j c t

I  believe  hat  he undamentals  upporting  he xpansion emain  very ositive. t t f s t e r p I am going  to  focus n  two  examples  of he ositive derlying  undamentals:  inancial o t p un f f conditions oadly efined nd  consumer  confidence.  e  might  ask  what  factors  ave br d a W h contributed   the trong  bove-trend  rowth  over he ast  ear nd  a  half.   supportive t to s a g t l y a A se

of  financial nditions rtainly ems  to  have  been  a  factor. nancial  onditions ther co ce se Fi c ei have  been  sufficiently mulative   romote  this  trength  r ot  sufficiently trictive sti top s o n res to prevent he esurgence.  orrowing  terms enerally  re iewed  as  attractive  r ome buying, t r B g a v fo h for onsumer  durable urchases,  nd  for usiness  ixed nvestment.  f  here s   problem, t c p a b f i I t i a i is he  excessive  mount  of orrowing  that  ome households ould like  o ndertake  nder t a b s w t u u prevailing nancial nditions. fi co

How  have  financial nditions anged  since  he arch 25  policy  ction? hat co ch t M a T action  as widely  anticipated,  it  argely  as reflected  inancial  rket  conditions  he w so l w inf ma att time  of he ove.  Since  the arch move,  however,  long-term  nterest  tes  ave  edged t m M i ra h slightly  wer,  he tock arket  has  rallied,  e  dollar  irst  se nd  then eclined  o  below  its lo t s m th f ro a d t initial  vel.   monetary  conditions dex or he  United tates, ich  took  account f le A in f t S wh o short-term d  long-term  nterest  tes, e  stock arket,  nd  exchange  rates  ould, an i ra th m a w I believe,  how more  favorable  inancial rket  conditions day han  was the ase s f ma to t c immediately ollowing  he arch move. f t M

I  do  not rdinarily  ace reat  eight n  measures  of onsumer  confidence  n  my o pl g w o c i own forecast,    I  don't  ant  to  oversell e ignificance  he atest ading  hen it so w th s oft l re w supports  he ase  I ant  to  make. But  the reliminary port  f he ichigan  Consumer t c w p re o t M Sentiment ndex  for arly  ay  was extremely nteresting. hows a  decline  n  the ndex  as I e M i Its i i it  elates  urrent  conomic  conditions at  re  consistent th he rojected  ear-term r toc e th a wi t p n slowing.  But  it  lso ndicates  sharp mprovement  in  expectations out uture  onditions a i a i ab f c supportive  f he rospect  f   solid  econd-half bound.  Let  me read ou a  few sentences o t p o a s re y from  Richard urtin's terpretation he  early  ay  data n  consumer  sentiment: C in of  t M o "Extraordinary rength  as  recorded n  consumer  sentiment  uring he irst lf  f ay, st w i d t f ha o M

Moreover, n l G a st m i sharp  contrast th  the nitial  action  o he nterest  te  ike,  onsumers  have  now wi i re t t i ra h c concluded hat  he  recent  ncrease  ill ave  little,  ny, mpact n  future  conomic t t i w h if a i o e conditions.  o be  sure,  onsumers  have  not hanged  their  iews  that  urther terest  te T c c v f in ra hikes ould  be  forthcoming  n he  year head.

First,  have  some very  significant   unexpected vidence hat  rofit rgins we and e t p ma are  still  sing  t his  ate  tage f he usiness  ycle xpansion. he  preliminary  arnings ri a t l s o t b c e T e reports  uggest  hat  he omestic perating  rofits  onfinancial rporations owed a s t t d o p ofn co sh fairly  ignificant e  n  margins  for he irst arter.  hen we add  in  the ramatic ise  n s ris i t f qu W d r i foreign  ffiliate nings, ich  have  increased  espite  he ise  n he ollar,  find   quite a ear wh d t r i t d we a impressive  ncrease  n  total ofits. at  is, f  e start th he irms n  the &amp;P  500, hose i i pr Th i w wi t f i S w domestic arnings  re  rising ster  han hose f maller  irms,  dd  in he  smaller  ompanies, e a fa t t o s f a t c and  allow  for he onpublic orporations at  lso ppear n  the ational  ncome  accounts t n c th a a i n i data,  e see  that  otal mestic perating  argins  are  moving higher. w t do o m

This  has  a  very nteresting lication r hat  is oing n  because  if  e i imp fo w g o w disaggregate e  data or onfinancial rporations,   urns  ut  that  he stimated  ate  f th f n co itt o t e r o increase  n otal  nit osts  rom  the  first arter  f  1996  to  the irst  arter  f  1997 is lose  o i t u c f qu o f qu o c t zero.  This otal,  ich  combines  unit  abor  nd  unit onlabor  osts, s  been  moving lower t wh l a n c ha in  recent  ears;  hat  s,  he ate  f ncrease  n  underlying  otal  nit  osts  as  been  slowing. y t i t r o i i t u c h The number for he  first arter  f 997,  which  is   rough  estimate  t his  oint  ut ne  that t qu o 1 a a t p b o is ased  on  accounting  elationships,  he est hat  e have  seen  in  a  while. f  e believe b r is t b t w I w that he rice  ata re easonably  ccurate, aning  that  he ias s ot  changing ery  much, t p d a r a me t b i n v and  if  e believe  he rofits timates e  about ight--the  tter  e ased  on  independent w t p es ar r la ar b earnings  eports--then,  arithmetic,  tal it  osts  ould ot ave  changed  much. If  e r by to un c c n h w subtract nlabor nit  osts,  hich  are omprised ssentially    capital nsumption no u c w c e of co allowances  nd  net nterest  r nit nd  which  combined  have  been  falling r uite   while-a i pe u a fo q a

Any reasonable  et f umbers  for verage ourly ompensation,  hich  has  been s o n a h c w rising  n his  eriod,  ermits  s  to  derive  roductivity  mbers  that  re ccelerating i t p p u p nu a a significantly--up  ghly   percent  rom  the irst arter  f  1996  to he irst arter  f 997. rou 3 f f qu o t f qu o 1 Now, one  should emember that  his  roductivity  timate  oes  not over  the ull  conomy. r t p es d c f e When  we try o  reconcile  his  stimate  ith  the ublished  onfarm  business  ector t t e w p n s productivity  ta hat  e usually  eal ith n ur  models, e run  into hat  arge  nomaly  of da t w d w i o w t l a a long-term  ecline  n roductivity  r he oncorporate  usiness  ector.  his  decline  akes d i p fo t n b s T m no  sense. t eems  to e that  ll  he  anecdotal  vidence hat  omes to ur  attention I s m a t e t c o is consistent  th he  data e are  getting  n  the onfinancial  rporate  rea. hose  are  the ata wi t w i n co a T d that  veryone ees.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Let  me begin  with  some further oughts  n  the aylor ule th o T R perspective   monetary  policy  ptions  nd  the hanges  in nitial  nditions d  forecasts on o a c i co an

between  this  eeting  and  the arch meeting.  This  will ead e into  y own version f he m M l m m o t policy  ptions or oday's  ecision, th  special  ttention   he nterpretations  ached  o o f t d wi a tot i att t the  options.   ill onclude ith  some considerations  lating   initial  nditions d  to Iw c w re to co an other  olicy  riorities t  ight  justify illingness   assume  greater  nflation  sks. p p tha m a  w to i ri

The Taylor ule  perspective derlies  y strongly  eld iew  that  rudent R un m h v p monetary  policy  hould ean gainst  he yclical  inds  by  enforcing    procyclical  ttern  n s l a t c w a pa i real hort-term  nterest  tes. pecifically, lieve  hat  eal hort-term terest  tes  hould s i ra S I  be t r s in ra s rise  n roportion  o  increases   utilization es  ver he ourse f   cycle nd  that  uch  a i p t in rat o t c o a a s disciplined  sponse  s specially  itical    the conomy approaches apacity.    interpreted re i e cr as e c I our  action  t he ast  OMC a t l F meeting  as  being ustified  a  forward-looking rsion  f he j by ve o t Taylor ule;  hat  s,  y  a  forecast   the ast  eeting f ising ilization   inflation  tes  n r t i b at l m o r ut and ra i the  absence f olicy  ction.  he  wisdom of hat  ove was quickly  pparent,  o e at  least, o p a T t m a t m in  the uicker-than-expected lization   igher abor  tilization  es.  We  might  in q rea ofh l u rat retrospect ll  t    "just-in-time"  etary  policy  ction! ca i a mon a

In  my view, e tightened  n arch because e believed  hat  ontinued w i M w t c above-trend  rowth  would  lower he nemployment rate o  or  below  5 percent  y  midyear,  n g t u t b i line  ith  the taff recast. e  unemployment rate  s lready  here  we feared  t  ight  go. w s fo Th i a w i m Why  should   forecast  ore moderate rowth  ahead  make us  more relaxed? ll  the a ofm g A forecast   a  return-to-trend  wth  guarantees  s hat  he conomy will  inger  ndefinitely of gro i t t e l i in this  recarious  osition til  nflation  es  turn p. p p un i do u

In  short,  have  more reason n y view  to  be  concerned bout nflation    May we i m a i on 20th  than e did  on  March 25th,  ot ess. f  ne  accepts  he iew  that  here  s ndeed w n l I o t v t i i justification   ome tightening,  e ext  question  s ow much of   cumulative  ove is fors th n i h a m

justified  today's  nitial  nditions  nd  how gradually  hould uch  a  tightening by i co a s s be implemented  over  time.  We  can  get ome guidance n  this  ubject  rom  alternative s o s f specifications   he  Taylor ule  as  well s  from  model simulations  lternative  nds ate oft R a ofa fu r paths round  the  base  forecast.  conclude n  the asis f uidance rom  those ources  hat a I o b o g f s t the  real  ederal  unds ate hould ove at east rcentage  oint  or ercentage  oint ith he f f r s m l pe p f p p w t unemployment  rate,  ith  some of he  evidence uggesting  hat  he est tabilizing ults w t s t t b s res come from  a  gradual  olicy  esponse hat  umulates o wice his  agnitude. p r t c t t t m

The bottom  line  f he nalysis  s hat  ome further  ightening pears  ustified o t a i t s t ap j by current  nitial  nditions  nd  forecasts.  the ther  and, t  ould  be  hard  to rgue hat i co a On o h i w a t recent  ata n labor  osts nd  inflation  ggest    high  degree f rgency bout aking  he d o c a su a o u a t t next  step oday.  I  also an  accept  he isdom of   view  that  resent  ncertainties ht t c t w a p u mig suggest    more gradual mplementation  f ny  cumulative  ightening an therwise. a i o a t th o

In  my outlook tatement,  noted wo  uncertainties t  ould  influence r s I t tha c ou judgment  today,  articularly ut  the iming f ny  action.  he first  hat  he ata n  labor p abo t o a T ist t d o cost nflation    the eriod  etween  meetings aised  urther estions  bout he stimate  f i in p b r f qu a t e o NAIRU and  suggested hat  he taff recast  f ising flation    prevailing ilization es t t s o o r in at ut rat may be  too  pessimistic.  e second  is he harpness  f he rojected cline  n  secondTh t s o t p e i quarter  rowth,  hich  encourages  he  Committee  to ait ntil  e confirm he xpected g w t w u w t e rebound.  The Chairman has  focused n  a  third  ncertainty--heightened irst-quarter o u by  f profits ta--the end n  productivity  owth. da tr i gr

With  the  above  considerations    background,  et  e offer  y own version  f he as l m m o t Bluebook  policy  ptions  or our  consideration. rst,   have  alternative    no  change. o f y Fi we B, This  alternative  uld e  supported  n  the asis  f wo  quite  ifferent  guments.   want  to co b o b o t d ar I

Let  me turn ow to  two  quite  ifferent  ts f onsiderations  at  ould  be n d se o c th w consistent th  the hoice f   reactive rategy.  am not romoting ither  f  these wi c o a st I p e o justifications--I  already  ommitted  to  preemptive C"--but    believe  hey  deserve o e have c " I t t b put  on  the able.  he first   he conomic  and  political  fficulty,  t  I  will all    "reverse" t T ist e di wha c a soft  anding.    view  the onetary olicy  mplementation  hrough 996 as  an  attempt  o l I m p i t 1 t achieve   conventional  oft  anding. t  nvolved lowing he  expansion o  trend efore t a s l I i s t t b i overshot apacity, ereby tabilizing  flation  d  extending  he  expansion. e  already c th s in an t W have  seen  that  t  an  be  difficult  muster ublic  upport  ven  for uch  a  sensible licy i c to p s e s po effort.  iven  the ecent  ecline  n  the nemployment  rate,  e might  now need  a  monetary G r d i u w policy  hat  s ttempting    reverse  oft  anding  n hich  we approach apacity  rom  above t i a a s l i w c f and  thus equire    period f elow-trend  rowth  to llow  actual  utput o rift ck  down to r a o b g a o t d ba capacity.  erhaps ore to he  point,  t  ould  be  a  period f elow-trend  rowth  to  raise  he P m t i w o b g t unemployment rate  ack  to AIRU. b N Such  a  policy  s ery  difficult ell  nd  very  difficult i v to  s a to  achieve. t ight  be  argued n  this  ase hat  he est e can  do  is o ttempt  o  slow  the I m i c t t b w t a t economy to  trend,  ope  for he est,  nd  react  f  ecessary  o  clear  nd  persistent  gns f h t b a i n t a si o higher nflation. onder  if  his  s   factor  ncouraging  ome to  accept   reactive  osture. i I  w t i a e s a p

Achieving  maximum  sustainable  ployment  would  ensure n  environment hat  ould em a t w reduce  the ensions  nd  challenges  ssociated th  welfare  eform nd  the ssociated t a a wi r a a movement from  welfare o  work.

With respect  o  productivity,  m glad hat  ou  have  highlighted   oday,  r. t I  a t y it t M Chairman.

On the  basis f hese onsiderations,  ould  prefer  o  raise  he unds  rate  y  25 o t c I  w t t f b basis oints  t his  eeting. owever,  since   do  not ee  a  possible  ickup n  inflation p a t m H I s p i as imminent,   am willing, mewhat reluctantly, upport    policy f o  change  in he  funds I so to  s a o n t rate or he ime  being nd  asymmetric  language ven  though  I  believe  e are unning he f t t a e w r t risk  f   larger  ate  ncrease  ater. o a r i l

What if  e were  to  tighten  ow by  25  basis  oints  nd  we were  wrong  and w n p a everything  tarted   come in  at east  s ell  as  the reenbook  sees t, d  maybe even  a s to l a w G i an little  ower?  Are  the osts  f eing rong  in  that  ay unacceptably  igh?  I  do  not  think o, sl c o b w w h s and  one  of he easons as  to  do  with  the rgument  of he sychological pact  on  the t r h a t p im markets.  I  meet  with  a  group  of nvestment  anagers  on  a  fairly gular  asis.  heir i m re b T discussions   recent  eeks  have  continually cused n  the  availability redit,  e in w fo o of c th liquidity   he arkets,  nd  the xcesses  hat  hey ee  everywhere,  articularly n it oft m a e t t s p whe comes to  commercial  real  state  inancing.  ather han eeding    sense f aution  hrough e f R t f a o c t uncertainty out  our ctions,  think hat  ot oving at his  eeting  or ertainly  t  moving ab a I t n m t m c no soon  will ead o  a  greater vel  f ertainty  ong market articipants  at  hey  can  persist l t le o c am p th t in  their  xcessive  ctivities   that  ill  eed nto  ore speculation  he sset  arkets han e a and w f i m int a m t is ealthy. h

What if  e stand at nd  we are  wrong? Of  course,  iming s verything  nd w p a t i e a perhaps t  eally  oesn't  atter  hether e tighten w or  in uly r  August  or  whenever  we i r d m w w no J o meet  during he est  f he ear.   do  think hat  n  delaying  e stand o ose   bit  n  the t r o t y I t i w t l a i markets, s  I entioned, nd  we also tand  o  lose he igh  ground  of dvocating    proactive a m a s t t h a a monetary  policy.  e need  to  reduce  the isk  f vershooting,  d  if  e do  not o  it  t   time W r o o an w d a a of  fast  rowth  and  tight bor arkets,  hen will  e do  it? g la m w w

For  what  it's  rth, he ame group  of nvestment  anagers  spent   lot f heir wo t s i m a o t time  at ur eeting  discussing at  they  saw  as  the otential tside  ources  f esistance o m wh p ou s o r to Fed  moves,  along he  line  f hat  Tom  Hoenig  was  reflecting    in is omments earlier. t o w on h c Their dvice,  gain or hat  it's  rth, s o  do  the ight  hing. or  them, oing  the ight a a f w wo i t r t F d r thing s o ighten  p  a  bit  n  the arkets  and  rein n he otential  r nflation    get ut  of i t t u o m i t p fo i to o hand.

But  again,  iming s t r p n a 25 p m t i everything.    think  ur  current  olicy  tance s ot oo ar way from  where  it  hould e,  Mr. I o p s i n t f a s b Chairman,  and  I ould  support  our  recommendation. c y
