Congratulations and best wishes for the next phase.  Thank CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  I'd like to start by our colleague, Larry Slifman, who is at his last meeting before his planned retirement. still fairly junior, having 183 FOMC meetings over 30 years.  At one day per meeting, that's almost exactly six months of FOMC meetings.  [Laughter] mentoring others in the art of presenting complex material to the Board in the clearest and most logical manner. greatly from you very much.  [Applause]

I'd like to welcome, of course, President Lacker, President part of the meeting a little bit later this morning, but I thought it would be useful year about what you would like to talk particularly want to thank Glenn Rudebusch in San Francisco for organizing this session Dallas, Andrew Haughwout from New York, from Boston.  Let me call on John. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. Lockhart, President Pianalto, and President Williams to the FOMC.  We will have a formal organizational first to begin with our special topic, which we're looking forward to.  The topic is the role of financial conditions in economic recovery:  lending and leverage.  This was a highly favored pick of FOMC participants when we polled you last about.  I and acknowledge the presenters, John Duca from and Daniel Cooper

DUCA. 1   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I will be referring to the handout on and short-run shifts in MR. lending and leverage.  This presentation, coauthored with Anthony Murphy, links the sluggish recovery in personal consumption expenditures (PCE) to financial factors and then shows how movements in consumption reflect long-

By comparison, consumer spending has rebounded slowly so far in the current cycle-not To provide a benchmark, exhibit 1 plots real per capita consumption normalized around the prior during these recessions-whether in terms of the average of those cycles (the black line) or their range (the shaded consumer spending declined by nearly 5 percentage points before hitting bottom.

temporary rate trended down until 2008:Q1. Turning to exhibit 4, it is helpful to understand recent developments by reviewing longer-term movements in the personal saving rate.  The saving rate (the black line) fluctuated between 8 and 10 percent until the mid-1970s.  Apart from some upticks during recessions, the saving framework, consumption depends on and on wealth.  This implies that the saving rate (the black line) current saving rate is considerably lower if wealth is disaggregated into different components to rate. In the standard lifecycle/permanent income permanent income and the ratio of wealth-to-income (the blue line) should generally move in opposite directions, as they do.  Nevertheless, the than in the 1970s, despite similar wealth-to-income ratios in the two periods.  This anomaly does not go away reflect their different influences on consumption.  Some additional factor is affecting the saving

This affects the impact Most of the nonstock wealth-induced movements 1970s stem from shifts in the availability of changes in mortgage credit standards that affected house prices.  Our model of consumption, which disaggregates wealth and controls for standard factors-such as income, unemployment, and interest rates-incorporates two important, novel features.  First, we estimate shifts in the sensitivity stemming from regulatory

Exhibit 5 illustrates the division of household wealth in our model into net liquid assets, illiquid financial assets, and gross housing disposable income.  Net liquid assets (the red line) are the sum of deposits and cashlike instruments minus consumer and mortgage debt.  The downturn in this ratio since the early 1990s mainly reflects increased mortgage borrowing.  Illiquid financial assets (the assets, with a twin peak pattern reflecting large swings in stock prices. 2000s, the ratios of illiquid financial assets income (the blue line)

As reported in exhibit 6, the estimated effect of net liquid assets on consumption exceeds that of illiquid financial assets.  Our model estimates indicate that in net liquid assets raises annual consumption by over $13, compared with $2 impact from the same difference is that households have more time and discretion to adjust their spending in response to stock price movements, whereas they incur penalties for missing debt payments.  In addition, illiquid financial asset holdings are concentrated among wealthy households, whereas debt is some credit constrained and consumer credit is more expensive than ability to borrow against housing equity has changed over time-as a wealth is time-varying. There is less agreement in the economics profession about whether, and by how much, housing wealth influences consumption.  In a realistic setting, where households are mortgage debt, increased housing wealth can boost consumer spending.  Because homeowners' result of tax changes and financial innovations-the impact on consumption of swings in housing

fell sharply to about $2.25 cents by early 2011.  The affected homeowners' ability we also control for changes in two commonly omitted variables, consumer credit availability. Exhibit 7 illustrates how the estimated impact of housing wealth on consumption has evolved over time.  In response to a $100 increase in gross housing assets, annual consumption rose from as little as 50 cents in the 1970s and early 1980s, to a high of about $3.50 by 2005.  This effect timing of the movements in the estimated liquidity of housing wealth coincides with tax, regulatory, and financial innovations that plausibly to tap housing equity.  Our estimates of consumption's sensitivity (or marginal propensity to consume) to housing wealth are smaller than those from conventional models because permanent income and

The consumer innovations and regulatory credit crunches.  The innovations include the spread of installment credit and credit cards in the 1970s and the deregulation of bank deposits in the 1980s.

As shown in exhibit 9, our results imply that movements in consumption relative to income mainly reflect shifts in consumer credit availability, the composition of wealth, and the liquidity ratio of consumption to nonproperty income (that is, non-asset income, the black line) move synchronously, though in opposite directions.  The actual income ratio lines up well with the combined estimated equilibrium effects (the dashed blue line) of household balance sheet, and the evolving liquidity

Since the peak, housing-related debt has fallen by nearly $1 trillion.

liabilities dominate homeowner balance sheets, the large mortgage debt (the red line), and equity as a share of household real estate value (the blue line).  The stability equity share during the housing boom of the 2000s indicates that, as a rate that reflected peaked (in 2006, around the time of green line), households subsequently responded by shedding mortgage fast to keep up with declining house prices, so remains well below previous levels. mortgage Since housing assets and decline in house prices since 2006 has taken a substantial toll on the wealth of most U.S. homeowners.  Exhibit 2 shows the flow of funds data on the market value of household real estate (the green line), outstanding owner's of the aggregate home prices rose, households took on additional mortgage debt at the increase in house values.  After house values the peak in the debt.  However, in contrast to developments during the run-up in home prices, reductions in debt were insufficiently the equity share fell sharply and now Consequently, while households have been reducing their debts, aggregate debt as a share of the value of the relevant asset-in this case, their homes-has increased substantially since 2006.

The top panel of exhibit 3 presents, as of outstanding mortgage balances exceed the estimated value of the property, exceed it-that is, the equity position is less than 5 percent.  Given the transactions costs involved in selling a house, these have difficulty satisfying their mortgage contract solely from the funds they could raise by selling their homes.

These analyses, are based on aggregate data in the flow of funds accounts and other publicly To be credit report a charge-off. Some recent analyses of reductions we have observed are however, available data sets that do not allow us to identify the source of the debt reductions. By contrast, the CCP allows us to look carefully at how both paydowns and credit report charge-offs have contributed to reductions in outstanding balances. clear, I will refer to the extinguishment of debt from a consumer's following a default as foreclosure process, debt is charged off, but an assetcomparisons between foreclosures and aggregate balance can use the unique information available in the CCP data to break categories, each of which is tracked exhibit 4.  The first two categories reflect the buying and selling of gross value of mortgage debt charge-offs, which ballooned gross reductions in household debt that result At the completion of the the house-is repossessed and can be resold and remortgaged.  This fact complicates the interpretation of reductions.  In order to focus on the active borrowing and repayment behavior of mortgagors, we down the change in mortgage balances into three in the top panel of houses and foreclosures, while the last measures the behavior of consumers outside of these transactions.  The blue line tracks changes in mortgage debt related to housing transactions other than the reduction in debt attributable to charge-offs.  As expected, this series fell sharply between 2007 and 2009 as the value of home sales plummeted. The red line shows the with the rise in foreclosures and totaled approximately $1.3 trillion between 2007 and 2011.  Again, charge-offs here are the from borrower default.

Excluding the paid down $135 billion in mortgage debt in 2009 and quarter of 2011, year. Finally, the amortization of first-lien balances, junior-lien balances, including HELOCs.  We interpret this series as indicative of household attempts at managing their leverage through means other than default. Between 2000 and 2007, consumers extracted equity from their homes at an average rate of $135 billion per effects of default, consumers $214 billion in 2010.  The chart displays the data through the second annualized, and indicates that paydowns continued apace in the first half of last nonmortgage debt, we can simply look at how aggregate balances have We combine this calculation with the green series shown in the net cash flow effects of in all forms of household debt.

There a reaction In the current context, households before 2007 may have based on optimistic expectations about future house price would be defined as consumption growth expectations and acted to adjust their leverage If true, the borrowing-fueled consumption not explained by the normal in consumption relative to the levels predicted by income recession. Household deleveraging decline in household debt holdings since the beginning of the are several possible definitions of deleveraging.  The top panel of exhibit 1 outlines the definition of household deleveraging used in this memo.  Household deleveraging is a household balance sheet debt adjustment that lowers consumption beyond what would be predicted on the basis of information embedded in current and past changes in income and asset valuations.  This phenomenon could, for example, be to a previous phase of leveraging where households increased consumption by accumulating debt. increased their leverage appreciation.  Here too, 'leveraging' beyond what would have been otherwise predicted by ongoing developments in income and net worth.  Then, as house prices started to drop in mid-to-late 2006, highly levered households decided that their debt burdens were inconsistent with their downwardly revised house price accordingly. link between consumption, income, and household net worth before the recession would result in a decline and net worth during and after the advantage of lower interest rates, principal young households. Consistent with the definition of deleveraging used in this memo, deleveraging does not include debt charge-offs due to foreclosure, which have accounted for at least 60 to 70 percent of the recent decline in mortgage debt.  Deleveraging also does not include debt restructuring to take repayment, or both as part of the mortgage amortization process.  These debt paydowns are the result of normal household balance sheet transactions.  In addition, deleveraging does not include the decline in debt that has occurred due to mortgages being paid off by older households at the same time as household formation and home purchases have been limited among

quantifies the extent to which a factor beyond observable and net worth impacted consumption and hence economic on Analyzing this memo's measure of household deleveraging is relevant for policymaking because it developments in income growth since the onset of the Great Recession.  Indeed, many economists and policymakers have attributed weak consumption growth during the current recovery to deleveraging.  My results, however, show little evidence that household deleveraging or any other non-fundamental factor has had a sizable impact consumption so far.  Consumption dynamics during and after the Great Recession, at least on a first-order basis, are primarily dependent on changes in employment, income, and net worth.

This decrease in household liabilities, however, does not appear to have major drag on consumption.

While the recovery in consumption has been sluggish compared with previous economic downturns, income growth has also been very slow to rebound.

Based on this fact, one could perhaps restraining consumption growth relative to income growth.

In all groups, such as those with high versus low debt, could mitigate the simultaneity issue between consumption and income that plagues particular, a finding that spending behavior differs across household groups sidesteps the simultaneity issue, since simultaneity should apply fairly uniformly to households.  Third, the microdata provide additional identification power by exploiting idiosyncratic income and net worth shocks, both of which are arguably exogenous.

The table shows 15 percent, on average, during the 2007 to 2009 period for households who reported a net worth decline.  This drop in net worth was 4 to 5 percentage points prior repayment.  In particular, the fraction of households reporting that they reduced debt during the decline in debt of these households was only slightly elevated relative to the 2001 to 2007 period.

Households are divided into groups based on whether their percentage run-up in total debt between 2001 and 2005 was in the top half of the debt increase distribution, and whether from his or her job between 2007 and 2009.  Displaced workers the largest decline in spending between 2007 and 2009; however, displaced workers with low debt also exhibited a sizable consumption decrease.  In addition, the consumption of nondisplaced households rose.  Overall, changes in households' consumption between 2007 and 2009 appear more related to income dynamics than to debt repayment.

consumption growth for highconsumption worth increased a bit.  In across time, however, are small and statistically insignificant. The bottom panel of exhibit 6 reports estimates of debt households (those with above-median debt) versus low-debt households (those with median debt or below).  The results show that the sensitivity of growth to income growth declined a touch for high-debt households during the Great Recession, while the sensitivity to changes in net comparison, the sensitivity of consumption growth to income growth and net worth growth rose somewhat over time for low-debt households.  These differences within groups consumption.  In addition, the observed consumption-less than (not shown)-according to the data.  This finding does not rule out highly levered households, in prices, did not have a first-order effect on consumption. The absence of major differences in behavior between high-debt and low-debt households argues against the possibility that a factor beyond developments in income and net worth impacted households' shifts in the sensitivity of consumption of high-debt households to income and net worth that did occur had a very small effect on overall PSID 0.1 percent deleveraging, but suggests that any deleveraging by response to falling house

Indeed, as shown in the top panel of exhibit 7, household liabilities have been very elevated relative to net Great Recession, especially compared with historical patterns. equation (1) in the bottom panel of exhibit 7 control for households who reported a debt decline and test whether such households exhibited consumption growth that was particularly sensitive to changes in income and net worth.

The sensitivity changes in the sensitivity of other households.  It does not appear, therefore, that a substantial shift occurred recently-at least through 2009-in determining household consumption behavior.

I find little empirical evidence during or following the Great worth had go only through 2009, so it is possible that estimates and exists, the remarks. In summary, Recession that factors other than ongoing developments in income and net an impact on consumption.  The PSID data a more recent shift in households' spending behavior has occurred.  My the aggregate data suggest, though, that deleveraging does not have a first-order effect on consumption.  As a result, even if pent-up demand for deleveraging risks to consumption growth would be limited.  The standard relationship linking consumption to income and net worth should continue to be a reasonable predictor of household spending.  This concludes my prepared you all very much for a very interesting presentation. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank The floor is open for questions, comments, or reactions.  Would anyone like to begin?  Governor Raskin.

a lot to think about here, particularly in the fact that with each other.  Interestingly enough, in John's presentation, he points changes would be affecting the sensitivity as I looked at this, it sounded rather plausible, in we are having some difficulties explaining consumption growth recently when these underlying regulatory issues going on going on having to do with the general convenience factor in terms of MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think each of these presentations was really very interesting and timely, and there's they're not all consistent us to the possibility that tax, financial, and regulatory of consumption to household wealth, and we see something that looks significant in that story in exhibit 7 of his presentation.  I have to say that fact, because some of the underlying fundamentals like household wealth and real disposable income aren't supporting what we see.  The notion that there are sounded as if it was on the right path, and I was even tempted to add that there could be something else

January 24-25, 2012

It was the case that in the upturn, it was very easy to do a refi.  You could meet While John's story sounded quite plausible, we then get to we're told that the data showed that the standard relationship real statistically significant differences between owners and renters or between to reconcile these stories? refinancing. your mortgage broker on a Saturday in a parking lot and get it done within hours, and now there seem to be these inordinate obstacles. the Boston presentation where linking consumption to income and net worth stays as it has stayed historically, and that we're not seeing levered and nonlevered households.  Is there a way ratios of consumption to income and could estimate an equation like Daniel's over a period relationship held in first differences.  The problem is that that relationship is not stable gains on stocks and housing, as well as income from dividends and result, in consumption equations and consumption functions, if one includes a income with property income and puts in wealth, one in a sense is double-counting property income, you see a big change, bigger swings in consumption to example, the blue line shows what happens if you include property income-not income, in our opinion, then one needs a more detailed approach. income into the different components, and that's why we test for these I would like to add that a lot of people have found that it is important to Rick Mishkin's paper with J. R. Kearl demonstrated a long that debt has a bigger effect on consumption per dollar than does, let's say, a rise in MR. DUCA.  That's an excellent question.  If the wealth to income were stable, then one where the if one uses a definition of income that excludes the income from assets.  Personal disposable income includes capital interest, and as a measure of wealth.  If one takes out income.  For much movement.  The red line shows bigger swings, and because the relationships are not stable, if one properly measures That's why we break out other factors. disaggregate wealth.  For example, time ago stock wealth, and there are a lot of other models out there that do that.  We look at things a little

We estimate over want to sort out what's the effect of swings in credit availability, stock wealth, wealth.  If hard to disentangle that.  I'm sorry for the long answer.

Basically, the point of what we're doing is, we're trying to address consumption forecast has been and is too optimistic based on some unknown factor, at the microdata is that, to the extent something is going on and you should see it when you're breaking out the or homeowners versus renters; we just don't The other thing I'd add-and I don't really want to get into a debate about the aggregate analysis I present holds up with alternative definitions of you use labor income in the regressions that I have with the microdata, the results are MR. COOPER. whether the and the conclusion is that unknown factor doesn't really seem to be there.  We're not really trying to get into a debate about whether there's a credit crunch or not, although one of the advantages of looking believe that there is some credit channel, you really households into high-debt or low-debt households see that there. data-is that a lot of the income.

you would use, because the term is used differently in the literature.  I think, actually, in down the implication that it's not just a case of waiting MR. ROSENGREN.  I want to follow up on Governor Raskin's question.  First, Dan used a definition of deleveraging.  I'm just curious whether the definition that he used would be one that this case it does matter because some people use deleveraging to mean that it is policyinvariant-that is, that we just have to wait for the passage of time for people to pay debt.  Using that definition, Dan draws the policy for time to go on, but actually there may be things that policy could do to affect some of the

January 24-25, 2012

a little bit more of a policy context than the other presentations. would as policy-invariant? fundamentals.  Second, he drew Would you agree that if a lot of it is explained by some of the fundamentals-either disaggregated or not disaggregated-that is something policy can do something about, or you be more comfortable thinking of it things that we have found is that debt has a large effect on you estimate through, let's effect on consumption that lasts for a long time.  That's With respect to write-offs and looking into this whole issue of write-downs guess. MR. DUCA.  One of the consumption.  The estimated effects really haven't changed much if say, 2007 versus, let's say, 2010 or 2011.  In that sense, the effects may not be all that different, but they're large.  And the disaggregated approach has the advantage of taking into account that a debt overhang can have a damping why we prefer that. of underwater mortgages, I haven't done enough on that to really hazard a

would say that I have a slightly different definition of and essentially what I said in the presentation is that repayment behavior through means other than foreclosure.  They may choose to choose to pay down their credit card balances as a asset values.  Now, I believe that Daniel would not consider that I referred to that as two presentations.  That said, looking forward, in both our views I and net worth of households is going to be important in I'm not sure whether it has direct policy MR. HAUGHWOUT.  I deleveraging than the one that Daniel uses, when household asset values change or net worth changes, that could induce households to change their accelerate payments on their mortgage or reaction to a change in deleveraging because asset values are a fundamental, but in my presentation deleveraging.  That's a slight difference in the definition, which might bring a little more consistency between our would believe, the path of asset values determining how much future debt paydown we see.

One point, though, is that you can actually get shifts in effect on consumption.  For example, someone with sufficient some of their assets to pay down their debt just through a balance without having any particular change in the consumption.  I would not consider MR. COOPER.  I don't really have a whole lot to add to that other than to say that Andy's actively deleveraging or foreclosures and default the debt-to-asset ratio without any assets could choose to use sheet reshuffling that deleveraging.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Vice Chairman.

of broad questions for you to react to. you save to achieve wealth rather than saving for its own sake, the level of you see as your appropriate level of savings.  Obviously, if real your net worth objectives.  How do you think the rates should affect the outlook given your work in this subject?  That's a situation in which the could be behaving very differently than those who are getting squeezed in terms of income growth.  When I looked at what you presented, that together, and there was no income distribution channel.  I'd like to get your seemed to have a pretty strong VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I have a couple First, assuming that interest rates might affect what rates are low, you need to save more to achieve low level of real interest my question number one.  The second question is income distribution has changed pretty dramatically over the last couple of decades, and you could imagine individuals who are accruing income actually was all mushed thoughts on that.  And then finally, I want to amplify what President Rosengren asked.  Daniel's comments that there was no independent deleveraging effect

January 24-25, 2012

get that same sense of what the your findings were.  If you could just expand on that, that would be implication for the outlook.  But John and Andrew, I didn't really outlook implications of helpful.

I would find something in levels, you do see this.  Wealth effects are usually drawn differences really obscures how wealth can In terms of real rates, the effects tend to be pretty limited.  We do find that changes the state level over long and Murphy, and I are MR. DUCA.  If one estimates these sorts of models using levels and some details, one typically finds that housing wealth has had a bigger effect on consumption as one moves forward in time.  You can see this in the aggregate data.  You can even see it in some disaggregated studies.  Even Daniel's 2009 study showed that when you estimate a framework that a little more amenable to out.  They're not a one-time thing, and using first affect things. in car loan rates have big, short-term effects, and we do try to control for that.  We don't include any data on income distribution.  It's hard to do that with aggregate data.  Some other people have been looking into that, but it's a little difficult because of our federal data system.  We haven't had consistent data on consumption and consumer spending at periods of time, but it is something that my coauthors, Muellbauer thinking about and looking into.

notion that the real rate has a relatively simple think about saving is a little bit misleading, as you're well aware.  We changes in that saving behavior in the form of debt paydown over this time MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe I'll chime in with a couple of observations.  First of all, on the question about saving, one important thing to keep in mind is that for many households the way they save is by paying down debt, and so the effect on the way people do observe some period.  Second, the consumer credit panel data that we're using don't have any information on consumer income, and so I'm not able to say anything direct about that.  However, some of the

January 24-25, 2012

exhibit 6 give some indication of the differences across different groups in the younger households seem to be behaving quite differently from older It will be nice to have some better income data at the individual level and a big sample get at some of these questions a little more closely.  Finally, on the outlook, what I going to years-but I think it's very important.  We have a large big effects, in my view, on the outlook for consumption. charts in economy.  For instance, households; they are continuing to pay down debt, whereas older households are increasing their balances. to be able to would take away as the bottom line from my presentation is that the outlook for asset prices and net worth of households is going to be very important in determining the path of borrowing and likely consumption going forward.  That's a hard thing to get a handle on-what's happen to house prices in the next five pool of underwater borrowers and large flows into and out of unemployment-these are situations that may have going to go in reverse order because I want to agree with what I said in my talk, the outlook for net worth and income really is what's going on.  To the extent that falling asset prices are going to have an effect, I wanted to comment on is a lot of people save not only by equity in their house.  I don't have the exact statistics for the vast majority of the people who are in the lower part of the wealth distribution, To the extent that even with low interest rates people can't get into because of credit problems or something else, there's a market failure that addressed to get housing demand back up.  Another channel through which If MR. COOPER.  I'm Andrew just said.  As going to drive what's it could be a place that policy could intervene in terms of trying to help people, if that's what you're looking to do.  The other thing paying down debt, but also by building here, but their wealth is all in housing. new housing potentially has to be consumption has been bolstered a bit in the past through low interest rates is refinancing. people are underwater-as Andrew pointed out-and now don't have the income or whatever to

refinancing, that may be restraining a bit people's freeing up cash flow for other I've done a little bit of related work while you look across the income distribution, you also don't really the income SCF.  The PSID doesn't It has a poverty sample, but those households tend not to have much wealth.  The income distribution is important, but one of the reasons it's important is a lot of those people usually save in terms of housing and through potentially paying get approved for spending purposes.  Finally, in terms of the income distribution, I touched on that a little bit in terms of the amount of housing wealth they have. doing this analysis, and basically if see major effects.  But again, the PSID doesn't have the really high end of distribution.  It's a representative sample, but it's not like the oversample the wealthy. housing because down debt or building equity in their house.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Williams.

very useful, and I like the fact that you and different methods of looking at the same set of issues.  That was very MR. WILLIAMS.  I found all three presentations used different data informative.

couple questions.  The first one -for all three of you-is how do you see your leverage was an important reason both for the I'm thinking work by Mian, Rao, and Sufi.  They take county-level data and assess the high-leverage households, using the cross-section across counties. a significant reduction in aggregate demand the past few years.  Again, the your research or your work relating to that kind of research? I have a work fitting in with other research that argues that severity of the Great Recession and for the sluggishness of the recovery? particularly of the importance of leverage on consumption, and they find that consumption has been much weaker in counties that had many This effect causes question is:  How do you see

January 24-25, 2012

struck by one of the summary statements in Daniel's presentation that I see as having these standard model predictions for years track actual consumption reasonably well or whether there I'm using FRB/US as a typical model of consumption.  Those are my My second question-and this may be more for Dave Reifschneider, so wake up, Dave [laughter]-I was really the standard relationship linking consumption, income, and net worth should continue to be a reasonable predictor of household spending, and that there's little evidence that this didn't hold. And I was just curious from the point of view of FRB/US-which relationships between consumption, income, and net worth-whether the consumption over the past few were big residuals. questions.

paper to be quite consistent in several ways you point out, they find significant evidence of household of the foreclosure process.  They have a similar data set to the one that good-only 80 percent as good, which is good-and so they're declines and get a sense of how much debt find a significant amount, which, again, is consistent with my you will, on consumption during the Great Recession and find the analysis broadly convincing, although they use an instrumental and I'm not 100 percent convinced about the instrument-but I say that about It's fair to say that their analysis is quite consistent with our results, generally speaking with their approach to the question. MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe I'll start by speaking a little bit to the previous literature and Mian, Rao, and Sufi, in particular.  I take that with my presentation.  First of all, as paydown of debt outside we're using.  It's not quite as able to take out the effects of foreclosures on debt payoff there has been.  They notion of deleveraging, although slightly different from Daniel's.  They also find a relatively large effect of debt overhang, if through 2009.  I variables approach every instrument, I think. and I would agree

January 24-25, 2012

agree that the Mian and Sufi work is consistent with what greatest a run-up and a rundown on debt, and that's it.  But the biggest is that they don't have individual-level data.  They don't know anything about the income or anything else.  As a result, they can't really distinguish of their results is that a lot of what's going on is changes in net worth.  Also-and changes run-ups in debt also had incredibly big drops in residential investment. Applebee's to buy dinner as frequently, and that in turn cuts down on the and it becomes circular.  There's a potential for a lot of that to be going I find MR. COOPER.  I don't really we do.  Their main thesis is that consumption drops the most in the counties that had the run-up in debt between 2002 and 2006, and they attribute this to deleveraging.  Some of it is a definitional difference, that there's difference individual's net worth or between changes in consumption due to debt and changes in consumption due to net worth.  My interpretation I've done this with the consumer credit panel-they find a correlation basically between in debt and big drops in employment and big drops subsequently in consumption.  It turns out that places that have big To the extent that you believe that there is a multiplier effect, construction workers who get laid off can't go to the local income of the waitresses, on, and that's not something that they can address.  Also, I would agree with Andrew that the instrument a bit suspect.

would like to comment on the breakdown in wealth.  FRB/US breaks wealth.  The other wealth basically includes other assets Our findings use a to the different components of wealth.  Our results MR. DUCA.  I wealth down into stock wealth and other and then takes into account debt.  Part of the reason for that is that there is a difference in the effects.  Stock wealth has less effect than the other components in FRB/US. three-way breakdown.  It's a little different, but it's consistent with the idea that we do see in the data-and a lot of people have found this when you look through the history-that there is a difference in the sensitivities of consumption

January 24-25, 2012

generally consistent with that notion.  Mian and Sufi's results seem reasonable for autos, but get a little suspicious about using credit card data to track non-auto retail sales because, as we have shifted.  I wonder to what extent the little low.  Nevertheless, their results are consistent with a long history are I all know, the payment system and payment media increased use of debit cards and electronic payments has perhaps caused their estimates of the fall in retail sales to be a of work showing that debt does have a more potent effect on consumption than asset holdings.

I could chime in on one more thing.  One of the benefits I liked about the Mian, Rao, and Sufi paper is just what John pointed to as a exclude mortgage income.  If you're not is going to be roughly stable.  You probably have a fixed-rate you more discretionary expenditure.  I thought that that was a value, and I do believe that MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Maybe and one of the things weakness, that is, the MasterCard data.  What I like is that those data payments, which are probably 30 to 40 percent of homeowners' defaulting, then that payment mortgage, and your payment is the same every month.  They're able to take that out of, if will, the voluntary consumption bundle and look at things like groceries and restaurant mealssomewhat those data incorporate debit card transactions on MasterCard debit cards.

I stand corrected. MR. DUCA.  Then about that. MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Well, I'm not sure

On the question about FRB/US, let me answer with FRB/US, staff models because they all tell similar sorts of stories.  FRB/US relationship.  Consumption is related to an estimate of permanent income, related to wealth, which used to be disaggregated, but these we just use total household net worth because we haven't been able to reliably estimate a are other cyclical factors that come in. MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. EDO, and a number of other has an aggregate which is disaggregated.  It's also days difference between the two components.  And then there

January 24-25, 2012

off during the recession, in 2009 and 2010, but since then it has come negative shocks-it's its longer-run level.  EDO saw a similar pattern.  However, 'Oh, there was a big adverse shock to risk explains it.'  That shock has faded away some.  Then if reduced-form consumption forecast equation-for example, one that the was also off a lot during 2009-10, and it's now That equation went way back on track in the sense that according to the model, there are no longer still tracking back to what would be when EDO looks at the unusual weakness in consumption, it parses the data and looks at the pattern of investment and things like that, and it says, premiums that hit the economy, and that you look at a simpler staff uses to prepare the judgmental forecast-it coming back on track.

at all of those models is to conclude that something funny seemed to That may be the right conclusion, but I'd throw out a if you're using aggregate data, the aggregate data are still, in real Income, consumption, and wealth could all be the statement 'they're all back on track now' is still open years from now, we'll be able to say that with more confidence, once is that-again, just focusing on aggregate data-if estimates of the coefficients in the models, then you'd say, 'Well, they're not But rolling estimates of those coefficients nonetheless send out-of-sample forecasts really whipping up and down in a way that would There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty about what that One way of looking happen during the middle of the recession, but now the equations are looking okay.

The second point you did rolling shifting around too much, those look pretty stable.' can be very material for the forecast. aggregate relationship actually is, even using revised data.

I'd make is that when we talk about these fundamentals, we need to also What role did tightening down on credit and the demise of prices down?  Finally, when you are working Income really isn't in some out leverage and credit effects is very difficult.  That's not a And the third point keep in mind how they may be affected by things such as financial innovations and changes in credit availability.  When we take housing wealth-a fundamental-and condition on it, we have to keep in mind that housing prices went way up, and ask what role did financial innovations have to do with that? subprime lending have to do with bringing house with aggregate data, there is a tremendous simultaneity problem. sense a fundamental, and wealth in the aggregate isn't a fundamental.

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President couple of I am sure the economists around the table know but I don't.  The first and whether pensions are factored into the MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, I would like to ask a definitional questions that question relates to the broader concept of saving saving rate for society-not the personal saving rate but the broader saving rate.  Then, how does

January 24-25, 2012

about Social Security being there or not being about wealth and net worth?  Any answer? the anticipation of pension income or recent fears there factor into a consumer's thought process is a real tough one elderly and of their children.  Corporate contributions to defined benefit plans are your I am going to be flying back home on.  It is a MR. DUCA.  Well, the anticipation of changes in Social Security because obviously, the issue of how to deal with the funding of these liabilities hasn't been addressed.  That is a very important question, and I think we will have to monitor the spending behavior of the incorporated into the saving data, but it is imperfect.  We have a lot of shifts in the form of pensions as well, and there is also a lot of uncertainty, depending on whether or not company is declaring bankruptcy, like the airline thorny issue.  Perhaps Dave may have something to add.

I was doing, doesn't include any defined benefit plan anticipation.  But theories based on being forward-looking in their consumption decisions should be based on their going to be ratcheting back their consumption and saving more now. MR. PLOSSER.  Using up a lifeline, is that what we're doing here?  [Laughter] MR. COOPER.  I don't know enough about the NIPA definition.  For what wealth in the PSID consumers anticipations of pensions, and if they don't think their retirement is going to be there, perhaps they are simpler question, then, is do you define stocks and bonds as is they are practically as liquid as pulling down a cash balance. MR. LOCKHART.  The illiquid because they are in accounts that cannot be easily tapped?  Because the reality of most stock and bond holdings

My coauthor from Great Britain uses that term to basically mean assets that are subject to capital more question, if I may, and it's related maybe a little bit to MR. LOCKHART.  One Vice Chairman Dudley's question on income distribution.  In a recent reading-I don't know if

January 24-25, 2012

attributable to the top would suggest to me, if that is true, that the growth in consumption going to be driven by the behavior of the relative few in society.  And, therefore, we assertion correct?  And then, how do you factor about the broad question of the growth in consumption? it's true or not-I read that 40 percent of aggregate consumption is 10 percent of income.  That is largely ought to be focusing on how that top 10 percent or top 20 percent thinks about wealth, future income prospects, and so forth.  Now, first, is the that into your thinking

I can't speak to whether the assertion is correct, although I am I would point out is that years have been in housing, and reductions in their years.  They are probably less likely, though, to have mortgage be such It is more of a pure wealth effect possibly, and that would potentially affect forward. MR. HAUGHWOUT. certain that some qualitative fact like that is true-that a large proportion of consumption comes from a relatively small proportion of high-income earners.  One thing the biggest declines in asset values over the past several homeownership is, of course, quite concentrated at the very top of the income distribution.  In other words, at the top of the income distribution people are very likely to own homes.  And, thus, these high-income individuals are likely to have sustained significant housing wealth in the past five debt, or substantial amounts of mortgage debt, against that housing, so that there may not a debt overhang. their consumption going contribution from an employer into the pension fund is treated as part of going to seem very confusing, but it makes sense once you pension fund pays out a benefit, it is a payment within the personal far as the national MR. WILCOX.  On the issue of pension funds, the pension fund itself is attributed to the household sector, so a personal income.  For reasons that are have been thinking about it for a long time [laughter], because pension funds are already in the personal sector when the sector, so that is not treated as part of personal income.  The income, as

January 24-25, 2012

concerned, took place when the employer made the contribution into the got it into the personal sector.  Thereafter, it stays in the personal sector.  Interest and earlier was right on, which is that theory tells us that households ought to be consumption that is income accounts are fund.  That dividend income is attributed to the household sector, so that counts as part of personal income. I think the comment taking a long-horizon look at the assets that will be provided out of those pension funds in terms of determining their permanent income prospects and, hence, the level of appropriate.

Continuing on the NIPA Jeopardy questions, as we often say [laughter], your conjecture that upper-income households account for a you just I would point out that part of the reason why the SCF oversamples the rich is because they account for a good information on that, so we try to do that. also have to keep in mind that-and this was ago-those upper-income people are the least likely to be affected by any are the ones most likely to be financial be liquidity MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. internally disproportionate share of total consumption is correct.  Whether it is exactly the number cited, I'm not sure, but that number sounded reasonable to me.  The other thing is disproportionate share of the total wealth in the economy, a disproportionate share of consumption, and so forth.  It is important to get Second, in thinking about what that means, we alluded to a second kind of credit constraint or things like that.  They planners, so their behavior is likely to be more like a classic optimizing household than, say, someone in the bottom 20 percent of the distribution who is more likely to constrained.

a comment and a question. I would make is on exhibit 11 on page 7 of John's presentation.  John, you Looking at the time-series plots, I'm not sure I should draw that confidence.  It looks like, for example, the mortgage debt-to-income consumer debt-to-income ratio also seems maybe not as elevated but I looked at these pictures, and I was more concerned than comforted by MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have The comment expressed some confidence that these ratios were starting to stabilize, especially the consumer debt-to-income ratio was starting to stabilize. where ratio is still quite elevated compared with where it was in 1996 or so when housing prices started to rise very rapidly.  The relatively elevated. them.  That is my comment.

for Daniel.  You made the statement that the linkage between Vice Chairman Dudley emphasized The literature I have seen on household real and we have been somewhat successful on that.  The real interest rates are much were in 2007.  But that doesn't seem to have materialized, and your own It doesn't seem to have shown up in the kind of faster consumption you would have picked that up as, 'Hey, my were before that.'  One question is why you didn't we see something a reason why consumption doesn't seem to be as responsive to the real The question, I guess, is fundamentals and consumption looks the same post-2007 as pre-2007.  The one fundamental that is missing from the regressions-and this is something that in his comments, too-is the real interest rate. consumption typically includes the real interest rate as an explanatory variable.  This is not just an academic comment in the sense that what we are trying to do is push down on that interest rate, lower now than they results seem to show this: growth we would like to see because otherwise regressions are different in 2007 than they include the real interest rate as an explanatory variable.  And then, couldn't about leverage as being interest rate?

the first question?  I distinguish between the two-and you may have misheard me, or maybe I misspoke.  I said mortgage debt is likely to I noted that the rate of decline seemed to have all know that, to some extent, that is the end of the But when we look at consumer debt to income, we have seen the nonrevolving rising for quite some time.

And if together, we see that the that are more sustainable, shall we say. mind, doesn't mean

To address your question on the interest rates, the regressions include consumption models, real risk-free rate or something that is going to pick up all the variation in that.  It would be interesting to the extent you had data on the interest rate faced by the I will say that the year fixed effects are very constant you just plot them.  As to why there isn't more of a consumption jump from low I don't want to hypothesize too much on that.

COOPER. year fixed effects, so that is going to absorb any of that.  Typically, in the we only use the probably individual consumer in terms of their ability to borrow or lend, and that might get some interesting cross-sectional variation there. over time if interest rates, suggested is that perhaps who are constrained, and

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Pianalto.

have a question about the implications of your presentation you gave us two scenarios and the Tealbook forecasts that the saving rate will increase to around 5 and then decline to the current rate of about 4 percent.  Are the saving rates that are all three of these studies? MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I the findings on the saving rate.  John, at the end of affecting the saving rate, percent forecast in the Tealbook consistent with the findings of would say our work is consistent with the Tealbook insofar as we are not all that much movement.  However, a lot depends on what is going to happen with track that, as well as what is going on with I would mention-and I agree completely with what Dave said measurement error.  The saving rate is a reflection of income, which is well as spending, which is measured with error, and sometimes they MR. DUCA.  I seeing consumer credit availability and how well we can mortgages.  The other thing before-there is a lot of measured with error, as compound each other.  I think it is broadly consistent.  A lot depends on what happens with lending conditions, to some extent, and what happens with the housing market, and those are pretty unknown.

I will briefly say it is broadly consistent with the view that going to continue.  They have been quite substantial over the past several years, likely to MR. HAUGHWOUT. emerges from my presentation, in the sense that we expect that household paydowns of mortgage debt are continue, and that is going to show up as saving.  But, again, much depends, as John said, on the outlook for house prices.  A big jump in house prices could change consumers' calculus on those

a relatively slow change in either direction in house prices, we would as households try to rebalance their balance sheets. issues.  But assuming expect to see more mortgage paydowns a whole lot to add to that.  I think that the saving rate fundamental factors impacting consumption, based on rate is going to continue on a similar trend to where it is now. MR. COOPER.  I don't really have is based on the past.  If there are no major my analysis, the saving

MS. PIANALTO.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

First of all, let me just say I love this work, and it gave me a lot of I just have one question.  We have been talking about definitions of and, I want to talk about default for a second.  The general story I have in my that households are very optimistic about the future, took on a lot of debt because they are trying to smooth consumption and tomorrow.  That is why you get the run-up in debt.  Then, tomorrow comes, aren't as high as they thought, so you've got debt overhang.  One 'I'm going to reduce my consumption today and pay off this debt.' going to consume what I want today, and I'm not going to I don't see why default can't be considered one part of the deleveraging interpret it-and maybe I have it wrong-did not want to go in that MR. BULLARD. perspective on these issues. deleveraging mind-and it could be wrong-would be and because of that, they between today and income and wealth reaction to that is to say, Another reaction to it is to say, 'I'm pay back my debt.' story.  You guys, as I direction.

do try to income, and the like, to try to control for on there.  In most of our work we find that for MR. DUCA.  Let me touch on the issue of permanent income.  We actually control for permanent income and use forecasts of swings there.  We don't see quite that much going

January 24-25, 2012

house prices, for example, that in controlling for expectations of future house prices that the main driver seems to be credit standards that, in turn, fuel price expectations.

I don't have any objection to thinking about defaulting on debts as the other form of quite likely that a default on a debt today will come at the price of at the Board indicates that that future could be quite a your credit score recovers to the extent that you will be able to get credit. MR. HAUGHWOUT. a form of deleveraging.  It is clearly a way that households can get debt off of their credit reports and off of their balance sheets.  But it does come at a price, just as deleveraging-actively paying down debt-comes at the price probably of sacrificing consumption today.  It is access to credit in the future.  Research while before

The household would make a decision about how badly they need MR. BULLARD. access to credit markets in the future against the benefits of just defaulting today.

I make on my mortgage and the time kind of rent-free. MR. HAUGHWOUT.  Exactly.  There is one other dimension and that is that in many states, particularly judicial states, the process for foreclosure is quite long and lengthening. Therefore, the amount of time between the last payment when I actually have to move is extending.  It is

That is changing the calculus to some degree? MR. BULLARD.

It changes the calculus to some extent.  But I would still say that MR. HAUGHWOUT. there is still a substantial cost embedded in default, and that is reduced access to credit.

Do I have it right in my head that this is a big issue because the chunk of the mortgage debt coming down? MR. BULLARD.  Okay. default part of it is a big years. MR. HAUGHWOUT.  That's right.  There is no question that defaults have been very important in removing debts from household liabilities over the past three to five

January 24-25, 2012

Default could be part of the story, if you wanted to think about it that I agree with a lot of what Andrew is saying.  But the story you describe, if you want to going to impact your you are just wiping away your debt, your point is you are just going to go you are.  That shouldn't really have an impact on consumption.  And, really, get at is a definition of deleveraging where you are trying to find something you wipe away debt, that is going to show up through a change in your net worth.  I you're telling has much of an effect on consumption.  And, yes, I comes at a price. MR. COOPER. way. abstract a bit from potential future hits on your credit, is not really consumption today.  If on consuming as what I was trying to abnormal that is impacting consumption beyond the normal net worth and income channels. Again, if don't really think that the story agree, it also a null hypothesis, which is the standard model, and we are going to test whether testing sense.' we usually do inference.  But suppose your objective is to minimize of your forecast, which is a little bit different.  Wouldn't the right be-and I am asking this in terms of how you think about this-to look at, on the one in-sample forecast brought about by a more complex model of extra parameters and some information criteria?  And isn't that the you should think about it?  Or do you instead use some kind of Occam's razor and stick CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would like to ask a quick methodological question, probably more to Dave and David.  The way that Mr. Cooper approached the question was to say, 'We have these bells and whistles are statistically significant in a classical hypothesis Obviously, that is the way the mean squared error approach hand, the improvement in the penalized by the number way with the smallest statistically valid model?

We had a debate recently on consumption and leverage, part of you are raising.  I would say you never know what MR. REIFSCHNEIDER. which, I think, involved exactly the question

January 24-25, 2012

it is a complicated world-you know lots of things good to look at a variety of models with a variety of channels and ask am I learning from this?  Probably never put zero weight on any of those models, weight.  Another methodological thing when you right-is, if you have tuned it to in-sample data, good way to do that is to close as you can get to an out-of-sample, real-time forecasting the true model is.  Occam's razor is good, but matter.  So it is really yourself, what although some of them might get a pretty low think about a model-if you are doing things then you really should penalize it for that sort of overfitting.  Maybe a try to evaluate these things as environment.  Try not to cheat by looking at the results and then going back.  That is very hard to do, but we aspire to doing that, taking that kind of a Bayesian broad approach.  We don't always get there.

you very much, presenters and organizers, for a very you for the comments from folks around the table.  While we are of Committee officers.

Specifically, the allows the New York Fed to undertake securities restriction causes difficulties when there are differences in the holiday calendars of the Federal Reserve and the markets in which the New York discrepancy can participation in our operations around these dates.  To address this issue, I am requesting that the authorization be altered to allow the New York Fed to lend securities on an overnight basis as determined by the trading conventions of the

market in which it is operating.  The specific change requested was described in the memo sent to the Committee ahead of this meeting.

would also like to update the Committee on several to the domestic authorization. In addition to this change, I items related

I would like to note an item that will likely come before the Committee for New York Operations that would allow these transactions with our Lastly, authorization at an upcoming meeting.  Last January, I mentioned that the Fed at some point would seek authorization on a proposed policy to address the occurrence of daylight overdrafts in foreign central bank accounts by providing intraday liquidity through daylight repurchase agreements.  We continue to work out specific details around the proposed procedures.  Once those details are settled, I will review this proposal with the Committee and ask for a change to the Authorization for Domestic Open Market foreign central bank customers.

Desk Instructions with Respect to Foreign Currency I recommend all three of these be renewed without amendment.  Please System's Let me now turn to foreign currency operations.  For those operations, the operates under the Authorization for Foreign Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Operations. note that the vote to reaffirm these documents will include approval of the warehousing agreement with the Treasury.

Brian?  [No response] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Are there questions for

January 24-25, 2012

two votes.  The first is to approve the Authorization for Domestic Open Operations with the amendment that Brian described.  Are there any objections?  [No Currency Operations, the Foreign Currency Directive, and the Procedural Respect to Foreign Currency Operations.  Are there objections?  President All right.  Well, we have Market response]  Seeing none.  The second vote is to approve, without amendment, the Authorization for Foreign Instructions with Lacker.

would like to oppose the Operations and the Foreign Currency Directive.  This is the I and my immediate predecessor have taken every three years since 1997. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I respectfully Authorization for Foreign Currency position exchange operations.  Foreign exchange years, and good reason, largely reflecting a sense of futility.  If these operations are sterilized but not bank.  If they are sterilized but followed by supporting operations, they compromising the independence of the central bank that has had to cooperate with its lead in these operations.  If they are not sterilized, we obviously could have on foreign exchange These are the foundations for foreign operations-interventions by central banks-have become exceedingly rare in recent for followed by supporting policy actions, then they are likely to fail to the detriment of the credibility of the central are essentially the Treasury and bought U.S. Treasury securities instead, the difference being we are taking risk to the detriment of the U.S. taxpayer.

for I believe that, given the history of the past decade or two with foreign exchange operations, we should consider approaching the Administration and seeking to take steps to wind down and dismantle this infrastructure and back away from this central banking practice.  In the meantime, I would like very respectfully use this triennial opportunity to register my hope

At least at a high level, it identifies the elements of FOMC policy explicit.  At the same time, it is a move forward.  It is, of course, also a product of a very long effort, and I debates.  In a way, this vote is a response to Governor Duke who wanted never to discuss these issues again, [laughter] and we hope maybe to accommodate her.  The FOMC

January 24-25, 2012

around the table have academic research and the central banking analysis that has contributed to this, of course. discussing these issues for at least 15 years or more, and many of us worked on the including me, what this is.  In my view, this statement does not reflect, approach of the FOMC.  Our healthy economy in complementary.  At the same time, this document is recent debates around the table about whether further actions to create risks of higher inflation.  In those situations, as the document says, do not want to interpret this statement as a change in the underlying public comments. It is important to be clear about and should not be represented as, a change in the underlying policy approach has stabilized into one in which we provide a firm anchor for inflation and inflation expectations in the longer term, which in turn gives us flexibility to offset short-term economic shocks.  Because stable inflation and inflation expectations both support a the longer term and improve our ability to respond to short-run shocks, we can say that the two sides of the dual mandate are generally explicit in saying that in the short run, the inflation and employment objectives can conflict, which is evidenced by our many promote employment we take a balanced approach that is informed by our knowledge of the economy's dynamics, the outlook, and the size and expected persistence of the deviations of our objectives from their desired levels.  Again, I policy approach, and I hope that people will not interpret it as such in their

We are What this is trying to do is increase our transparency our communication clearer to the public.  There is a lot of evidence that communication and transparency are valuable to monetary policy in the long term.  In that respect, I don't think of this as simply a short-term document or an opportunistic document.  But of course this is a particularly important time for us to focus on communication.  Our normal policy instrumentthe target for the federal

In effect, the Committee will need to continue to engage in essentially the same consensus-building process that we always have the same 2 percent inflation goal in mind when we have those discussions around the FOMC table, and on occasions where inflation deviates from that understand our intention to bring inflation back to that goal over time, rather than wondering whether the Committee 1970s, or engage in opportunistic disinflation.

The statement itself indicates that the Committee intends to reaffirm these principles at each organizational meeting, but we will need to go well beyond that to ensure that this document isn't effectively dropped into the file cabinet For example, we should ensure familiar with these principles, and we will need to use a wide array of communications tools to highlight and explain these principles to the through ongoing efforts in speeches, media interviews, academic conferences, and other initiatives.

I very much think it's the culmination of a lot of long discussions around this table years, and in my view, this is not very different from what I would think of as a going forward.  We'll still have many debates about when to tighten and when not to tighten, when to ease and when not I do think it helps the Fed catch up to other central banks, which have run ahead of the very much support the statement.

Right, and the second, which is a negative inference, is that the fact that these are two-year rates suggests that anything beyond the fundamentally been yield spreads in, say, essentially any securities beyond the horizon of the LTRO to the extent that end of the curve. MR. SACK.  That's right.  You've not seen the narrowing of 10-year securities or we've seen it at the short

We do think that the improvement at the short end of the sovereign debt attributable to the LTRO, and that it hasn't backstopped the entire yield effectively.  You can actually raise questions about whether it will continue to backstop reasons I cited in the briefing. MR. SACK. markets has been largely curve as the short end of the curve as effectively as it has so far, given the you. MR. TARULLO.  Thank

I can just add onto that.  I broadly agree with Italy than for other countries, there have been some a little bit Italy and a little bit more for Spain and some others.  So it's possible that the effects of the in providing more liquidity, and in some sense improving the broader tone of investor MR. KAMIN.  Governor Tarullo, if everything Brian said.  I think that, less for much more muted downward movements in 10-year spreads for other sovereign areas, for LTRO sentiment, may have had some knock-on effects to longer maturities as well, not working mechanically through the wherewithal to purchase, but just through broader sentiment.  But the

January 24-25, 2012

issue really is the durability of that sentiment.  If some future shocks develop, the demand for the longer-term securities might just as easily turn south again.

But I guess, Steve, the implicit question behind the questions I was Brian is:  Has investor sentiment with respect to the probability of repayment of a bond 5 to 10 years hence changed at all? MR. TARULLO. asking by Italy or Spain minutely smaller, but I think in broad terms, most MR. KAMIN.  Well, by that metric it's people recognize that nothing fundamental has changed, consistent with Brian's statement.

To the extent there is some improvement farther out the curve, my point was just that it's an order of magnitude different.

It allows you to buy the debt, hold it to maturity, and if there's is so powerful when the ECB was LTROs and presumably would maintain these fixed-rate full-allotment offerings were liquidity strains in the market.

Is there evidence on the Can we match it up in some way?  Is there really data on speculation? MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.  The two more substantive questions about the is we don't really know balance sheets of the Spanish banks or the other European banks that they've actually increased their holdings of the sovereign debt? that or not, or is this just

We cannot, but the ECB included some charts and text in its monthly They were arguing that they thought that panel 2. MR. SACK. bulletin that showed that the participation of individual banks was actually correlated with the funding needs that they face over the next three years. this was evidence that the LTRO was being used, to some degree at least, as a pre-funding mechanism to address the rollover issue that I was highlighting in

It's sort of indirect though, right? MR. PLOSSER.

January 24-25, 2012

It's very indirect on what the banks then did with those funds.  We, in fact, any information on whether or not specific banks have increased their own country's sovereign bonds or other euro-area bonds. MR.

I was trying to get at.  Going back to your view.  One of the clear implications from the sovereign debt crisis and what's going on in Europe over the past six months has been a degree to which there has been a dollar.  Some of the reduction in yields on U.S. Treasuries, I suspect, to safety.  Do you have any sense about how are going on in the shorter-term debt markets? MR. PLOSSER.  Right.  That's really the link yields, I have one more question that I guess is related.  I asked this question last time, and I just want to hear been flight to quality, to the U.S. has something to do with shifting risks and flights to tease that out from other things that

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Lockhart.

you seem to be painting an improved and relatively encouraging LTRO is at its limit, is it not, or close to its limit? MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  On exhibit 1, I'm just trying to anticipate what could happen.  Overall picture.  The

I mentioned in the briefing, they will conduct a second LTRO in late February, and the amount of activity is expected to go up notably among their limit because the banks have collateral that can be ECB. MR. SACK.  No, it's not.  As three-year market participants.  And they're not at used to borrow from the

LOCKHART. Then if you look at the maturities in exhibit 2, that looks relatively comfortable. front-loaded, it's still spread well, and it's pretty manageable. MR. manageable it would seem to me with an LTRO backstop and markets getting more Even if it's slightly

That's correct.  That's the right interpretation, that the LTRO has been used given the availability of collateral, and in that regard can be used the banks that they have funding.  Let me just I noted in my briefing text, the expansion of the collateral that the ECB That was equally as important perhaps as extending the horizon of the LTRO from one MR. SACK. heavily, could be used further to offset these maturing debt payments and assure mention quickly, as accepts.

years.  That meaningfully increased the capacity of banks to borrow.  And so in a where collateral is becoming a more binding constraint, this is a very important year to three jurisdiction constraint to loosen.

The market navigated through the S&amp;P downgrades, which I think were the threat in the near term.  Regarding sovereign debt, many of the as well as from other agencies.  So we certainly additional ratings downgrades.  Now, it might be useful to talk for a minute about If there are ratings downgrades, we never know exactly how markets mandate-driven selling by investors, and impair the ability of banks to use the ECB to help fund those securities. there is room for downgrades and this debt will still be eligible as could see more ratings actions.

We never know the extent to which there is it is not easy to judge how much pressure it would put on markets broadly.  What it probably won't do is significantly The ECB has loosened its ratings requirements, and it accepts sovereign debt down to a BBBrating, which means that collateral to the ECB.  And the ECB has shown, in exceptional cases, it is willing to even suspend that requirement.  I think the big picture here is we shouldn't affect the ability market consequences that are hard to judge.

I may.  How important in this is the MR. LOCKHART.  And one final question, if negotiation over the haircuts of the Greek debt?

I think it is a wildcard-a significant near-term risk event.  The negotiations get far enough along that they were debating over a final few details.  And one could MR. SACK. seemed to

January 24-25, 2012

be worth letting the whole thing unravel based on those details.  I think get a lot of questions about what happens next.  If collective are put into the securities and are used at the default event, it would trigger the about, but it is hard to anticipate exactly what would wonder if it would really there is still a good chance they will get to a PSI agreement and will proceed.  If they do not to a PSI agreement, though, it raises action clauses CDS.  And it is hard to predict just how damaging that would be to markets.  It is certainly a risk that many market participants are worried happen.

I could just add on to that, President Lockhart.  There is a very nearcould default as soon as March, if this deal doesn't go through and does not private creditors, which seems a rather high even if that PSI deal does go through, the prospects for Greece still are years because they require another very IMF as well.  And finance ministers said that they have no intention of increasing the size of that going to need more.  It has got to come from So we have both very acute near-term stresses related to the Greek deal, but also what is happening with the Greece PSI deal MR. REEVE.  If term risk that Greece get near-universal participation on the part of the hurdle to achieve.  But full of tremendous risk over the next couple of substantial financing package from the European Union and presumably the yesterday the EU package that they had agreed on in October.  By our reckoning, Greece just doesn't quite get there with that amount of funds.  They are somewhere. some longer-term ones.  As a final point, there have been two exceptions to this improvement in market sentiment in Europe since December.  One is Greece, of course, and the other is Portugal. And we have started to see some contagion from now starting to rattle investors who are holding Portuguese debt.

Overall, the data that have become available since the December Tealbook suggest that the economy has been expanding at a somewhat more moderate pace than we had anticipated.  The first exhibit highlights some of the recent information that has some of the recent economic indicators have improved.  As shown in inset box in the

your first exhibit, the unemployment rate has declined about gains averaged 155,000 per month in the fourth quarter, the quarter.  Moreover, other labor market indicators, such as average monthly job gains will be about 150,000 in the current and that the unemployment rate will edge up to 8.7 percent. upper-left panel of ½ percentage point in recent months to 8.5 percent in December.  Nevertheless, private-sector payroll same as in the preceding initial claims and firms' hiring plans, point to continued modest gains in employment in coming months.  With overall output projected to expand at only a moderate rate, we anticipate that quarter solid recovery in the motor vehicle supply from the disruptions earlier last year.  Near-term indicators of production-such and national manufacturing surveysyear ago, so we at about the same rate in the current quarter As shown to the right, manufacturing production continued to expand at a pace last quarter, boosted in part by the ongoing chain as the new orders indexes from the regional have improved some lately, but remain below their levels from a expect manufacturing output to increase as in the fourth quarter.

As shown in the middle-left panel, after sales, motor vehicle purchases, and consumer prices, we estimate that real expenditures are on a somewhat shallower trajectory than we previously Moreover, because sentiment remains subdued, we expect consumer pace in the equipment and software has been a bright spot in the we have anticipated.  The nondefense capital goods weighted relative importance in E&amp;S expenditures.  Both of these measures curled after flattening in the preceding months, and they are to see for gains anticipated this quarter. Business spending for recovery, but these expenditures look to be slowing as middle-right panel shows orders and shipments of by their downward in November consistent with the noticeable deceleration in E&amp;S spending that we expect the fourth quarter and the modest

As shown in the bottom-left panel, monthly data for defense spending suggest that real federal purchases declined significantly more in the fourth quarter than we had anticipated in the previous Tealbook.  Defense expenditures fell short of our expectations through most of last indicating that funding for overseas military operations next year will be much less than we had anticipated, we also have lowered our projection for the federal purchases in the first quarter.

Folding in all of the incoming data, we now expect real GDP to rise at an annual 3 percent in the forecast. of about 1½ percent, nearly ½ percentage point below our previous forecast.

I will discuss recent one in a moment, but let me current forecast for real GDP-shown by the black line in Tealbook, not reflecting the higher exchange value of the dollar and higher oil prices to increase 2 percent in 2012 and 2½ percent in 2013, about the same pace our assumed growth rate of potential output this year and a only a bit faster than project that the unemployment rate will edge down to only 8¼ percent by from the effects of the assumed unemployment benefits at the end of this year. The next exhibit presents the medium-term outlook for real activity. the gap between the June projection and the most begin by noting that our the upper-left panel-is just a shade weaker than in the previous shown, mostly in this forecast, along with our lower projected path for defense spending.  Real GDP is expected as potential growth next year.  With only a slight pickup in real activity, the recovery in the labor market also looks to be painfully slow.  As shown by the black line to the right, we late 2013, with most of this reduction coming expiration of emergency is growth and the unemployment rate growth in potential output is lower than we thought last June. As shown by the dotted red lines in the top two panels, our current forecast considerably more pessimistic for both real GDP than the one that we provided to you last June.

Although it is always difficult to predict how these types of evolve, we the U.S. economy during the first half of this Trevor will discuss recent developments in the European situation in more my presentation, and Josh will then talk about some of the downside financial risks posed by these developments.

Even with the headwinds growth to step up only been restraining the recovery-such as difficult access to credit and the depressed housing market-also are expected to improve only slowly.  Reflecting the pace of overall economic activity and the current environment of heightened uncertainty, we expect the recovery in the labor market to continue to be slow.  As part of the Beige Book process, we asked the staffs at the Reserve Banks to make inquiries on several questions related to firms' hiring plans.  Some key summarized in the middle-right respondents employment over the next 12 months, roughly unchanged from the were provided last June.

Both of these revisions, which have been predominantly driven by the heightened stresses in Europe, have diminished the outlook for U.S. exports.

Although money funds have reduced their direct words of caution are in order.  First, aggregate data can mask fund-level Consider the panel in the middle right, which shows the distribution of prime money funds' exposures to France.  As shown by the left-most bar, quite a few funds have no exposure to France.  However, scanning to the right, many funds have at least some exposure, and, as shown by the right-most bar, quite a few exposures exceeding 10 percent of their portfolios.  In other words, although aggregate exposures to France large enough such that defaults on French liabilities (or even pressures to liquidate these assets quickly in light of increased concerns themselves cause these funds to 'break the buck.'  Experience has shown that, in the wrong circumstances, a break-the-buck event at even a single money fund caused by a credit event at a single firm can set off a broader flight of investors that can quickly become a full-fledged run, with consequent serious damage to the entire financial system.  Second, although shortened maturities reduce risks funds, the aggregate effect is to put additional pressure on issuers and likely the overall stability of the financial system.

And last, the Comprehensive way, and bank supervisors in the System are Stepping back for a moment, the lower panel provides a brief update on some ongoing policy initiatives.  First, we expect that the SEC will soon issue for public comment a proposed rule aimed at reducing the susceptibility of money funds to runs. These rules, which have expected to include some form of a capital buffer-likely modest in size-perhaps in conjunction with holdback provisions on redemptions by money fund investors.  The SEC will brief the FSOC on the proposal in February.  Second, the industry-led force on triparty repo reform is expected to issue a final public report soon that will acknowledge that its earlier recommendations have not been fully implemented. Most importantly, the industry has not eliminated the market's credit from clearing banks, although a number of prerequisites to this goal have been put in place.  Efforts in this direction continue, notably by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York through the use of supervisory tools Third, the FSOC has issued for public comment systemically important nonbank financial institutions.

Exhibit 2 presents information on your federal funds rate associated with your assumption of no further two-thirds of Committee participants anticipate that economic conditions warrant the removal of policy accommodation until 2014 or later.  In contrast, six of you believe that earlier action will be required.  Regarding the balance sheet, seven of you about as assumed in the significantly earlier or later expectation for liftoff assumed by or later, consistent with the exit principles agreed on in June.  However, one participant suggested ending the maturity extension program early.  And three participants indicated that, in their view, appropriate policy would include additional purchases of mortgage-backed securities this

The two participants with liftoff during year-end funds rates of 1½ and 1¾ percent.  Your estimates of the longerrate are plotted to the right, and you can see that as of the end of you anticipate that the appropriate federal funds rate below its longer-run level.  In broad terms, the federal funds gradually to 4¼ percent by 2020, appears to be in your policy projections. The bottom panel details the distribution of participants' individual judgments of the appropriate level of the federal funds rate over the longer funds rate during the projection period.  In this regard, I should note that although we did not plot dots for those who put the first increase in 2015, they rate at only ½ percent 2016, have run level of the funds projection period in 2014, all of will still be substantially rate path assumed in the Tealbook, in which the funds rate lifts off from the zero lower bound in late 2014 and rises the range of

Most of the will be close to or below increase in the federal funds rate anticipate that the funds rate liftoff will occur in 2014 or later.  In their narratives, those participants cited their expectations economic expansion would proceed would decline slowly, and that inflation was likely to be relatively stable at or below 2 percent until the time of liftoff. recovery will be sufficiently slow that the unemployment rate will not fall enough to warrant liftoff until 2016 projects inflation at that juncture to be substantially 2 percent.  In contrast, the participants who judge funds rate is one that begins earlier and rises more quickly (the shaded triangles and diamonds) generally believe that the Committee should act decisively to contain inflation and to avoid the risks of losing credibility expectations.  In addition, several project above-trend economic concerns need to act to forestall inflation while the unemployment rate is still above 7½ percent.  One participant, who is forecasting inflation to run above 2 percent over the next two years, expects the unemployment rate to fall to 7 percent 2013.

your economic you made in November and with the growth, shown in the your projections is for the economy to expand at year and then to accelerate moderately in 2013.  The compared with your November forecasts were relatively small, but the your projections for GDP growth for the next two years are a bit as continuing to restrain the pace of government, a depressed housing market, and elevated levels of consumer In addition, many of you noted that you had marked down forecasts some in light of a weaker outlook for Europe and the emerging market you anticipate that the factors restraining the of your projections showing real above its longer-run pace.

However, for a number you, this outcome for inflation rests on the assumption that monetary year or two to forestall a pickup in forecasts. Turning to inflation-the bottom two tendencies of 2 percent over the 2012-14 period.

Over the medium term, you anticipate that inflation will remain subdued as the persistence of high levels of slack in resource utilization hold down inflationary of accommodation will be removed in the next inflation.  By comparison, the Tealbook forecast for inflation skirts the low end of the range of participants'

that struck me was business fixed investment, and I would like to get it.  In our business outlook survey, the diffusion index for prospective forecast is just barely over ½ percentage point off your forecasted GDP growth.  What I would like you down from 7½ percent, or whatever it is this year, to in 2011?  Is it add factors?  Is it uncertainty?  What's feeding through in your some elaboration on it. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The Tealbook's forecasts in general seem to be on the weak side relative both to the SEP projections as well as some private forecasters.  One aspect of the difference some clarification on capital expenditures actually doubled from 10 to 20 in January.  I would also note that in the SPF-the Survey of Professional Forecasters-the projections for business fixed investment in 2012 are in the neighborhood of 5.8 or 6 percent, while the staff's 2 percent.  And, indeed, the slowdown in business investment from 2011 to 2012 is actually knocking something like is some insight as to what is knocking 2 percent projections for business fixed investment?  That seems to be a very important part of the forecast, so I would like are two parts of that.  First, on equipment and software, in the is consistent with what we had been anticipating for we have also seen that although business sentiment have improved since the fall, they are still below what they were a year ago, and our MR. ENGEN.  There recent data, we have seen a slowdown that the fourth and the first quarter.  Moreover, measures

January 24-25, 2012

is that the uncertainty about Europe and about the overall economy having prevailed has led to somewhat damped expectations for the path for E&amp;S expenditures.  On are two parts to that.  We see drilling and mining structures well as with the new are using.  We did see some bounce-up in nonresidential outside of drilling and mining in the middle of last year.  We think that that is due to some expiring provisions for tax credits for some types of power in that sector of vacancy rates, restrained we will return to the slow and subdued level of that we saw earlier last year. judgment for a while nonresidential investment, there continuing to rise briskly with higher oil prices and other energy prices, as and profitable technologies that they structures primarily transitory, industries.  And so when we look at the fundamentals credit, and other things like that, we think that nonresidential investment outside of drilling and mining

I might just add, you are correct, President Plosser, that the business off GDP growth this year compared with year.  That is unrevised from the December Tealbook, so our projection in this regard is just MR. WILCOX.  If investment forecast is taking about ½ percentage point last as it was in December.

MR. FISHER.  I presentation we talked about French banks.  For reasons that may be peculiar to me, I primary fiscal deficit and developments that might occur during the Do we have concerns about France, or you are alone.  We are actually fairly concerned about all in Europe, not just in France.  Now, France's risk, I suppose, because of the election.  But with the exception of Germany, MR. REEVE.  No, I don't think of the fiscal adjustment programs that are in place may be at more

January 24-25, 2012

Italy, by a small margin.  Italy didn't have much of an adjustment to massive adjustment to do next year and the year.  And Spain, which missed its target by at least 2 percent of GDP in 2011, is going to have to negotiate a revision to its target for 2012, especially in light of the economic growth.  My own preference would be that the whole would be renegotiated at the European Commission level, with new friendlier to economic growth and not quite so 'damn the torpedoes, full But of course Spain's initial reaction to missing its target was to announce of structural cuts.  There is a fine balance around going too far, and the key unfold.  But, clearly, which is going to overshoot its target for 2011, the rest of them look likely that they will miss it, although in some cases, like do between 2010 and 2011, but it has an absolutely following almost surely deterioration in the outlook for constellation of fiscal targets targets that are a little steam ahead.' another 1½ percent test will of course be how markets respond to these developments as they the whole fiscal situation is one of the main, if not the main, factor that is underpinning our very weak outlook.

In December, we did do an upside scenario in the Tealbook.  We fully MR. REEVE.  I are about upside admit that we could be surprised in the other direction.

It looks likely that their opening bid on the size of the capital buffers is not going to be particularly large.  We don't know exactly what they will be out fairly soon.  There is the potential for the rules, if they were make a meaningful dent in the runability on funds. in particular, on how the are well designed and integrated well, you could have a meaningful fix to the situation. However, we have to wait to see what have to wait to see what gets implemented.  There is a real chance that what would come out would be watered down and not be effective.

The picture on exhibit 12 gives a snapshot in time, but or an increase in the dependence on short-term funding over time?

The trends have been roughly flat over the past few holding companies-Bank of America, J.P.

Can I add just one thing to that?  Their ratios have been pretty the crisis, their assets have shrunk quite a bit.  That is opposed to the deposits, which have been increasing at the bank holding companies, and so their reliance on other types of short-term, nondeposit funding have example, these are actually quite a bit lower. more capital and more long-term debt

My understanding is that of the larger firms, if you net short-term investments against short-term liabilities, for kind of data that a bank supervisor could look at.  I always am a little MR. GALLIN.  If instance, dependence ratios have come down a lot for some banks.  I have looked at Y9C data, which are not the perfect nervous about netting out these big, broad categories that may not be perfectly maturity matched, but the supervisors presumably would have the data to look at that in more detail and more appropriately.

MR. GALLIN.  That's true.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Mr. Chairman?

a two-hander? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  You have glad to yield the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, I had another question.  I'm always floor to President Lacker.  He always has such interesting things to say.

LACKER. I will yield the remainder of my time.  [Laughter] MR.

'Lost Decade' scenario.  The thing I MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  My question is about the found puzzling about that scenario is that we had continued downward drift in inflation throughout that.  You could imagine a lost-decade scenario that would be maybe slightly different than the one that staff programmed up, one with so much supply-side damage that

January 24-25, 2012

you are going to end up with increases in inflation alongside increases in actually unemployment.

There is, as I noted, some supply-side damage involved in this in terms of lower participation rates, a higher NAIRU, and lower potential, but not you were mentioning.  A Tealbook alternative that I didn't have had a little more of what you are talking about was the 'Greater It continued with the weak economy, but with greater supply-side that policymakers are slow to recognize.  In that different scenario, you then can get a MR. ENGEN.  Yes. scenario enough to get the kind of result that highlight here that may Supply-Side Damage.' damage boost in inflation.

your thoughts on what would be happening to you look at this dotted line in exhibit 3, it is just heading downward. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  What would be inflation expectations?  If How would inflation expectations be reacting?

We assumed that inflation expectations are anchored.  It is one of the that keeps inflation from dropping further.  If it was the case that you also had a big drop then clearly inflation could fall quite a bit further. MR. ENGEN. things in inflation expectations,

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

I was listening to the SEP presentation question occurred to me that relates to the strategic framework statement that we game to point this out-you might want to wave it off for framework statement I certainly agree with Lacker that if 17 of us were going to write down one of these statements it would take MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As from Joyce, a just adopted.  I don't know if it's fair another time-but the Committee just adopted what I think is a terrific about how we conduct policy in line with how we have been doing it.  And President

January 24-25, 2012

forms.  But I think that we found a pretty good intersection of our views.  But looking exhibit 1, our forecast for the unemployment rate exhibits a long period of substantial everybody's long-run sustainable unemployment rate is, and yet the core embodied in everyone's rate projections that we will be those indicate some people's tightening begins year, and then as we proceed more indicate tightening.  A question, particularly if you were framework at the press conference, would be:  How is it that we until I saw the projections. different at deviations above what PCE inflation forecast has absolutely no overshooting whatsoever forecast.  Then, on top of that, we have the federal funds presenting at the press conference tomorrow, and this to bring out the strategic interpret this as a balanced approach to dealing with these substantial deviations?  This could be a defining characteristic of how we portray balanced approach.  I don't know if anybody has given thought to that.  I didn't expect this exactly you raise is very legitimate.  I will let people speak for themselves, probably tomorrow, but would be that, if you believe that we are out of tools, that would be one you think we have effective tools, then it is hard to explain that path.  Is that CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, I think it is something we ought to talk about.  The issue I suppose one argument explanation.  But if okay?

MR. EVANS.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.

and even in a couple of cases the range, which seems unusual to me. MS. DUKE.  Mine is just a question.  The Tealbook forecast seems to be way outside of what the central tendency Is this unusual, happening from time to time?

they are usually a little bit closer than this. MS. ZICKLER.  I think that

January 24-25, 2012

wanted to come back as well to the within a pretty narrow width of our confidence interval.  I would say, yes, we are on the pessimistic gravity of opinion, and probably this is a little unusual in terms of our Committee participants. MR. WILCOX.  I think this is a little unusual.  I question of our relationship to outside forecasters, too.  We are a little more pessimistic, though not much more pessimistic.  The Blue Chip consensus projection, for example, of the unemployment rate at the end of 2013 is 8.0, and we are at 8.2.  This is range, given the side of the center of relative position compared with

MS. DUKE.  Thank you.

President Plosser. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

I have a two-hander because I want to follow up on the question I asked I wanted to come back to investment because I think investment plays forecast.  I didn't quite get an answer to the question. your lower forecast is add factors or judgment calls relative to your affect your MR. PLOSSER. when we started this off. an important role in this somewhat weaker Given where the private sector is on the forecast for business fixed investment, I'm trying to figure out how much of investment equations.  Can you give me some sense about how those two things forecast?

Certainly there is some judgment in it in the following sense.  When we forecast relative to last June, some of that is As Trevor showed, there is the effect of the exchange value of the dollar on exports. sentiment both for businesses recovered some, but they're still pretty subdued.  Risk for a while is always a judgment.  How much of that was directly MR. ENGEN. think about how much we've marked down the direct. Some of that is indirect in the sense that we saw that measures of and households went down.  They've premiums have risen, and how much to attribute that to more transitory factors and how much is going to weigh on the forecast

January 24-25, 2012

factors as well as how much has weighed specifically is hard to parse exactly.  But even though businesses in the past couple of a fast rate in order to build back up their capital stock to a certain degree, the case that we think some of this uncertainty and subdued sentiment going forward will surveys on capital expenditures that we have looked at, for example and the difficulty in I can't give you an exact amount from our forecast. related to Europe and how much was other on the investment years have invested at it is weigh on it.  Some other those that ask firms what their thinking is on this, indicate that uncertainty planning long-term projects is part of it, but what it's worth, we're running a little ahead of our preferred staff a lower forecast.  We think MR. WILCOX.  For model.  We're not add-factoring down the E&amp;S projection to get we're taking a small bet that there is still a little bit of pent-up demand for replacement of aging equipment.

MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I want to talk about exhibit 11 at the Risk.  I want to get clarification on what this is showing.  I would that this is a high reading; what does it mean?  In particular, what are the units here? MR. BULLARD.  Thank bottom, Conditional Value at say

I showed the CoVaR-Conditional Value at Risk-is an index, I hadn't indexed it, it would show a dollar amount that the financial system could lose in an at a specific firm.  Again, in that case it's operationalized 5 percent extreme event for a specific firm.  It is done firm by firm-the note at the a fair bit of systemic risk right now in the system. MR. GALLIN.  The way but if extreme but plausible event-for example, a 5 percent tail event loss to the financial system, conditional on an extreme stress event with the bottom says which banks it is for-and it's added up for that and then indexed.  It's a high reading, which suggests that there's

January 24-25, 2012

What I'd like to know is how much the dollar value is.  But also, we does it mean when this thing peaks?  Does that MR. BULLARD. actually had an event in 2008 and 2009, so what match up with actual loss to the financial system during that period or is that not what's going on here?

a conceptual idea of measuring the risk to the system from a distress at an institution, but you occurred.  There's also a question of over what amount of time the loss amount of time, like a week or a month.  Of a longer period of The $150, $200 billion that this would look like if it were not indexed may not seem like a actually the reason I indexed it was because of all of these subtleties of how VIX have come in, but it is still pretty high. MR. GALLIN.  The amount was on the order of something like $150, $250 billion. There's you have to operationalize it, and here we have done it with a 5 percent tail.  And compared with what happened in 2008, we're not doing it at 1 percent tail or a 0.1 percent tail or wherever think that event actually is being incurred, and in this it's a fairly short course, over the financial crisis as a whole, the losses were enormous over time. large number, but you interpret it.  I didn't want that to interfere with the main idea, which is that it has come down some as things like the interpretation MR. BULLARD.  I think it's a potentially useful tool, and I want to get the clear so we know what we're looking at when we look at it.  Thank you.

Tarullo. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor you, Mr. Chairman.  I wanted to come back to the question that to Eric and David on the gap between the Committee's projections and the staff you in a bit of a difficult Committee got wrong or what is it missing as a you could reveal a bit of MR. TARULLO.  Thank Betsy addressed projections.  I have two somewhat related questions.  One puts situation.  From your point of view, what has the group?  The answer to that may be informed by the second question, if

January 24-25, 2012

more optimistic and something substantially more pessimistic.  But as were actually putting this Tealbook together, what was the nature of the actual debate, as decade and a really robust snapback that I of you actually anticipate?  And maybe the answer would help inform a gap-specifically whether your debate was really between you ended up and where we as a group ended up, or was your debate actually of a your internal deliberations.  That is, you've got, in the best Fed tradition, your projection plus something substantially you opposed to the hypothetical debate, between a lost don't get the sense many bit that first question of why the where different nature with a somewhat more pessimistic but not lost-decade-like possibility?

MR. WILCOX.  I'll have something, too.  You stab, and then I'll stab.  [Laughter]

It certainly was the case that we were wrestling with how to interpret the of the data-labor market, production, and so we were wrestling we were missing a little bit more of a stronger recovery than what we settled on was that the perception that some of the news has been was right, but we did need to see that for our forecast.  To try to illustrate that, the staff has whole bunch of data.  If you go back to writing down maybe a recession or very, very models have shown, to get to where we are at this point.  In the near general but we had to go with that.  Thinking more about the medium term, we MR. ENGEN. incoming data.  Our perception is, yes, that some even residential construction-were a little bit better than we expected, and with the question of whether we built in.  Part of what better a suite of factor models, which is a way of interpreting a October, those models were saying we should be low GDP growth.  We discounted those at the time.  We needed to see the improvement in the data, which those factor term, there are also some special factors, particularly defense spending.  That took ½ percentage point out of Q4 and another ¼ percentage point out of Q1.  That's very much off the perception radar screens,

I would say, in that are wrestling with this problem of interpreting the data.  Maybe we could be a little bit we noted, there are some big downside risks out there. would view it as unchanged, and in some ways one of the reasons is that it seems a little more plausible than it did, say, in October scenario out and think about, 'Well, okay, how reading a little bit too much. sense, we higher, even though, as with all the considerations that Eric mentioned.  Let me add a or we could have put a slightly brighter forecast on the table. MR. WILCOX.  I agree few other observations coming from the perspective of somebody who presided over the wrestling.  We struggled with a number of issues, and based on different calls, we could have put a weaker forecast on the table

plausible for us not to adjust our that we featured in the Tealbook box.  We rethought our treatment of the BEA.  In the December Tealbook the next year or two I would point to is that, at the moment, we've got a substantial tension gap in resource utilization that's implied by the output gap and the unemployment gap.  Our output gap is substantially wider than the unemployment rate gap.  We've taken that we don't measure either one perfectly.  We put most of our eggs in the On the downside, I think it would have been quite attenuation assumptions very negative news about income that we had gotten from the we told you we had attenuated our response to that.  We went back, took yet another look, and boosted our consumption spending judgmentally a couple more tenths over on the theory that Eric laid out before having to do with mismeasurement.  We are still very concerned about the potential consequences of the European situation.  I don't think we have substantial new information since the previous Tealbook, but there would be plenty of reason to draw a more negative inference about the implications of the European situation for the United States.  The third thing between the rate the view

January 24-25, 2012

If we had the unemployment rate gap coming back into line with arrived at. unemployment rate gap basket. the output gap, we'd have an unemployment rate that would be two- or three-tenths higher at the end of the projection period from what we have.  Those are some of the factors that we wrestled with that could have led to a darker outcome than the one that we

I were trying to build the case for a stronger outlook, I think I and colleagues on the staff would have built that case around the decline in the we think the preponderance of indicators at this point still counsels caution. as in the preceding three-month period.  One can look On the brighter side, if many of my unemployment rate and some encouraging signals from the labor market.  We didn't choose to go there because Eric showed the quite striking fact that employment gains over the most recent three-month period are about 150,000, exactly the same at a number of the other indicators of hiring and layoff and so forth, and we think most of those other indicators are pointing to, yes, an improvement, but one of more limited scope than is suggested by the decline in the unemployment rate.

you all differ from us.  You give us topline you all the homework.  You've got our worksheets in detail that probably I can't really inform what lies behind your thinking. Those are some of the issues that we wrestled with on the upside and the downside. Now, to be honest, I don't know why it is that aggregates.  We show you and I both find excruciating.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.

whether the other potential difference that when we do projections, we're doing them under what we view to policy prescriptions.  There is the real possibility that what you guys are assumptions-and in this case you put those assumptions in footnote 1-but MS. RASKIN.  To follow up on that, I wonder could arise from the idea be appropriate monetary doing is making what the Committee is doing is, in essence, putting together projections and then saying to

January 24-25, 2012

to affect what your numbers look like.  To some extent, the projections are projections that aren't necessarily ones that we think are going to occur, but monetary policy. ourselves, 'Well, what do we think appropriate monetary policy would be?'  Some people then may have different views as to what appropriate monetary policy is, and that appropriate monetary policy is going that we are doing ones that we think would occur under appropriate a positive statement of what your typical what we call the outcome-based rule.  So we're positing that your that particular rule and then conditioning the MR. WILCOX.  I think that's right.  You're positing a normative statement about the right monetary policy, and we're trying to drive our projection off monetary policy would be indicated by a particular rule, which is estimated off behavior in the past.  This is funds rate policy will follow the pattern dictated by rest of the forecast on that.

I think Governor Raskin's idea would have the people growth forecast having more accommodation in place relative to the outcomesee if that's true. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  But with the strong based rule.  Well, we can test that hypothesis and

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

forecast, especially if years out, but really even if you're talking one year out.  The amount of MR. BULLARD.  Yes, to follow up on this discussion, Governor Raskin is exactly right, that the exercise is somewhat different for the policymakers than it is for the staff, and I do think that's an important consideration.  There is literature on this, and you can check it out.  The other thing we have to keep in mind is how much uncertainty there is around any you're talking several uncertainty is actually usually understated around this table.  The confidence bands are gigantic. The idea that there's a lot of difference between a forecast of 2.2 versus 2.7 is not serious.  The

January 24-25, 2012

huge, and those two numbers are not very different.  That's a about this issue.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. amount of uncertainty is consideration when we're talking with President Bullard's observation entirely, and in fact, we FRB/US stochastic simulations, on page 82 of the wide.  They're quite wide for the current quarter.  We spend a lot of 'nowcasting,' which is trying to determine the initial condition. MR. WILCOX.  I agree show confidence intervals, which are based on Tealbook, and they're very time on what's called

I should add that both the faster snapback and the lost decade are confidence band, even though they have been characterized as MR. ENGEN. essentially within the 70 percent markedly different.

for.  [Laughter] [No response] CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  This wasn't the reconciliation I was hoping Any other questions?

I want to broach a question about the projections with concern is that the SEP asked you if you has no additional purchases, so that people who are quite willing to undertake further purchases if the situation was CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. participants.  In our minutes for the December meeting we said not only that we would provide quantitative information about our expectations of rates in the future, but we also said we'd provide qualitative information about balance sheet policies.  And my question was probably inadequate to elicit much information; basically we agreed with the Tealbook.  The Tealbook baseline who agree with the Tealbook could include people who would never undertake further purchases or could include people worse than the mode.

conversations around the table I'd like to suggest three short statements that I believe characterize our views, see if you are comfortable in using them as a qualitative description on this For purposes of the minutes and so on and based on many and bilaterally, and I would like to

January 24-25, 2012

The first, I think, is uncontroversial:  'There is a diversity of views on the Committee additional asset purchases.'  The 'Most participants would set a fairly on further purchases if the economy continues to improve, but are prepared to take inflation shows signs of persisting below its So I'm saying that most participants would be prepared.  It's pretty rate policy according to the I was hoping to get a little bit more substance for the Vice Chairman? subject. [laughter] about the potential efficacy and desirability of second one is perhaps more controversial.  I would say: high bar further balance sheet measures if it is judged that employment is not making sufficient progress toward our assessment of the maximum level or if mandate-consistent rate.' qualified.  And then the third one, which I think also is not so controversial, is that many people observed that the balance sheet should be linked to federal funds principles we described last June in our minutes.  I don't want to get into an extended discussion. I'm perfectly prepared to drop this, but purposes of the minutes in particular.  Reaction?

The one question I have is on the words 'fairly high going to be taken as changing where the Committee is headed?  You could use 'does not expect if the economy were to continue to improve.'  That high bar' means there's an impediment. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. bar.'  Is that different language like would be a little bit less forward leaning.  'Fairly

I think is probably more negative. MR. BERNANKE.  'Does not expect'

I'd just like us to think about that language, because further asset purchases, that we're significantly further away from that expectation, we're call for. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. right now the market basically has about a 55 percent probability of which is actually helping to keep financial conditions more accommodative.  If we say something that suggested going to essentially de facto tighten financial conditions, which I would argue our forecast doesn't

I'm not trying to change market expectations here, and if CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. it's in the minutes, of course, it will have to be approved by the Committee.

is really quite the right characterization. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would just raise a question about whether the 'fairly high bar'

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Do others have reactions?  President Lockhart.

LOCKHART.  Yes, I'm maybe on the other side of the sentence from Vice in being slightly concerned about characterizing the majority being or something that signals that there would be in the future, and that minds are not closed, but not go so far as to say MR. Chairman Dudley 'prepared.'  Could we not say 'would consider' deliberations around this 'prepared.'

I was trying to balance the 'fairly high bar.'  Forget CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Well, the first part about the bar and just say, 'Most participants would consider further purchases of the economy if employment is not making sufficient progress,' something like that?

PARTICIPANTS.  Yes.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher?

do think that's an improvement.  This goes back to the question I asked that the market is expecting further accommodation through greater expressed.  The Vice Chairman of this Committee has and some others at the table.  That was the Fed-speak I are for it or against it. MR. FISHER.  I Brian.  I think the reason asset purchases is because that's been expressed it, the Vice Chair of the Board, referred to.  These are powerful voices.  They condition markets.  I'm a little concerned we may be reading into the dealer survey or 'market expectations' hints that individuals, albeit important individuals of this Committee, have been giving the marketplace.  I think the refinement that Dennis suggests is better.  Obviously, all of us would consider whether we

January 24-25, 2012

and accurate.  I would agree with the amendment President Lockhart put It's more encompassing to the sentence.

I don't think this is fruitful to continue now, but we'll see comfortable with. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. what we can do in the minutes to get something people are

MR. EVANS.  Mr. Chairman, could we perhaps opine on that tomorrow during the policy go-round?

good point. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That would be fine.  That's a

Remember we're not here trying to come to decision, obviously.  We're just trying to Anyway, it will be an improvement if people give us a little bit better sense, we can promise to give some information about that.  Vice Chairman.

I ask David just a quick question?  Why did the asset purchases?  I'd like to understand the thought VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Can Tealbook not assume another round of process.

delicate task, as possible out of the way of guidance from the as the most neutral, bland, beige approach that we could MR. WILCOX.  Designing our monetary policy assumptions is always a which we try to undertake with some sensitivity to staying as much prejudging Committee actions, and it would probably overly dignify it to call it art, but it was our judgment that the more judicious approach was to assume, until further Committee, no further asset purchases take.

January 24-25, 2012

asset purchases. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  But saying that doesn't mean that the staff is somehow opposed to further attempted to do as a regular standard operating procedure I was discussing earlier, off the outcome-based rule and to has been our standard practice. MR. WILCOX.  What we have is to drive the funds rate trajectory, as leave existing portfolio policies in place, and that

no signal in that? VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So there is to be as signal-less as possible. MR. WILCOX.  No.  It is by design intended to try

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Fair enough.

I'd point out we did send a memo to the Committee that said you could you did, here are the effects of that on financial an addition problem that can be done that yields what MR. ENGLISH. do a $500 billion MBS purchase program, and if conditions and on the economy.  There's the effect of that would look like.

I accept that. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Yes.

an opportunity to make CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We have on the agenda comments on financial stability issues, and we have a couple of people who would like to do that.  Why don't we do that now, and then we will take a break?  President Rosengren.

That's really beginning to I liked the structure that you had in LISCC portfolio and then went to the broker-dealers. LISCC organizations that you focused on all had large I looked at exhibit 11 that we were shown today in the briefing, it was MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the financial stability very thoroughness and directness at which you address gel, and I really appreciate the effort in making that work. the very beginning, which began with a What struck me as interesting is the broker-dealers.  As

January 24-25, 2012

to note that the market equity ratios of both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were as relatively well Morgan Stanley was viewed as poorly capitalized.  Then I noted the you made that hard-to-value assets are continuing to be financed by brokerVice Chairman Dudley made that crisis, like what's happening in Europe, central banks tend to be the counterparty to a lot choose not to transact with each other, they tend to transact with the I put all of these strands together, along with what you put together for the crisis?  I'd start with asking whether you share my concern about the brokerNoting the disparity in capital between Goldman Sachs and Morgan your concern is that organizations aren't going to want to transact with them and could make, altering their liability structure. you think would be right and what more we could organizations having credit default swaps as are. interesting quite low, but in the previous CCAR exercise Goldman Sachs was viewed capitalized, whereas observation that dealers with short-term financing.  And the observation that during a of organizations-that they central banks.  As broker-dealers, the question that I came up with is:  Is the broker-dealer model sustainable if we have a European dealer model being sustainable in a crisis.  What was not in the report was how we could mitigate those concerns. Stanley, if they're highly dependent on overnight financing, then it would be something like altering the repo market, altering what kinds of investments they If you could give me more of a sense of what do, because it is troubling to have such important high as they

They aren't the only are a lot of non-2a-7 funds and other cash pools that we are just starting to try to There is a little less trading activity; we don't know how much there think that very much is ways to address that.  There are issues about the triparty market and the repo market.  Are there ways to make that somewhat safer? but are there other ways to address some of the funding problems in short-term markets? money funds are a big part of that.  They are a big source.  There understand.  Those are long-term policy initiatives-money funds, triparty.

Currently, because many of conversations up front about how one reassuring to say here, except longOn crisis management, which is more near-term if ongoing discussions with supervisors in other countries about how one does recovery or resolution for these types of institutions if stresses them operate cross-border and their funds in good times tend to flow between the different entities, everything is fine.  The concern is if stresses rise and the home-country supervisor wants liquidity there, then it starts to get dispersed.  Having those would address that is ongoing.  I don't have anything terribly term reform and some attention to possible crisis management issues.

staff hit the report.  I thought it was really good in terms of what you going to add a few thoughts of my own.  Let me just start with the U.S. financial I think the good news is that firms have more capital-the securities firms have cleaned stuff that is really difficult to hedge.  A good example of that is Morgan Stanley, very difficult for them to manage.  The bad rightly gets at, is that there are questions about the business model, and that is are depressed.  The story is quite different if you look you look at the trajectory over the past few years relative to market value. business model are a very big factor there. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I thought the right notes on the financial stability covered.  I am institution issue. bigger liquidity buffers, and they have cleaner balance sheets in the sense that they have up some of the which closed out its MBIA positions, which were news, as Nellie why the market values of these companies at book capital, as The questions about the good lender-ofthe funding can run so easily.  The firms going to actually get you the funding, and there is no lender of last resort for these We can provide 13(3) facilities, but only in extremis.  The bar to that is extremely high, be firm-specific.  And then, second, when you look it is not obvious how they would get their the U.K. broker-dealer affiliates of Morgan Stanley But the other thing that is very significant here is that there is no really last-resort backstop for these firms, and that is why have enough collateral to reasonably pledge and gain funding, if people are willing to be their counterparties.  But as we saw in 2008 into 2009, just having sufficient collateral isn't necessarily entities. they have to be broad based, and they can't at their foreign operations, there are places where liquidity.  For example, it is not clear where and Goldman Sachs would get funding.  The absence of lender-of-last-resort backstop makes it easier for the run to occur because people have uncertainty about what would they do if they

January 24-25, 2012

funding from me, then maybe they are I should run.  I think that is a fundamental problem in the regime.  It's not is just a question that the financial system has evolved pretty these entities, which were de minimis in 1970 regime, apparatus, and the central bank and lender of last resort have not really kept up really do have something serious that we have to think about.  Either we we have to wrestle with years. couldn't get funding from me.  Well, if they couldn't get in trouble, so maybe the firm's fault per se.  It dramatically over the past 20 or 30 years, so that in terms of their size and importance, are now quite substantial.  And yet the financial the regulatory with that evolution.  We decide that we want to remedy this, or we decide that these firms don't have significant social value, and that, therefore, they need to shrink.  This is something that over the next couple of pleasantly surprised-that might be the right word-by how I don't think we are heading down very rapidly in Europe, and then all of a sudden there is a months of improvement, and then we go back on another leg down.  I don't think we are out I would highlight there that have me program with Greece is successful-in other words, they get the debt trajectory.  There is also a question that their needs are going to be are willing to provide.  That seems to at about 14 percent, plus or minus a little In terms of Europe, I am powerful the three-year, long-term financing operations have proven to be.  But should take too much comfort from that, because we have had these periods in the past where things look like they policy response, and then people say, 'Oh, good, the resources are coming.'  Then we have a few of the woods by any stretch.  A couple of things that worried.  Even if the PSI exchange and there is no trigger of the credit default swaps-it is not obvious to me that Greece is on a sustainable greater than what the IMF and Europe have said that they be a big risk.  Portugal seems to have been forgotten, although Trevor did mention it in his comments.  Ten-year sovereigns in Portugal are trading

And they are supposed to return to the public markets in I would stress about markets, and that is the comment I made That really raises questions about, how do we go back to the process where access to is restored.  The exit in Europe is not at all obvious.  And then, finally, there is meet their fiscal targets, and the most obvious that fiscal austerity may lead to economic underperformance, which then course, the problem is that at some point the I am glad about that.  I feel like the downside risks to the U.S. outlook bit-that is not a 2013.  It is not obvious at all how that is going to happen.  The other thing Europe is that public support has replaced private earlier. private markets the risk that the countries will continue to not reason for that is requires further fiscal austerity measures.  And, of political process may fail to support those additional rounds of fiscal austerity that are needed.  It is a little bit better, and have diminished slightly.  But we have seen this movie before, and so I am not convinced at this point.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota.

Vice Draghi took over as the head of the ECB, there was a lot of uncertainty to play.  Do you think formed a view that maybe he is willing to play a more active role than they might a little more MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, Mr. Chairman.  I had a quick question for Chairman Dudley.  When about how he would view the crisis, what kind of role he wanted the ECB markets have have thought in November?  And that might be part of the reason for things being quiet?

you my view, and the Chairman and way.  In fact, if you look at the numbers in terms of the amount of VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I will just give Governor Yellen might have other views that they want to express.  My view is that he has been very mindful of not going over into the fiscal space by having the ECB expand their bond purchase program in any

can do and what is clearly within the province of the ECB as providing liquidity at term against a broadened collateral set.  And he has been more government bonds purchased by the ECB, they have actually been pretty small.  He has escalated in the dimension of what central banks as far aggressive in broadening what a normal central bank could reasonably say, 'This is my province. I'm not stepping out into the fiscal space.'

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Great.

I'm not sure about the fiscal part.  He is playing a careful very hawkish fiscally, and I think the purpose of that is to give CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. game.  He has actually been comfort to the Germans in particular, in the hopes that they will, given these reassurances, be more forthcoming themselves.  It is a complicated game.

At least verbally he has been quite hawkish on the fiscal side. I meant that he wasn't actually doing things by the has certainly spoken about fiscal policy quite a MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Well, ECB that could be construed as fiscal policy.  He bit.

The Tealbook is little changed from last time and is forecasting substantial shortfalls on both elements of the mandate.  At the 2013, the unemployment forecast is virtually identical to that of the Tealbook, with PCE inflation of 1.4 percent

at the end of 2013, albeit with an easier monetary policy mainstream forecasters share that outlook. Goldman Sachs all expect similar large misses on Despite the high degree of uncertainty, there is surprising agreement that over the next unemployment rate of 8.1 percent assumption for appropriate policy.  In fact, most other Macroeconomic Advisers, J.P. Morgan, and both elements of the mandate.  Even the four DSGE models predict 2013 inflation at 1.2 percent or less. two years, we will fall short of both elements of our mandate.

Small business hiring and investment have also been laggards in this recovery.  While recently there have been increases in bank lending to large businesses, small business lending remains stagnant.

For example, over the past month, there has been a substantial decline in freight rates for ships that deliver bulk goods such as grain, as well as the Baltic Dry provides a measure of bulk-shipping freight rates for ships of various sizes over the major shipping routes.  Freight course, these rates harbinger of forecast.  Of all of these to me what will pull Europe out of its recession.  Europe is more bank-dependent than the United States, and we may be underestimating the likely recession, as unemployment rates in much of southern Europe.  While there is little we can do to directly influence European outcomes, encouraging stronger

I'm more optimistic than the Tealbook, but then again, the Tealbook appears to be somewhat of continue to expect the economy to grow

I'm more optimistic about labor markets as well. unemployment 8 percent by the further accommodation hinges a great deal, I think, on the confidence we I mentioned, the Tealbook forecast is below the central tendency of the generally somewhat more negative than most private-sector forecasts.  I must confess, entirely convinced of where the pessimism comes from, but that's what it is.  I think we error band around our forecast and around our well, as we were discussing earlier today.  Indeed, the data provided by root mean squared errors of forecasts are strikingly large, especially in growth three years out is about 1.8 percentage Board staff's forecast, the historical average root growth and 1.4 percentage points for These are substantial degrees of uncertainty and reflect our inability to really want to signal in our statement that policy is years, given such wide confidence bands associated forecast, and we need to be from pretty We are operating with a great deal of uncertainty, particularly on our farGiven the attention paid to our calendar dates in our statements, the entirely clear that the markets or members of the The case for have in our forecast.  As SEP and I'm not all have to acknowledge that there is quite a large long-term projections as the staff on the historical the third year of our forecast horizon.  For example, the historical average root mean squared error on the unemployment rate and real GDP points.  And for two years out, at least for the mean squared error is about 1.6 percentage points for GDP the unemployment rate. forecast in the intermediate term.  Do we likely to remain on hold for another three with our forecast?  I think we need more humility when we particularly careful about relying on point forecasts that are largely indistinguishable wide ranges of views. out forecasts.  Thus, I'm very wary of phrasing our policy statements based on economic forecasts three years out. focus on them suggests to me that it's not

January 24-25, 2012

conditional and how conditional they might be.  It's much putting dates into the statement.  I think the value of our SEP exercise is going increase over time as we monitor them and the public begins to changes.  That's a better way to give the public understand that these are really preferable that we allow the SEP to do the job and reflect where the sense of the Committee is on our forecasts, rather than on projections of policy see that those projections change as the economy forward guidance-and perhaps less confusing.

that both year and over the rest of the goal will need to commence policy tightening this unemployment rates are falling and inflation is above our goal.  We until the unemployment rate reaches 7 percent before we begin to move from the zero bound is similarly very risky.  I don't take much comfort in saying rate is a backward-looking indicator and our forecasts for medium-term inflation over time and are not very accurate.  Given the uncertainties around our if we prove ourselves wrong, The recent deceleration in inflation is welcome news, and I'm anticipating headline and core inflation will pull back toward 2 percent this forecast horizon.  But my forecast is predicated on somewhat tighter monetary policy than the Tealbook's.  In my view, to keep inflation expectations well anchored and inflation near our over the medium to longer term, the Committee year.  In particular, it concerns me that we continue to seek ways to expand the degree of accommodation even as have already reached a point, in my view, where we have taken substantial risks of higher inflation in the medium term.  With unemployment beginning to head down, I see little reason for doubling down on further increased accommodation.  Even if we don't have further accommodation, waiting the funds rate that we'll follow such a strategy only if our inflation forecast stays near 2 percent, since the unemployment change only very slowly forecast, we run the risk of having to reverse course very abruptly; and that would be very destabilizing.

But importantly, they're telling us they pass these on-that their improving sales.  My trajectory for unemployment in my forecast also departs from that of the Tealbook.  The Tealbook has the unemployment rate in 2014 at 7.8 percent, having been raised ½ point from the staff's end 2014.  As regards the balance of risks, it's pretty clear that Atlanta's forecast is more upbeat than the Tealbook's, and the anecdotal input we're getting is consistent with that. about the balance of risks for because of the still-looming big, exogenous risks-Europe and others-beyond our could throttle the economy and kill momentum.

Reports from the Fifth Federal Reserve District since our last meeting suggest improvement and are continued growth at a moderate pace.

We did see negative readings in many retail sales revenue index was up from 4 to 24.  Residential real estate activity remains pretty weak in our District.  As distressed sales, we're told.  This is understandable.

I don't see that in the take a little glow off of December's data, and I wanted to mention that, in case President Pianalto would like to comment on that or President Lockhart might wish to add something to it later.

So as the

Our growth rate for potential share the same story line.  While there has been some modest increase in underlying momentum, we are not talking might be on the optimistic side.

January 24-25, 2012

I say this might be optimistic?  Well, there are three things that I'd like to point first about most current forecasts for the United States-that is, about the conventional complacent about the outlook.  On two previous occasions over the past two and years, we expected that the recovery would gain momentum, and both times we were Well, to use some golf-speak, I think we've used up our mulligans.  I can't imagine we're wrong a third time on this one.  We should not ignore the and economic growth during this stop-and-go recovery, especially when of rising inflation risks. Why do out wisdom outlook.  First, it's natural when we begin to see some lift in the incoming data that we also tend to get a half disappointed, as growth weakened in 2010 and again in 2011.  Of course, even once we had realized the weakness, we waited for a time to see if the momentum would return before taking any action. receiving dispensation if inadequate demand inadequate demand is combined with the absence reasonable upper tolerance range objective, this argues for balance and having more monetary insurance want to make.  Tealbook A, analyzes a relatively large number of alternative risk scenarios that reported is for 2015 through 2016 at 2.3 percent PCE inflation.  That's 'Greater Supply-Side Damage' scenario; 2.3 percent-that's just not a very large number term structure models imply that three years from now, the years, three years With our inflation projections not even close to any relative to our 2 percent in place, in my opinion.  This lack of inflation risk is the second point about current forecasts that I the economy is facing.  In the table on page 80, 'Alternative Scenarios,' the highest and most worrisome inflation rate in the relative to our 2 percent inflation objective.  Financial markets also don't see much inflation risk. For instance, our Chicago affine three-year-ahead PCE inflation outlook is only 1.4 percent.  So that's three ahead, 1.4 percent-and that's just a straight reading from the forward curves.  With resource

The short-run Tealbook-consistent measure of the higher at minus Furthermore, the optimal policy simulations of FRB/US show that to achieve our funds rate of about minus only at minus 1.6 percent.  In those analyses, policy is too restrictive. I look, economic analysis using our workhorse models tells me that our policies and worries over unobservable and undocumented inflation accommodation, and comments about the inability to forecast economic growth and like that are true, writ large for inflation-we're not very good at forecasting that.  How to which uncertainty you care about most depends a lot on how you risks.  It's difficult for me to understand how this can be compelling, and we need more This brings me to my third point.  The Tealbook analyses that report on equilibrium real interest rates indicate that policy is not adequately accommodative.  The staff analyses, it seems to me, are begging equilibrium real interest rate is minus 3.2 percent, and the actual real rate is 1.6 percent. dual-mandate objectives, we should want to achieve a short-term real 5 percent.  Again, we're Everywhere remain too restrictive.

This kind of evidence suggests that labor markets have almost normalized in Minnesota.  Yet the employment-to-population ratio in Minnesota remains markedly below its and the payroll employment level is even more suppressed.

President Bullard was channeling President now going to channel President Bullard because I'm sitting where he usually sits.  I I was disappointed in that remarks is that full use of our tools today risk that we could end up in a outcome.  We talk a lot about keeping inflation expectations anchored, at 2 percent.  But that anchoring doesn't just come from statements and comes from the public's beliefs about our willingness and ability to act to defend anchor.  Thus, if the public believes that if inflation or inflation expectations were believes that we will take effective actions' means that we will never and are a credible backstop that keeps inflation expectations from drifting At this stage, I'm Fisher; I'm was waiting for President Evans to channel me [laughter], but expectation.  The message of the remainder of my could jeopardize the stabilization capabilities of future FOMCs, and my remarks will emphasize a risk that President Bullard has stressed in earlier meetings-the self-fulfilling deflationary and our consensus policy statement is going to talk about our desire to keep longer-term expectations anchored from talk.  It that 2 percent ever to start to drift upward, then the FOMC would raise interest rates and thereby bring inflation back down-'the public see upward drift in inflation expectations, and so we will never have to act.  Our willingness ability to raise rates

I'd emphasize what we usually emphasize:  our commitment to keep inflation up.  But of course, the same is true on the downward side.  The public 2 percent and keeps them from falling below that.  But this last logic hinges on the FOMC ability to add a sufficient amount of monetary accommodation.  Suppose we bought of the assets that we can buy and that we've already promised to keep interest rates for a relatively long period of time.  At that point, we have little extra and nothing more. upward.  So here expectations from going believes that if inflation expectations start to drift downward, then the FOMC would cut interest rates and bring inflation back up.  And it is this belief that keeps inflation expectations anchored at having the nearly all extraordinarily low accommodation with which to fight off a downward drift in inflation expectations.  We are now supporting our 2 percent anchor with talk alone downward drift in inflation expectations is inevitable.  We're a bank without deposit insurance.  Such a bank a run, but it's susceptible to a run, especially in conjunction with adverse we've nearly maxed out on accommodation.

In the same way, the country open to a downward drift in inflation expectations, especially in conjunction with an adverse shock of some kind.  Now, a downward drift in inflation expectations would be unlikely to continue forever.  There's a self-fulfilling outcome, and this is what President Bullard is emphasizing in his perpetually maxed out in terms of accommodation and inflationary expectations stay constant at an undesirably low level. terms of accommodation, monetary policy is no longer a viable tool in terms of macroeconomic stabilization, and the country is left more susceptible to macroeconomic shocks.  To sum up, if we choose to get close to maximum accommodation in the coming

Regrettably, few of my European contacts assigned high odds to such an optimistic scenario.

And as they both noted, in both instances there proved to be transitory reasons for those short-lived bursts.  So the question now, of course, is whether the recent burst of moderately favorable data portends a more durable trend in this direction.  One point in favor of that interpretation is that in the past, there was a pretty close correlation between those bursts of activity and the maximum effects of either case right now. there this relevant of these for me continues to be that we're the problems peculiar to a serious recession induced by President Williams great condition geopolitical, I do year we could be getting closer to the point at which we There are several relevant indicators, some of which were discussed in the introductory me that needs to be crises, as surveyed by Rogoff and Reinhart, would have suggested that the a year or 15 to 18 months ago were misplaced, end of this year or the beginning of next year would fit much more However, I want to add to that a second point, which is that with the very of the absence of negative shocks whose origins are essentially political or think it's possible that by the end of this pull out of the mud and onto a reasonably dry stretch of pavement for a more extended period of time. session this morning.  But like many people, I continue to think the most important factor in determining this point would be the reality and, importantly, the perception that housing prices have bottomed.  This was the essential asset bubble; the bursting of that bubble was the essential problem that led to the domino-like effects in the markets, and it seems to repaired before we're going to be in a durable recovery.  While the experience of developed nations after banking relatively optimistic predictions about housing of improvement toward the

About three-fourths of the people reasons are incumbents in jobs whose hours have looked for work and found an existing part-time position.  The number of such people is still well over over the last six months.  But what's most striking about this population of the employed part time U-1 to U-6 shows us that the gap between the various measures of unemployment has proportionately roughly the same in the nearly 20 years since the U-5 and U-6 data series were begun, except for the relationship of U-6 to the rest of the indicators since this recession began.

One person observed that output gaps inflation, and that inflation expectations are also very important in thinking about inflation and policy formation.

Another point made was a deflation, excessive use of policy one person pointed out that the economy is still in such a deep hole, with the total number before the recession, that precise forecasts several necessary in order to see go-round.  I'd be happy to take any comments. Those are some observations from the President Lacker.

Let me make a few comments of my own.  Like most others, I see modest, near-trend economic growth over the next year, discuss this more tomorrow-that it concerns from the same side, so to speak.  I think that given our agreement today on a policy objective, we

also like to comment on the difficulties of forecasting that a couple of people talked exercise, it seems inevitable to try to set up at least a provisional scenario or on which to base the policy decision and then obviously to adjust as new information outcomes for demand and for the broader economy and so on.  Although certainly will often miss, they really have no alternative but to make a forecast and do the they can and try to tie their decisions to that forecast. I'd about.  No one doubts that forecasting is difficult, but in order to make policy, which is a forward-looking forecast comes in.  President Fisher talked about the difficulty corporations have in forecasting earnings. But corporations sometimes undertake 10- or 20-year capital projects, and inevitably they have to think about the likely they best good data in the employment area, in sentiment, and in I think there's some signal in those about the economy, as there is in the you look at the composition of demand in the fourth quarter of the increase in final demand in Q4 was actually weaker than in Q3.  The goods Let me return to the outlook.  Like others, I noted the positive developments in the intermeeting period, including some housing.  I don't think we should ignore the fact that equity prices rose considerably and volatility declined. increase in Treasury rates.  However, I do think it's important that we not over-extrapolate from the fourth quarter of 2011.  If 2011, you see that inventory build, according to the Tealbook, accounted for about 1½ percentage points of the increase in real GDP in Q4, and another percentage point came from the fact that durable spending, notably in automobiles, rose at an annual rate of 15 percent in the fourth quarter, which is certainly not sustainable.  On the other hand, fiscal spending was unusually weak in the fourth quarter, but overall, the growth in final private demand was not particularly impressive.

January 24-25, 2012

overall slowing should going forward. And if final demand continues at that rate, then we should see a more moderate pace of economic growth going forward, and, in particular, fiscal policy and global continue to exert drags on economic growth near-term context.  I would just note that going to feed back into going to reduce the willingness of firms to invest and going to reduce the willingness of consumers to spend.  So the potential weakness economy has its implications for demand and near-term growth as well. news was good in the fourth quarter-not I don't think that at this point we've seen enough strength to stronger economic growth in the near term.

Last time, I talked about the problems of reconciling has been moderately good consumption spending with very weak income growth.  On the rates have come down, continued strength in household spending because, obviously, barring Now, of course, as we try will be central.  It is, after all, the largest component of spending, and the household sector is obviously the key to the what surface, the fact that income growth has been so weak, and that saving would bode poorly for substantial increases in asset values, which we haven't seen, the lower saving rate can't be maintained indefinitely.

found the Tealbook box on the shortfalls of income very I'm going to actually reinforce the point that staff had anticipated at the beginning of the year or maybe the middle of the year, but if Like Governor Duke, I also interesting, and in talking about that for a moment, forecasting is difficult.  The Tealbook estimated that income in 2011 was $120 billion below what the

January 24-25, 2012

dividends, and about one-third of it was in On the dividend side, first, it's in a way very puzzling that dividends are so weak, good.  Two conclusions are possible.  One is that that firms are just conservative and that ratios will come back up and we'll see those dividends flowing out in reflected in capital gains and stock prices.  The other we know that dividends and an area that can be highly volatile quarter to quarter, and revisions are large. it's hard to draw conclusions.  The other major category of shortfall was in transfers, and I asked staff members about this, they reported to me that half of that shortfall was in being paid to the states.  But it's very puzzling that Medicaid given that in current economic more people to need Medicaid.  So, again, interpreting this, there are two costs have been kept down through better efficiency, for example, in be matched one for one in reduced consumer's market is the same but families are required to bear a significant impact of that reduction on you decompose that shortfall, only $27 billion of it was in compensation.  About one-third of the total shortfall was in dividends and interest, mostly transfers. given that profits have been exceptionally payout ratios have dropped significantly, in which case it's certainly possible being the future; to the extent not, then they'll be possibility, though, is that the measurement is just inadequate; interest constitute The tax data that are used to construct this are not available in real time, and so that's one area where when Medicaid.  Now, Medicaid, unlike dividends and interest, is very easy to measure in real time because we see the money payments would be so much lower than anticipated, particularly conditions, we'd expect possibilities.  One is that which case the income reductions for transfers will probably consumption of health-care spending.  But the implications for the rest of the basket should be pretty small.  The alternative is that the Medicaid shortfall comes from cost shifting, where the total spending on medical cost more of it.  In that case, you would expect to see spending.

at consumer spending.  There are many are poorly measured.  So I have to concede-and I think it's don't know why the saving rate has fallen or if indeed it has fallen. a lot of uncertainty about this.  All that said, as we look at the fundamentals that we have we take all of those together, what is most likely is a moderate path of expansion going forward. And of course, I can do the same thing in looking components, like services, that inevitable-that we really There's more confidence in-such as asset prices, sentiment, gas prices, and the labor market-I think overall, when in consumption, but that will be a critical issue that we have to follow

LTRO.  It does appear to be affecting sovereign debt.  The point made by the staff is that the declines in yields of sovereign debtors have been most years, and that's helped market confidence.  But I addressed.  Greece and Portugal remain very far from being able to return to the unlikely that Greece can avoid some kind of default, even if it's will be insufficient to protect all of the countries that might come under Greece, or Greece and Portugal, fail to make their payments.  More fundamentally contradiction that in order to address the fiscal deficits austerity.  But austerity combined with money that is a still tight, and with deleveraging in the banking system is a recipe for very all the more difficult.  Like Governor Yellen, I've commentary from our European colleagues.  It is a very worrisome type of environment, hoping that There was a lot of discussion around the table on Europe and the benefits of the threeyear there is some evidence that pronounced in the maturities of less than three think it's widely appreciated-it's not just a technical point-that the fundamentals have not really been market, and it seems very disguised in some way.  If that happens, then the concern is that the firewalls that have been set up by Europe so far pressure if than that, of course, you have the basic and the current account deficits, you have little bit easier, but slow growth, which in turn makes the austerity heard much of the same situation.  At this point, they're in a kind of extend-and-pretend

can help get through this difficult period, but it's far from being obvious.  So, like have to continue to follow. ECB liquidity others, I think this is a very important issue we'll couple of words on inflation.  Staff members get very good can be done; their prediction that pass-through into goods and services would be reversed seems to be coming true.  Prices of have come back down.  Apparel prices have stabilized.  The data I've 2 percent, but I certainly reasons President Pianalto discussed, the potential for rent increases is there.  The basic facts, though, are that commodity prices seem very tame.  They're also food at home, for an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the last three months.  Inflation ranges.  So again, I think that if we look at the we have to monitor all dimensions of the economy and of our at this stage. And then, finally, just a marks here.  They showed that forecasting non-commodity core autos and other durables seen suggest that OER seems to have been stabilizing lately close to concede that, for the certainly down about 10 percent since July.  Not only has energy fallen a lot, but example, has risen at expectations remain at the low end of historical risks we're facing, while objectives, inflation risks seem relatively low

policy sure to get that done get all the material together in time for the press conference tomorrow you have any changes to your projections and you can possibly get those in this if we have to do that in a very short period.  I a highly productive day.  There's a reception and dinner available. Those are some observations.  Tomorrow we'll want to draw the monetary conclusions.  We are slated for an 8:30 a.m. start tomorrow because we need to wrap up our deliberations by 11:30.  I think we can certainly do that, but we want to be because we have to afternoon.  If evening, it would be very helpful.  We now have a whole bunch of figures that we have to revise, and clearly, the chance of a mistake is increased thank you for

reminding you that deep that we don't have responses to them yet.  In particular, the first look further into how we might adjust our measures of the federal funds rate to and other policies; the second was to analyze the implications of optimal policy simulations for policy rules implications of simpler Taylor-type rules, for example; and the third was to look further transmission mechanism.  We will have discussed this, of course, a more, quantitatively, about the extent to which the transmission changed by the effects of the crisis?  Bill English has you that the staff is working hard, and we will be providing you with CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good morning, everybody.  I'll start by at the last meeting, President Kocherlakota raised some interesting questions for the staff to look at.  They were sufficiently question was to take into account the effects of asset purchases further the differences between and the into the monetary policy great deal, but can we say mechanism might be impaired or authorized me to tell memoranda on these subjects over the next couple of meetings, but these are obviously important issues for us to consider.

That packet contains the we distributed Monday is incorporated here. MR. ENGLISH. 6   Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll be referring to the material that was distributed.  It should be in front policy alternatives as well as the associated draft directives.  The one-word change in the language that

has been you see only economic growth over coming quarters, with the unemployment rate even more slowly than you anticipated at the time of the November SEP. you mentioned yesterday, there are significant downside suggest that most of you see inflation as likely to be Turning first to alternative B, on page 4, the Committee may view the economic information received since the last meeting as indicating that the economy expanding moderately.  However, your SEP submissions suggest that modest declining Moreover, as a number of risks to the economic outlook related to the problems in Europe.  With regard to inflation, the SEP results

Against this backdrop, you may wish to ease financial conditions further by providing forward guidance that pushes out the expected date of the liftoff of the federal funds regarding the level of the federal funds rate.

In particular, the statement says the economy 'has been and recognizes some 'further' improvement in the labor 'moderated.' The first paragraph of the statement under alternative B is updated to reflect the incoming economic data. expanding moderately,' market, but states that the unemployment rate 'remains elevated.'  The paragraph also updates the characterization of inflation, describing it as having been 'subdued in recent months' rather than having

'only slow progress' toward its coming quarters.  The Moreover, members may be concerned that there is no The second paragraph indicates that the Committee expects 'modest' economic growth over coming quarters and anticipates employment objective.  The statement would also note that inflation is expected to run at or below levels consistent with the dual mandate over last sentence of paragraph 2, which emphasizes the Committee's intention to monitor inflation and inflation expectations closely, is shown in brackets.  This sentence was adopted when inflation was elevated and upside risks to inflation were a particular concern.  With inflation having fallen back, the Committee may now think the sentence is unnecessary. analogous sentence pointing to the Committee's concerns about the elevated unemployment rate.

B offers two options on forward guidance.  The exceptionally low levels of the with the median SEP projection of 2014, but with the target federal year. In paragraphs 3 and 3′, alternative simpler version, shown in paragraph 3′, starts by indicating that the Committee expects to maintain a highly accommodative stance for monetary policy.  It goes on to update the forward guidance the Committee has used since August, stating that members expect economic conditions to warrant federal funds rate 'at least through late 2014,' rather than 'at least through mid-2013.'  The revised date would be consistent the Committee members, which was for liftoff in funds rate still quite low at the end of the regarding the the current very low level of the would provide increased clarity to the public regarding the Specifically, paragraph 3 begins by indicating that the accommodative' stance for policy and within its current low range 'at least as long as the unemployment rate The more detailed version, in paragraph 3, provides guidance economic conditions that would warrant retaining funds rate.  You may feel that adding to the statement an indication of the Committee's collective judgment regarding potential policy thresholds and the possible timing of liftoff Committee's intentions. Committee 'intends' to maintain a 'highly then goes on to state that the Committee anticipates that it will be appropriate to keep the funds rate exceeds 7 percent, the inflation rate . . . at a horizon of one to two years is projected to be either below or close to 2 percent, and longer-term inflation expectations

It then notes that the Committee expects these continue to be well anchored.' conditions to prevail 'at least through late 2014.'

at 2 percent, the Committee would signal that projected inflation By setting the threshold for inflation as a projection that is 'close' to 2 percent, rather than precisely a bit above 2 percent would not necessarily lead to an increase in the funds rate, particularly if the unemployment rate were still elevated and inflation expectations well anchored.

could be an appropriate benchmark.  First, some simple rules imply a rate of 2 percent, an inflation rate equal to about 7 percent. rate in the Committee member sees the unemployment rate close to fourth quarter of the year of liftoff. For the unemployment threshold, a number of considerations suggest that 7 percent threshold of roughly this value.  For example, a Taylor (1999) rule, with an assumed value of the equilibrium real federal funds the Committee's objective, an equilibrium unemployment rate of 5½ percent, and an Okun's law constant of 2.5 yields an unemployment rate at liftoff of Second, 7 percent would be a conservative threshold for the unemployment Tealbook's constrained optimal control simulation, which suggests that the first increase in the federal funds rate should come in the first half of 2016, when the unemployment rate would be below 6 percent.  Finally, your SEP contributions suggest that the median 7 percent in the

These market a little larger if investors also delayed their expected timing for the a little further, and so have somewhat larger Market participants see significant odds that the Committee will raise the funds rate by the middle of 2014, and so specifying a date of 'at least through late 2014' would likely push out somewhat expectations for funds rate.  Longer-term interest rates would likely rise some, and the foreign exchange value of the effects might be normalization of the balance sheet, thereby putting a little additional downward pressure on term premiums.  The inclusion of the threshold language would likely push back the expected date of liftoff effects on asset prices.

you augment the stronger forward guidance B with a new asset purchase program.  You might view this as your 2 percent objective. Alternative A, on page 2, would have in alternative appropriate in light of SEP projections showing the unemployment rate still well above its longer-run normal rate in the fourth quarter of 2014, and inflation generally at or below alternative A would be quite similar to B, although paragraph 2 includes the option of indicating that The first and second paragraphs under those under alternative

for Bill?  President CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Questions Lacker.

LACKER.  Bill, first, have any participants altered their economic projections? Changed their SEP contributions, you mean? LACKER.  Right. MR. MR. ENGLISH.  For this round? MR.

MR. ENGLISH.

There were a couple of changes on Monday.

got? MR. LACKER.  So that was in the packet we

Yes. MR. ENGLISH.

I said yesterday, that seven an unemployment rate above 7 percent.  You cited a median figure.  I wasn't quite sure MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Great.  The packet shows, as participants have a federal funds rate above 13 basis points-but the lowest is 50 basis pointsand have what that median was.

It's the median for the Committee members.  Which sentence? MR. ENGLISH.

I MR. LACKER.  You cited something, a median involving 7 percent unemployment. wasn't quite sure I caught what it was.

Yes.  The median unemployment rate for the year of liftoff varies you're talking about.  It is either 6.9 percent for voters or MR. ENGLISH. depending on which set of participants 7.1 percent for all participants-so, about 7.

LACKER. The big question I have has to do with these words 'currently B(3). MR. anticipates' in

January 24-25, 2012

to be clear, the package of SEP results that you got all of the new results.  The package that was distributed on Monday evening. MR. ENGLISH.  Okay.  Just yesterday on the table has didn't have one of the changes that was made Monday got a packet on Tuesday morning.  Is that the same packet referring? MR. LACKER.  Well, I distributed Monday afternoon to which you're

MR. LUECKE.  Yes.

we could get that updated.  The big Paragraph B(3) has the condition that 'this the federal funds rate will be appropriate' as long as three conditions So the word will be exceptionally low under those three conditions. yet this forward guidance language is widely interpreted as a commitment by the said the Fed is committed to keeping interest rates low 'anticipates' language is used with regard to the you view this as a commitment-that we're saying that we're going to behave in a way that would be other than what we'd want to do then, or is this merely a MR. LACKER.  Okay.  Great.  Maybe sometime question has to do with 'currently anticipated.' exceptionally low range for are met, and the sentence says that the Committee 'currently anticipates.' 'currently' there suggests that at some future time, given future data, it could be the case that we no longer anticipate that interest rates And Committee.  Today's Wall Street Journal until at least mid-2013, and the same sort of year-'Committee expects'-right?  So I'm just wondering.  You helped draft this language. Do in some circumstances forecast of our future behavior?

was primarily a forecast of future behavior, your you'd be you'd put out there.  But for the most part, this is, as it says, the MR. ENGLISH.  I would have said it expectations today, but it may have a very small element of commitment because hesitant to change something Committee's current anticipation.

January 24-25, 2012

Lacker, if I could just interject.  If we do accept forward guidance languages, I will be making clear in the press I think there is a little bit of a difference between the 7 percent language and contingent on changes in that is contingent on economic outcomes should be a little bit more permanent because or later date.  It's also a threshold, not a trigger, and so there's flexibility but I even in that case think one reason to play down the commitment language is these decisions.  I know that a number of rules, et cetera, but we can't entirely mechanize.  There may be other CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President either of these kinds of conference opening statement that it's not intended to be a commitment, that it's entirely conditional.  Now, the simple date language.  The simple date language is obviously very the outlook, and we reflect it in changes in the SEP projections from quarter to quarter.  The language it's more about our reaction function than it is about the state of the economy.  It could accommodate an earlier in that respect, that we all recognize that we can't entirely mechanize people are interested in considerations that would be relevant, and so for that reason, we have to leave ourselves flexibility.

I think that the date in August had an effect on expectations.  It was read as meaning that perhaps really did have a slightly different reaction function than had been In particular, it's amount.  So I don't think that it would be read as immutable.  It would be read as subject to revision as the data change. MR. ENGLISH.  One other thing that might be worth saying is that language that was added the Committee thought.  But since then, as data have come in, that date has moved around. moved back a fair correctly interpretation is that in August, the market reaction was that it our reaction function, but subsequently the reaction to data surely MR. LACKER.  So your learned something about

January 24-25, 2012

future evolution of the data is going to be different given our reaction you interpret movements since August? reflects a sense that the function?  Is that how

Just on that point, I think there happened in August, which is that there was tremendous market turmoil at that time.  There was the July 29 GDP report, which marked down the interpretation is that that's what pushed out market expectations of our didn't have much to do with whether we put '2013' in the language or not.

January 24-25, 2012

I'm saying that the data were very volatile around the August meeting. MR. BULLARD.  Well, you're saying that sometimes what the Committee says moves the market, and then other times, the market is moving the date of liftoff independently because of changes to the data.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?

future economic data as much as it conveyed information about our We don't know a signal from our read about the economy-gloomier than they thought way of teasing that out? MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up on that?  This other hypothesis about August is that it conveyed our sense of reaction function, and the same thing plagued interpreting March 2009, right? whether they're taking we'd read the economy-or it's the reaction function.  Do you have a we said we think conditions will be such that low rates will be justified.  So both about our expectations of economic conditions and about our CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It doesn't matter.  They're both in there.  When we said 'extended period,' that's saying something reaction to those conditions.

I just want to Fisher. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  We'll continue with questions, but make sure everybody will have a chance, of course, to comment on the whole situation here. Two-handers?  President

January 24-25, 2012

about what we ascribe any market Bill's paper pretty carefully, and by the I really appreciate it.  You talk about the number of basis of 1 percent.  Now, the shorter you are on the that you wouldn't have a market impact.  I think President Bullard's good, and President Lacker raised a very good point.  It's not clear what you can the effect over the longer term.  I do believe we have done it alone.  It's happened in circumstances But I think we have to be extremely careful. an event occurring, but ascribing it to what is said at this table, particularly reading too much into the data.  The data are helpful, but at least for moves the market, and credit for immediate reaction.  It's what we do on a sustained basis over I do believe we send signals to the market, clearly, that we expect to any tightening of policy for a substantial period.  That takes time to factor into the explanation as to why we do it is, as pointed out earlier, also very critical.  But I any one minute, any one second, any one day, the market way markets work. MR. FISHER.  I think we have to be very careful movement to; markets don't work that way.  I did read way, it's a thoughtful presentation. points.  Again, we're talking about one-hundredths yield curve, one can assume point is very ascribe things to.  The question is suppressed the yield curve.  I don't believe we've relative to what's happened elsewhere.  We've seen additional oomph come from what's happened in Europe and our relative performance. We might observe with immediacy, may be what it's worth, again, as a former market operator, you never know what I think we take too much time that is impactful, and repress market.  The would urge the Committee, again, from one person's perspective, not to read too much into any immediate market reaction because on reacts to a multiplicity of factors that none of us understand.  That's the Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Kocherlakota.

January 24-25, 2012

I want to say that I constraints for those kinds of purchases.  Alternative A talks about $500 billion of MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First of all, appreciate the staff's responsiveness to my questions from the last meeting and am very much looking forward to the fruits of their labor.  I have a quick question about alternative A, which is about capacity purchases through, I think, January 2013, and I was wondering, if one wanted a more accommodative alternative A, how high could we go in terms of that number without impairing market function.

MR. ENGLISH.  Do you want to respond, Brian?

Purchasing $500 billion through January involves purchasing at a pace of a number of years.  I that sometime in the second year, we would become quite concerned amount of gross we have to go I would say that if a second year or beyond, we'd MR. SACK. just over $40 billion a month.  We're comfortable that we could do that program through January of 2013 without significant market consequences, but we couldn't do it for think our best judgment is about market functioning.  At that point, our purchases would be outrunning the supply, so we'd have to be extracting holdings from other holders.  And the deeper there, the more significant types of market disruptions we think can occur.  So the Committee were intent on carrying that pace of purchases for want to entertain the possibility of shifting some of the purchases into Treasury securities, in addition to MBS.

MR. EVANS.  Brian, what do you mean by 'market disruptions'? MR. LACKER.  Thanks, Chuck.

Lacker likes that question.  [Laughter] MR. SACK.  I know President

January 24-25, 2012

as though going in and purchasing from a disruption.  So we might have different MR. EVANS.  Well, it didn't seem to me somebody who owned the asset already would be interests here.

two issues very carefully.  What we're not talking about is having a bigger market market, and we had an episode of this in the first round of mortgage in certain coupons-fours, point, we tried to buy an additional amount of higher coupons, fiveactually led to significant disruptions in that coupon diving too far into the stock can cause these market difficulties. MR. SACK.  I think when market participants talk about this, they confuse that we want to separate effect.  I think that would be a positive development and presumably an intention of the program. What we're talking about is a loss of liquidity in the market itself, a loss of the ability of private agents to transact in the purchases.  We bought an awfully large portion of the gross issuance four-and-a-halfs.  At one and-a-halfs, in which case we had to pull securities out of the stock.  And even though we owned a much smaller fraction of that, that process in terms of the liquidity of that coupon and in terms of our ability to settle the holdings.  We discussed this at the time, and the Committee approved a coupon swap to let us, at the end of the program, not demand delivery of the five-and-a-halfs and switch to a different coupon.  So we do have some evidence that

In terms of Treasuries, presumably we'd want to be buying My understanding our discussion of the maturity extension program was, even there we have some capacity MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. longer-term Treasuries.  What's our capacity look like on that dimension? from constraints.

staying unchanged, whereas market supply is MR. SACK.  Right.  In Treasuries, we currently own about 20 percent of the stock of coupon securities, and of course, our holdings are increasing.  So over time, that would drift down.  However, in longer securities, from 6 to

January 24-25, 2012

extension program, our holdings will actually be 30 years, when we're done with the maturity 30 to 35 percent of the market in aggregate.

That's a lot. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

quite large there already.  We believe we could push that further. I said, if the Committee were interested in a larger or longer LSAP program, I do think we comfortably and easily get to outcomes where MR. SACK.  So we're As could shift some of the purchases into Treasuries this type of program could be carried on for two years or longer, but there, too, eventually there could be a limit.

you have a two-hander?

I do now.  [Laughter] MS. DUKE.  Well, actually

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

MS. DUKE.  Thank you.

Lacker, did you have a comment? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President

LACKER.  Yes.  I'm always curious and yearning for more when I hear you say you did just now about liquidity.  I think of liquidity as whether you can buy or sell an MR. things like

January 24-25, 2012

at the last meeting to alternative B at this meeting, the language went through a effect of a disruption on would be-where, over the short term, the inflation rate would go up go to a short horizon, I wonder if a horizon further out or core concept or talked about underlying inflation-there are a number of ways to what we're language would be less susceptible to a supply shock. you have that concern with this language?  And it gets to the Chairman's comment that this is circumstances where this language necessarily be something that generated us to tighten.  But just looking at the way the here, it seemed more susceptible than the language in alternative A at MR. ROSENGREN.  I had a question, again, on the language in paragraph 3.  From alternative A substantial change.  I looked at this language and thought about what the oil prices in the Mideast quite substantially, and we'd probably, over the two-year period, move further away from our unemployment objective.  When we go to a total measure but various supply shocks become problematic with the threshold.  If it was if we used a change that language, either through the actual threshold or through actually measuring or through the time period-the Do not binding, that it is conditional language, and there are wouldn't language was structured the last meeting.

Two thoughts on that.  One is, the one-to-two-year horizon is supposed you see it you say, these are thresholds; they're not triggers.  So the Committee could a years-it won't come back until, say, year three, but we're okay with that.  And we'll tighten policy given this language.'  That was our case. MR. ENGLISH. to say, yes, you could get an oil shock or whatever that would push inflation up, but if coming down, say, year after next to something close to your objective, then that's okay.  And the other is that, as say, 'Gee, we've had such a large shock that inflation will be away from our objective for couple of not necessarily have to take any action to intent, in any

MR. ROSENGREN.  Okay.  Thank you.

want to ask about your choice of alternative A and what the thought process was.  It could be just as simple as using fulcrum.  A adds more accommodation and C removes some accommodation, but an might be that A implies a lower assumption of the NAIRU than B, or A for a later liftoff.  So could you elaborate further on the thought process of getting to a as a choice in A? MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, I 6½ percent in B as a alternative interpretation implies a higher tolerance for inflation risk than B, or the unemployment rate is now serving as a proxy 6½ unemployment rate

In A, what we were trying to suggest was that the Committee could try a lower the SEP contributions for members of the SEP contributions for the unemployment rate at the time of liftoff that MR. ENGLISH. to provide a little more accommodation by, in effect, making it likelier that the Committee would wait longer before raising rates-or at least suggesting that to the public by having threshold for the unemployment rate.  In terms of FOMC, four people had were about 6½ or lower.  That's including somebody at 6.6 percent.  So it seemed a plausible

I said in my briefing, if you were taking seriously the written down an even lower unemployment threshold in alternative A. number given your SEP contributions.  As staff's optimal control exercises, you could conceivably wait considerably longer still, and we could conceivably have But that seemed to get away from the SEP contributions.

LOCKHART.  Yes. MR.

I want to make the observation that there is a substantial keep rates low.  And if that promise is credible, being the time-consistent path of policy, there is an argument-I think a reasonable argument-that one might consider going beyond that point in order to get about this.  Governor Duke. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. amount of thinking in academia about the notion that in a liquidity trap, you might want to promise to keep rates lower longer than would be time-consistent.  That is, you want to promise that even when inflation begins to pick up, you'll which it may not be, that can produce more stimulus now and give overall better results.  So if you interpret the SEP as pretty further stimulus now.  But that's just one additional way of thinking you see the language So I'm happy to see that the 'late 2014' is pretty consistent with the I can see that over time, the projections might move. was wondering how you thought about changing that guidance, if that guidance is in thereof circumstances?  And then similarly, is the MS. DUKE.  My question has to do with the language and how evolving over time.  When we did 'mid-2013,' the ink wasn't even dry before we started wringing our hands about whether that was the right date and whether we should move it or express it differently. projections that we're going to publish, but I how often, how frequently, with what kinds

Would we in 3 as being another dial to be turned? language on the unemployment rate or on inflation a transparency piece or sometimes think about the language commitment to for longer, then the 7 percent, for example, could change, the thresholds could If the Committee didn't decide to go in that direction, I would expect that those change, although ultimately, if economic conditions change, of course they you'd want to try to have these things be more or less squared up with the exactly what's in the SEP contributions. MR. ENGLISH.  I think my intention would be that the date would have to be adjusted. It would need to be at least roughly consistent with the SEP contributions.  If the Committee decided, as the Chairman said a moment ago, to go more in the direction of a keep rates lower change. wouldn't necessarily might have to.  But SEP contributions, though there can be some discussion by the Committee and agreement by the Committee to agree to things that aren't necessarily

have come in over the last few months, I don't see a reason to change at this meeting.  I do think there's a substantial chance for that If employment growth picks up by the end of 2013-and that doesn't seem at all out of going to need to raise rates around that time, even if MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Given the outlook for the economy, particularly the data that the stance of monetary policy either way that an increase in our policy rates will be appropriate sooner than in the Tealbook's baseline forecast and sooner than described in paragraph 3 of alternative B-or paragraph 3 ′, matter. the question-then it seems to me that we're

January 24-25, 2012

the unemployment rate hasn't made as much progress as we'd like and come down as much as we'd like.

good reasons to think about this in terms of a strong, positive link between and the rate of economic growth rather than the level of resource utilization. building block in the fundamental model, of which all models we use The standard growth model links real interest rates to the rate of growth of of our models are extensions of that model, so it's natural for there growth rates and real interest rates, whatever else is going on in the model. unemployment can vary independently, even I said yesterday, in some very simple models there are just two shocks.  Given an gap and the rate of growth are monotonically related in very simple models, but easy to envision more general models where they vary independently.  And rate can be high even if the unemployment rate is going back to 2009, when we first started talking about our exit strategy.  This is I think it would be a mistake to link monetary policy explicitly to the unemployment rate, For example, an economic growth could bring a lot of discouraged workers back into the labor up for a while.  President Pianalto mentioned yesterday.  In that case, a pickup in economic growth could warrant raising real There are interest rates Indeed, that link is a key are extensions. consumption over time.  All to be a link between In general, the rate of real growth and the level of though, as inflation rate, the I think it's very we've seen that over time, where the growth high.  To the extent that they do vary independently, we need to think about how we respond to the two, and we need to be prepared to respond to growth as well as unemployment.  We've been debating this why the way paragraph B(3) does.  I don't think it's hard to envision plausible circumstances in which we would need to tighten policy with unemployment above 7.  Indeed, nine of us believe that we would need to lift rates before the unemployment rate is below 7. acceleration of force, and that could keep the unemployment rate this possibility

January 24-25, 2012

even if unemployment is high.  More broadly, given what we know about the of output, I don't think it's inconceivable that year.  And if that's true, then promising to maintain at the natural rate or even below it, and risks raising inflationary pressures. interest rates natural rate of unemployment, or the natural rate it's close to or even above 7 percent.  I think that's something we learned in our discussions about the consensus statement over the last accommodative policy whenever unemployment is above 7 percent risks accommodative policy when we're would no longer be satisfied, and it would not be inconsistent to tighten I see with this argument is that it would preclude tightening monetary and our performance, in the past.  For example, in February of 1994, we embarked on a rate the time-and that was considered relatively way the inflation threshold is framed, credibility.  I think it's a dangerous strategy, because restoring Our goal should be for it to always be the case future, close to 2 percent.  And I don't It would allow for substantial transitory fluctuations in inflation in in the context of consensus statement.  Moreover, that's how policy works in our standard models. Now, you might argue that the inflation language in B(3) takes care of this problem in the sense that if it were the case that inflation projections or inflation expectations rose, then the conditions of B(3) policy.  The problem policy preemptively.  And doing that has been crucial to our behavior maintaining our credibility tightening campaign despite the fact that inflation had not increased, and the unemployment was at 6.4 percent, according to the Greenbook at high back then.  In essence, the conditionality in B(3), the implies that as long as unemployment is above 7 percent, we won't tighten policy unless we've already lost some of our credibility after we've lost it can be very costly. that inflation is projected to be soon, sometime in the near think this is a radical notion. response to oil price shocks, for example, as Bill English pointed out, and it's perfectly consistent with the notion of flexible inflation targeting that we discussed adopting our

January 24-25, 2012

the property that I don't think we want to set up a situation In our standard models, we write down a policy reaction function that has inflation is always projected to return to 2 percent. where we're going to underachieve relative to those simple rules that embody a standard of credibility that we've been able to maintain for two decades, where inflation expectations have not materially deviated-one or two minor exceptions aside.

worth keeping in mind that we've just begun including the federal funds rate put in the statement.  That provides detailed information, much more provides, about what monetary policy participants think is most likely to be years.  And to me, that seems like the natural place to put our guidance.  As I said, it shows that a majority of us believe interest rates will be attempts to a little tricky for the I'd like to see is that we just eliminate this opportunity, with the introduction of forward guidance in the got it in there in a careful way, a very rich way-to take it out of the It's projection in the SEP, and it's worth really thinking hard about the relationship between the SEP disclosures and what we detailed than B(3) appropriate over the next few forward exceptionally low through 2014, consistent with the characterization that B(3) provide.  But on the other hand, it shows that nine of us think that we're going to raise rates before unemployment is below 7, and I think that disconnect is going to be Chairman, even, to finesse in his statement.  So what forward guidance.  Take SEP-now that we've statement, back away from it in the statement.  We provide plenty of forward guidance in the SEP.

attempts to provide, is-as we're also releasing our consensus statement about our framework for What the SEP will not provide, which the language in B(3) you put it, Mr. Chairman-a partial characterization of our reaction function.  It's a characterization of the way in which monetary policy may vary with inflation and unemployment in the future.  Now, today

January 24-25, 2012

about this unemployment language in and how it relates to our consensus statement.  The hardest part of drafting that statement more a year wrestling with that.  We learned there's a wide range of views on the Committee, but consensus view-we found a formulation, an articulation-that a broad working I said, we learned over the course of that discussion that rate of unemployment are all over the map, anywhere from 5 to as much as 8 percent or more.  We took extraordinary efforts to craft relationship between employment, inflation, and monetary policy-one a range of nonmonetary factors that are too hard to predict, The language of B(3) strikes me as directly conflicting with this numerical policy criterion for unemployment that seems to we don't know about maximum employment to write down a numerical objective.  But in the meeting enough to write down a particular unemployment rate as a threshold awfully confusing. monetary policy, and I think we ought to think carefully B(3) was dealing with the relationship between labor markets and monetary policy.  We spent than we found a majority of us could support.  And as estimates of what you'd think of as the natural ranging a nuanced view of the that isn't inconsistent with the views around the table.  In the end, we decided there that it was not appropriate to articulate a numerical objective for employment or unemployment, because they're predominantly determined by and they're difficult to estimate. consensus statement.  It introduces a imply that mandate-consistent maximum employment corresponds to an unemployment rate somewhere below 7 percent.  We'd be saying in the consensus statement that enough statement, we'd know criterion for policymaking.  This strikes me as that I oppose the language in B(3) are, first, that it elevates employment growth or real economic growth.  I'm not going to go down that road.  Elevating unemployment risks credibility.  As I've said before, the times we've lost our credibility have been A couple of other reasons unemployment rather than employment or sure that's a wise choice, if we're undermining our

It seems to rule out preemptive as very confusing SEP, and the SEP would be a much better way to provide that forward we just adopted. and the SEP.

However, attempting to represent our monetary an oil supply shock and how the language in this current version of you have an oil price shock that pushes inflation up for markets that we would be raising rates.  Now, I recognize that this is a actually think these efforts are very good efforts, but it's hard to get this right.  I think that our medium-term target.  So these illustrate some of the difficulties MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Today paragraph 3 .  My own projection has the funds rate lifting off in late 2014, reaching 50 basis ′ points at the end of 2014.  That's consistent with the statement as written in 3 .  I am ′ uncomfortable with the threshold language in paragraph 3.  Simple thresholds work fine in certain circumstances, such as the military command 'Don't fire until you see the whites of their eyes.'  [Laughter] policy reaction function with such a simple threshold runs the risk of confusing the public about how we set monetary policy.  And I think President Rosengren's comments actually illustrate that difficulty regarding 3 works.  It could be misinterpreted as, if a year or two, a signal to very difficult challenge to, in a couple of sentences, describe the Committee's reaction function. I 2½ percent, which was in the earlier draft, also suffered from this issue of raising the question of whether that is somehow

And so I think, again, a and/or the inflation rate, the way it's described confusing in terms of describing our reaction function.  I'm also worried about what effect the thresholds in paragraph 3 would have on funds rate about that.  The interaction of policy thresholds and time-varying private-sector macroeconomic forecasts is hard to predict.  So, with trying to the appropriate setting of monetary policy depends on many variables.  It depends on the path on which the economy is simple threshold around the unemployment rate in 3, is potentially how the communication of these thresholds would affect the market reaction.  As the Tealbook notes, it's difficult to gauge expectations going forward.  And I, again, worry with diffuse again, I'd prefer paragraph 3 . ′

As I've said in the past, and as the staff memo consistent with the standard economic conditions change.  I also recognize effects of an MBS program depend on the expected stock and expected path that we expect to continue these purchases at least through the year-end advantage of the flow-based approach is that it Looking forward beyond today, we may still have to provide more policy accommodation if the economy loses objective.  In these purchases of mortgage-backed securities.  I paragraph 3 ′ per month. of approaching MBS purchases points out, having this open-ended or flow-based approach is more monetary policy reaction of adjusting policy as that, in my view, the of that program.  So it would be appropriate, even with a flow-based approach, to provide some forward guidance saying or something like that.  To my mind, the big

But for today, I'm in favor of alternative B with the avoids this abrupt end of recognize, as we discussed be good to have more information about how long we could actually Treasury purchases.  Again, this discussion I've just had is about future policy, depending on how the economic language in 3 . ′

understanding of that Bill described-that that was a reflection of the fact that inflation was elevated somewhat at that time.  And In terms of the sentence in paragraph 2 'However, the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations,' my sentence was the same as running above desired levels and that inflation risks were in fact, inflation has come down.  I don't think we need that sentence anymore, given that the facts have changed.  So I would strike that sentence from paragraph 2.  Thank you.

I support alternative surprisingly, like others, I stressed in the economic go-round yesterday, I see the outlook as largely unchanged from our last meeting, with a modest economic expansion, a slow decline in the unemployment rate, and an inflation rate that stays near 2 percent.  My outlook supports continuing extension program and the reinvestment of mortgage-backed securities.  And anticipated period of low rates now stretches into 2014 will be seen as another action to support our objective for like mine as reason to ease policy today.  One reason is that my projection for falling inflation is just a projection, and further

For example, as strength of OER over the next then that could be cause for further policy policy accommodation is that further easing of policy would have some other costs by potentially causing inflation expectations to become unanchored or causing distortions in the Treasury MBS markets and further complicating our holding off on more-aggressive action today.

I prefer an I mentioned yesterday, than the 5½ percent that is used in the Tealbook's Taylor higher natural rate warrants a threshold greater I realize that the unemployment threshold needs to reflect the Lacker mentioned, nine of us believe that the first federal funds rate liftoff. Regarding paragraph 3, my first preference is to let the Committee speak through our SEP and not put specific guidance in our statement.

I recall very clearly that when I joined the FOMC in extended period of very low interest rates.  Two years later, with inflation at each point in time were certainly am inclined to be cautious in following the prescriptions of optimal policy ourselves plenty of flexibility.

To post-FOMC statement is a policy tool, and the SEP is supplemental MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll start by stating my support for alternative ′ getting into that, let me make a couple of comments on how statement versus the SEPs and the intended effect of forward guidance in the statement.  It strikes me that, just based on the first three statements on the policy afternoon, we will be introducing innovations that coordination between the statement, the SEPs, and the consensus statement yesterday, and that more my way of thinking, the

January 24-25, 2012

I don't believe the SEPs a consensus of the Committee.  I do see forward a policy instrument-that is, a tool to influence market expectations.  And I think and other I see the choice now between paragraphs 3 and 3  as a question of, what's the guidance attuned to the public's and the market's key Fed's market activity information that communicates individual views of FOMC participants. can substitute for the statement of the Committee, because the projections do not represent voted decision of the Committee or an actionable guidance as guidance needs to be expressed through the statement or the Chairman's testimony public comments. ′ simplest and most effective way to convey concerns?  And I think those concerns are the path of interest rates and the using the balance sheet.

I acknowledge some awkwardness in stating forward guidance in the form of a I think it is still the more appropriate form for issuing official forward guidance expecting-is an explicit 'balanced approach,' included in the statement of longer-run goals and policy a new chapter for the FOMC.  And I have some misgivings growth.  In recent months, we've seen an unexpected drop in the unemployment focused on how to interpret the nature of flows in and out of I worry that institutionalizing such an intense focus on a single While calendar date, regarding the policy outlook of the Committee.  Paragraph 3 retains the calendar date, of course, while introducing the innovation of conditional thresholds based on macroeconomic outcomes. And the real innovation in this-one that the broad public may not be macroeconomic threshold based on the unemployment rate.  Even if introduced with the affirmation of a strategy, this strikes me as opening about going down this road.  Many of us have made the fairly obvious point of the difficulty of expressing the Committee's employment objective in terms of an unemployment rate as opposed to employment rate, and there has been much discussion about the causes of that drop and whether it will stick. Attention has been rightly employment and the labor force.

January 24-25, 2012

nature, is based on our forecasts-in a way, our guesses-about what that this could reinforce cynicism about our motives and has the shifted rather profoundly and stable inflation. labor indicator-the unemployment rate-would actually confuse the public's understanding of the employment mandate.  I'm similarly uncomfortable with the asymmetry of specifying the unemployment threshold in terms of a realized outcome while the inflation threshold is expressed in terms of a forecast.  While the unemployment threshold is based on observable data, the inflation threshold, by will happen.  And I worry potential to fuel an inference that the Committee's true priorities have in the direction of less commitment to low about going down the path of putting economic conditionality I'm leery of the 7 percent threshold in option B, and even more so of the I think the criterion for an unemployment threshold, if we in monetary policy effects, a 7 percent In addition to concerns into the statement, 6½ percent threshold in option A.  In my view, a 7 percent threshold is getting a little too close to reasonable estimates of the NAIRU. include one, should be that it is high enough that most people will see it as clearly consistent with price stability.  This is especially true since the nature of the threshold is that policy is not expected to adjust until the stated threshold is crossed.  Given the imprecision in estimating NAIRU, and our imperfect knowledge of the lags threshold makes me a bit uncomfortable.

adding these conditional thresholds to our rate guidance, the bias in the direction of the employment and carries the risk of would prefer paragraph 3  in alternative B.  But now language decision in the statement.  If the So I am concerned that by Committee may, perhaps unwittingly, introduce a mandate.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Rosengren.

B.  I support using rate, but feel we need to rework the language I was somewhat surprised that B does not include at the last and the modest deterioration in the Tealbook forecast since then.  Given how far we are either much faster growth than is currently predicted or more accommodative If GDP growth is as slow as the Tealbook am concerned that the latest version of the announcing a goal today, which should clear up any confusion about our longer-term goal.  I am not might be interpreted as making 2 percent sound like a ceiling.  Given elevated unemployment rate, I believe we need the latitude to allow MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative thresholds, including a 7 percent unemployment before it is included in the statement. additional quantitative easing, given the direction that our discussion was heading meeting from both elements of the mandate both in the Tealbook and my own forecast, it is likely we will not be tightening until beyond 2014.  To shorten the time period of exceptionally low rates would require monetary and/or fiscal policy in the near term. envisions, and we continue to experience large misses on our mandates, at the next meeting we should consider beginning a large mortgage purchase program to reduce the adjustment period.  I support thresholds because they move us in the direction of a statement based on economic outcomes rather than a calendar date.  That said, I statement reduced the inflation threshold from 2½ to 2 percent.  We will be 2 percent in favor of language that our current and expected modest fluctuations of inflation around our longer-run goal, consistent with a quadratic loss function.

would not support removing the calendar date from the statement now, for Lockhart.  The SEP, as of this meeting, reflects the expected I example, by distinguishing voters from nonvoters or identifying the way to communicate the consensus of the In addition, I reasons just described by President funds rate path for all participants, with no distinction between voting and nonvoting members. The markets will price in the interest rate path that reflects the expected vote of the Committee. believe paragraph 3, with a calendar date, maintains this distinction and better reflects the consensus of the Committee than a scatter diagram of our individual interest rate paths.  Unless we change the SEP-for submissions-the statement will remain our best current voting members, which should include the likely date of liftoff and the economic conditions consistent with that liftoff.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

This could help us decide on a more systematic consensus would eliminate the need for such reaction function would be better laid out.  Until then, find these thresholds or triggers very problematic.  I also note, as President Lacker pointed out, alternative B appears to be at odds with the Committee's views in the SEP. occurring with the unemployment rate Committee on a path that could be very treacherous to navigate.  As we've meetings, I do favor being more transparent about triggers or thresholds on unemployment and inflation is not the way to do it.  Saying that we'll not change interest rates be close to 2 percent, as policy rule into the statement. and their policy rules.  I rules to see if we could reach some approach to policy.  Indeed, reaching such a thresholds and triggers because our entire I that the language in As he said, nine participants see the funds rate liftoff above 7 percent and the inflation rate at 2 percent or less.

I want to focus my remarks on the recommendation to continue to include the 'late 2014' in the statement.  As I said back in August, I believe including calendar that conditionality.  All we have to do is refer to the public reactions date and how much would we change it and going on?  As President Lacker mentioned, even in the Wall Street Journal But calendar date dates in the communication is poor communications.  It's not well understood by the public.  We believe that that calendar date is conditional, but in fact, I'm not sure the public does or fully appreciates the nature of and their focus on, would we change the calendar what's today, it talks about our commitment to 2013 or whenever.  I think this poses severe difficulties for communications for this Committee.

Does the deteriorated that much, and indeed, the path for future unemployment is Growth rates of GDP are a little lower due to some of the are the criteria, then, that we're using between the last and this meeting to change forward guidance by nearly two years?  This is terrible confusing, and it's really not a yet we want it to be a commitment.  I just think this is the wrong way to What is the change since December that's now tightening out by 18 months?  Do we know the moving it out by 18 months or 12 months or 6 months or 24 months?  How do we choose between these dates this? 2014, late 2014, 2013, or 2016, for that matter? We haven't articulated that.  We haven't told the public what's driving us to do that.  And we have no measurable quantitative framework for actually even thinking about that, as far as tell.  So how and when will we choose to change that forward guidance?  By 18-month increments at this meeting, are we sending a signal to the public that somehow the increments by which we are going to change this forward that mean that the next time we do it, it will have to be 18 months, or would it be 24 months? What's the expectation we're setting up by taking public's expectations about how we'll behave-I think with a lack of a to move it. What are the conditioning variables that are 18 months come from the SEP?  Well, if it comes from the SEP, then we don't need to tell what it is in the statement.  What will we need to see to change this?  Since the last meeting, the economic outlook hasn't lower than it was in December. projections that we have, but what meeting communication.  I don't think the public understands it.  It's commitment-and

January 24-25, 2012

I think it's still a bad decision.  We've communicated very little about the SEPs. communicate to the public about policy.  Using the calendar dates was a bad decision, in my view, in August; criteria that we're using to change it, and I think it's confusing to the public.  And that's independent of the

And and it provides more clarity about the nature and It reveals more about the uncertainty that the Committee has about SEP projections paint It will also move more incrementally.  Now we're stuck in this mode where we have to a year or more in huge hunks to make a difference, when in fact at the revealed by the SEP is going to be much more how our views are evolving over time. of the whole SEP exercise on appropriate policy is to be about our reaction functions, and it is much more informative than these years in advance, for which we really don't commit. large enough that we should be careful about making commitments so Moreover, now that we're publishing the SEP projections of appropriate policy, what's the rationale for continuing to put it in the statement?  The SEP would appear to dominate it in almost every dimension.  It's clearer, it's richer, the views of the Committee. the nature of the timing of liftoff, reinforcing the notion that in fact it's not a commitment, and indeed it shouldn't be.  Even more useful is that over time, the picture the will evolve as the economy evolves, reinforcing the notion that there's conditionality of our policy. shift the forward guidance by our views about policy are probably changing more incrementally.  And indeed, looking distribution of the forward guidance as informative about our reaction function and about Indeed, one of the important elements more descriptive discrete choices about moving things our forecasts are certainly far in advance.  So I think the SEPs are a far superior method for revealing forward guidance than putting in discrete dates and having those discrete dates jump around at various points in time for reasons that we can't fully explain.

January 24-25, 2012

April or June, the SEP forecasts appropriate policy, and it begins to shade back more toward sooner are we going to change the statement?  Are we going to say, 'Well, no, conveyed in the SEPs and the We might have to resort to saying, 'Well, it's the voting members who are in the are in the SEP.'  That just sets up a game where we're the public that who is on the Committee matters a lot, and they have to start are the voters and who are not the voters, because their forecasts may send this Committee that and will misdirect public interest and public attention away from the want to send and toward confusion about who's voting and who's not.  And it's just road. I think also that reporting dates in the statement and using the SEPs can present for us a very complicated communication problem.  Today, we have the unique opportunity to substitute the SEP for the date in the statement.  And indeed, for those who wish to send an easing statement, the SEP in fact reveals that the modal anticipation of many members on the Committee is not just 2014; it actually may be later than that.  So for those who wish to send an easing signal, the message in the SEP is perhaps even more favorable in that regard than trying to pick late 2014.  The second thing is that if we continue to use both signals, I think it creates even greater problems for us.  Suppose, on the other side, that by begin to pull back on the rather than later.  How we're not going to change the statement because we're not ready to move it by a year'?  How would we explain the differences between the information being statement? statement, and the nonvoting members communicating to guessing who different messages.  That just creates another communication headache for will not be productive messages we very bad communications and will cause us untold headaches down the could go on about the problems this creates, but I think my message is clear.  For today, actually prefer the language of alternative C.  For one thing, it conveys a more balanced alternative B is going I I assessment of the outlook, in my view, than alternative B does.

And so negative signal to the markets forecast.  Whatever heaven forbid that notice.  I think it's time for patience.  Patience is appropriate at this point.  I would not want to advocate I would take that part out.  I

Book B of the Tealbook and Bill English's great surprise to the market and represent a the calendar date from guidance in the statement, because date is going to be a suspending the MEP, I alternative C, leaving in the MEP but taking out the date, would And that brings me to the last point about alternative C, which I think is a better view of the economy, and it discussion suggest that alternative C would be a tightening.  I would point out that in the dealer survey, a number of the respondents expressed the expectation that we would remove it was redundant to the SEP.  So I don't believe that removing the calendar surprise or a disruption to the market.  And thus, since I'm not advocating think writing up the statement as not be a surprise to the market.  And indeed, the SEP would reveal a motivation of this Committee to extend the dates out further, and it actually would be a much more effective statement.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

January 24-25, 2012

I'm going to argue pretty strenuously on three points, and probably most strenuously high unemployment and low inflation I agree with many of the confusing, both for the Committee and for dates in the statement, which I have opposed in a date in the forecast really means anything with the SEP.  I've already suggested a qualitative statement that lets the SEP do the [Laughter] on the first point.  I do not think that simply citing indicates that more should be done.  I've argued this before, and I'll try to be more aggressive today on that point.  Then I'll discuss thresholds in the statement. previous speakers that this is potentially quite financial markets.  And then I'll discuss calendar the past, and with the SEP now, it's not clear that compared talking, and I'll come to that at the end.  I have provided language in a memo.

I'll come back to the is a characterization-I'm overdoing it a little bit to make a point: I'm hearing.  Let me make the point that if you look at Laforte, this is patently false.  Let's consider the optimal policy Laforte's memo.  This is in the Tealbook.  It's called 'Uncertainty and it's the standard memo that we In particular, figure 2 in the memo shows how unemployment and inflation would model, under fully optimal commitment strategy for the Committee.  So you're willing to accept the model, you can't do better than that. you accept the model, you can't do better.  This is the full unemployment would remain high, and inflation would year from now.  So you would get to 2013, and you'd have inflation pretty you accept the model and accept So let me start on the first point, and let me characterize what some of the argument around the table is.  This 'Unemployment is high.  Inflation is near target.  That can't possibly be the optimal policy, and therefore we must do more.'  That's what the memo from Jean-Philippe exercises that are included in about the Tealbook Forecast and Alternative Simulations,' always get. evolve, according to the at least if assumptions under the model, but if commitment solution.  In that scenario, be about 2.1 percent a close to target, and you'd have pretty high unemployment.  If

January 24-25, 2012

these are the values I am interpreting the argument around the table, many of would come back to the Committee and say, 'Well, we've got high unemployment, inflation But that would be a wrong is already being done, according to that In that circumstance, in fact, doing more would be making things worse by knocking citing high that the Committee was able to pursue the full commitment strategy, then that would obtain in 2013.  And yet, as you is essentially at target, and that suggests more should be done.' statement in my view, because the most that can be done exercise. the economy off the optimal path that's been calculated.  So the point is that simply unemployment and low inflation is not enough to determine whether the Committee is doing as much as possible or not.

for the memo that you tell us where to find it? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard, people are looking you're citing.  Could

Mr. Wilcox is going to adjudicate.  What is the difference? MR. WILCOX.  Okay.  Bill, help me out here.  I all have in front of

January 24-25, 2012

The difference in what is shown in Jean-Philippe's memo is that it also plots Book B, holds the funds rate at the current longer-through, it looks like, about mid-2016-whereas the liftoff under the control trajectory. the Tealbook baseline, and Jean-Philippe's memo compares the optimal policy trajectory under commitment and under discretion.  So what the version that President Bullard is referring to shows is that, compared with the Tealbook baseline, the optimal policy under commitment, which is the same one that's shown on page 3 of target range Tealbook baseline, which is driven by the outcome-based rule, has liftoff occurring in late 2014.

rule-based-am I right? CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  So all optimal policies imply inflation above 2 percent.  Only the

BULLARD.  Okay.  I'm looking at this picture, 'PCE inflation.'  In 2013, it's about MR. 2 percent.

inflation below 2 percent CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  But it doesn't project indefinitely.

I'm coming to that. MR. BULLARD.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.

But first of all, to talk about tenths of 1 percentage point on the It's close to target.  That's the message of the graph.  The basic story going to observe high unemployment and inflation close to target even under to say we should do more is obviously not that is not all.  Most would say that there are limits to the commitments If you try to go out several years, it's unclear how be, and even if you try to make those commitments, you make tentative So the full commitment MR. BULLARD. inflation rate is ridiculous. is that you're optimal policy.  So citing those numbers as a way right, in my view.  Now, this Committee can make far into the future. credible you can really commitments.  They may not be credible with financial markets.

January 24-25, 2012

a feasible outcome, I would say.  The best we can do is to approximate that or behavior according to a Taylor-type policy go to the optimal discretionary policy line in the Laforte chart, there you'll see that a long period of time.  And that's because you can't get the you get something that approximates the full commitment solution Inflation is near target or a little bit below target.  This can't be got a Committee.'  We've got a lot of views. Laforte picture, inflation a little bit lower than that. solution is not really outcome with perhaps optimal discretionary policy rule.  If we inflation is slightly below target for full commitment solution, so with the optimal discretionary solution.  Again, you'd have the same story.  You'd be saying, 'Gosh, unemployment is high. the optimal thing.'  But it is the optimal discretionary solution.  And then again, you might say, 'Well, we're not completely optimal here.  We've So we're not actually doing that, either.  And you just look at the baseline in the and it has that different.  So even if you're fully optimal rule, you're not that far off of optimal policy.  But they all have around pretty close to target, within a few tenths of Why is What's going on here?  Well, in models, you might be able to offset shocks completely to pull the economy right back to the balanced a lot of inertia, and it takes a long time.  So you're always going to be observing this close to target.  Again, arguing in those circumstances that we should be doing economy off from something that's either fully optimal or worse outcome-from the perspective of the model, anyway.  But The good news about these lines is they're not all somewhat off the the characterization that inflation hangs target, whether it's below or above, and unemployment comes down only very slowly. this? with monetary policy, and then you might be able growth path right when you want to, like next year.  But in the real world, you can't do that. There's long, slow decline in unemployment and, simultaneously-even under optimal policy, I thinkinflation pretty more, then, would be knocking the nearly optimal and getting a

January 24-25, 2012

an appropriate baseline Evans pointed out yesterday, all of those alternatives involve inflation I'm trying to state as forcefully as I can that I from where we should be. that's not all.  The same memo also looks at alternative scenarios under policy, and as President quite close to target.  None of them have inflation going up over 3 or 4 percent.  Even if some of these dramatic tail events happen in the economy, we still wouldn't expect inflation to get very far from target, according to those simulations.  So don't think it's valid to just cite high unemployment and low inflation as evidence that the Committee is way off are clear caveats to this argument, but I do not think they invalidate the main approximation to reality, and in fact, I have often got the wrong models and we've got the wrong way to look at the world. argument to make, but a lot of the arguments for doing more are actually citing a reason for doing more is that we're just dissatisfied with what's wrong you want to make that case. Now, there point.  Of course, the model may be a poor argued that we've That's a fine Tealbook forecasts and saying that Tealbook forecasts, and I think you have to say more than that.  You have to say with the Tealbook exercise, if

calculations differ.  I weights in the objective function.  You could show how I will say about objective functions, however, that they are not really a free good. I come from, you can't just choose your own objective function.  You In addition, as has been mentioned by President Kocherlakota at past meetings, the optimal control exercise involves an objective function, and one might have a different objective function than the one that's used in the optimal control exercise.  In particular, you might have different weights on different variables, and that would change what the path looked like, absolutely, and one thing the staff could do is to show how those kinds of think it's fairly simple to change the those differ. In my opinion, or where should be choosing the objective function that somehow represents the households that are

I going around choosing different objective functions. we're supposed to be doing all of for and to the households that are actually in the model.  And when you do that, you think, that are close to the ones the staff is using, but we could argue But I think that the basic point is that this scenario of high unemployment supposed to be behind all of this analysis, and what the households would really New Keynesian literature, you actually do that.  You start with the households, and then you build up to an approximate quadratic objective function that takes into account what the households would really don't think we should just be willy-nilly You should be able to relate them back to the people whom this policy get objective functions, I about that, I agree. and low inflation does not mean that it's obvious that we need to do more.

I advise against argued here.  We're doing a lot at this meeting.  We've got our objectives, which I think is important and will not change things part of this as I can, that connecting monetary policy directly and numerically to colossal error for American monetary policy.  Hysteresis in a what's basically being predicted at this meeting the unemployment rate coming down only about three-tenths over the years.  So I'm very concerned that we somehow manage that risk, that we not box Now, let me turn to the second point-the thresholds in the statement. doing this, as many have statement of longer-term dramatically, but the markets have to get used to that and have to absorb that.  We're also putting out the SEP with a policy forecast.  That is a pretty significant move on the Committee.  Adding thresholds at this juncture is potentially confusing.  I've argued strenuously in the past, as strenuously unemployment is potentially a unemployment and structural labor market problems could pull monetary policy off course for generation, and stunningly, hysteresis is actually and in this Tealbook, with next two ourselves in and never get off zero.  Europe has not been below 7 percent unemployment for two

I want to go there, but if we go there, I don't want both structural labor market end up going in that direction, let's work on the our monetary policy.  I'm very concerned going well, as many of you have stated.  I'm just saying we should not ourselves numerically to that.  I'm not saying we shouldn't pay attention to the labor markets; course, we're going to pay attention to the labor markets.  I'm just saying, don't tie our fate to know what's going to happen, and the in the G-7 over the last two decades. decades-not that problems and monetary policy problems.  If we structural labor market problems independently of about that possibility.  We have not experienced unemployment at this level in the United States for a long time.  It's not tie of what happens in labor markets, because we don't experience has been bad

I sometimes do.  From the dovish what the 2 percent threshold will mean.  I think that could easily be as President Rosengren has said:  'Gee, anytime inflation is above 2 percent, the need to think this go with these thresholds.  I'm not sure what the answer is.  I've not that I'm aware of. an incomplete way to describe our reaction function.  We should think about it more and we have a more complete way, which is the SEP, paragraph 3.  As far as I've argued against the calendar date as well.  To me, this meeting is the opportunity to get you should Let me put on my dovish hat for a minute, as viewpoint, I'm not clear interpreted Committee has to take a more hawkish position.'  That does argue that we through a lot more before we been a fan of this threshold argument.  I don't think it pops out of anything It's think about more complete ways.  Ironically, and so let's let the SEP do the talking for this meeting.  That makes me not in favor of alternative B, 3′ is concerned , it's okay, except it still has the calendar date in there, and rid of the calendar date in the statement and get rid of the problems that many people around the Committee have talked about-how cumbersome it is to put in a calendar date, have the data change on you over the next two meetings, and then be in a quandary about whether

January 24-25, 2012

If you leave it where it is, you look as though you move it around, people aren't quite sure what to So I think it makes it cumbersome.  This is a great chance to get rid of the calendar got a rich description of the views on the a clear median.  You've got some nutcases like me who put in other you've got a clear median there, and I think markets will appreciate the description. try to change the date again or leave it where it is. you're not paying attention to the data.  If make of it. date, in my view, and again, let the SEP speak.  You've Committee.  You've got things, but thresholds and replaces them with the following language for the second The language says that this the price index for a lot of people then, would be a topic for debate among the Committee-what does or 'subdued' inflation?  But you'd have the SEP, which I support none of the listed alternatives.  For me, they didn't span the space of the possibilities here.  I did suggest my own alternative, which does look like alternative B.  It's B(3), but it takes out the part of B(3)-this is in the memo that I distributed to the Committee. 'exceptionally low range for the federal funds rate will be appropriate at least as long as unemployment remains elevated, the projected inflation rate (as measured by personal consumption expenditures) remains subdued, and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.'  And I think that that's a big enough tent to get under the tent.  'Elevated,' 'elevated' really mean?  'Near-target' would give the various members' views on that.  So that's my suggestion for today, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you.  President Evans.

I said yesterday, many workhorse models real rates should be substantially lower, and your comment earlier with regard to We can certainly quibble over every single MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As say that liquidity traps is just another example of that. analysis of those models, but the broad implication across these economic analyses is clear,

January 24-25, 2012

more accommodation today. certainly to me.  With resource slack substantial and inflation projections well contained and below 2 percent, I favor character for us all to do what I'm about to do here.  I'll start with my wish would be to substantially improve our forward guidance with more 7 percent on the unemployment rate-frankly, even I would prefer 3 percent as the given that the SEPs were just put out, and they don't a very nice chart in there that shows-here's our liftoff date, what the unemployment rate is, and here's where the inflation rate is-that a substantial accommodation.  It would guidance, it would be of SEPs.  I think that it would be completely in that this could be a very useful tool. workable.  It's clear. It's not out of list first.  My preference economic thresholds.  I've talked about this at length, and it's well beyond what is contained in the alternatives today.  Something like 6½ percent-with an inflation safeguard seems quite fine. safeguard threshold for total PCE inflation over a three-year projection period-that's medium term.  Now, you may say that's problematic encompass that at all.  There's here's number of participants have liftoff with higher unemployment rates and lower inflation rates. Well, actually, that's just fine.  This would then be interpreted as more be a choice by the Committee, if it were undertaken, as more forward guidance, more accommodation.  Then, given that the Committee takes on board that true the setting for the projections in the next set keeping with what we do for our SEPs, and it's another way It's

I've made this offer before, and since that better embraced, today I would favor more large-scale asset purchases.  We is another way to demonstrate commitment, would do it in a substantial fashion, in a way that is in accordance more with the forward guidance that I think is appropriate.  I'd be thinking more along the lines of But clearly, there are no takers here. course is not likely to be talked about commitment problems.  I think that this and frankly, I type of

I think it's a focal point, With regard to the the 3′ uses the calendar date for late 2014.  The current language on conditioning judgment.  It's certainly that it would be interpreted as an implicit policy tightening.  I concerns that just mentioning a one-year horizon-even if horizon in there, too-allows people to be concerned about incorporating oil there.  For reasons that are a bit idiosyncratic to the way that we've communications, I'm also bothered by this language of inflation projections 'below or close to 2 percent.'  That could be interpreted as

January 24-25, 2012

that our objective is The actual language may be different than that, but I think that is the mentioned.  I think we really need to as inflation'-we would get out of 'if inflation was above some threshold X,' whatever that number is.  That's why I think we toward inflation.  And then, frankly, I don't think the guidance is helpful here, since we have such a currently low inflation and what if we changed it and said, 'As long as the rate is above 7½ percent?'  And then suppose we found ourselves with a risks giving the appearance that we It just is bothersome to me. and the framing for that is going to be the Chairman's language in the past '2 percent or a bit less.' frame that people will bring to it.  It mentions 'below' 2 percent, which seems obvious to me, so I'm not quite sure why that would even have to be somehow be able to formulate a construction like 'as long this need a better discussion about our attitudes unemployment rate projection threshold.  Seven percent is a pretty high number, and 7½ percent is very high.  What if our inflation projection were 1.8 percent; unemployment 7¼ percent unemployment rate and inflation projections of 1.8 percent.  I understand it's a threshold; it's not a trigger.  I understand that there are other conditioning statements involved, but frankly, I think people would jump all over that.  It somehow dislike employment.

going to continue to provide accommodation until economic growth is strong enough, until lower.  So for myself, to my way of thinking, keep centered our expectation on 2, but once we started talking about Again, I think the focus needs to be on the inflation projection and expectations, and that we're unemployment and resource slack are pumping accommodation until resource slack falls dramatically or we know inflation is gaining momentum and rising to an upper tolerance range.  We used to talk about inflation in the 1½ to 2½ percent range, when we'd our explicit objectives and whatnot, we dropped that upper part of the range, and I think that that's unhelpful.

January 24-25, 2012

I said yesterday, our inflation goal.  That greatly bothers me.  I think the 'balanced approach' good language, but I know from our discussions that that's not something that many put into that statement.  But I thought it was implicitly pretty well was the case.  For example, we know that if our inflation projections were 3 and the unemployment rate was 4½ percent, we would be willing to raise the funds rate overshooting on that all the time, and we greatly admire Chairman Volcker for being willing to do that under I think that's what 'balance' means.  So I'm kind of flummoxed well at all.  I frankly do not know how to explain what 'balanced relative to the SEP projections that we are going to publish in just a few hours, the right answer.  I don't know if anybody is willing to say that, I think that we have to continue to try as hard as we possibly Thank you. Finally, on our communications rollout, I think our SEPs make clear, as that we're undershooting our employment mandate for a long time, and inflation is undershooting language in our framework statement clearly contemplates overshooting.  We didn't discuss at any length Governor Tarullo's language on overshooting.  I personally thought that that was perfectly members wanted to understood that that percent quite a lot and allow unemployment to go well above 5 percent, or whatever we think the natural rate of unemployment is, in order to get inflation down.  We contemplate margin very difficult circumstances. that we don't think about this the same way in terms of overshooting inflation when our real-side mandate is not doing very approach' means and Mr. Chairman, I think we need somebody to explain to us, to explain to me, how to explain that without causing a lot of confusion.  I need some help on that.  And you said something yesterday, which-maybe that's but the question to me is, is this balance?  And if it's not, is it because we're unwilling to do that?  Or do we think we're powerless?  If we don't have the tools to do it, I think somehow we have to explain that to people, but can.

Because unchanged over the last few meetings, I see no need for the our balance sheet extension in alternative B. federal funds rate, forward guidance to the calendar or to specific thresholds for unemployment and inflation.  Rather, we should set policy as described in our consensus statement based on our longer-run goals, our medium-term outlook, and our assessment of the balance of strategy necessarily involves consideration of broader factors than suggested by language that emphasizes a date or threshold levels for unemployment and inflation.  With respect to the thresholds, I simply do not have reliable estimates of the extent to which unemployment is structural versus cyclical today, much less several problems are not readily tradeoffs will be short lived and that by the continue to worry that additional action intended to speed improvement in the housing markets could have unintended consequences in the longer run.

guidance as viewed in the corporate community.  Of course The issue is making it public and what traps that creates.

going to make public our projections, our SEP.  I may not I believe that think there are concerns about contradictions with our long-term statement if we get into the specifics that others from a different had I to go along with statement B, that might soften the way it's also say in paragraph 4 of a fixed goal for and yet in paragraph 3 of alternative B, what are we doing?  Laying out a specific rate, which is just the mirror image of Having said all that, we are value that as much as others at this table, but it is an exercise we're undergoing. should substitute for the conditionality and for the date that we place in our statements in terms of our policy alternatives.  I also goals and policy strategy viewpoint have expressed concern over.  We do talk about a 2 percent longer-term rate, and I suggested some language, were currently written so we don't get locked into the short term.  But we our longer-run goals and policy strategy, 'It would not be appropriate to specify employment,' number-7, 7½ percent for the unemployment employment.  So I think you could create confusion in the marketplace here.  I'm worried about simple message management.

Not Laying out our strategic goals helps frame SEP.  I think as I like to call them, the best guesses-forecasts are can set the stage for any We have taken significant steps with the statement of goals and policy strategy. 100 percent of us are on board there.  I was somewhat sympathetic to the arguments Governor Tarullo made, but that's the decision that was made. our actions and expectations overall.  And now we're going to release the new that's big news.  I think it indicates, guesses-of the Committee as to when we think we'll have a takeoff point.  I think these two exercises give markets and others plenty to discuss and to digest and tactical adjustments for policy at our next meeting in March.  At that point, we'll have much

January 24-25, 2012

whether the recovery is proceeding as some of us perceive, whether or more information about not the situation in Europe is worse or becoming dire, or whether we need to react to some financial event that we should, as central bankers, react to.

I had a vote, taking the language of the first C, not referring to the date in and I would also, as a I think that to take that out now doesn't get us very So, Mr. Chairman, I would advocate, if paragraph of alternative 3′ , but utilizing 3′; footnote, always include that 'the Committee will continue to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation expectations.' much.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President role as an adviser and offer some comments The first comment-and this builds on President Bullard's remarks-is about we go to page 3 of I'm sure my research director has you look at the path for the constrained optimal solution that has the rate greater than or equal to 5 percent through 2016 or so, and inflation really that it's as high as this for so long, and that the Committee should going to be helpful in which model we like. just looking at the forecast alone, saying that we're going to be near target in terms of MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In my provider of input to the voting members of the Committee, I am going to on alternative B. the mapping between the forecast and the need for accommodation.  And if Tealbook B-I haven't read the Laforte memo, but [laughter]-and unemployment always around 2, never larger than 2.3 percent, you might well come to this and say unconscionable that unemployment be be doing something more about it.  But this is what's optimal.  And why is it that this is what's optimal?  Generating more inflation later on in the decade is not really terms of lowering unemployment today, within the context of this model.  There might be other models where it would be helpful, and we should have a discussion about But

January 24-25, 2012

going to be well above target-that doesn't tell you enough. going to be generating the reductions in the rate in the current environment. inflation and that unemployment is You also have to have some notion of what the mechanism is that's tradeoff between more inflation and how much is that going to buy in terms of unemployment was asking Brian about capacity constraints, and this ties back to my remarks yesterday something we should be keeping in mind.  Do further.  You can promise to keep it low until mid-2014 or could be late 2020, I guess.  But there's a point where you start to feel as though constraints that we are facing on purchase programs.  He was careful not to give a hard I would translate what he said into, something on $1 trillion at a pace of $40 billion a month represents something like how much we I about longer-run deflation risk.  I think that that's we really want to be maxing out on accommodation?  Now, what does 'maxing out' mean?  You can always push out the interest rate late 2014.  It you're hitting diminishing returns on that.  And I think Brian gave a very nice description of the capacity number, and it was appropriate he did not.  But the order of have left to do on that front.

we should be thinking about get slightly more concrete-I'm going to talk about the thresholds in gone back and forth about this.  I'm very much in our reaction function, but I feel that the thresholds much.  We have done simulations in Minneapolis, and I think this was here at the Board:  The impact of the thresholds depends critically on after they're hit.  It's going to depend on whether President Plosser or President about our reaction function as a whole, not about these bits Those are just some broad statements about how accommodation.  So let me the statement and in paragraph B(3).  I've favor of our communicating something about really aren't saying very confirmed by work done what happens Evans gets to pull the levers at that moment in time.  We have to do a better job.  What we should be communicating is really

January 24-25, 2012

reaction I'll talk about in a second, is that it is a that it's we might like about the full I hope we can start to try to work on what the right way to for now, between B(3) and I think the thresholds say so little about the policy, about how and pieces.  So I think we should be working toward forming a more holistic view of this issuewhat sort of loss function do we want to use, and what does that imply about our function?  And we should be thinking about what's the best way to communicate that reaction function to the public.  The benefit of the statement, as vote by the Committee of what policy should be.  The problem with the statement is pretty compressed.  It's a little hard to communicate as effectively as range of our reaction function.  But solve that problem might be.  We can certainly offer more guidance in the minutes, for example, about what our reaction function might look like.  So I would say that B(3 ′) , I'd prefer B(3 ′) because much stimulus we're really offering, and they don't tell us very much about what the Committee is planning to do once we get there.

Economic Projections.  I was this-that the This was actually a was not in favor of releasing the projections rate in their current form.  I don't think it serves us well to be trying to we happened to be in over the next four years or into the long run.  What forward guidance a policy decision by the Committee, the voting members of the Committee, on policy going forward.  I don't think the SEP is that, and that's not what as some people fed funds rate projections in the So now let me close by talking about the Summary of actually pretty concerned to hear a number of the remarks being offered about Summary of Economic Projections can be a replacement for the statement. concern I had about releasing the projections, and I of the federal funds communicate in this way about our separate views on what we would do if charge of monetary policy should be about is what's the likely path of the SEP is about at all.  So in fact, I would argue almost the exact opposite around the Committee have offered.  I think that having the

January 24-25, 2012

will be confused about the SEP actually being a policy statement, which it not been voted upon by the Committee.  So I would say we have to have I'm not a voter, as I said.  I would actually advise saying 'mid-2014' as opposed that is simply, it comes back to this issue about what we're going you say 'late 2014,' it looks as though the Committee is relatively rapidly when you hit the thresholds, because the median is rapidly If you put that into models and think about that, people are going to that as soon as you hit these thresholds, you're going to raise rates rapidly-that's I'm hung up on.  But I do think we have to provide some formal guidance in terms argued before at the meeting, for durations.  I would prefer to be years.  That's something like 11 to could adjust as we go on.  It corresponds to what and then we're automatically go forward.  If we were to keep a duration fixed, then we're not automatically go forward, and I think that would be preferable.  But I've been told this is a Summary of Economic Projections means we have to have a date in the statement, because otherwise, people cannot be because it has a date in there. to 'late.'  And one reason for to do when we hit the thresholds.  If planning to raise rates something like 75 basis points at the end of 2014.  So you're actually raising rates fairly once you start to raise rates. be thinking actually cutting back on the amount of accommodation you're providing.  That's a delicacy; it's not something of dates.  I would prefer, as I've saying-let me see where we are:  late 2014, three 12 quarters.  I think a quarter is something we we usually do-the setting of our policy stance is adjusted to what economic conditions are. Now what's happening is, we set a date, we keep it fixed, tightening as we tightening as we losing battle, so I won't spend any more time on it.  Thank you.

good example of giving up a losing battle, because CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  That's a most people don't follow that.  Governor Yellen.

January 24-25, 2012

B, and for reasons I'll I prefer version 3 , the simple extension of the calendar date, to version 3, the around 2 percentage points at the end of 2014 and inflation to run persistently forecast horizon.  Based on optimal policy simulations conclude that the outlook plainly justifies support the inclusion of language indicating that remain highly accommodative at least through late 2014.  We talked yesterday surrounding our forecast.  'Late 2014' isn't an ironclad promise.  So very quickly, we will retain the option to tighten policy sooner if we confidence interval for the unemployment rate generated by FRB/US simulations is confidence interval lies well above the entire range of a very slim chance that the economy will grow enough to close the unemployment gap over the next three years. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative explain, today ′ threshold approach.  I indicated in the economic go-round that I project unemployment to still exceed NAIRU by below our 2 percent target over the entire and the recommendations of a variety of rules, I additional policy accommodation.  And hence, I policy is likely to about the large uncertainty if the economy recovers think it appropriate.  Nonetheless, I would note that, as shown on page 86 of Tealbook A, the 70 percent 6.5 to 9.1 percent.  In other words, that Committee participants' estimates of the longer-run normal unemployment rate.  Put another way, this confidence interval suggests only rapidly

I submitted, I deemed it appropriate to hold the funds rate at zero I anticipate that the unemployment rate will decline to about 6½ percent under 2 percent.  My projection also incorporates a program of MBS along the lines of alternative A.  I will not advocate moving in that direction today, but am open to either of the approaches in I see significant advantages, given the uncertainties pertaining to the outlook, In the projection that until late 2015, when and inflation will still be purchases I do think such a program deserves serious consideration in the coming months unless the outlook improves.  And if we move in that direction, I alternative A, but

As Bill noted, such thresholds for policy tightening accommodative than those implied by Taylor's 1999 rule, with a NAIRU equilibrium funds rate of 2.  These thresholds are less accommodative than the Tealbook.  In my view, additional stimulus the Taylor(1999) benchmark is appropriate when monetary absence of the lower bound is a by Reifschneider and Williams, and I believe it's appropriate to in the open-ended, or Bullard, approach.  Holding rate has declined below 7 percent, under the 2 percent target, is, as policy simulations, and research concerning the constraints posed by the are only slightly more of 5½ percent and an the ones implied by the optimal policy path in over and beyond that called for by policy has been so long constrained by the zero lower bound.  Substituting future policy accommodation for the easing that would have occurred in the strategy that was studied promote a somewhat stronger recovery, and I think it's also called for in response to the asymmetric downside risk to the forecast.

rate liftoff will a shift in expectations about the path of the Fed's balance sheet. balance sheet will for longer.  That mechanism will tend to amplify the overall benefits of modifying our more-accommodative financial conditions.  For example, if the alternative B, the expectation of policy firming in the first quarter of 2015 Any outward shift in market expectations concerning the date of funds very likely be accompanied by In particular, our exit strategy statement indicates that asset sales will not commence until sometime after we start raising the target funds rate.  Thus, if market participants push out their expectations concerning the liftoff date, they should also anticipate that our stay larger forward guidance to provide Committee adopts would be about six quarters later than investors had been anticipating just a few months ago, and

January 24-25, 2012

normalization could reduce the term premium a bit smaller than the estimated impact of the would be worth even more in gauging the alternatives B and C. the corresponding postponement of balance sheet by around 6 to 12 basis points.  This effect is only maturity extension program.  And this influence difference between

B, with option 3  rather I continue to support with President Evans's comments on conditions and our reaction function that would govern our future.  I think it's clear that the language we have today in 3, that have been expressed about it, is something we need to think more discuss in future meetings.  So I conclude that for today, the wisest calendar date from at least mid-2013 to at least expectations already, but late 2014 may be a bit later My preference for 3  rather than 3 today also reflects a recognition They would need to reconcile the forward for today.  I would not want to threaten the success of our other important I said that of the options on the table today, I support alternative ′ than 3-a preference that may seem surprising in light of my previous comments and past support for the threshold approach in 3.  So I do want to emphasize that very strongly the threshold approach-I agree entirely this-and I hope very much that we will be able to work on this.  I do think it's important for us to provide insight about the economic conduct of monetary policy in the given all of the concerns about and work on and course is to keep things simple by pushing out the late 2014.  Option 3  does provide additional monetary accommodation.  Expectations of such a ′ change may be partly embedded in market than markets now anticipate. ′ that the communications challenges we will confront, if we adopt a formulation along the lines of 3, are formidable.  Market participants would need to understand the distinction between thresholds and triggers, the meaning of the phrase 'below or close to 2 percent,' and how that threshold relates to the 2 percent inflation target. guidance in the statement with the SEP projections and the consensus statement, and I think this is a bridge too far

But adopting B(3 ′) today should not preclude forward that with respect to the approach embodied in option C of simply guidance in the statement in favor of allowing market participants to about the diversity of views in the absolutely have to do in the statement, and the SEP is absolutely no on the evolution of unemployment or inflation, and they may differ from approach I could not support. Finally, I want to say eliminating any forward draw inferences just based on the SEP, I want to associate myself very strongly with the comments of Presidents Lockhart and Kocherlakota.  I have supported publicly supplying policy projections in the SEP to provide greater transparency Committee as well as the assumptions that underlie the economic projections that we've long been providing to the public.  But I feel it is incumbent on the Committee members to form a collective policy judgment and to communicate that judgment to the public.  And I think that that's something that we substitute for that.  I would point out that often in the statement, we do make statements about the Committee's views what people would see in the SEP as well.  So to me, a poll of all participants is simply no substitute for a collective Committee judgment, and that's an

I would be ready to take any growth.  As I noted yesterday, one fundamental driver that particularly concerns me is MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Before contractionary steps, I'd like to see more-sustained improvement in the fundamental drivers of economic real disposable income, which actually edged down in the second and third quarters, not up. These weak income data suggest that the growth in consumption that we have seen will have to be supported by credit growth, and without large jumps in consumer confidence or household wealth, I think rapidly rising credit would not be particularly desirable or sustainable.  So consumption and growth could sputter out.  Until we move away from a sputter-out possibility, I'm not inclined to begin contractionary steps.

I support paragraph 3  for this meeting, I think a paragraph 3 has some desirable features that should not be our tools.  First, I think that the three conditions get-with our statutory Including inflation expectations also seems important if we're going to say that I like the flexibility I think we should be open to allowing inflation to be above the number we choose, but including well-anchored inflation would not tolerate much more than that.  I also like that the clarity federal funds rate path is likely to change. numbers is a serious question, but one that I think would be worth our For now, I support alternative B.  While ′ structure similar to the first version of overlooked as we continue to consider the use of that have been articulated are probably the closest we can get to the correct conditions to focus on:  the unemployment rate, the inflation rate, and the state of long-term inflation expectations. The first two conditions line up-not perfectly, but as close as we can mandate. inflation should remain close to, say, 2 percent rather than below 2 percent. that the 'close to' language allows, because temporarily and modestly expectations makes it clear we of the conditionality would encourage an automatic response in market participants' expectations.  In other words, as conditions change, the markets have instant and contemporaneous information about whether the Determining the correct effort to continue to consider.

It's worth noting that from a governance perspective, it would be misleading, if between voters and nonvoters to become fuzzy.

Within that alternative, I ′ gives consider raising the federal funds rate.  Having those threshold conditions then forms the basis for the date of liftoff, late 2014 in this particular case, and I'm a better way to go.

You're basically forcing people to Relying just on a date, I think, is inadequate in terms of how we communicate to the market, and there did the date come from? figure out what the thresholds are themselves, when in fact we could provide more clarity by

Two, communicating thresholds makes the process more If the data are strong and this makes it more likely that the unemployment rate is going more quickly, then the date more fluid. as the outlook changes.  This makes us less locked into the date than we are currently. not been fluid under our current approach.  We've been operating with August, and I'm uncomfortable with the fact that we're going from the that as our outlook changed, that continuous adjustment.  Three, I also think providing information about benefits of reducing uncertainty and risk about the economy's trajectory, but to the we're likely to react to the economy as it a positive outcome.  So we should still work on this, see if it's providing some dynamic. to fall more sharply or that inflation is projected to climb above 2 percent market participants will change their assessment of the likely timing of liftoff, and we'll do the same thing as our projections change.  I think this is good because it makes It changes I note that the date has the middle of 2013 since middle of 2013 to late 2014 all in one jump.  It seems to me should have been a more our reaction functions is important in terms of the premiums.  Of course, there's still the uncertainty extent we can make it less uncertain about how evolves, that has to be viewed as actually possible to put in the statement.

problem is that it collection of unemployment projections, If it's not possible to put in the statement, we should try to find other means of communicating this same thing because this is something that the markets want to understand, and I don't think the SEP is a substitute for this.  As people have said, one represents participants, not voters, but there's another problem with the SEP.  We're not actually providing forecasts in the SEP.  We're just providing a GDP projections, and interest rate projections that are amalgamated in this very odd way, which also makes me uncomfortable with using the SEP.  Second of all, the SEP is not a Committee

I think the Committee needs to come to a view is, with everyone giving a little bit around the edges. view.  It's a collection of individual forecasts, and consensus about what its want to talk a little bit about agency MBS.  There is a logic to actually doing more a logic to even doing it at this meeting.  We are far away great. survey made clear, market participants do not expect an agency MBS year.  So my view is, as long as we don't jostle those expectations about, what's likely an LSAP at this yet any significant cost.  Second, I think waiting a bit allows us to the acceleration in growth in the fourth quarter Are the improvements in financial conditions and in the mood In a sense, we currently own an option on the agency MBS could argue that this option has value that we would lose if we embarked on such At the same time, I don't think we want to change the current market communicate it's very we all communicate, that we risk today that people will look at what we're doing as, run out of ammunition.  They're extending the date.  There's no further action.  The I agency MBS purchases.  In fact, there's from achieving our objectives, and the SEP projections and the extension of the date to late 2014 certainly underscore that.  That said, I don't think the costs of waiting a bit longer are very First, as the primary dealer program to be embarked on at this meeting, but in fact, they think that there's a reasonably high probability-I think about 55 percent probability-that something is going to happen sometime later this going forward, we could actually maintain most of the benefits from doing meeting without incurring gather more information about the outlook.

So in terms of how we important that we make it clear that we're prepared to do more if economic conditions warrant. It's very important in how the Chairman communicates, and how don't take this off the table.  There is a 'Oh, they've

That would actually as a as the language of removing the last sentence of paragraph B(2)-'However, the to pay close attention to the evolution of inflation and inflation I think the idea of taking it out was, one, for unemployment, and, two, we're becoming more at least for me, that it makes sense to take this out now to indicate that we feel As far Committee will continue expectations'-I'm slightly inclined to taking it out. we don't have a similar sentence comfortable with the inflation outlook than we were before-inflation seems to be coming down. The view was, more comfortable with the inflation outlook.  To keep it in creates asymmetry in terms of how we're thinking about inflation versus how we're thinking about unemployment.

However, I would argue you individually, you look at your own rate projections and your policy analysis, to ask whether you are year or two, but out through 2016.

And of course, the staff should be looking at some of at our next meeting. that has inflation below target for that a projection of inflation below target for a considerable period, beyond the normal lags in monetary policy, in most cases would be suboptimal, and I would ask each of as assuming that rates will be such that inflation remains below target not just for a for a very long period.  For instance, I note that the Tealbook-of course, not everyone agrees with the Tealbook-has inflation about 1.5 percent you can construct a balanced approach, which means weight on both sides of the dual mandate, that would give need to get some more indicating that inflation is well below remains stubbornly high, then I think that we would need to take we consider these details relating to alternatives that we might at least want to consider any discussion of B(4).

I mean on that point, I think that we should just agree that the words direction is of that change, then why don't we just keep it the 'moderate' one, I think, is a more substantive issue, and that's a question of whether the Committee wants to downgrade change in the

I'm really curious as to how you would respond if asked about the end of 2014, leaving MR. LACKER.  But fact that 11 out of 17 SEP projections have us increasing rates before the only six- the SEP projections as useful input, but of course it's going to CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I would respond that we changed it from 'end of' to 'late' for exactly that reason, since 11 of 17 have rates at the end of 2014 at 1 percent or less.  Again, I will say that the Committee takes make a judgment.

I'm really curious about-we debated commitment, the MR. LACKER.  The other thing extent to which there's commitment, and it's still sort of murky to me.
