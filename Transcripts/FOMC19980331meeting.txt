MR.  FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  will e referring    a b to package  of  materials at  ou  should ave  in  front  f ou. It egins ith  a th y h o y b w one-page  summary of  my comments. 1/

Going over  the  summary,  the  first int s hat he  short-term d po i t t an forward  interest  te urves or he  G-3 countries main  relatively  at. ra c f t re fl Second,  I  will e  commenting that reed  eclipses  ear n  asset  arkets, b g f i m except n  Japan.  My  third  oint ill e  that he lat  orward  pricing  f i p w b t f f o short-term  nterest  tes  eflects,    my view,  a "clearing ice" or i ra r in pr f divergent  iews  about  the irection  f he ommittee's  ext  move,  not  a v d o t C n conviction  bout  the  likelihood   steady olicy. f    am right  bout hat, a of p I I a t then  there  s  something f  a problem.  Why  hasn't e isk remium i o th r p associated  ith  this  ncertainty en  more evident  n  the reasury ield w u be i T y curve?  I  offer  wo  tentative swers  to hat. ne is hat,  n  general, t an t O t i expanding  risk ppetites ve  consumed the  uncertainty r he  moment. a ha fo t Secondly  and  more technically, uctions   Treasury upply oth  actual red in s b and  anticipated, bined with  the  flat  orward oney market  curve com f m recently  ave  been  encouraging ealers  o  extend  duration, d  that as h d t an h tended  to  flatten e  Treasury ield urve.  Finally, ill iscuss  esk th y c I  w d D preparations r he  heavy  tax nflows n  April nd  May  that ill ause  a fo t i i a w c sharp  rise  n  the reasury alance nd lead nce  again  to  a  need  for uch i T b a o m larger  perations an  normal. o th

Turning  to  the harts n page  2 that how current, month  forward, c o s 3and  9-month  forward  deposit  ates,  ou can  see  that  hese ates  emain r y t r r relatively  at  n  all hree harts. nly  in  Germany, the  blue  lines,   there fl i t c O is much  of  a spread etween  the urrent  -month  rate nd  the  9-month  forward b c 3 a 3-month  rate. n  the hart  or he  United tates,  he  red  lines,  ou will ote I c f t S t y n see  that  orward  rate  xpectations cked  up following  he  Chairman's f e ba t Humphrey-Hawkins  testimony,  ut  they ave  not  backed  up  to  the  levels b h where  they  closed t  the  end  of  last  ear. a y

Looking at  the  chart or erman  rates, u can see  that here ontinues f G yo t c to  be  a  wide  spread etween  current  nd forward ates  elative  he b a r r tot spreads or apan  and  the  United tates.  hat  spread eflects  e f J S T r th anticipation  at  he  European  Central  ank,  when it omes into xistence th t B c e next  January,  robably ill ave  a policy  ate omewhere in  the id 3 p w h r s m percent ange;  -1/2  percent  s hat most  people  in  the arket  expect. he r 3 i w m T Bundesbank's  current  ate  s  3.3  percent.  ven with  that  n  the ackground, r i E i b I  think  he erman  economy and the uropean  economies  more generally t G E are  perceived  o e doing  a  bit etter an  they  were  earlier,  d  it s t b b th an i noteworthy hat  oth  Finland nd  Norway raised  heir  ates. o,  if nything, t b a t r S a the  market  has  a  sense f  some upside isk  o  interest  tes  n  Europe, ven o r t ra i e if  he otential crease  s  very  moderate. t p in i

Finally,    the ottom  chart ou can  see  that  apanese eposit  ates, in b y J d r both  current  nd  forward, eclined  n  February nd  March. This  reflects a d i a some decline  n  the apanese ank  premium. Unfortunately,  is  s  not  so i J b th i much the  result   an improvement  in  the  credit  tanding  f he ndividual of s o t i institutions   rather,    my  view,  a reassertion    the  convoy  system  and but in of

the  implicit vernment  guarantee  ehind  the  major  Japanese anks.  The go b b Japanese overnment  simply  will ot  let  hose anks  fail, d that as g n t b an h pulled ome of  the isk remium out  of  the  forward ate arket. s r p r m

With  that ather  uted monetary  policy  utlook n  the  G-3 countries, r m o i the  charts  n  the ext age  suggest  n  my  view  how  greed as  eclipsed  ear o n p i h f in  a umber of he  asset  arkets.  In  our  written  eport,  detailed at n t m r we th phenomenon across   number of  individual rkets.  This  is   quick a ma a summary.

On the  left  ide,  e have  equity  ndices  e-indexed  o  July , 997,  and s w i r t 1 1 total  eturn  ond indices  or he  United  States,  ermany, and  Japan.  The r b f t G red  lines  how the quity ndices  rading  p  from  a  100 value n July  nd s e i t u o 1a the  blue ines  ndicate e  total  eturn  n 10-year ond indices. l i th r o b

On the  right  ide,  e have  indexed he  option mplied olatility s w t i v on equity  nd  bond  futures  n  the -3 countries.  e  plotted  he  price  f  an a i G W t o option nd  its mplied olatility  each  of he  contracts,  t  they  are a i v on t bu indexed  to  place hem on comparable  terms,  gain  with  100  on July ,  997. t a 1 1 You can  see  that  he  upward  shifts   volatility t ccurred n  October  and t in tha o i November have  been reversed,  specially    U.S.  and  German  equity e in markets.

Generally peaking,  ou can  see  that  inancial set  rices  n  the nited s y f as p i U States  nd Germany have  been  consistently  sing  ince he  November a ri s t period nd  their  olatilities  sistently  lling,  though t s  noteworthy a v con fa al i i that  n  the  last  ew days  there  as  been  some uptick  n  the  implied i f h i volatilities  oth  the  United  States  nd Germany. in  b a

The bottom  panel, f  course, hows that  apan  is  quite   different ory. o s J a st You can see  the  poor  performance f  the ikkei, ut  it id  rally  arly his o N b d e t year,  nd  total  eturns  Japanese overnment  bonds  have  improved.  The a r on g authorities  re working  quite ard  over  the  last  uarter  o et  the ikkei  to we h q t g N close t  the  18,000  level,  n  effort  hat  id ot  succeed.  On this  ndex  scale, a a t d n i 89 would be  equal  to  the  18,000  level. n  Tokyo,  they  even  invented   new I a term  for his  ffort.  raditionally,   arket  has  referred   PKO,  meaning t e T them to price eeping  operations,  ere public ension unds  and  the  like re  used k wh p f a to  support quities.   the  last  onth or  so, hey ave  relabeled  hese LO, e In m t h t P price ifting erations.  s you can see, he  Japanese uthorities  d  their l op A t a ha only  success n  early anuary,  nd  since hen  they  have  succeeded nly  in i J a t o lifting  e  level f  volatilities,  strated  the  right. th o illu on

I  did  ot hart he  last  ew days.  With the ailure   the ikkei  to  close n c t f f of N at  the  18,000 evel t apan's  iscal  ear-end,  he arkets  are  quite  nxious l a J f y t m a at  this  oint. he yen  has  been  weakening  a  bit, flecting  mething f  a p T re so o sense  in he  markets hat he  Japanese uthorities  e  without   policy  t  this t t t a ar a a

point. hile  we hear hat ne more package  is  coming,  it s  not  clear  hat W t o i t the  package  is oing  to  do anything or he  financial ctor, d  the  markets g f t se an are  quite  ynical  bout  what is ikely  o appen. c a l t h

The next  page  provides nother  ay of  thinking  bout  how risk a w a appetites ve  been  expanding.  I  return  o  a table  hat    showed to  the ha t t I Committee  last  ugust  in  which I  introduced  he ifferent ilosophies A t d ph of four  characters    their  earch f  a  return  n  financial rkets--the timists in s o i ma op and  pessimists der  the  old  paradigm  and  the ew paradigm. un n

The top  half  f  this  able  s  identical    form  to he ne that    presented o t i in t o I to  the ommittee  last  ugust.  It  shows  the  old  paradigm  pessimist o is C A wh worried  about  an  imminent  breakout f nflation  d  the  old  paradigm o i an optimist  ho thinks nflation  y be  coming but  the  Fed  may be  able o w i ma t delay  it or   few quarters.  e  have  the  new paradigm  optimist  ho thinks f a W w the  economy has  entered    new era  and  he  does  not  worry  about nflation a i at all.  We  have  the ew paradigm  pessimist  ho thinks  hat eflation   upon n w t d is us.  I  introduced  hese our haracters st  ugust  to  help  explain  he t f c la A t volatility were  then  experiencing   the  markets, ncluding  ntraday we in i i volatility,   these our haracters re duking  it ut  in  the  markets. and f c we o I reintroduce em here  to  show briefly w they  would have  fared o  date. th ho t

Had you run  a  portfolio  nsistent th  the  views  of he ld  paradigm co wi t o pessimist, orting  tocks nd  bonds  as shown here  at he  bottom, ou sh s a t y would have  been  crushed,  o  put  it luntly.  he new paradigm  pessimist, t b T who would have  been short tocks nd  long  bonds, ould have  done  a little s a w better, t  his ositive  eturn  n  bonds  would  not  have  come close  o bu p r i t offsetting  s egative  eturn  n  stocks. hi n r i

The two optimists uld have  done fairly ll, bviously.  he point wo we o T is, f  course,  hat  he  pessimistic  ews, he  skeptical ews, ave  simply o t t vi t vi h been  priced  ut  of his  arket  and are ot  being eflected   the o t m n r in performance  of  the  market. If you were trying  o  manage money on the t basis f  those iews,  you  were stopped ut  long  ago. o v o

Turning  to he  next  page,   depict  n  the op anel hree ifferent t I i t p t d trajectories  the  implied ields  n  the ed  funds  futures  ontracts. e of y o f c Th blue  line hows  these ield rajectories he  time  of  the  August  meeting, s y t at  t the  green  line n  early  anuary,  nd  the ed  line s  of  last  riday. y  view, i J a r a F M as  I  mentioned, s hat  he  steady ath f he ed  funds ates  mplied y i t t p o t f r i b these ontracts flects  clearing  rice mong divergent  iews  regarding c re a p a v the  direction  he  Committee's ext  move. oft n

Forgive e if ou saw it,  ut  Friday's ll  Street  ournal ad  a  lovely m y b Wa J h item  in  it hat ummarized a  recent  oll f he  36  primary ealers.  t t s p o t d I showed that one  expects  he ed  to  change  interest  tes  t his eeting. n t F ra a t m

But  the  survey lso evealed that  here  s o clear  onsensus n the a r " t i n c o direction  f he  Fed's ext olicy hift."  ixteen  ealers  redicted o t n p s S d p a tightening,  elve n easing,  even  saw the ed on hold  for t  least  he tw a s F a t foreseeable  uture, d  one said t  was not  possible  o  assess  ccurately f an i t a what  the ed will o. F d

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Give him an "A." [Laughter]

MS.  MINEHAN. Give  us  an "A."

MR.  FISHER.  With  that egree  of  uncertainty,   isn't ere d why th more of  a isk remium evident n  the  yield urve?  I hink,  s  I aid,  hat r p i c t a s t expanding  risk ppetites  ssociated  ith  the  bull arket  in  financial sets a a w m as have  consumed the  premium and therefore rtially  scured  it. he charts pa ob T showing  the  bond and  equity  arket  returns  nd  the  implied olatilities m a v speak  for hemselves. round the  middle  of  last  eek,  both  the mplied t A w i volatilities onds  and equities d  the  yield urve  did  begin  to  back  up. I on b an c certainly uld have  been  a  buyer  of  volatility he  low  levels  eached n wo at  t r i the  middle  of ast  eek. l w

In  my  view,  this  ackup  in  volatilities  in  the ield urve robably b and y c p reflects  o  things. ne is hat he arket  is eginning  o  price n  some tw O t t m b t i uncertainty    recognition  f  the  greater  ncertainty  out  direction. in o u ab Secondly, he  market  may also e  pricing  n he  very  small robability  at t b i t p th the  Committee  will ct  at  this  eeting, ven  though  it till ews  a  move as a m e s vi an  extremely  nlikely  vent. hen  markets  begin  to  get  anxious,  hey u e W t sometimes  price  n  a  little   hat nxiety.  hat  adjustment  ay  come out  of i oft a T m the  market  after  he  meeting f  he ommittee does  not  make any  change. t i t C The other ind  of  adjustment  ay be  more enduring. k m

Turning  to  the ext  chart, second  explanation at  entioned s  that n a th Im i the  reductions   Treasury upply,  oth  actual nd  anticipated,  mbined in s b a co with  a  flat  orward oney market  curve  recently  ave  been  encouraging f m h dealers  o  extend uration, nding o  flatten e  Treasury  ield urve.  I t d te t th y c hope you will ear  with  me while  I xplain  his  hart. b e t c

At  the ast  eeting,  howed the  Committee  a  chart f  the ield urve l m Is o y c on a  constant  aturity  asis  s  each  of he n-the-run  ssues  raded  hrough m b a t o i t t the  funds ate.  oted  that  ith  numerous  issues  rading  hrough he unds r In w t t t f rate,  any saw that s  encouraging  n  expectation   the arket  that  n m a a in m a easing ove was coming. But  showing  you only  the  yield  urve  relative m c to the  fed unds  target  ate as an incomplete  icture.  n  pricing  n-the-run f r w p I o Treasury ssues, alers  re  not  significantly strained  the evel f  the i de a con by l o funds  rate. ather,  heir  ost f  carrying  n-the-run  ssues  s eflected    the R t c o o i i r in term-to-date  po  rates. re

In  the  top anel, he  red  line ndicates e  10-year n-the-run  ield. he p t i th o y T bottom  blue  line s he  term-to-date  rate or he  on-the-run  0-year i t RP f t 1 maturity  s  it raded ver  the  past ear. his  rate s   declining  aturity a t o y T i a m repo.  On  the irst y  of  a  refunding  ycle,  t s   90-day  instrument;  the f da c i i a on last  ay, t s  a 1-day  instrument.  o,  it as  a  declining  aturity  s  it oves d i i S h m a m across  he  chart. t

There  are  a number of  factors  hat nfluence is  ate,  bviously. ne is t i th r o O the  remaining erm.  A second  is he  scarcity   a  Treasury ssue.  s we t t of i A move  through  each  auction ycle,  he  outstanding easury ssues  ecome c t Tr i b more and  more scarce. he on-the-run  ssue  s  purchased y  people ho T i i b w actually nt to  hold  it,  ather  han  just  o  trade t r  to edge  with  it. o,  as wa r t t i o h S you come to  each  of he  dotted ertical nes  n the  chart,  ou see  a greater t v li o y and  greater  carcity lue.  Of course,  he erm  structure  he  money s va t t oft market  also ffects  his  ate. a t r

The purpose f  the  top  panel  is o  help ou  understand  he ottom  two o t y t b panels y  putting  hem  in  context.  n the eft, u can  see  a  snapshot f he b t O l yo o t entire  ield urve  and  the  term-to-date  po  rates  or he n-the-run  ssues  s y c re f t o i a of  the  Friday efore ast arch's eeting.  On  the  right, u see  the ame b l M m yo s as  of his  ast riday. ach of hese ates s  roughly n  the iddle  of he t p F E t d i i m t auction ycles--the rst-quarter  unding  nd  the  second-quarter funding. c fi ref a re They are  off y only  a  few  days.  What you can  see  is  that ven  though  the b e yield urve  has  moved  down, there  s  still  positive rry cross he ntire c i a ca a t e curve.  What you also an see  is ow much more attractive  e  carry s n c h th i o the  10-year ow  relative    the  short nd  than t as last  ear. n to e i w y

The purpose f  this  ather  omplicated  icture  s o  make two simple o r c p i t points.  irst,   be  clear, e arginal uyers  and  sellers   on-the-run F to th m b of Treasury ecurities  e  not  significantly strained   the  funds  rate tself s ar con by i but  rather  y the ost f  financing, rticular  -the-run  ssues  n  the epo b c o pa on i i r market.  There, he  rates  re  significantly  ected  y  the  supply nd t a aff b a demand conditions  or hose articular  sues  nd  by  the  term  structure f t p is a of the  money market.

Second,  at  present  he ositive rry n  the arket  is aking  it elatively t p ca i m m r more attractive  r ealers  o  extend  duration  nto  he  10-year ector.  o, fo d t i t s S while  real nvestors   nonleveraged  nvestors e eing  drawn out  along  the i or i ar b yield urve  in  search f igher  bsolute  eturns, e  dealers  re  being ulled c o h a r th a p to  some extent  nto he  10-year ector  n  search f  the  carry. hese  are  not i t s i o T the  only  factors at ffect  he evel  f  the ield urve  by any  means,  but  I th a t l o y c think hey  are  important  nes  for s  to  understand. t o u

Finally, rning  o  domestic perations  n the  last  age,  our  operations tu t o o p over  the  last  eriod ave  been  detailed  ur  written  eports, d  I  thought p h ino r an I would focus  on  the  upcoming  period. ast ay, Governor  Rivlin hided L M c

me and  my colleagues  or he 50 billion  ositive rprise   the  Treasury f t $ p su in balance elative    our  projections.  at  positive rprise flected r to Th su re a positive  reasury ncome surprise.  thought  t ight  be  helpful  o  review T i I i m t how we are  doing  so  far his  ear nd  to  anticipate  e esk's perations t y a th D o in April nd May. a

At  the op  of he age,  we have shown the  forecasts d  actual  esults r t t p an r fo last  ear's  irst o  quarters.  t  the  top  left  ou can  see he  forecasts   the y f tw A y t by Treasury,  he  Board, nd  the ew  York staffs  f irst-  arter  reasury t a N o f qu T budget  receipts. e actual  s hown in  red  and  the  percent  rrors  f  the Th i s e o three orecasts e  indicated  n the ight  ide f hat irst x. In  the  right f ar o r s o t f bo side anel  at  the op, ou can  see  the  to  10 percent  isses  in  projected p t y 7 m Treasury evenues or he  first arter  hat reated  he ositive  urprises r f t qu t c t p s of some $40  to  $50 billion.

The next  two  panels how how we are  doing  this  ear.  On the  left  re s y a the  forecasts r he  first arter  y  the reasury,  he oard, nd  the ew fo t qu b T t B a N York staffs  nd  the  preliminary  ctual utcome.  The  Treasury's recast a a o fo was right  n the  money, and  the oard  and  New  York are oing  a little o B d better  han  last  ear n  their  orecasting.    the ight  anel, ou see he t y i f In r p y t April-June  orecasts.  e  have  a rather  ide  range  of bout  $30  billion f W w a separating  ew  York and  Washington, ith  the  Treasury ight  n  the N w r i middle.

The bottom  picture  ranslates  is nto ur  estimates  f  the aily t th i o o d Treasury alances  t  the  Fed.  The latter se  harply  nce  the reasury b a ri s o T reaches he  ceiling   its  T&amp;L t on T account  capacity  n  the anking ystem. i b s The differences tween the  New  York and  the  Board estimates,    I be as understand  t,  re  not  related   differences    nominal  GDP  forecasts t  in i a to in bu some of  the  nuances  of ax  collection.   do  have  a  bit f  a  gap  here,  ut t We o b the  estimates  racket  ast  ear's  ctual  reasury alances,  he otted reen b l y a T b t d g line.

I hink e are  all to t w puzzled  by  the resumption f  the  Japanese uthorities  at  hey an  somehow  have  an effective p o a th t c program  to  change  the tock arket  and  announce  it. t s  questionable ough to  believe  hat s m I i n t the  government  can substantially er  he  level  f  the  stock arket.

MR. FISHER.  Oh, it  s  still sitive;   can  still e  it. i po we se

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. If    could  make a comment:  The people n  the I i market  think hat he  single  east  ise  thing he apanese ould  have  done was  to  reconstitute t t l w t J c he convoy system.  But  that  s xactly  hat they ave  done. As a  result,  e  view  is  that  he  19 i e w h th t largest  anks  have  become a sovereign  redit, d  therefore e remium was created nd  there b c an th p a is  still  premium. a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The premium has  to  be  a reflection  oubts  about  the ofd sovereign redit. c

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Precisely,  d  even  though  there s   perception an i a that  he  bank  that  ailed, kkaido  Takushoku,  was managed reasonably  ell  when it ollapsed, t f Ho w c

the  Japanese re  convinced hat hey  did  a terrible  b  because hey  did  not  anticipate  e a t t jo t th collapse.    think  he  market  is aying hat, s,  there  s  a convoy  and  there  s overeign redit, I t s t ye i i s c but  if  here s n accident, e inding  down  of he  institution  l e  managed very  badly. t i a th w t wil b Therefore,  here s  concern  that hat ould  have  a contagion  ffect.  ith reference  o  the asel t i t c e W t B ratios, hink here s  a general eeling  hat he  stated  atios  re  meaningless  n  assessing e I  t t i f t t r a i th condition  f apanese anks.  The rest f  us  play  game where the atios  ean something,  ut o J b o a r m b for  the apanese anks  they  really  o  not.  We  have  a sovereign redit  ith  a  question  ssociated J b d c w a with  it,  s  you suggested. a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. They have always  had  the  opinion hat ince hey t s t would never  let   bank fail, e  Basel  ratios re  irrelevant. a th we

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Exactly.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The fact hat  hey  agreed o  the asel  ratios  as  always t t t B h implied  very  unusual dmixture. n the  one  hand,  every  Japanese ommercial  bank  is  backed a a O c by  Japan's  overeign  redit, d  on the  other and, hey ave  met  their  asel  ratios.  his  creates s c an h t h B T confusion. t as  to  be terribly  nfusing  o  a lot f  our  colleagues  n  Japan  who  are  wondering I h co t o i where all his  s  going.  Other  questions  or eter? t i f P

MR.  JORDAN. Peter,  ou made what  was almost  a  passing eference  o  the  fact  hat y r t t intermediate-term  easuries  ad  traded hrough he unds  rate his  ear,  nd you indicated  hat Tr h t t f t y a t many saw that evelopment  as  reflecting  pectations   some easing  n  the  funds ate. ut  the d ex of i r B alternative  planation  s hat rading  hrough he  funds  rate  s onsistent th  an expectation at ex i t t t t i c wi th the  funds ate ill e  increased.  e  had  at  least   brief  iscussion  hat n the  call ver he  last r w b W a d oft o o t week or  so.  With regard o  our  credibility  a central  ank, ne  of  your  people  commented that t as b o if  n  a  gold  standard  ype orld  there as growing  credibility t  he  central  ank  was going  to i t w w ha t b

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't  hink   need  to.  I  think ou've aid t ery  well. t I y s i v

MR.  JORDAN. I'm  asking bout  Street  alk  r  views  on  this  ssue. a t o i

MR.  FISHER.  I  don't  hink he  Street's  cus n that  ypothesis  ould be  at  the hort t t fo o h w s end of  the  coupon  curve, ut  if here  ere an anticipation    an  easing ove,  the treet  ould b t w of m S w talk bout  expecting   rally  urther t  on the ield urve.  In  January,  n  fact,  observed hat a a f ou y c i we w I  was talking  bout n  the  chart  hat    showed at he  last  eeting. s I said hen,   think  he a i t I t m A t I t market  was responding  o  recent  peeches y  the  Chairman and Governor  Meyer,  which  were t s b interpreted    indicating   increased  ikelihood   an  easing ction. hat  is hen the  short  nd as an l of a T w e of  the oupon curve  traded hrough  the  funds ate.   do not  dispute  hat hat  you have  described c t r I t w can  happen  and the treet  oes  talk bout t hat  ay,  but  what  was happening n  January as  the S d a i t w i w other cenario. s

MR.  KOHN. But  wouldn't t  lso eflect,  esident rdan, he  expectation at, i a r Pr Jo t th unless  here as a  negative  erm  premium,  nominal  short-term tes  ould fall  t  some point  o t w t ra w a s that he  expected olding eriod ield  rom  rolling er  overnight  nstruments  nd  two-year t h p y f ov i a instruments  ould be  equal. w

MR.  JORDAN. I  was thinking  ore in  terms f  the  5- to  10-year ange.  If eople m o r p anticipated ransitory  celeration    inflation  at  e would  respond  to,  e would expect he a  t ac of th w w t yield  urve  to e  downward  sloping  n  that  onger-term  ange. c b i l r

MR.  KOHN. Right, ecause  inflation  uld  come down  and short-term tes ould b wo ra w move up.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Further  uestions  or eter?  If ot, ould somebody q f P n w like  o  move to  ratify e ctions  f he esk? t th a o t D

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. So moved.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.  et  us  move on to ike Prell  nd L M a Larry  Promisel.

MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  think t ould be i w appropriate  or e to  begin  this  orning  by  acknowledging hat,  es, ou f m m t y y did  tell  s  so  last  onth. You said hat ur  GDP  forecast  or his  ear u m t o f t y probably as too  low,  and  now we have  raised  t ppreciably.  oreover, w i a M a little  ading etween  the  lines  f  the  Greenbook  would indicate at,  ven re b o th e with  the evisions  have  made,  we are omewhat more concerned  about r we s the  possible  pside isks  o  our orecasts r emand and  inflation  an u r t f fo d th about  the  downside  risks.

With that  s  preamble, et e engage  in  a  little nd-reading  nd a l m mi a attempt  o  anticipate ew of  the  questions  ou might  have  about ur t a  f y o revised  orecast. f

First, n't e  upward-revised  DP  growth  rate f  3.1  percent  hat is th G o t we're  showing  for he  first arter  till ther  kimpy, specially    light  f t qu s ra s e in o the  strength  f he abor arket  indicators? o t l m

That's  ertainly easonable  uestion. udging y the  growth  of c a  r q J b employment and hours  through  February nd  the ontinuing  ow level  f a c l o jobless  laims,  he  increase  n  labor  nput lmost  surely  as well  above  the c t i i a w average  of  recent  uarters.  oreover,  the ata n consumption, ousing, q M d o h and equipment  purchases oint  o  a  large  ain  in  private  omestic inal p t g d f sales. owever,  it s  also rue hat  he  January igures  or et  exports nd H i t t t f f n a inventory  nvestment ere  much weaker  than  their  espective urth-quarter i w r fo averages.  Even when we plug  in  what seem like mple  numbers  for hese a t two variables  n  February  and  March, we still d  up  with  a  drop-off  n  GDP i en i growth.

But,  you might  ask, oesn't  hat  ust  mply  an implausible  rop  in  labor d t j i d productivity?  es,  it oes  imply  a  drop, ut  obviously  ot  one  we find Y d b n implausible.  utput  per  hour  has  risen  onsiderably   the ast wo  years O c in p t relative   the  underlying  rend mbedded in  our  projection--the  d  of to t e kin pickup  that  ne  might  expect o  accompany an acceleration   roduction. o t ofp If e have  it ight,  movement back  toward  the  trend ine as to  be w r a l w expected ver  time--and,  iven  the rratic aracter  f he  series, o g e h o t a substantial  op  in  some quarter  ould  be  far rom  shocking. hat  said,  n dr w f T i

the  present  ase,  e also ould  not  be  stunned f  he pending ata  coming c w w i t s d in  over he  next ew weeks were to  point o  a  larger  ain n  Q1  GDP. t f t g i

Well,  you  are  thinking, e irst arter  s istory, yway;  so  the eal th f qu i h an r question  s hat  makes us  think hat  he till eater  oderation f  GDP i w t t s gr m o growth  that  e long  have  been  forecasting   ere  at ast? sn't mestic w ish l I do demand proving o  be  strong nough  to  override  ny  damping  effect  hat t e a t might  be  coming  from the xternal  ector? e s

It  certainly   onceivable  o  me that  hat  we are  going  through ow isc t w n will urn  out  to e  the bverse f  the t b o o 1987-88 experience.  n  that  ase, I c a strong pswing  in  net  exports  elped o  keep  the conomic expansion n u h t e o track  n  the ace f he  stock arket  decline.  his  time  around,   booming i f o t m T a stock arket  might  offset e ffects   a slump  in  net  exports. m th e of

However,  a  few considerations  ad  us  to  conclude hat  his cenario  s le t t s i not  the  most  likely.  will eave t or arry o  discuss  he  incoming I l i f L t t evidence n the  trade  ront. uffice  t o  say  at  this  oint hat  he  recent o f S i t p t t news has  not  undermined  our  notion hat  here  s--and  ill e  for t t i w b a while--an  ppreciable  rag  on activity  ming from  the  external  ector.  t s a d co s I i not ust  n Asia  story;  t s lso he agged  effects  f  a  sizable  umulative j a i i a t l o c appreciation  f he  dollar  ver he  past ew years. o t o t f

But,  that aid,  ould  we be  seriously  nderestimating  e ngoing  thrust s c u th o of  domestic  demand?  As we look  at  it ector  y sector,  do  not  think e s b we w have  stinted  expenditures. ong  other hings,  emand has  been on Am t d boosted  recently   the  decline  n  longer-term  nterest  tes  ver  the  past by i i ra o year,  nd we do  not  foresee  hat nterest  te  rend eing  extended n  any a t i ra t b i meaningful ay. As many have  commented,  this  as  in  part  een  the w h b dividend f  the  Asian  crisis r he  U.S.  economy. To be  sure,  he  predicted o fo t t softening  n  economic  indicators  uld  revitalize  pes  of  Fed  easing. ut, i co ho B unless  he  bond market  bulls  re ble o  push  yields  aterially low the t a a t m be recent ange,  his hould ot  provide   great  mount of  additional imulus. r t s n a a st

Where we might  be  especially lnerable, ough, s ith  respect  o  the vu th i w t stock arket.  At this  oint,  t ppears hat  he  market  has  entered    phase  in m p i a t t a which the  gravitational  ll f aluation  ay no longer  e  operating.  he pu o v m b T PE ratio  or he  S&amp;P  500  recently  eached 7,  based  on trailing  -month f t r 2 12 earnings, en as  companies  were issuing  arnings nd analysts  ere ev w a w lowering heir t 1998 profit  orecasts.   the revailing ychological f In p ps environment,  ith  people ncreasingly  nvinced hat  he  market  will w i co t t inevitably eld eturns  astly  reater  han  those vailable day  on liquid yi r v g t a to fixed-income  nstruments,  e  market  can keep  going  appreciably  igher  n i th h o its wn  momentum--at least  ntil  here  s  an  event arring ough  to  cause o u t i j en people  to  reassess eir  eneral iew  of  the orld. th g v w

For  now, the  market  is n integral rt  f  a  perpetual  otion  machine a pa o m that eeps  the  economy powering  ahead.  We  have  seen  this  efore,  ecently k b r in  Asia, nd  while  I o  not  want  to  overstate at omparison,  he  issues a d th c t about  bubbles hat he  Chairman  raised  n  his  famous  "irrational t t i exuberance" peech  do seem increasingly  levant.  e  pointed ut  once s re W o again  in  the reenbook the  difference  ight  make to  the utlook f  he G itm o i t market  were merely  to  rise  oderately rom  here--rather  an alling m f th f somewhat,  as  we have  predicted.  f  he  market  were  instead  o  keep I t t zooming upward at  20 or  30  percent  er  year,  hen  the onsequences or p t c f aggregate  emand  and  thus or nflationary ssures  ould  be  quite triking. d f i pre c s

This  brings e to  a  final  uestion.  here  seems  to ave  been  some m q T h increase  n  concern bout  inflation  sks  f  late, th  commentators oting i a ri o wi n such  things  s  the ontinued ightness  he  labor arkets,  he ecent  pturn a c t oft m t r u in  oil rices,   the eating  p of  real state  arkets.  Is here omething p or h u e m t s going  on here  beyond  what  we have  captured  n  the  Greenbook? Perhaps, i but  we think hat he pward revision  e have  made to  our  inflation  recast t t u w fo leaves he  risks  easonably  alanced--assuming at  he  predicted  utput  nd t r b th t o a unemployment path  is bout  right. a

As we noted  in  the reenbook, ncreases  n  average ourly arnings G i i h e -- the nly  broad  statistic   available r his  ear--have  ot  been  getting o yet fo t y n discernibly  rger  r  smaller  f ate.  owever,  the  anecdotal  eports  eem to la o o l H r s be  indicating th  increasing equency n acceleration   ompensation wi fr a ofc rates  nd an  increase  n  recruiting  d training sts.  he picture   still a i an co T is uneven,  with  many firms aying hey  are  holding he  line  n pay  and  others s t t o that hey  are  tightly rgeting creases  o  those orkers  in  key  positions t ta in t w or with  "hot"  skills. d, where  pay  is  raised,  ften s hrough lexible rms An ito i t f fo of  compensation hat  an  be  trimmed  more easily  hen business  lackens--a t c w s feature  hat  e think ay be  significant    determining  he  momentum t w m in t of wage inflation  ing  forward.  In  the nd, e bowed only  slightly    the go e w to anecdotal  ews and  raised  ur  compensation orecast st   ouch  more than n o f ju at we would  have  on the asis f  the  lower  unemployment rates  n  this b o i projection.

At  this  oint,  are  sticking th  the  notion hat  he ecline  n p we wi t t d i inflation  d  inflation  pectations er  the  past ear ill xert   significant an ex ov y w e a damping  influence  n nominal  wage increases.  hus  far n 1998,  the  trend o T i in  overall  PI inflation  s  remained  very  favorable, ing to  the  sharp C ha ow decline  n  oil rices.  oreover,  even  with  the ecent  irming  n  oil rices, i p M r f i p the  outlook or his ector  hrough 999 now looks  more favorable  han t f t s t 1 t i did  in  late  anuary,  nd  we have  lowered  our  forecast r etail ergy J a fo r en prices.

On the  other and,  though  it ay be  splitting  irs  o  say  that  he ore h m ha t t c CPI has  increased  ore rapidly  n average n  the  past ouple f  months, m o i c o

there ertainly  s  not  been  any  further wnside  surprise  here.  he c ha do t T deflationary  pact  of  the  Asian  crisis pears o  be  no greater  han  we im ap t t anticipated,  d with  a slightly  wer  dollar  xchange  rate ath his  ime,  he an lo e p t t t projected  ecline  n  non-oil  mport rices  utside  he emiconductor  nd d i i p o t s a computer  sector  s  a  little  allower.  verall,  ur  interpretation he i sh O o of  t incoming  price  ews--coupled ith  the  more inflationary  bor arket n w la m conditions  n  this  rojection--has n  mirrored n  the uarter-point i p bee i q elevation  f  our ore  CPI forecast. o c

In  concluding,  might  remind  you that  e have  not  built  nto he I w i t baseline  rojection y  allowance or he  big  hike  in  cigarette  ices  hat p an f t pr t looms as  a distinct  ssibility.   legislative posals  eep  changing,  s po The pro k a they  did ust  esterday, d  the  only  thing  hat eems certain  ight  ow is j y an t s r n that  here re  lots  f eople illing  o  provide he anufacturers  ith  an t a o p w t t m w excuse  to  raise  heir  rices  harply.  t s asy  to  come up  with  numbers  that t p s I i e would add several  enths  o  the PI inflation  te t  some point.  his  would t t C ra a T present  he  Committee  with  a challenge  t  as  not aced  in  some time--that t i h f is, eciding hether  to  accommodate an adverse,  ather  han  a favorable, d w r t supply  shock.

First, e  crises   Asia:  There  is  an  Asia  effect, though e do  not th in al w have  a systematic  andle n it. e  see  evidence n  the  trade tatistics he h o W i s of  t Asian  economies  themselves.  he combined trade alance f  Korea  and T b o Thailand n  November-December swung from a  deficit   $5 billion i of in 1996 to  a  surplus  f 4 billion   1997--a wing  of  more than 50  billion   an o $ in s $ at annual  rate. e  see  evidence f t  rom the  U.S.  side:  Trade  statistics W o i f for January  show a substantial  cline  n  exports  o  Korea and Thailand. he de i t T U.S.  purchasing  anagers'  survey eports  eak export rders. he m r w o T anecdotal  eports  rom the  special  urvey  conducted y  the  Reserve anks r f s b B contribute bstantially  our  sense  of he eakness  in  exports o  Asia. su to t w t And we see  evidence n  the  trade tatistics apan  and  Europe.  Based  on i s of  J all f  this  omewhat fragmentary  nformation, st  of  the ffect  o  date o s i mo e t seems to  be  on the  side f  Asian  imports,  ot  Asian  exports. o n

The question  ow is ot  whether here  s  a  noticeable fect, t  rather n n t i f bu how  large nd  how long-lasting  at  ffect  ill e.  On  that  core,  bout  all a th e w b s a I would assert  s  that  he  probability    some of  the ore negative  cenarios i t of m s that  e and others  ave  talked  bout as  diminished.  hile  the roblems  in w h a h W p Asia  certainly ve  not  been  solved,  he  situation  tside  f ndonesia--and ha t ou o I perhaps  Malaysia--seems  o ave  stabilized,  d  we can  be  a bit ore t h an m confident  hat  t  least  ome of he  needed  reforms nd  policy easures  will t a s t a m

be implemented.  The  evident  esolve f  the  new government  in  Korea and r o the  success f  the escheduling fort  or laims n Korean banks  have o r ef f c o added  importantly   our  degree f  confidence. to o

Second,  Japan:  Recent  data--including  urth-quarter   and fo GDP indicators r he  first arter--suggest t  he  Japanese conomy is  even fo t qu tha t e weaker  than  we had  been  expecting.  rogress  n  resolving  he roblems  of P o t p the  Japanese anking  system  is  slow, t  best. n the  other  and,  substantial b a O h fiscal  timulus  as  been  signaled, though he  details e  missing,  nd  there s h al t ar a is  some prospect  or timulus  n  the  form  of ax  cuts. hat remains o  be f s i t W t seen, f  course,  s ow  much so-called  real ater" here ill e  behind  the o i h " w t w b headline  igures.    would say  there s  now  some upside isk,  ot ust f I i r n j downside  risk,   the utlook or apan  that  s resented  n  the reenbook. to o f J i p i G

Third, il:  he decline  n  oil rices  hrough id-March was a surprise. o T i p t m If hat  ad  been  sustained,   ould have  been  a central  lement n  the t h itw e i revision  o  our  Greenbook forecast nce anuary. f  course,  he  decline  as t si J O t h not  been  sustained.  il  producing ountries  ave  responded ith  an O c h w agreement  to  cut  production, d  their  ecision  s  sufficiently dible  hat an d i cre t prices  ave  backed  up  quite    bit. e  anticipate  at  rices  ill tay ear h a W th p w s n current  evels, th  expanded  exports rom Iraq orking  to  keep  prices  rom l wi f w f rising  urther ter  his ear  and  next.  The price f il n  our  forecast r f la t y o o i fo 1999 is ow $2 per  barrel  ower  than  in  the anuary reenbook. We  think n l J G the  risks  o il rices  re  fairly enly alanced round  the orecast  ath.  I t o p a ev b a f p might  note hat  he rice f  oil n  our  forecast so s  about 4.50  per arrel t t p o i al i $ b lower  on average n  1998 than t  was in  1997. The decline  n  price  rom last i i i f year  plays  significant  le  n  the llocation  he  burden  of  current a ro i a oft account djustments  n  the orld  and tends o  some extent  o  support lobal a i w t t g aggregate emand. d

Fourth,  he  dollar:  e  have  a small ecline  n  the ollar's  lue uilt t W d i d va b into ur  forecast,    both  nominal  and  real erms  against  he  yen and o in t t European currencies  nd  in  real erms  against  he urrencies  f merging a t t c o e market  economies.  Again,  there re  risks  n  both  sides. specially   the a o E in short  un, e see  some upside isks.  he market  may continue  o  be r w r T t disappointed   the  performance f he  Japanese conomy, putting  urther in o t e f downward pressure  n the  yen.  Problems  in  Indonesia  ould  spread nd o c a Asian  currencies uld  weaken again. ersistent  gor f  the  U.S.  economy co P vi o could  entice  nvestors. d while  the rocess eading  oward  the  next  stage i An p l t of  EMU seems to  be  on track,  here  s  scope  for roblems--associated, t i p for example,  with  the  German  election   September.  However,  over  the  longer in term, hat  we see  as  the eed  for he  dollar  o  decline  o  begin o  correct w n t t t t U.S. current  ccount mbalances ould  assert  tself,  some of  the actors a i c i as f that  ave  been  putting  pward pressure  n  the  dollar  iminish  n  force:  the h u o d i uncertainties  lated   EMU,  the  Asian  crises, d  even  the  weakness  in re to an Japan.

Putting  ll our lements ogether, yself  see  the  balance f isks a f e t I  m o r skewed toward  the  upside,  n  terms f  the  foreign  mpact  on U.S.  demand i o i and  prices.  y  colleagues  robably ould  not  be  so  unequivocal, t  then M p w bu again, his  s ot  their  ast  OMC t i n l F meeting!  [Laughter]

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Larry,   oticed hat n  the  last  ouple f ays  we have In t i c o d had a  particularly ong rade-weighted llar.  ow  much is  the  dollar  bove  expectations str t o H a in the  final  reenbook forecast,  ich I ssume  was put ogether   week to  ten ays  ago? G wh a t a d

MR.  PROMISEL. How  much higher  epends  on what  you mean by  the  dollar.  here d T are  a  lot f ifferent  ys of eighting nd  characterizing   dollar's  erage alue.  It as  gone o d wa w a the av v h up some against  he  yen,  but  I on't  hink here as  been  a  big hange  in  terms f he  various t d t t h c o t weighted  averages hat e use.  I  am  looking or ne  average  that  e employ--it  as 101.3-t w f o w w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is he  G-10 weighted  average? t

MR.  PROMISEL. Yes.

MR.  TRUMAN. On that verage,  he  dollar  s bout ne  percent  igher han t as at a t i a o h t i w the  time  the  Greenbook  went to  press.

MR.  PROMISEL. That's  gainst  he ther -10 currencies,  t  it s p less han  that a t o G bu i u t presumably  against  ome of he  other eighted verages. t oes  not  change  the asic icture. s t w a I d b p

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. The recent  ppreciation  till ise s  far s  the a iss no a a Greenbook forecast   concerned? is

MR. PROMISEL. Absolutely,   our  view. in

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Supposing  the  fiscal  ear urplus  umber  comes in y s n closer  o  the ew  York Bank's stimate  han  ours.  That  would seem to  be  outside  he  noise t N e t t range  in  terms f he mplications r iscal  rag.  What kind f  response ould  you  have  if  e o t i fo f d o w w accepted heir  umbers  for eceipts?  hat happens? t n r W

MR. PRELL.  I  think e need  to  consider  hat the  source f hat ifference ght  be w w o t d mi before e would characterize  at s  fiscal  rag.  We  have  not  gotten  otally side  heir  rains  o w th a d t in t b t be  able o  say  exactly  hy their  umbers differ om ours, ut  it ppears hat  ne  element n  the t w n fr b a t o i picture  s,  n  effect, w  York's xpectation  f  much larger  evenues rom  capital ins. e i i Ne e o r f ga W normally ould not  think f  that s  a articularly  strictive  cal ement.  People  get  wealthier; w o a p re fis el they  presumably  anticipate  at hey ill e  paying  more taxes;  nd  they  are  not  bound  by any th t w b a liquidity  nstraint, en  their  ealth.  So,  if  hat s he  source f  the ifference,   would  not co giv w t i t o d we regard hat  s  implying uch additional scal  estraint.  so,  I ouldn't  ay  at  this  oint hat t a m fi r Al w s p t the  difference  utside  he  range f ormal  noise. e  have  had  some substantial  rprises iso t o n W su in the  last  ew years. s the  economy gets igger nd  bigger,  he ossible  ollar  rrors  row. Even f A b a t p d e g so, t s  a  significant  fference,  d  we shall  now  a  lot ore in  the  next ew weeks. Some  of i i di an k m f this  s peculation out  whether  people  anticipated  eir  ax  liabilities   ast  ear etter  han i s ab th t forl y b t they  did  for he revious ew years. here  also s  uncertainty out  the  sources f  the ncome. t p f T i ab o i We  are  not  adamant  in  saying hat  he ew  York forecast  rong,  and  I  am  sure hat hey re t t N isw t t a humble about  the recision  f  their  orecasting ility,  o, t  this  uncture. p o f ab to a j

MR.  FISHER.  Absolutely!   put  in  last  ear's  ctuals  o  show that  he  range f I y a t t o misses  was 7 to  10  percent.  hat  had  a huge  impact n  dollar  erms.  But  I as also ffering at T i t w o th experience  o  provide ome scale f  the  forecasting  rors  nvolving  ig  numbers. If  e could t s o er i b w get  Desk operations  o  have  misses f nly  10 percent  ver  24-hour orizon,  e would be t o o o a h w doing  awesomely well.

MR.  PRELL.  It s  my understanding at he  difference    the  projections   the i th t in of surplus  or he  fiscal  ear,  hich I  believe  s n the  order f  $40  billion,   ostly n the evenue f t y w i o o ism o r

side,  ut  not ll f t s here. here  are  the  ongoing uestions  oncerning ow appropriations b a o i i t T q c h will lay  out  in  terms f  authorizations  d expenditures. p o an

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Do you have  any  rule f  thumb  regarding  he  effect  f o t o changes  in  crude il rices  n  the  core  CPI--some  notion f he eed-through? o p o o t f

MR.  PRELL.  I  cannot ite    rule f  thumb off he  top  of  my head, ut  in  some of ur c a o t b o models  we do  have  terms or ood  and energy  prices  eeding  hrough o  the  core  CPI. We  did  a f f f t t simulation  hat  ndicated  hat he  effect  f  the ownward  movement  in  energy  prices  n  our t i t t o d i forecast  n the  core nflation  te his ear s omewhere between .1  and .2  percent. o i ra t y i s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. It s uite ubstantial    other ords. i q s in w

MR.  PRELL.  It  is ot  negligible,    be  sure. n to

MR.  JORDAN. Mr.  Chairman,  we have  done  a little  rk along  the ame lines.  ur wo s O staff s  what we call  he  median CPI or  the  trimmed  mean. The effects e  on  the  order  f ha t ar o magnitude  that ou suggest,  ike,  from  what  I  recall  ur  people ere  saying. hey are y M o w T continuing  ork to  evaluate  hose ndirect  fects. w t i ef

MR.  PARRY. Mike,  I  have  two  questions at re  somewhat related.  he Greenbook th a T stresses at  abor arkets  are  very  tight  nd that  he  tightness uld  lead o  increases  eal th l m a t co t inr compensation.  But  increases   real ages  in  the  Greenbook  forecast  ctually  ecline  n  1999. in w a d i For  example,  the CI decelerates  .5 percentage  oint elative    the  CPI. In  fact,  eal age E by p r to r w inflation  y even  be going  down more than  that f  ne  believes  hat  age earners  argain n ma i o t w b i terms  of hat  they ee  on  Main Street  ather  han  what  they ead n  the ewspaper  about  the  CPI, w s r t r i n which,  of  course,  s ffected   the echnical  djustments.  ould  you comment on  why real i a by t a C wages are  decelerating    the orecast ere you  have  the conomy operating  t  such  a high  level in f wh e a and with  such  little  ack? sl

MR.  PRELL.  We  do not  have  real ages declining,  t  in  1999 the ap  between  the w bu g ECI increase  nd  the PI increase  s maller.  e  are  not  at  all ure hat hat  s he  number  to a C i s W s t t i t focus  on. In  fact,  prefer  o  focus n a  product rice  easure  rather  han  the onsumer  price we t o p m t c index  in  looking t  real ages,  and  it eeds hrough,  oo,  o  the mplications r ncome  shares. a w f t t t i fo i We  have  had very ubstantial  celeration  eal ompensation  gains ver  the ast wo  years. s ac ofr c o p t We  are  anticipating  zable  urther creases   1998 and 1999. In  1999,  it s  smaller  ncrease si f in in i a i and  one  could  explain  hat  n  part y  the act  hat  e project    little  creep n  the nemployment t i b f t w a up i u rate. e  also re  banking  to  some degree  on the  notion hat  he CI and  other  age measures W a t t E w have been  boosted ver  the ast ear r  so  by  minimum  wage hikes. hese  are  not  present  n o p y o T i this  rojection. e could  regard hat,    suppose, s  another  pside isk  n the nflation  tlook p On t I a u r o i ou because  there  bviously  s iscussion,  beit  itful,    further nimum  wage increases.  e  also o i d al f of mi W saw a  very  big  increase  n ommissions  and bonuses  in  the atter  rt f  1997,  which we think i c l pa o probably ill e  repeated  n  the irst arter  f  1998. These  are  associated   part ith  the uge w b i f qu o in w h level f  profits d  activity    the inancial d real  state  ectors.  e  foresee  n abatement f o an in f an e s W a o that ontribution    compensation  increases   we move forward. c to as

As I  said arlier,   are airly nvinced  by  all he  anecdotal  nd  survey vidence-e we f co t a e indicating  at mployers  have  been utilizing  re flexible rms  of  compensation uch  as  cash th e mo fo s bonuses  and  incentive y  of  various  orts--that ure djustments  o  compensation hould e pa s fut a t s b more sensitive  an  previously  o  a eceleration    the  economic  expansion nd  a  falloff th t d in a in profitability  h  as  we have  in  our orecast.   other  ords, he  inertia    adjustments  o suc f In w t in t compensation hat ormerly  ight  have  been  present  n  such  circumstances  ay not  quite  s t f m i m a evident  n  this  ycle. hose  are  the lements hat ead s  to e  fairly nguine bout  the i c T e t l u b sa a prospects  or olding he  line  n nominal  compensation ncreases  ven  in  this  ight bor arket. f h t o i e t la m

We  still ticipate  zable  ncreases   real ages  that  e think re  in  general onformity  ith an si i in w w a c w the  Phillips rve  model. cu

MR.  PARRY. Related o  a  point hat  ou made in  your  comments about  the  anecdotal t t y data  pertaining   inflation  d  how they ight  be  at  variance  ith  some of  the  published to an m w statistics,  ht  that e  related  o  the  fact  hat  he necdotal  ata eflect at  people ee?  The mig b t t t a d r wh s CPI certainly cludes  he  effect  f echnical  djustments.  ight  this  iscrepancy  ctually in t o t a M d a increase  ver  time  because,  s  you show in  the reenbook, he  technical  djustment  o  the  core o a G t a t CPI is robably oing  to  be  on  the rder f  .6  percent  n  1999? Of  course,  eople o  not  see p g o o i p d that;  hey nly  read  about  it. t o

MR.  PRELL. I  am  not  sure bout  the bility   John  Q.  Public  o  filter  t  all he a a of t ou t cumulative hanges  from  the  1994 approach  to  measuring onsumer  prices  o  the  method used  in c c t 1999.

MR.  PARRY. They never  see  it xcept hen they  read  about  it. e w

MR.  PRELL.  In  the  world  of nstantaneous  ows  of  information,  l he  economists i fl al t will e  talking  bout  it nd  maybe it ill ilter  t  into he eal orld  to  some degree.   guess e b a a w f ou t r w I w are  not  totally rsuaded ne  way or  the ther  n  this.  e  are nclined   think hat n  terms  of pe o o o W i to t i formal  cost f  living  djustments  nd,  more informally,  he xtent  hat eople ook  at hat  the o a a tot e t p l w CPI has  done  over  the ast ear,  hey  are  probably oing  to e  influenced   a  considerable p y t g b to degree  by the  headline  umber. I  did  note  some tension  etween  the  anecdotal  nd  the  statistical n b a news on the age side. his  does  make us  nervous. n  our  survey hat  ll he eserve  Banks w T I t a t R participated  , he ocus  was more  on what  business  irms re oing, f nything,  f  hey  are in t f f a d i a i t experiencing    shortage.    think   majority  f he irms hat  ere  in  that redicament  aid hey a I a o t f t w p s t were doing  something. ut  I  think  t s ifficult udge he  timing nd  dimension f  an B i i d toj t a o

acceleration--how  ch more they  are  doing  now than hey  were  doing  before. nd in  general, mu t A based  on this  necdotal  vidence,    wonder  if  here sn't  me sort f  Heisenberg roblem  here. a e I t i so o p We  are  looking o  hard  and  we are sking o  many people hat ne  wonders  whether  we are s a s t o finding    few  more stories an  we would  have  if  e did  not  have  a  neutral  xpectation  bout a th w e a what was going  on. We  are  a it ervous bout  this, t  I hink here  s  a  little  side isk  n  the b n a bu t t i up r i wage outlook.

On the  price ide,   elieve  he  markets nd  the  commentators  have  gotten   whiff f s Ib t a a o the  inflation  at  ay be  out  there.  ecent  housing arket  developments ave  intensified  at th m R m h th impression. he indexes ave  been  distorted  shifts   geographic ix,  but  I hink he arge T h by in m t t l increase  n  prices  hat  as reported  n  connection  ith  this  ew home  sales  igure  he ther ay i t w i w n f t o d is  one  more instance  here  people  are  not ooking t  those ubtleties.  at they ense s hat w l a s Wh s i t this  s   really  ot  market  and  prices  ay be  moving. i a h m

MR.  JORDAN.

MR. PRELL.  All  of hat  eflects  e  arithmetic at  escribed  t  the  outset  s  to  how t r th th Id a a we have  added  up the  GDP  components.

your  first-quarter  ductivity  timate.   nderstand  ow it  s erived nd  why you wind up pro es Iu h i d a with  this  egative roductivity  mber,  shocking s  it s.  It s  a  residual. n p nu a i i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Can we stipulate  at easured  productivity   istinct th m isd from  true roductivity? p

MR.  JORDAN. Somehow  statistically ved  t!  When  I  was talking  o on Kohn arri a t D last  eek,  he  told  e that  he ecline  id  not  happen and  that  roductivity  obably ose y,  say, w m t d d p pr r b 2  percent.  tarting th  that resumption,  hat  else as  to  change  in  your  forecast   ou are S wi p w h ify forced o  put  in  a  positive oductivity  mber for he  first arter? lso, hat  is  the et  going t pr nu t qu A w n to  look  like?

MR.  PRELL. If e talk bout  it imply  from  a  straight ithmetic int  f  view, w a s ar po o obviously  e would have  to  find ome more  expenditures. ere might  we find hem? It  could w s Wh t be  in  any  number of  places.  ne could  conceive hat,  espite  hat  looks ike   very  strong O t d w l a consumer  expenditure  umber in  the  first arter, ople  really  ave  had a lot f  income,  though n qu pe h o it s verstated   the  first-quarter  ber because  of  seasonal djustment  uirks. onetheless, i o in num a q N consumer  spending s  strong  nd  is  supported  y  a  lot f ealth  and  people eeling  eally  reat. i a b o w f r g So,  there ould  be  an even  boomier  picture  n  consumer  expenditures an  we have  projected. c i th

MR.  JORDAN. So you would  be  raising t ust  he  real utput umber  but  the no j t o n nominal  GDP?

MR.  PRELL.  In  the  end,  BEA  is nly  going o  publish    number that  dds  up  on the o t a a expenditure  ide,  nd  the roductivity  mbers  are  measured  that ay. So,  that  s ow we are s a p nu w i h going  to  have  to  get here.  e  have  only  one  month of ata or et xports nd  that  s   volatile t W d f n e a i a number,  so  we could e  surprised ere. ver  the  past ear e have  been  surprised  final b th O y w on sales,  nd  there  as  been  an accompanying  upside urprise  inventory  nvestment.  e  could a h s on i W

see  larger  mounts  of nventory  nvestment  hat ould be  consistent  th  higher inal  ales  nd a i i t w wi f s a with  our  basic ense hat  o troublesome  ccumulation as  been  occurring.  etting  p to  4 or  5 s t n a h G u percent DP  growth  is  not  totally plausible.  e  could  also  ave  some revisions    the G im W h in employment figures  r  something  precipitously    the  weak side n  March that  ould  make up o on i w for he  string  f pside urprises at  ave  helped o  generate  his  eak productivity  mber. t o u s th h t t w nu

MR.  JORDAN. When  you try o  reconcile e  data nd  make them consistent   the t th a on income side,  s our  negative  roductivity mber tied  n  with  the  decline  n  corporate  rofits i y p nu i i p that ou're  howing? y s

MR.  PRELL.  Again,  arithmetically  s.  Certainly, at  we have  in  this orecast r it i wh f fo 1998 in  essence s  a  story  here unit abor  osts  re  increasing re rapidly  ecause f  the i w l c a mo b o lagging djustment f  labor nput  o  the  deceleration    output. eaker productivity  ans a o i t in W me weaker  profits.

MR.  JORDAN. You can imagine  what  it's  ke  hen we are  out  around  our  Districts li w talking  o  people  and  we tell  hem that  roductivity    going  down, profits e  really  ad,  but t t p is ar b employers  are  hiring  orkers  in  large umbers  because hey re  earning ncome and  spending w n t a i a lot f  money. Something  just  oes  "clunk" n  that ogic;  t imply oes  not  sound  quite  ight. o g i l i s d r

MR. PRELL.  I  think  hey  have  been  hiring  eople  in  part ecause usiness  as  been t p b b h very  good and  they xpect usiness  o  continue  o  be  good. On the asis f he  anecdotal  eports, e b t t b o t r firms ave  had such  a difficult  me  finding  orkers  that hey're obably till tching  p to h ti w t pr s ca u some degree.  That  may be  one  of  the easons he orkweek has  been  on  the  firmer  ide han  we r t w s t would have  expected,  ven  allowing or tatistical  blems.  I  think hat ontinues  o  happen. e f s pro t c t There  is  momentum to  this  rocess. f  e  get hat  tronger rst arter,   s  going o  imply p I w t s fi qu it i t accelerator  fects  nd possibly  stronger  nvestment  utlook eyond. If e get hat ef a a i o b w t

performance  and  stronger  rofits,   alls  nto uestion  ur  expectation  f  a  weaker  stock arket. p itc i q o o m So,  one could  envision,   happened  last  ear,  hat hings  ould  come together   a  way that as y t t c in propels  he conomy forward  and  keeps  going  on with  the  support f he inancial rkets. n t e o t f ma O the  other and,  that  ould imply  that  e might  be  moving toward  a  4 percent  ate  f h w w r o unemployment this  ear,  nd I  think hat trains  ne's  ense, iven  what  one  can  already  ee,  f y a t s o s g s o what  is ossible  ithout eally  ubstantial  flation  essures. p w r s in pr

MR.  STOCKTON.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Any further  uestions  or he  gentlemen? q f t

MR. BROADDUS. Mike,  I  have  the  mpression  hat  he ossibility  a  stock arket i t t p of m decline  s  playing    larger  nd  larger  ole  n  the rojected celeration   the xpansion.   would i a a r i p de of e I be  interested    some sort f  quantitative  lationship e. re you expecting   permanent  drop in o re her A a in  the arket? Is  it omething  that  s oing  to e  extended nd sustained?  f e had  a normal m s i g b a I w correction,  mething  like   10  percent orrection   like  he orrection at  e had in  the  fourth so a c or t c th w quarter, at  eally  ight  not ave  much of  an  impact n aggregate  emand. So,  I'm  wondering th r m h o d what  underlies e  quantitative  mensions f  this  spect f  your  forecast. th di o a o

MR.  PRELL.  It ould  be  less.   apologize  f ord about  what  we are  assuming  did c I i w not  get  to  you.  We  have  a  10 percent  ecline  n he arket  from  its  evel  ast  eek to he nd of d i t m l l w t e

the  year nd  we then  have  a flat  arket  in  1999. So,  in  comparison o  what  we've  seen  in  the a m t past ew years,  hich as  I  recall  ere a couple f lose-to-10-percent  rections  at ere f w w o c cor th w quickly  eversed, is  ore permanent  correction uld  be a distinct  ntrast.   provided r th m wo co We a simulation  n  the reenbook of  an alternative  P  path n  which  in  essence he  stock arket i G GD i t m rises  oughly   percent   year,  nough to  keep  pace  with  the  growth  of  nominal  disposal  ncome. r 5 a e i It akes some material  ifference en we move out  to  1999. As I  suggested  n  my remarks,  f m d wh i i you  think he arket  can do  appreciably  etter  han hat--and at  s eally   paltry  erformance t m b t t th i r a p by the  standards  f ecent ears r  in  relation   what  the  average nvestor ems  to  be o r y o to i se expecting--then  e  economy's  performance  will e dramatically fferent    we move out  into th b di as 1999.

MR.  JORDAN. Thank you. When  I  left  he  meeting  in  early  ebruary,  e were t F w f t A to h a t t l i like omeone who was trying  o  anticipate  at  would  be  the  effects   an asteroid   a comet s t wh of or that upposedly as going  to  show up one  of hese ays. s w t d A o m a a t m e i waiting  or he  East sian  effects   get ere, nd as  I  tried  o  analyze heir  ikely  mpact  I  felt couple  of  weeks after  ur eeting, there as in  fact  report bout  an asteroid  hat  ight  reach  the arth n  about  30 years. w [Laughter]  Upon further  nalysis at eport  as very  quickly ismissed.  lmost 25 years  ago, a th r w d A we were  all reated  o  reports  f  the oming  of  the omet  Kohoutek. omet Kohoutek  was going t t o c c C to  do wondrous  things. t  as going  to e  the rightest  lestial  ject  f  the entury,  nd  there I w b b ce ob o c a was speculation at  t ight  change  the arth's  tation  nd  weather atterns.  f  course,  t as th i m e ro a p O i w a  complete  fizzle d  no  one  will emember it.  As I hought bout  such  phenomena,  it ccurred an r t a o to  me that  steroids d  comets  are  less  redictable  an  eclipses. t  even  eclipses,  ough a an p th Bu th

predictable,  e  often ery  hard  to  observe ecause  there s o  much  other ctivity    the ar v b i s a in atmosphere  that  ven a  trained  cientist  y need  powerful nstruments   observe ne. e s ma i to o

I  then hought bout  El t a Nino, which  has  been wonderful  for y part f he  country  his m o t t winter. he lesson here  s hat ven  when phenomena are  accurately recasted  nd  exceed T t i t e fo a anticipations,    effects  re  sometimes  hard  to  analyze. f ne  analyzed l Nino's  ffect  n the the a I o E e o basis f  expensive alifornia mes falling to he  ocean,  one  would have  a  different cture o C ho in t pi than  if  ne lived round  Lake  Erie nd saw what  a  wonderful  winter  e had  in  our  part f he o a a w o t country. he schools id  not  close. he people  who drive alt rucks  omplained  about  the  lack T d T s t c of  overtime,  ut  other  han hat  he xperience  as  relatively  sitive.  e put  such  disparate b t t t e w po Ifw observations  nto   full  eneral quilibrium  ontext,  eally   very  hard  to  sort hem  out.  It ay i a g e c itr is t m be that  ompanies  that ompete  with  Asian  imports r hat ose xport ales  n  Asian  markets c c o t l e s i will ontinue  o  get  hurt. ven so,  till ink hat he  economy is uch  more likely,    Mike c t E Is th t t m as Prell  emarked, o  be stronger  the  upside han  weaker  on the  downside  of  the  Greenbook r t on t forecast.

I  also ontinue  o e  concerned hat e may never  see  the ffects  f onetary  excesses c t b t w e o m in  output rices,  ut ather  hat  e will  see  them in  asset  rices. t  our  business  dvisory p b r t w p A a council  eeting  about wo  weeks ago,  one  of y  relatively  w members came into he eeting m t m ne t m and  indicated at e  now  understood  he ole f  the ederal eserve.

We  asked  our  advisory  ouncil embers  and  our  directors w the  first arter  elt c m ho qu f compared to  the  first arter  f  last  ear nd  compared to  all f qu o y a o 1997.

The anecdotal  eports  n labor arkets  still ad e to  believe  hat  he  reported r o m le m t t compensation umbers are  not  capturing  hat is oing  on. First, on't  hink he  turnover  f n w g I  d t t o workers  is eing  analyzed orrectly.    addition, ere  s ccurring  hat  I  now think  f  as  the b c In th i o w o "dumbing down" of  the  labor orce. ore  and  more employers  are  telling   that ecause  of he f M us b t introduction   smarter  echnology  nd the  way they  are  organizing  heir  perations,  ey ow of t a t o th n are  willing  o  hire t  a  given  wage people ho have  lesser  kills an  previously.  hat  does  not t a w s th T get  captured n  any  of he  compensation umbers  that  e receive. i t n w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  Twelfth  District onomic  growth  accelerated ec in 1997, led by a  surging alifornia onomy. We  believe  hat  he  District onomy entered C ec t t ec 1998 with considerable mentum. mo Recently evised igures  how that rowth  in  California  yroll r f s g pa employment  jumped to 3.8 percent  n i 1997, about  a  percentage  oint reater  han p g t in 1996 and also   percentage  oint reater  han  the  increase  or he ation s  a hole. The pickup  occurred a p g t f t n a w in  most  major  sectors, t  not  surprisingly as largest   the  construction  dustry  here bu it w in in w employment grew by over  11 percent.  urthermore,  e see  that ll reas f he  State  f F w a a o t o California ared  in  that urge.  The most  pronounced  acceleration  curred n  Southern sh s oc i California,  d le by San  Diego  and several  ounties  hat urround os Angeles  County.  Although c t s L demographic  factors  eld  growth  in  Los Angeles  below  that f he  rest  f  the  state, e os h o t o th L Angeles  economy did pick  up substantially in 1997. Employment grew at  a  solid  ate, r unemployment declined by nearly  -1/2 percentage  oints, d  the  housing arket  improved 1 p an m considerably.

For  the  state  s  a  hole  in a w 1998, a  weather-related  use  in  January mployment pa e growth  was followed by strong xpansion  in  February,  uggesting  hat  alifornia mains n or e s t C re o close o  the  path  that  e saw in t w 1997. As the  California onomy continues  o  heat  up, here re ec t t a signs f  a  shift  n  economic  activity ay from  other tates   the istrict.  ployment and o i aw s in D Em construction dicators nerally  howed that  evada,  Arizona, regon,  Utah,  Washington, nd in ge s N O a Idaho  all xpanded  less apidly  n e r i 1997 than  they did in 1996. Despite he  gradual ooling  rend t c t outside  f  California,   District    a  whole  remains n  a stellar  owth  path. o the as o gr

One development  that e are  watching  carefully    the mpact  of onditions  n w is i c i Southeast  sia, hich certainly  e  having  a moderating ffect  n  District port ales  f  various A w ar e o ex s o agricultural  d  manufactured roducts. ut  the  net  impact  on employment growth  in  our  region an p B is  quite imited  o ate. l t d

At the  national  evel,  he conomy has  once  again  shown surprising rength.  ndeed, l t e st I our  monthly  indicators  del projects rst-quarter  DP  growth  well  above  the  Greenbook mo fi realG estimate.  t s  in  the ow 4  percent ange.  Some of his  trength  ay  be  transitory, haps I i l r t s m per a result  f  unusually  arm  weather.  If  hat urns ut  to e  the  case, hen  the  robust  xpansion n o w t t o b t e i the  first arter  ay have  little  plication r he onger-run  utlook ecause  it ay be  the qu m im fo t l o b m result  f ome borrowing  from  the  second  quarter.  owever,  we think t s ore likely  hat  he o s H i i m t t considerable mentum mo of  the irst arter  ill arry orward. he latest  ains n  disposable f qu w c f T g i income,  which should  support urther  urchases  y  households,  re  particularly ressive  n f p b a imp i this  egard. hus,  at he  current  unds  rate nd even  taking nto ccount he allout om  East r T t f a i a t f fr Asia  and a slowdown in  inventory  nvestment,  see  real DP  growth  remaining ear otential i we G n p throughout  he  remaining uarters  f  1998. Given our  outlook or eal rowth, here s ittle t q o f r g t i l question  hat  abor arkets ill emain  very  tight  his  ear. here  is lready ignificant  ward t l m w r t y T a s up pressure  n wages and salaries,  d  we see  annual  compensation  growth  increasing veral o an se tenths  his  ear  and  again ext ear.  However,  as  all f s  have  noted,  he  outlook or rices  s t y n y o u t f p i considerably  ore favorable  han  that  or ages. With  falling port rices, wer  prices  or il m t f w im p lo f o and  other ommodities, s  well  as  recent  roductivity  hancements  and  additions   capacity, c a p en to core  price nflation  obably hould ome in  at  a rate f round  2 percent.  his  would  certainly i pr s c o a T represent  urther  odest  progress  oward  our  objective  f rice tability. f m t o p s

Looking  beyond this  ear,  t s ncertain  n  my  view  whether he  special  actors y i i u i t f moderating nflation  ll ndure  and  whether  our  recent rogress  oward  price tability  be i wi e p t s can maintained.  hank you. T

In  terms f  the  Asian  situation,  st  of ur  directors d  council embers felt  hat  he o mo o an m t t Asian  impact  on  net  exports  ould  not  be  large. till,  have  heard  various  necdotes  hat w S we a t indicate  n Asian  impact  on some types f  exports  nd imports. ork  sales  o  Asia  are own a o a P t d significantly,   we are  importing  ontainer ard  from Japan  for he  first me  in  our  contact's and c bo t i memory.  In  the  auto ndustry, me domestic ight  ehicle  roduction  as  been  cut  as  a  result i so l v p h of softening  xport ales  o  Asia.  Import  sales f ight  ehicles  ave  increased, though ostly e s t o l v h al m sales f  European  rather  han sian  models.  Korean  imports ave  doubled  their  arket  share f o t A h m o motor  vehicle ales  rom  .7 o  1.4  percent.    guess  it's  t  surprising  nce hey  are  offering s f t I no si t $2,000  rebates  n cars elling r 12,000. All  of  us  have  heard  that  sian  firms re aving o s fo $ A a h difficulty  taining  rade inance,  ut  several  uto  industry  ontacts  peculate  hat  he apanese ob t f b a c s t t J auto  firms ave  not  increased  xports  o  the nited  States  ecause f  political  nsiderations. h e t U b o co

Turning  to  the ational  utlook,  continue  o  be  impressed y  the trength  f he n o I t b s o t domestic  economy. Consumer fundamentals re  strong nd  firms  seem poised o emain  big a a t r spenders or igh-tech  apital  oods  over he  next  few quarters.  s in  January,  e expect et f h c g t A w n exports nd  inventory  nvestment  o  be  the  largest  rags n GDP  growth  this  ear,  hough  our a i t d o y t

outlook or   depressing  sian  effect  s  somewhat less  essimistic  w  than  it as  two months f a A i p no w ago. All  told,  e expect o  see  GDP  growth  of bout  2-1/2  percent his  ear,  ith  some slight w t a t y w pickup  in  inflation  er  last  ear's  evels. ov y l

Last  week I  met with  eight  conomists omprising ur  academic  advisory ouncil. e c o c Most council embers attributed  asured  inflation's  ent  ow levels  o  a  variety  f  special m me rec l t o factors.  hese  include  he ollar's  cent  ppreciation d  the  deceleration  edical  care  costs T t d re a an ofm as  well  as  the ontinued  ethodological  hanges  implemented  by  the LS.  Every  council c m c B member expects nflation    accelerate ticeably  ver  the ext  12 months, he  consequence  of i to no o n t tight  abor arkets  and  GDP  growth  consistently  ove  its  rend ate. he council  as nearly l m ab t r T w unanimous  in  its iew  that  onetary  policy  hould e  tightened  ver he ext  few  months. v m s b o t n

In  summary,  I  remain  concerned hat  he omestic conomy's  strength ll utweigh t t d e wi o any  negative  ffects  rising  rom  the  turmoil  n  Asia.  At our urrently gh  resource  tilization e a f i c hi u rates, is  trength  hreatens   generate  oticeable ice ressures  ver  the  forecast  orizon. th s t to n pr p o h Although  in  January  iewed  the  risks  s  somewhat balanced,    now view  the isks  oing 1v a I r g forward  as  tilted ward  the  upside. to

MS. RIVLIN.  Mike,  excuse  me,  but  what  were your  academics  saying  year  ago? a MR.  MOSKOW. Several ere saying he  opposite    year go. It  was much  more of  a w t a a mixed  picture, th  some saying hat  e should e  tightening d  others  ndicating  at hings wi t w b an i th t were  just  ine nd  we should ot  change  our  policy. ut  for he  first me  at  the  latest eting, f a n B t i me they  were virtually  animous  in  the  view  that  ome tightening uld  be needed.  It as a un s wo w surprise  o  us. t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oehne. B

MR.  BOEHNE. Thank you,  Mr. Chairman. The economy in  the  Philadelphia  strict Di is  growing  at  the  same rapid ace  as  last  ear. ob  growth  has  expanded  to  all ectors  ncluding p y J s i manufacturing,  hich  had  been  a  drag  on the  regional  conomy. Labor  markets  are  very  tight. w e Compensation  costs  re  rising,  t  apparently  o  is roductivity  owth.  There  is ittle  idence a bu s p gr l ev of  rising  nflation. i

As others  ave said,  he necdotal omments from  the  business  ommunity revolve h t a c c mostly  around  people ssues.  he most frequently ard  comment  is hat  ualified rkers  are i T he t q wo scarce nd  they  are ecoming more expensive. here  is ore job-hopping  s  compensation s a b T m a i bid  up. One labor eader  old  e that he  building  rades  re  having rouble  ttracting  alified l t m t t a t a qu workers  because ages in  manufacturing  ave  now  surpassed  hose n  construction. w h t i

For  the irst me  in  several ears,    also m hearing  omments about  a shift  n  the f ti y I a c i psychology f  the orkplace.  In  the  wake of orporate  ownsizing,  here as  job  insecurity  d o w c d t w an people  tended  to  work longer  nd harder.  ow  there s n emerging  view among workers  that a N i a they  cannot eep up the  pace  any  longer. t ould appear hat  ob nsecurity   eginning  o urn k I w t j i isb t t the  other  ay,  and  workers  are ooking or hings ike  ore vacations  nd  more predictability w l f t l m a in their  ork schedules.  f hey're t  getting  hat  rom  their  urrent  mployer, hey an  get  a ob w I t no t f c e t c j somewhere else ith  a  significant  crease  n  pay. In  conjunction th  the ightness    the  labor w in i wi t in market  and the ncreasing  osts  ssociated th  it,   ontinue  o  hear  stories out  the  pervasive i c a wi Ic t ab use  of  technology  hroughout  he conomy to  increase  roductivity.   s ne  story fter  nother, t t e p Iti o a a and  one  gets he ense hat  he  end  is owhere  in  sight, at  e are n  one  of hose eriods  here t s t t n th w i t p w this  rocess s  likely  o  go  on for ome time. p i t s

Turning  to  the ational  conomy,  it eems  that  e are  still ing  dealt  he ame hand n e s w be t s that  e have  been  dealt  or   number of onths.  We  have  ongoing  strength  n  demand and  very w f a m i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  uynn. G

MR.  GUYNN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  would characterize  e  overall  rowth  of th g our  region's onomy as  moderate, t  least  y  our  District's  ndards,   that rowth  in  our ec a b sta in g region as  fallen  ack  to  national  rends  n  the  last  everal  uarters  fter ading  he ation h b t i s q a le t n through he  early ears f  this  xpansion. ith a  couple  of otable  xceptions, urrently e t y o e W n e I  c se few signs f  imbalances  n  our  regional  conomy. o i e

Housing  activity  ntinues  o  be  mixed  but  at  a high  level,  ith  increases   sales  f co t w in o single-family  mes offset  o  a substantial  tent  y  declines  hroughout  he egion n  the ho t ex b t t r i multifamily  ector.  e  have  generally  ealthy ommercial  real state  arkets,  ut  to  repeat s W h c e m b a comment that    made at  the ast  wo  meetings,    continue  o  see  some worrisome  signs f I l t I t o speculative  ommercial  development n  Atlanta.  lanned xpansions  n  Atlanta re  estimated  o c i P e i a t be about  double  the  current  bsorption  ate or he oming year.  I  would  emphasize  that his  eal a r f t c t r estate  ctivity  oncentrated   Atlanta  nd  is ot  representative  the egion s  a  whole. a isc in a n of r a Nonetheless,  s  a  development  that    think    need  to  continue  o  watch. iti I I t

Tourism  in  our ajor  tourist nters  s ery  strong.  ne measure  of ust  ow strong s m ce i v O j h i the  unavailability  airline ats  n  most  flights to lorida, ere hotel nd  cruise  hip of se o in F wh a s bookings  are  quite  eavy  into  he uture. h t f

Like  others  n the  Committee,  I  continue o  look  hard  for igns hat  he sian o t s t t A problems  are  affecting r  regional  conomy. One piece f  tangible  vidence hows up  in  our ou e o e s District's  p  paper  industry.  wo pulp  paper ompanies  in  Alabama were  forced  to  shut own pul T c d for wo weeks.  About two-thirds   their  ardwood output nd  about  one-half  f heir ftwood t of h a o t so output s  sold o  Asian  customers. ulp  obviously  s   volatile dustry  nd  periodic  hutdowns i t P i a in a s are  not  unusual,  ut his  s he  first tributable evelopments n  Asia. Beyond this,  here re b t i t at to  d i t a as  best can  tell  nly  fragmentary  eports  o  far hat  ndividual mpanies  have  been  adversely I o r s t i co affected.  n  the  aggregate, e eported  sian  impact  in  our  region ppears o I th r A a t be negligible at this  ime. t

It  is lso ecoming  clear  hat here re  both  positive d  negative  mpacts n  the a b t t a an i o domestic conomy from Asia. e A positive  xample  comes from  one  of ur  directors o builds o wh roof  trusses  or ouses  and  small  commercial  buildings.  reports  hat ecause  of he ery  wet f h He t b t v weather,  t as  been nearly mpossible  or eavy  equipment  to  get nto outhern orests   harvest i h i f h i s f to southern ellow  pine,  nd  the rice  f  such  lumber  has  increased  ignificantly.  ever,  the y a p o s How price  un-up  of ine umber  resulting  om the  supply  squeeze as  been muted r p l fr h by the  influx  f o West Coast  spruce nd  fir.  he drop-off  n  demand from Asia  for hat est Coast  lumber  and its a T i t W diversion  o  our  region as  come with  price uts f bout t h c o a 25 percent.

Lastly,  s  far s  the egion s oncerned, would be  remiss a a r i c I if   did I not  add our perspective   the  current  vailability   cost f  labor.  o no  one's urprise,  bor arkets n to a and o T s la m i our  area lso emain  tight  nd  continue  o ress mployers  to  look  even  harder  or pportunities a r a t p e f o to  substitute  pital  or carce abor.  o add one  more story f  productivity  ins,  n a  swing ca f s l T o ga o I made through  north labama two weeks ago, A who manages an agricultural conglomerate  old e about  a  new piece f  equipment.  The equipment s  configured  o  as  to t m o i s

allow  each  pass f  the quipment  through he  fields  o  till   harvest  2 rows  instead  f he o e t t or 1 o t previous  0,  a  very  appreciable crease  n  productivity, 1 in i part f  the esulting o r savings as retained  y w b and  part as used  to  raise  he ourly ages of  the orkers  by w t h w w about  15 percent.  ontinue  o  get  similar ports  rom almost very  industry  ontact  hat  alk Ic t e f e c t It to.  It s lear  hat  fforts   achieve roductivity  ins re  still eting ith  some success. i c t e to p ga a me w

As far s  the  national  utlook  s oncerned,  ur  judgmental orecast  s xtremely lose a o i c o f i e c to  the  Greenbook's his  ime  and  similar   others  hat  lready  ave  been  laid  ut  around  the t t to t a h o table.   agree hat he ear-term  utlook  s  good to  excellent. ven this greement n  the  near I t t n o i Gi a o term  and the ack f  immediate  policy ction  hat  t eems  to  suggest,  ur  focus  should ontinue l o a t i s o c to  be  on  the  longer  erm  over  which  many forecasts ve  inflation  sing  fter t ha ri a 1999. Here  we must acknowledge  that e have  tended o  over-forecast  flation  d  under-forecast  owth w t in an gr during his  ecade.  Speaking or yself,  his  s  the  type f  error   an  live ith  if  t oes  not ead t d f m t i o Ic w i d l us  into olicy  issteps,  hich I hink e have  avoided  so  far. till, eing he ast attern  f p m w t w S se t p p o forecast  rrors,  am concerned hat  e may be lulled  nto iscounting e urrent  nflation e I t w i d th c i forecast  oo  much and  risk aiting  oo  long  before he equired  olicy  ove is  made. t w t t r p m

I  suspect  hat any forecasts plicitly  sume that he  FOMC t m im as t will ehave  as  it as b h in  the ast,  nd  if  e do,   think  nflation rtainly ould e  expected o  rise.  ur  Atlanta p a w I i ce sh b t O baseline  odel forecast  xplicitly  sumes  that e will ehave  as  in  the ast,  nd  it ndicates at m e as w b p a i th on average  we have  tended o  ease  policy  hen growth  was in  the  range e are  now  forecasting t w w for  a  substantial  riod head  and  when inflation  s low  and  falling. e model shows that pe a wa Th later, t  not  much  later, flation  s  tended  to  accelerate,  monstrating  he ind  of olicy bu in ha de t k p mistake  we need  to  guard  against.

I  think his  istory  autions  s  to  be  leery f uggestions at  he  recent ow  inflation, t h c u o s th t l whatever  the  source,  rovides n opportunity   ease  policy.  his  leads e back  to  thinking p a to T m about  how  much to  discount  he  current  nflation  recasts,  ich tend o  show an  acceleration t i fo wh t several  ears own the  road, omething  almost ll f  us  have  said e find nacceptable.  ur y d s a o w u O model suggests  hat  f e stick  o  our  current  olicy osition  nd  do  not  repeat  he attern  f t i w t p p a t p o easing hen growth  seems  to  be slowing nd  inflation    be  declining,  en  I  think  e can w a to th w comfortably  iscount  he  forecast  f  worsening  inflation.    is or hose easons  hat   think  e d t o It f t r t I w can  afford o  wait or   while  to  see  if he isruptions    the eal conomy do  or  do  not t f a t d in r e materialize. ank you.

MR.  HOENIG. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. The economy in  the  Tenth  Federal Reserve  District  mains uite ealthy.  t  appears o  be  growing  at  a faster te  han  the  nation re q h I t ra t so  far his ear. or  example, e estimate  hat  otal  mployment rose  at  an  annual  rate f  7 t y F w t t e o percent  n  the irst o  months  of i f w 1998, quite   bit aster an  the  increase  or he ation. ome a f th f t n S of  the urge n  employment  was due  to  the arm weather,  hich had  a  favorable  ffect  n s i w w e o construction tivity    our  region,  ut  other ectors  lso dded  jobs cross  he istrict.  bor ac in b s a a a t D La markets  remain  quite ight, th  some continued  vidence f  wage pressures  oming through. t wi e o c As in  the  last  everal  onths, bout  half  he  firms e have  contacted  aid hat hey ere s m a t w s t t w responding o  labor hortages  y  raising  ages more than  normal. t s b w

For  example, ontracts   the  food  industry o t i c in show reduced  exports  o  Asia  this  ear.  District  ergy  activity  so as  slowed  in  response  o t y en al h t

the  sharply  ower  oil rices.  he District  g ount as  fallen  bout  20  percent  ince he l p T ri c h a s t beginning f  the  year. etail ales  ave  been quite  ealthy  n  the istrict, tly  ue  to  good o R s h h i D par d weather,  ut  again he  gains ave  been  broadly ased  across he istrict. b t h b t D

Despite he oncerns  about  credit  uality  ationwide,  ending  tandards  n  the istrict t c q n l s i D as  they  are eported  o  us  do  not  appear o  have  deteriorated reat eal.  At  the  same time,  e r t t a  g d w are eginning o  hear  anecdotal  tories   some speculative tivities.  ill hare ust   couple b t s of ac I  w s j a with  you. In  one  of he esort  reas n  Colorado--not il  or  Aspen but ne of he  more t r a i Va o t modest  resort  reas--condominiums  ere  offered  or ale rior  o  construction.  e prices  hat a w f s p t Th t were  considered  inimum  in  the id  process ould ot  cover  the equired  ash  flow  even  if  he m b c n r c t condominiums were rented  very  day  of  the  year. et,  people  were  standing  n  line o  buy  one e Y i t unit  t  a  minimum  and  they ere often oing  for wo. Another xample  relates   the  recent a w g t e to experience  f  a  small nvestment  irm  with  a good  reputation at  ffered  hares  n  a new fund. o i f th o s i They were  trying  o  raise  bout  one-  half  illion llars  or nvestment  urposes. hey started t a b do f i p T the  new fund  in  January,  nd  when I  asked  them  recently w  they ere  doing, hey ndicated a ho w t i that o  far hey  had  been  offered bout  1-1/2  billion   invest.  ne of heir  xamples  of nvestor s t a $ to O t e i interest  s that  lthough hey  did  not  want  to ake ore than  $20 million  rom  any  one  investor, wa a t t m f a couple f  them  insisted  their  aking t  least  60 million.  o,  some of he  anecdotal  eports o on t a $ S t r that  e are  getting  uggest   degree f  optimism  and speculation at  e have  not  seen  for ome w s a o th w s time  in  our egion. r

More generally, r  forecasts lating   the  broad  domestic conomy are  not  unlike ou re to e others.  e  see  a very  strong conomy and  one  that  e expect ill emain  strong.  he W e w w r T contributing  ctors  re  the  obvious nes: ow interest  tes, gh  consumer  confidence,  trong fa a o l ra hi s incomes  and  employment,  and, f  course,  he  stock arket.

However, a c th m we think hat  he  risks  o  the  expansion re n the  upside n  the  context f mprovements  in t t t a o i o i productivity  at ay continue  n a  more permanent  than  expected asis s  a  result  f  persisting th m o b a o high  rates  f nvestment  nd  further  mprovements  in  technology. ut  we also ecognize  hat o i a i B r t inflation  s  been  held own by  some temporary actors.  ow  temporary s,  f  course,  he ha d f H i o t question.  hese  factors  re  the rices  f  food, il, nd  imports. s these avorable  rice rends T a p o o a A f p t unwind,  I hink e're oing  to  see  some fairly bstantial  essures  oward  increased  nflation, t w g su pr t i given  our  forecast  f n economy that  emains  very  strong  n the  domestic ront.  hank you. o a r o f T

In  keeping ith  most  of he  other omments around  this  able--] w t c t guess  Bob McTeer's  comments are  an  exception  oday--our strict onomy seems  by all t Di ec accounts o  have  remained  very  strong. here  are  some indications    the anufacturing  ector t T in m s that hipments  may be  softening    bit,  ut  orders  emain  quite  trong. ike  Jack  Guynn  and s a b r s L some others,  e have  gotten ccasional  omments from  folks ndicating  at  he  Asian  situation w o c i th t is  having ome negative  mpact  in  particular  dustries, ecially    the  paperboard ndustry. s i in esp in i A manufacturer  old s  that aperboard rders rom Korea  and  Indonesia  ecently ve  fallen t u p o f r ha sharply,  ut  those tories e  the xception  ather  han  the  rule. anufacturing s ery  important b s ar e r t M i v in  our egion nd most  manufacturers  re  quite ptimistic  r he  longer  erm.  In  general,  hey r a a o fo t t t are  expecting  otal  hipments,  omestic lus xports,  o  be  higher nd  perhaps  significantly t s d p e t a higher  ix  months  from now than  they  are ow. s n

Elsewhere, n  the  words of ne of  our  retail ntacts, nsumer  spending s  "going i o co co i great uns."  Auto sales  ay be  a  little  otty, t  they re  higher  han  most  dealers  ad  expected g m sp bu a t h them  to  be  not  oo ong  ago.  Our housing ector  emains ery  strong,  nd  we hear ore and t l s r v a m more tales  bout  speculative ilding.  e  have  had  a  lot f  anecdotal  eports  n tight  abor a bu W o r o l markets  and  I, oo, esitate   add  any  more,  but  that  s hat most  of ur  contacts  ant  to  talk t h to i w o w about.  At our  small usiness  ouncil eeting   couple  of  weeks ago,   member  who runs  an b c m a a employment agency  here  in  Washington  reported  hat  er  firm o longer  ounsels  rospective t h n c p employees  on how to  attract ospective  mployers.

On the  national  conomy,  we now have  at east  ome hard  evidence s  opposed  to e l s a pure  predictions  at he  Asian  problem  is  having  some negative  mpact  on U.S.  net xports. th t i e Obviously,  e need  to  watch  that ituation  d give t eight  in  our  deliberations. , s  Jack w s an i w But a Guynn  and  Cathy  Minehan mentioned, he  Asian  situation  s  another ide o  it. t  is lso aving t ha s t I a h effects  hat re elping o  strengthen  lready  obust .S.  domestic emand,  helping o eep  the t a h t a r U d t k inflation  te  own, helping herefore   keep  real ages up,  and  also elping o  keep  U.S. ra d t to w h t interest  tes  own. ra d

On  balance,   hink t's  asonably  lear  hat  t  least  uring he eriod ince ur  last It i re c t a d t p s o meeting,  he  strengthening    domestic emand has  outstripped atever  negative  mpact  is n t in d wh i i fact oming from  Asia.  The Greenbook obviously  as  recognized  his  ith  what  in  my c h t w experience  s  a airly  triking ward  revision  rom  one  meeting  to he  next  in  the rojected i f s up f t p growth  of  real DP  for he oming year.   still ink,  nd  Mike Prell  aid he taff s  this  iew G t c I th a s t s ha v as  well, hat he isk  s n the  upside n  this  rojection.   ave  felt  hat  ll long  and  I  feel t ven t t r i o i p Ih t a a i e more strongly  ow, especially th  respect  o  inflation. n wi t

In  this egard,  t  s nteresting  note hat lmost ll f he  Greenbook's rojected r i i i to t a a o t p decline  n  real DP  is ccounted or y a  drop  in  productivity  owth, s  several  eople ave i G a f b gr a p h noted  already. his  means that  abor arkets  are xpected o emain  tight  ver  the orecast T l m e t r o f horizon. t s  a  little  rprising    me that  espite  his  xtraordinary  b arket  tightness d I i su to d t e jo m an widespread xpectations at ealth are osts re  going  to  move up,  the  Greenbook  does  not e th h c c a

project    further crease  n  the  growth  rate f CI compensation or 998 over  1997. Unit  labor a in i o E f 1 costs n  the rojection  rise  s  a esult  f he  weak productivity  owth.  So,  we do  get  a i p do a r o t gr projected  3 ercentage  oint ncrease,  a  consistently  asured  basis,  n  both  the  core . p p i on me i CPI and the  core  PCE measures  of nflation.  viously,  f ompensation oves up more strongly  han i Ob i c m t the  staff  xpecting,  hat ould compound  any  upward push  on prices  manating rom  labor ise t w e f markets.

With regard o  the  District,  arly ll ectors  f  the  regional  conomy remain  very t ne a s o e strong. or  example, istrict  ployment is  up about  3-1/2  percent rom  early 997 to  early 998.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are you going  to  answer  that  uestion? q

MR.  STERN. I think art f  the  explanation  s  that  eople re aking econd  and  even p o i p a t s third  obs. wasn't  oing  to  get nto he necdotal  ompetition  n this.  Laughter] e  do  hear j I g i t a c o [ W

stories out  places ike all  of  America  that re  sufficiently perate  hat hey ill ire ab l M a des t t w h a worker, f  hey  can  find ne, ho  for hatever  reason s illing  o  work only  from  4:00  in  the i t o w w i w t afternoon  ntil  :00  in  the vening hree ays  a week. These  are eople  who obviously re  doing u 8 e t d p a other hings  uch of he  time.  We  hear  that ome of hem  may be in  the  process f aking  heir t m t s t o t t third  ob. j

On the  other and,  we are  seeing omething  that  e have  not  observed ince robably h s w s p the  mid-1980s.  I  don't  ant  to  exaggerate  his,  ut  we see  some indications  at   two-tier w t b th a economy is  developing here  the  urban  areas re  doing etter  han  the  rural reas. he principal w a b t a T problem  in  the ural reas s griculture.  ere  it s artially uestion  f  commodity prices-r a i a Th i p a  q o and  Asia  may be  having  some effect--and rtially uestion  f  growing  conditions,  ich  right pa a q o wh now are  not  terribly  vorable.  aving  said hat, ere  s lways  a problem  with  every fa H t th i a generalization,   the  energy  sector, ich  is  of ourse ural,  nd  the  iron re  industry,  ich is and wh c r a o wh also ural,  re  both  doing  very  well  at  the oment. r a m

The third  nd  final  egional  haracteristic nt  to  comment on relates   shortages. a r c I  wa to I will  not omment further  bout  the abor ituation,  t  there  s  related  hortage  f  housing, c a l s bu i a s o particularly  those ural reas here employment has  gone  up. In  the  metropolitan eas, in r a w ar I think ousing onstruction s  been  sufficiently ong o  more or  less eep  up  with  housing h c ha str t k demand. There  has  been  a  shortage  f  office  pace, ut  that  s n  the rocess f eing  alleviated o s b i i p o b and  it robably ill isappear  n  the ext  several  ears. here  are  now five ignificant  fice p w d i n y T s of projects  nder  way in  downtown  Minneapolis nd  at  least  wo  in  downtown  St. aul. u a t P Developers eport  niformly hat  hey  have  no  problem  finding  inancing. r u t t f

As far s  the ational  conomy is oncerned, verall    must  say  conditions  ook  very a n e c o I l good to  me.  Real  growth, oth  current  nd  prospective,  ems secure,  nd I  believe  nflation  ll b a se a i wi

remain  low at  least  or ome time.  If  anted  to orry,  hink I ould worry  about  the f s Iw w It w following  hings,  specially    the ontext f  the  Greenbook forecast. e is hat he reenbook t e in c o On t t G seems  to  have  a  very  avorable  ominal  wage adjustment  n  the  face f ery  tight  abor arket f n i o v l m conditions.   orry  a  little  out  whether e really  ught  to xpect hat  o  happen.

I ust  admit a f t s at l t m that rowth  in  M2  is tarting   oncern  me a  little. g s toc

In  my view,  the  kicker  ere  is roductivity. on't  ant  to  get  caught p in  how  we h p I  d w u measure  productivity,   all f  those dverse actors  an be  offset  f  roductivity   n a but o a f c i p iso fundamentally  ore favorable  rend. ertainly, siness  eople  have  asserted  or   long  time m t C bu p f a that  t s nd  they  continue  o  do  so.

MR.  POOLE. As in  most  of  the  rest  f he  country,  onditions   the ighth o t c in E District e  strong nd  labor  arkets  are ery  tight.  he  unemployment rate n  the ighth ar a m v T i E District   actually  bit elow the  national  verage. ather han  repeat  he  kinds f  anecdotes  e is a b a R t t o w have  heard  before long hose ines,  would like o  emphasize  my interpretation he  Asian a t l I t of  t situation cause  think e are  all earching  or hat  s  the ey  to  understanding  here  we are. be I w s f t a k w

In  my view  there re  three nalytically tinct  fects  the  U.S.  economy that low a a dis ef on f from  Asia.  One is he  trade ffect.  f e search,  e find irms nd  industries  at re  impacted t e I w w f a th a by  reduced sian  demand for .S.  goods.  In  the  Eighth istrict,   see  this  n  food  processing, A U D we i including  hickens.   was surprised  o  discover  ow high  a fraction  istrict od  exports  o  to c I t h ofD fo g Asia.

Secondly, fter  he  summer,  as  the  impacts f  Asian  developments nd the a t o a appreciation   those mpacts rew,  we obviously  ad  declining  nterest  tes.    think hat ame of i g h i ra I t c about  for wo  reasons: ne,  safe-haven  oney came to  the nited  States;  econdly,  here t o m U s t emerged a  view  in  U.S.  markets hat  he  Asian  impacts ould slow  the conomy and  that he t t w e t odds  on monetary  policy  ecoming easier  r  tighter d  changed.  That  was an indirect fect b o ha ef from Asia.  I  suspect hat  he  second  reason elating   the  outlook or onetary  policy  as much t t r to f m w more important  han  the  safe-haven  oney  that  ame here.  Obviously,  he  lower  interest  tes t m c t ra are  unambiguously  expansionary  or he  U.S.  economy. f t

The third nalytically  stinct  pact  is  lower  oil rices  hat ave  come about  from  the a di im p t h decline  n  Asian  demand for il. he lower  prices  ave  had  mixed effects   the  United tates. i o T h in S The firms nd the egions hat  pecialize    oil  production  re bviously mpacted egatively,  t a r t s in a o i n bu the  overall  mpact  is ositive cause  we have  a  lot f il onsumers  who are  benefiting. i p be o o c

My  overall  ssessment  s  that  sia  is  primarily  relative mand shock  rather  han  an a i A a de t aggregate  emand shock  for he  United  States.  e  have shifts    the ix of emands in  the .S. d t W in m d U economy. I  believe  e need  to  appreciate  specially  at he articular  pacts e see  in  the w e th t p im w trade ccount  and  in  the  oil egions  re  easy o  spot. hat  is,  hey nvolve  articular  rms, a r a t T t i p fi whereas  the  generalized fects  n  consumers  that ome from  lower  interest  tes  nd  lower il ef o c ra a o

prices  re  much more diffuse.    think hey  are  much more important ut asier  o  miss  precisely a I t b e t because  they  are  so  widespread.

Overall,  t eems  to  me that  lower .S.  growth  than hat  een  in  recent  uarters i s s U t s q is likely  ut  primarily  ecause f esource  onstraints.  onomic activity   umping along,  t b b o r c Ec isb i seems  to  me, above  and  beyond  capacity.    do  not  see  slower rowth  in  aggregate  emand I g d because  I  believe  he nderpinnings  or urther  rowth  in  aggregate  emand are  very  strong. t u f f g d There  are  many  signs f ooming demand. The ones  that mpress e are  the  recent  apid rowth o b i m r g of  income,  output,  nd consumer  demand that s ed  by rising  sset  rices  verywhere  one a i f a p e looks--equities,  ds, eal state--and  gh  and  rising  oney  growth, owever  defined.  his  is bon r e hi m h T not  an issue  f xactly  hat  monetary  aggregate  s ne's  avorite nce  ll f  the s  are  giving o e w i o f si a o M the  same kind  of  picture.  e  also ave  tight  abor arkets  and  wage pressures.  n  sum,  I  don't W h l m I see  anything  n  current  conomic  conditions at uggests  ignificant atives  n  our  outlook. i e th s s neg i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR.  MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  want  to  focus n three spects  f o a o continuity   the  developments ince he  last  eeting.  First, ere as  been  continued in s t m th h exceptional  omentum m in  private  omestic emand and  payroll  mployment,  only  partially d d e offset  y  a  decline  n  net  exports. econd, he trength  n  domestic emand has  continued o  be b i S t s i d t supported y  very  favorable  inancial nditions, cluding  oaring quity rices.  hird, b f co in s e p T favorable  upply hocks, einforced   this  ase  by a sharper-than-expected line  n  oil rices, s s r in c dec i p have  continued  o estrain flation. t r in

I  continue  o ccord n important  ole,  ndeed  a central  ole,  o  favorable  upply t a a r i r t s shocks  in  explaining  ecent  conomic  performance  and  assessing   appropriate urse or r e an co f monetary  policy. hen  there s  an adverse upply hock, t s ell  appreciated  hat  he  bad  news W i s s i i w t t

cannot  be  escaped, nly  shared n  the  near erm  between  higher  nemployment and  higher o i t u inflation.  d  so  it  s ith  a  favorable  upply hock, nly ubstituting d news for ad news. An i w s s o s goo b Policymakers annot  escape he  benefits   matter  ow  they  might  try.  [Laughter] hey can c t no h T only  influence  ow  the enefits e  shared etween  lower  unemployment and  lower  inflation. h b ar b

There  is, f  course,  uch to  like  n  the utcome  of ow  unemployment and  low o m i o l inflation d  in  the  policy  hat as  supported  hat  utcome,  so  far t  least.  n  particular,  s ot an t h t o a I it  n i imprudent o  operate  or  a  while eyond  the  point f  long-run ustainable  pacity  s  part f he t f b o s ca a o t sharing f  the  benefits  f  the upply hock.  Still, e  optimal ourse f  policy  n  this  ase o o s s th c o i c depends  on the xpected ersistence    the  shock, lthough he  length f  time  it ersists e p of a t o p is sometimes  as  much  of  a  surprise   the  shock  itself.    any  rate, e onger-than-expected as At th l persistence   renewal  of  the  favorable  upply hocks as  certainly ntributed   the ery or s s h co to v favorable  utcome and  to  how brilliant etary  policy  ppears fter  he  fact.  he danger  in  this o mon a a t T policy  s he  possibility  misperceiving e  sustainability  he  recent  erformance nd i t of th of  t p a therefore  f  failing   appreciate e ecessity  f  a  transition    some point o  a  more sustainable o to th n o at t state.  iven  the  transition  at ust  ultimately  made,  it ight  be  unwise  to  move still rther G th m be m fu beyond the  point f  sustainable pacity. o ca

The key to  the  Greenbook forecast  he  projected  lowdown immediately head  in ist s a the  rate f  economic  expansion o  below trend rowth.  The Greenbook forecast  hares  his o t g s t feature  ith  almost ll rivate  ector  orecasts. is  is orrisome  because  my experience  s  a w a p s f Th w a forecaster ggests  hat orecasters  n  get  it ll rong,  but  they lmost ever  get t ll ight.  t su t f ca a w a n i a r A any rate,   ave  described  his  idely  shared orecast  s  tracing t  a  graceful  everse  oft Ih t w f a ou r s landing. ecause  the conomy slows  almost  immediately  o  below  trend rowth, t oves B e t g i m gradually  rom its  nitial  int eyond sustainable  pacity  oward  sustainable pacity  ust  s f i po b ca t ca j a

the  favorable  upply hocks  that re estraining  flation  ssipate. e result  n economy that s s a r in di Th isa glides  oward  full  mployment with  still w inflation    we reach  the  end  of he  Greenbook t e o as t forecast  orizon. his  is  remarkably avorable  utcome,  especially nce t ccurs  while  we h T a f o si i o play  spectator.

The risks,  owever,  seem weighted rom  my perspective   stronger  rowth  and  hence h f to g higher verage tilization  tes  nd,  given  the rojected  lowdown,  to  even  sharper  ncreases a u ra a p s i in compensation  and  inflation  an  in  the reenbook forecast. ere  is  still  potential  r urther th G Th a fo f declines  n  the nemployment rate ased  on the  momentum i u b in  demand before he  slowdown t takes old.  There  is  also he  potential at  he rosscurrents    clearly  dentified    the h t th t c so i in Greenbook may work out  a  little  ss avorably  or rice  nflation, rt omewhat more pressure le f f p i exe s on nominal  wage changes, nd  produce  a somewhat sharper  eversal  n  benefit  osts. he latter a r i c T developments,  nteracting  th  a slowdown in  productivity  owth,  suggest he  potential r i wi gr t fo a less enign  than  projected  ath  of  labor  osts  n  coming quarters.  ooking  to  1999,  I  also m b p c i L a concerned  that  here ight  be a  somewhat sharper  eversal  n  the  supply hocks  than  projected t m r i s by the  staff.

Financial  onditions   general nd monetary  policy  n  particular  ve  played c in a i ha important  oles  n  supporting  ecent conomic  performance. avorable inancial nditions  ave r i r e F f co h been supporting  ggregate  emand,  notwithstanding  e  sharp ise  n  the eal ederal  unds  rate a d th r i r f f stemming  from  the  decline  n  inflation.  al  long-term  ates  re  steady o eclining, uity i Re r a t d eq prices  re  soaring, edit  vailability mple, nderwriting  tandards  ay have  eased a cr a is  a u s m somewhat,  loan  pricing  s ggressive, d  money growth  is apid. rue, here  s  good  reason o i a an r T t i t project   decline  n  velocity   the irst arter, d  there  re  some special  actors  hat ikely ve a i in f qu an a f t l ha boosted 2  growth.  Still, ere  s  fairly  lear  ignal  n  the  acceleration   oney growth  that M th i a c s i ofm

The projected  lowdown in  M2  growth  in  the orecast  s ag d s f i only  the  mirror mage  of he  projected  lowdown in  nominal  income  growth, einforced  a i t s r by return  o  a  more stable  elocity th. his  simply ndicates at  f  he sian  slump  slows  the t v pa T i th i t A economic  expansion o  the  degree  projected, e  current  etting   the  funds ate  s onsistent t th s of r i c with  the  slowing f  nominal  income growth  and  hence  money  growth.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Gramlich.

MR.  GRAMLICH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  This  is y fourth  eeting. t  the m m A previous  hree,    felt  ather  onfident   my advice,  nd  I'm fraid    am now joining  he old eet t I r c in a a I t c f crowd. Let  me first ke a few comments on the  Greenbook  forecast  nd  then  a  few on policy ma a strategy.

On the  Greenbook,  there  s   big  change  in  the orecast om  last  ime  that any of i a f fr t m you have  noted.  A  second omment is hat  t east  ne  of  the rojected  ources  f  the lowdown c t a l o p s o s is  and  has  been  questionable  e.  I  think hat  f  ny  of s  really  new what  we were  talking tom t i a u k

about  with  regard o  stock arket  values,  e would not  be  here.  We  would  be  doing  something t m w else.    have  always  been  troubled  y  the orecast  f   stock arket  decline  n  the  sense hat he I b f o a m i t t stock  market  traders  now  everything  hat  e know. They presumably  know about  the arnings k t w e forecasts. ,  I  have  been  troubled  y the  assumption hat  n  effect  e can  see  something hat So b t i w t they  cannot ee.  Mike Prell  as  conveniently ne an alternative  recast  hat  oes  not  assume a s h do fo t d stock arket  decline.  n  that  orecast, owth  in  real DP  does  not  moderate  to  a pace  below  the m I f gr G trend ate f  long-run conomic  growth.  It  gets own to  about rend r  maybe even a bit bove r o e d t o a it,  o  part f he lowdown in  the  staff's  seline  orecast   based  on the  assumption f  a stock s o t s ba f is o market  decline.  here  is nother  ay to  look  at  the tock arket.  If e compare  price/earnings T a w s m w ratios  o  interest  tes, ose atios  o not ecessarily  ok  out  of  line. o,  the arket  decline t ra th r d n lo S m source  of he  slowdown seems  a  little  aky  to e. t sh m

The third  oint   would make about  the  forecast,  d  a lot f ou brought his  ut  with p I an o y t o your  questions,   hat  ven core  inflation   ot eally  core."  There  are  already    lot f ositive ist e isn r " a o p supply  shocks  in  that  easure.  Inflation  uld e  heating  p a little  en  as  we speak, hough m co b u ev t that  s ot  apparent f  e just  ook  at he  CPI excluding  ood  and  energy. i n i w l t f

I  also ant  to  make a  few comments about  policy  trategy.  ctually,  arry eyer w s A L M made the  first en he  talked bout he eaction  o  good news. The point s hat  hile  it s reat wh a t r t i t w i g to  have  low  unemployment,  we cannot  overemphasize t n  relation   inflation.    have  to  be i i to We very  careful  hat  e know  what  we are oing.  Other  than  that, rry  said t ery  well  and  I  will t w d La i v not  repeat  is  comments. h

A second  point n  policy trategy  s hat    am among those ho think  hat  e can o s i t I w t w operate n  the  basis f  a federal  unds ate arget.  ut  the  point f  that  arget  s hat  e have o o f r t B o t i t w tried  o  work out, r thers ave  tried  o ork out, he  way the ederal  unds  rate  eplicates t o o h t w t f f r or

would respond  to  economic  events ad  we been following    money standard.  t  is s  if e are h a I a w following    money growth  standard,  ut  we are  somehow  putting  side ll he upply hocks  or a b a a t s s the  velocity  hocks  that  ive s  so  much trouble  n  interpreting   monetary  aggregates.   hink s g u i the It it s erfectly ssible  o  operate ith  such a  modified oney growth  standard, t  we should i p po t w m bu remember that f  e do so, he  federal  unds  rate ill ounce  around.  The risk  n  following i w t f w b i a funds  rate  arget  s hat e can  get  a arget  hat  s oo igid, d  we ought  to eep  that  n  mind as t i t w t t i t r an k i well.

The third  olicy trategy mment is bout  lags. conomic conditions  re  great ow. p s co a E a n As Alice  Rivlin ays, e may be seeing he est  performance f  an economy ever.  I  am not s w t b o enough  of  a  historian   know about  that, t  it ertainly   as  good as  I  can  remember. As we to bu c is look  around  the orld, e see  that  e are  uniquely lessed, t  we do have  to  look  ahead.  We w w w b bu have  known that  here re  lags n  monetary  policy  nd we should ot  be  conducting  olicy n  the t a i a n p o basis f  what we see  out  the  side oor  as  we drive ut n the asis f  what  we see  ahead.  As I o d b o b o look  ahead,  ust  say  that he  inflation  sks  re  beginning  o et  a  little  re threatening  d Im t ri a t g mo an the  aggregate  emand risks  rom  Asia  are eginning  o  get  a  little  ss hreatening. d f b t le t

The last  oint   would like  o  make relates   something hat  o  my  surprise  obody p I t to t t n has  mentioned  in  all he eetings   have  attended.    get  periodical   my  desk  called  ed t m I I a on F Watch. Probably  all f  you get t. very  time  some new statistics  e out,  ed Watch says  the o i E com F Fed  is  going o  have  heart  alpitations  out his  ew set f  numbers,  but  it  ill ot  do  anything t p ab t n o w n at  this  eeting r  at ts ay  meeting.  I m reluctant   be  that redictable. aughter] m o i M a to p [L

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR.  FERGUSON. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  During  the offee  reak,  resident c b P Boehne suggested  hat  e had  relatively  ttle    say  this  ime  around  because e  had  such  a short t h li to t h

distance  o  travel.  y  office  s  the earest  o  this  oom,  short f  the hairman's,  o  I  will ave t M i n t r o C s h even  less  o  say  this  ime. t t

Let  me observe,  s  others  ave, hat uring he  first arter  he  spillover  om  the a h t d t qu t fr Asian  crisis s indeed  overshadowed  by  the  strength  f omestic emand. Labor  markets  have wa o d d remained  tight,   many of ou have  indicated. e thing    would add  that  e have  not as y On I w discussed  uch is  that hile  short-term terest  tes  ave  risen o  relatively  gh  levels  y m w in ra h t hi b historical  andards, is  e  facto  olicy ightening   ot  associated th  similar  ightness   the st th d p t isn wi t at longer nd  of  the  yield pectrum. isk  spreads or rivate  ebt  instruments  re  quite  arrow, nd e s R f p d a n a the  extension  f redit  o  private nfinancial rrowers rom  numerous  sources--commercial o c t no bo f paper,  ank  lending,  nd so  on--is  unning ell  above  the ace  of he ast  ouple f  years.  So,  I b a r w p t l c o think  we are  in  a very  stimulative  vironment rom  a  monetary  and  financial andpoint. en f st

The second  thing    would add  relates  sia.  We  already  ave  talked  bout  how little I toA h a impact  we have  seen  from  developments n  Asia.  I  have  just  eturned  rom a trip  o  Japan  during i r f t which  I  met with  central  ankers nd finance  inisters  rom  the ffected  ountries.  wo  things b a m f a c T emerged from  those eetings hat   would like o  bring o  your  attention.  e is  that  oth  the m t I t t On b Koreans  and  the hais  certainly  el hat heir  conomies  are n the  road  to  recovery,  ut  they T fe t t e o b describe  heir  ecoveries  s  "U"  shaped, nd  they xpect heir  conomies  to  bounce  along  the t r a a e t e bottom  for n extended eriod efore hey  finally e  some uptick. econdly, he  major a p b t se S t economy in  the egion,  apan,  s  still cing ignificant  allenges.  uring  my visit, ound r J i fa s ch D I  f universal  greement  that he  economy was at  least  tagnant  nd  probably  n  a  recession.  he a t s a i T fiscal  timulus  ackages  introduced  o  date,  he atest e totaling   trillion ,  are  thought  o s p t t l on 16 yen t be far ess timulative  an  they ight  appear. s one  newspaper  indicated,  e ost  recent l s th m A th m

package  is big,  ague,  and  unconvincing." herefore,  think hat  he nited  States  s till kely " v T I t t U i s li to  be  the  importer  f  last  esort  nd  that ore impact s et o e  felt  rom  Asia. o r a m i y t b f

To summarize  these rief  omments,  what  risks  o  I  see? I  believe,   do  a number of b c d as others,  hat here s  an  increasing flation  sk manating rom labor arket  tightness,  om the t t i in ri e f m fr potential  nding f  some of  the  special  actors  hat ave  restrained  flation  cently,  d from e o f t h in re an the  stimulus  hat s  emerging  from financial rkets.  still e  a  possibility  some greatert i ma I se of than-desired ag  from Asia, ut  I  think hat isk  s  less ow than t as at  the ime  of  our  last dr b t r i n i w t meeting.  Overall,    believe  e should  be  in  a vigilant sture, cognizing  hat  he isks  ow I w po re t t r n seem to  be  tilted ward  the pside.    do see  some dangers n  a premature hange  in  policy to u I i c stance  hat ight  be  too  great  r hat ould take arkets y surprise.  nlike  my colleague  o he t m o t w m b U t t right,  think redictability  ometimes  not  a  bad  thing.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice Chair.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr.  Chairman,  the  Second  District   oing  so isd well  that    will ot  spend  any  time  commenting on it. e  have  reached   point f rosperity I n W a o p in New  York City  that  as  led he ayor to  decide hat e should ow spend  most  of  our  time h t M t w n being  nice o  one  another. t

On the  national  evel,  hat do  we know now that e did  not  know at  the ast  eeting? l w w l m There  have  been  some changes. rom everything  e have  heard his  orning, he  Asian  effect F w t m t on the  American economy is  going o  be  less r  at  least  ater an  we thought  t ight  be  at  the t o l th i m last  eeting.   was particularly ressed y  the  fact  hat alifornia,  e lace hat  ne  would m I imp b t C th p t o think s  most  vulnerable   a negative  sian  shock, eems  to  be  doing  extremely ell.  Consumer i to A s w demand is  even  stronger  han e anticipated.    have  had  yet  another  ositive pply hock t w We p su s coming  from  lower  oil rices.  he labor arkets re  tight  nd  may be  even  tighter an hey p T m a a th t

were  at  the  time  f he  last  eeting,  nd  there  s uch  anecdotal  iscussion   some upcreep  in o t m a i m d of compensation. he equity arkets  are  overpriced  n  my view,  but  the  strong  low  into quity T m i f e mutual  funds, hich was very  substantial    February nd  appears o  have  been  very  strong n w in a t i March,  could  well  push  equity rices  ven  higher. p e

One very  positive fect  f ight  abor arkets,  nd one  about  which  we should f o t l m a rejoice,   hat eople  who normally o not  get  hired re  getting  obs n  these arkets  even ist p d a j i m though  they  may have  to  be  trained  efore hey re  able o o  these obs. hat  experience b t a t d j T prepares  hem  better  or he  labor  arkets  of  the uture  nd  not ust  or heir  urrent  obs. t f t m f a j f t c j However,  the  duration  f  these  obs s articularly nerable  o  the olicy ctions  hat  ay be o j i p vul t p a t m needed  to  correct  n overheated  conomy. So,  if  e are  interested    sustaining at ery a e w in th v positive  spect f  our ob  markets,  e have  to e  especially gilant d  not  allow  the conomy a o j w b vi an e to  overheat.

On the  other ide,   hink he  problems  in  Asia  are  in  no  way solved. es,  the s It t Y economies  of  Thailand nd  South  Korea  probably ave  bottomed  out, re  bouncing  along  the a h a bottom, nd  the  policy  ix in  those ountries  uch better.  ndonesia's  oblems  certainly  e a m c ism I pr ar in  no  way resolved.  apan J

A continuing  eak Japanese conomy w e

has  an adverse ffect  n the orld  economy. Also, he  persistence   such  an economy would be e o w t of very  likely  o ring o  an end  the elatively  lm  world  trade nvironment. e  in  the  United t b t r ca e W States  re  very  good at rumbling nd complaining  nd screaming,  ut  we don't  o a  whole  lot a g a a b d about  it. uropeans  are  much better   reacting  nd,  for etter  r or orse, hey efinitely  act. E at a b o f w t d re It s ighly ikely  n  my view  that  f  apan  continues  o  follow ts  resent  olicy  f  allowing  o i h l i i J t i p p o n growth  or  a ecession, ereby roviding    very  weak market  for ther ations' ports  nd r th p a o n ex a

fostering  very  great  esire  o  export hemselves,  e are  likely   have  a serious  rade onflict a d t t w to t c between  Japan  and  Europe.  That  would  not  affect  he orld  economy in  any  positive y! t w wa

Since  the  last  eeting, think e have  had  a  modest  shift  n  the isks  o  the conomy m I w i r t e from  balanced o  somewhat on the t high side. n  my view, he ositive  upply  shocks hat e I t p s t w have  enjoyed re  sufficiently ely  o  continue  hat, r he resent,  can  afford  he uxury f a lik t t fo t p we t l o some additional iting.  ut  this  s  not  a  situation    which the  guardian aiting  n  the ight an wa B i in w i n c allow  himself  o t be lulled  nto leep. ather,  he  guardian hould  be  even  more alert.  t  seems  to i s R t s I me that  here as  been  enough  of  a  shift   the isks  oward  the pside hat  e have  to e  very t h in r t u t w b careful  f ecoming overconfident  bout  our  ability   analyze urrent  roblems  and  relying  oo o b a to c p t much on the  continuation   positive pply hocks  and  in  fact  aiting oo  long. of su s w t

We  have  focused n  two potential ocks  to  the  economy that  re  an  important  ey  to o sh a k the  outlook--Asia d  the  stock  market.

As Vice  Chairman  McDonough s just  aid,  t ow appears hat  e will void  the s i n t w a worst  of he  impacts hat e saw as  possibilities  t    few  months  ago. I  had  been thinking  ntil t t w jus a u quite  ecently  hat ur  forecasts at he  Asian  impact as going o  be  "just ght"  ere  probably r t o th t w t ri w reasonably  ccurate, t  I  am beginning  o  lean o  the iew that  he sian  impact  may turn ut  to a bu t t v t A o be  somewhat less  han  "just ght."    appreciated ll oole's  omments to  that ffect    little t ri 1 Bi P c e a earlier,      understood  im correctly. if I h

In  the  case f he  stock arket,    have  no doubt  that entiment  s oing o  change o t m I s i g t some day. I  remember that  fter    brilliant iod or nvestors   the  1960s,  we experienced a a per f i in what  amounted  to  a 14-year ear  market  starting    1968 and  lasting til  982. I  am not b in un 1 predicting at utcome,  but  some day  the uphoria e are  witnessing  ow will hange.  The th o e w n c change  may occur  today,  ext  month,  next ear--who nows. However,  left  o  its  wn devices, n y k t o there s  a  great eal f omentum i d o m in  the tock arket  also. erious eakness  that ould  have  a s m S w c material  mpact  on macroeconomic  performance ould  be  a  long  time  off. i c

In  short,  agree ith  others  ho have  said ver  the ourse f he  morning  that he I w w o c o t t risks  ow clearly  ppear o  be  to  the pside. n  my view  a move to  tighten  s  becoming n a t u I i increasingly  visable, though   do not  think he ase  for uch  a move is ompelling oday.  I ad al I t c s c t would agree  with  the omments of resident  inehan a  little  rlier at ur ob  now may be  to c P M ea th o j consider  arefully e  timing f  policy  ove that  e increasingly  e  seeing s  necessary. c th o a m w ar a Thank you.

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. The expansion s ow entering  ts ighth i n i e year.  The situation   tarting    feel   bit urreal, rhaps ven  unbelievable.  very  facet f  the iss to a s pe e E o U.S.  economy is urprisingly  rong.  DP  output ontinues  o  expand  briskly.  ousing  activity s st G c t H is  up. The labor arket  remains xtremely ight,  t  employers  have  managed to  contain  osts m e t ye c by  productivity  provements, apital  nvestments, d  creative  abor-management  approaches. im c i an l Throughout  this  rocess,  apacity  ctually s  expanded.

Financial  arkets  have  been supportive  f xpansion.

The monetary  aggregates  lso re  indicating rong u a m a a st growth.  I  recognize  hat  ome of  the  growth  in  the  aggregates  ay be  the esult  f emporary t s m r o t factors  nd  more generally  ay just  e  reflective   ontemporaneous conomic  growth.  Even a m b ofc e so, he  monetary  aggregates  re  pointing  o ignificant  rength. t a t s st

So far,  he sian  crisis s  on balance een  more positive r he  United  States  han t A ha b fo t t negative.  ndeed, he  rest  f  the  world  seems to  be relying  n the nited  States  s  the ngine o I t o o U a e t get  their  conomies  going. e

I  keep  thinking  hat  omething as  to  give.  The rate f conomic  growth  in  1997 and t s h o e the  apparent ate f rowth  that  e are  experiencing   the  first arter  re  not  sustainable.  t r o g w in qu a Bu where is  the lowdown going  to  come from? If e started  o  see  a  deterioration  profits,  at s w t i th probably ould be an  indication at  irms re  no  longer  ble  to  offset  heir  ncreasing bor w th f a a t i la

Again,  as  I aid,   hink hat s u w in d s It t i fairly  nlikely. u

The Asian  crisis uld  turn ore negative. ndeed,  lthough onditions  eem to  have co m I a c s stabilized    Thailand nd Korea, t s  hard  to  know whether  or  not  some of he ong-term in a i i t l changes  that eed  to  be  put  into lace n  those ountries tually e  going o  occur. nless n p i c ac ar t U conditions  n  those ountries  ecome more transparent,   I  mean transparent stern  style, i c b and We reduced  foreign  apital  or nvestment  ill imit  heir  conomic  growth.  Absent  bank c f i w l t e supervisory  eforms nd  a  shoring p  of  domestic ank  balance heets, e  proverbial edit r a u b s th cr crunch  will low  their  ecoveries.   say  that here  re  cultural fferences en we try o s r We t a di wh t understand  hat  is oing  on in  Asia, ut  it s  difficult  determine ow these ultural fferences w g b i to h c di are  going  to  play ut  in  a  crisis vironment nd whether  some of hese ountries e  going  to o en a t c ar make the  long-term hanges  that  re  needed  to  stabilize  eir  conomies.  So,  even  though  it c a th e appears hat onditions  ave  stabilized, east  n  two of hese ountries,  e ury ay in  fact till t c h at  l i t c th j m s be  out  with  regard o  the  long-term  conomic  performance f hose ountries. rtainly, t e o t c Ce we cannot  say  that onditions ve  stabilized    Indonesia, d  they  have  not  yet  started   improve c ha in an to for apan.  For  the nited  States, e  latter    a  bigger isk. J U th is r

For  now, I  think he alance f he  risks  eems  to ave  shifted  oward  stronger  rowth. t b o t s h t g The slowdown from  Asia  is tarting    show up, ut  it as  not  exerted  uch  restraint s  far, s to b h m thu and in  fact t  s ard  to  know  how much  of  a  restraining  fect  t ill ave.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Thank you very  much.  I  will ow  call  n Don Kohn. n o

MR.  KOHN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. Governor  Phillips d  a an number of  others entioned  money growth  in  their  resentations,   I m p and thought his  ight  be  one  of hose nfrequent casions  hen discussion t m t i oc w of this  ubject  ould be  helpful.   ill egin  with  some comments on the s w Iw b surprising rength  n  money growth  and  use  that  s  a  lead-in  o  issues st i a t involved n  the  Committee's  urrent  olicy.    will e  using he  chart hat i c p I b t t was distributed  is  orning. th m 2 My  remarks  will ocus  on  M2  because  that f aggregate  as  been  the ne  most  closely  ssociated th  spending  since h o a wi deposit  ates ere  deregulated  n  the  early 980s  and, onsequently, e r w i 1 c th aggregate  ost  closely  ollowed y  the  Committee and  the  staff er  that m f b ov period.

As can  be  seen  in  the pper eft-hand nel, 2  growth  has  been u l pa M accelerating  er  the ast  ew quarters.  he pickup  in  growth  in  the econd ov l f T s half  f  last  ear nd  the  first arter  f  1998 does  not ppear o e  a result o y a qu o a t b of increasingly  ster  rowth  of  nominal  GDP, at  least  ased  on the reenbook fa g b G forecast  f  current-quarter  . o GDP

Instead,  s  is vident  n  the pper ight  anel,  elocity  urned own  in a e i u r p v t d the  second  half  f  1997 following  everal  ears n  which a  residual  ptrend o s y i u in  velocity  ersisted,  en after  he ajor  shifts   the arly 990s. And that p ev t m of e 1 decline eems  to  have  become faster   1998 despite  nchanged  opportunity s in u costs s  conventionally asured. a me

The middle  panel  lists  few hypotheses  or hy velocity  ay be a f w m declining.  irst, me special  actors  ave  artificially  sted 2  growth F so f h boo M relative    spending oward  the nd  of ast  ear  and  early n  1998. These to t e l y i have  included  ontinued trong  verseas  urrency hipments,  nlarged c s o c s e mortgage  refinancings,  ich  tend  to  be  associated th  temporary eposits wh wi d in  liquid  ccounts,  he  effects   accelerated x  refunds  nd, erhaps,  he a t of ta a p t recent  uildup f  balances  n  anticipation    outsized  ax  bills.  till, b o i of t S we believe  hat hese pecial  actors  an  account  for nly  a  small art f 2 t t s f c o p o M growth  in  the ourth  nd first arters  nd  none  of he urprise cause  we f a qu a t s be basically d  anticipated em in  January. ha th

A  second  influence  hat  ay be  giving n  unusual oost o 2  growth t m a b t M is  the lat  ield urve.  Savers  sacrifice  ry ittle  rrent  eturn, duce heir f y c ve l cu r re t exposure  to  capital ss,  nd  gain  liquidity  en they e-emphasize o a wh d longer-term  ixed-rate  vestments  n  favor f  liquid  ssets  n  M2.  In  fact, f in i o a i

almost  all he  growth  in  M2  in he  last  wo quarters s  been  in  its  iquid t t t ha l components--money  market  funds  and  savings eposits.  oreover, e saw d M w evidence  of  such  a  redirection   avings lows  in  accelerated noffs  f ofs f ru o noncompetitive  enders  t  Treasury ote  and bill  uctions  ate  ast  ear.  But t a n a l l y in  recent  onths  those unoffs  ave  slackened   bit, d  flows  into  ond m r h a an b mutual  funds  have  been  fairly bust,   such  shifts obably o not  account ro so pr d for  the urther ckup  in  M2  growth  this  ear. f pi y

A third  ossibility ousehold fforts   rebalance  sset  ortfolios. p is  h e to a p Although  the  ratio  f 2  to  GDP  has  been  rising   recent  uarters,    is o M in q M2 becoming a  much smaller  roportion  f  household ealth  owing  to  the p o w tremendous  rise  n  the  market  value f  equities.   response,  eople ould i o In p c be diverting re current  avings r  the  proceeds f ecurities  les  o  M2 mo s o o s sa t to  restore sired  isk xposures. hile this xplanation  s lausible,  e de r e W e i p on has  to onder why such  shifts ve  begun in  the  last  ew quarters  hen w ha f w equity rices  ave  been  skyrocketing r everal  ears. p h fo s y

Fourth, ome scale  ariable  ther han  GDP  or  wealth  may be driving s v o t M2  demand,  or  current-quarter   may be underestimated. come has GDP In been  growing  faster an  published r  estimated  DP, and  so, oo,  n  most th o G t i quarters  ncluding  he  first,   private  omestic pending. n  the  past,  hese i t has d s I t alternative  ale ariables  ave  been  no  better  elated   M2  over he  long sc v h r to t run  than as  nominal  GDP. h But  our  standard  odel does  use  consumption m spending  to  explain hort-run  ovements in  M2, and  people  may be s m accumulating elatively  rge mounts  of 2  to  support urrent  nd  future r la a M c a private  pending,  hose growth, wing to  a idening  trade eficit d s w o w d an damped government  outlays,   outstripping  at f  GDP.  And, as  Mike is th o Prell  oted  earlier,  e apid rowth  of mployment in  the  current  uarter n th r g e q may be telling   that DP  is  stronger  han  estimated  n  the reenbook. us G t i G

Lastly,  he  money demand relationship  s  always  been  fairly t ha noisy--even  n  previous ecades  when, in  hindsight,   eems  to ave  been i d its h well-behaved.  nnovations  ver  the  past 0 years,  hich have  made a I o 2 w broader enu  of  financial sets  ore readily  nd  inexpensively ailable m as m a av to households,  hould nly  have  added  to  that  oise. e  have  never een  able s o n W b to  identify l he actors  ffecting   demand,  especially er eriods s al t f a M2 ov p a short  s  a  few quarters,  d  undoubtedly y list sses  some that  re a an m mi a relevant  ow. This  uncertainty ises  uestions  bout  the  implications n ra q a of unexpected  variations    M2  growth  over  relatively  ort  ime  frames  for he in sh t t Committee's bjectives  or pending r  prices. s a  consequence, ince he o f s o A s t early 980s  the  Committee  has  been  unwilling  o  tie  ts  ehavior  oo losely 1 t i b t c to  M2  or  to  any  other  onetary  indicator. m

As you can  see  in  the ottom  panel, 2  growth  over  a year's me  had b M ti a strong ssociation th  future  pending n  the  1960s  and 1970s.  But  that a wi s i relationship  s  weakened considerably   the  1980s  and 1990s, ven ha in e

outside  he  velocity-shift  rs f  the  early 990s.  The earlier ading t yea o 1 le indicator operties rked importantly rough  differential s  in  the pr wo th lag responses  f  money and spending o  changes  in  interest  tes.  f,  or o t ra I f example,  the ederal eserve, eeing oney and economic activity owing F R s m gr too  rapidly, ised  nterest  tes, nancial rtfolios  uld  be  reallocated ra i ra fi po wo fairly  romptly ut  of  money,  whose rates  ended  to  adjust  luggishly,  to p o t s in market  instruments, t  spending ended  to  be  trimmed  much more slowly. bu t Hence,  money would weaken before he  economy. For  money to  be a t leading  ndicator rough his  echanism,  the  Federal eserve  needed  to i th t m R react  o  contemporaneous r  lagging ndicators  he  economy and  it t o i oft needed  to  move short-term  nterest  tes  ubstantially ffect  pportunity i ra s to  a o costs. ince  the  early 980s, he  Federal eserve  has  become increasingly S 1 t R more anticipatory,  effect  hanging  short-term terest  tes--and, in c in ra implicitly, ey stock  growth--to  ead  off wings  in  GDP, which  were mon h s then  more damped. And, of  course,  n  the  last  ew years he  Committee  has i f t not  had  to  ove  short-term tes  ery  much, leaving  2  largely  o  fluctuate m ra v M t passively  ith  contemporaneous  spending.  So it s ot  surprising  at  he w i n th t reliability 2  as  a leading  ndicator s  been  considerably duced. of  M i ha re

That  does  not  mean the  monetary  surge n  1997 and  early his  ear an i t y c be  ignored,  side rom  the ossible  mplication at  ontemporaneous a f p i th c GDP may be  higher  han  the  staff   forecasting.  e  portfolio ift  hat  as t is Th sh t h raised 2  relative    income  results portantly  rom  more accommodative M to im f conditions  n  key  sectors  f omestic inancial rkets  over  recent  uarters. i o d f ma q The decline  n  nominal  long-term  ates, ich has  flattened e  yield urve i r wh th c and spurred ortgage  refinancing,  d the ise  n  equity alues,  hich  has m an r i v w elevated  ax  obligations  d  increased  sset  ortfolios, e  boosted oth t an a p hav b M2  and spending.  And we haven't  iscussed  3, whose very  rapid d M expansion s elated  n  large  easure  to  accelerating  edit  rowth  at i r i m cr g depository  nstitutions,  ch,  in  turn,  s  part f   broader ickup n  the i whi i o a p i availability   use  of  credit.  he relationship  tween  money  and  current and T be or  future  pending ay not  be  very  tight, t  from  this  erspective rong s m bu p st growth  of  money  reinforces e essage  from other inancial rket th m f ma indicators at  inancial nditions e  quite  upportive  f  domestic th f co ar s o spending,  nce  we look  past he  level  f  the eal ederal  unds ate. o t o r f f r

It  was those inancial nditions,  ong  with  the  lagged ultiplierf co al m accelerator  fects  f  recent  conomic strength  hat ed he  staff   raise  he ef o e t l t to t level f  spending hroughout  he  forecast riod. o some extent,  he taff o t t pe T t s projection y simply  be catching  p to  the  Committee, ut  the ecent ma u b r upward revisions  highlight e  risks  n  the  outlook. ven in  January,  he do th i E t forecasts   both  the taff  nd  FOMC of s a members portrayed  he  economy as t operating  eyond  most  estimates  f ts  ustainable tential,  least  n  the b o i s po at i labor arket.  Obviously,  he evisions centuate  hat  endency,  nd  in  the m t r ac t t a staff  orecast  nderlying  nflation  s  assumed  a more discernible  ward u i ha up tilt. us,  the  data n the conomy and  financial rkets  along  with Th o e ma

forecast  evisions uld seem to  argue  for ore serious  onsideration   a r wo m c of near-term  irming f  policy. f o

But  there emain  reasons  hy the  Committee  may want  to  wait.  It as r w w supply  uncertainties--questions  t hether  the  economy might  be  able o abou w t sustain  aster  xpansion hrough aster  roductivity owth  and  a  higher f e t f p gr level f esource  tilization n  suggested o r u tha by history--that erred  he det t Committee  from  tightening st  all,  nd  those ncertainties e  not  been la f a u hav resolved.  espite   low unemployment rate  nd  anecdotes f  strains D a a o in labor arkets,  age and compensation nflation  ill ems to  be  moving up m w i st se only  slowly. rice nflation  mains argely  uiescent, d a  resumption  f P i re l q an o robust nvestment  pending n  the  first arter  hould eep  industrial i s i qu s k capacity  mple. On the  other ide,  isappointing ofits   fourth-quarter a s d pr in data nd first-quarter  imates,  rhaps  associated   part ith  weaker a est pe in w productivity  rformance,  ay be  early igns f  emerging  cost ressures. pe m s o p

On  the emand side  of he  economy,  robust omestic pending as d t d s h been  expected o  a  considerable tent, d  the uestions  ave  involved  he t ex an q h t coming offset  rom  the oreign  ector, ich is ust  merging  in  the  data. f f s wh j e The size nd  timing f  the ffset  emain  very  uncertain, ven  the  still a o o r gi unfolding  rama  in  Asia  and the carcity precedents  or auging ts d s of f g i effects  n  the o U.S. economy. In  a  fundamental ense he  situation s  not s t ha changed  that uch over  the  long  intermeeting riod. he Committee m pe T remains  in  the ifficult  sition   waiting d po of for a  moderating nfluence  f i o unknown  dimensions,  ith  the  economy uncomfortably trong  nd ebullient w s a financial rkets  feeding hat trength--it's    hat  he  economy is tronger ma t s just t t s and  markets  more ebullient  an  anticipated. th

On the  positive de,  evelopments n  train  o  support  rowth  and si d i t g contain nflation  an that  he i me t ill effects  f  either o too much or  too  little external  ector  estraint  e  likely s r ar to be muted for ome time.

Clearly,  he  situation   ifficult    get  into ontext  ecause f  e take he evel f,  ay, t isd to c b i w t l o s the  S&amp;P  500  and  decompose it nto  he  riskless  te f nterest,  rojected te f  growth  in i t ra o i thep ra o

That  in  and  of tself  esn't ll  s  terribly  ch until  e look  at  the d p i do te u mu w implications   the  earnings  xpectations at  re  implicit   that  tructure.  e convert  he of e th a in s Ifw t earnings  xpectations r he  S&amp;P  500 into  perating  rofits    the  NIPA  accounts,  hen rofit e fo t o p in t p margins,  hich have  been  rising  onsiderably r uite    period f ime, ontinue  o  rise w c fo q a o t c t indefinitely;  y  eventually  reak  through o  all ime  highs  and  still ntinue  o  rise.  verything the b t t co t E we know about  the  way the  system  functions  mplies  hat  hat s  an  utterly realistic i t t i un expectation.

The question,  owever, s ow far he ise  n  stock arket  prices  an  go. We  know h i h t r i m c from history  hat arkets an  be  perceived  s  overvalued or n exceptionally  ng  period f t m c a f a lo o time.  It s uite onceivable,    the  Vice  Chair ays,  hat  he xtraordinary ows  into quity i q c as s t t e fl e mutual  funds  can sustain  his  arket  phenomenon  for  hile.  But  countering  hat s omething t m aw t i s that as not  very  evident  he  last  ime  we met, amely, hat  perating  arnings  re eginning  o w t t n t o e a b t come up short f  forecasts,  d  indeed heir  rowth  rate learly s  begun  to  decline  n  the ast o an t g c ha i p several  onths.  These  are ot  the  numbers  that  re  showing  up so  far n  the arnings  er hare m n a i e p s of  the &amp;P  500  companies  because hat  ndex  provides    biased stimate  f  total  arnings.  he S t i a e o e T S&amp;P  500,  by  the ature f  its  election iteria, ks p  those ompanies  that  re  growing  most n o s cr pic u c a rapidly  nd  whose earnings  enerally  ave  been  quite mpressive.  onetheless, ere  s o  doubt a g h i N th i n that he  earnings  rowth  numbers  are  slowing  down. t g

That  means that or he  first me  in  evaluating e  unit ost tructure   nonfinancial f t ti th c s of corporations,   are  not  looking  t  the  phenomenon that    have  referred   many times t hese we a I to a t meetings  of  a  very  low  inflation  te nd stable  r  rising erating  rofit  argins,  he  direct ra a o op p m t implication   which  is hat rowth  of  unit osts  s egligible.   are  still eing  ery  low of t g c i n We se v inflation. e estimates  hrough he  first arter  re  about  as  low as  we have  seen  for uite Th t t qu a q a while, il  obviously  eing  relevant  actor  ere.  But  even apart rom  oil rices,  do  not  yet o b a f h f p we see  any  meaningful cceleration   inflation.  e evidence f  pricing  ower on the  part f a of Th o p o business  s  still cking.  here  is  no anecdotal  vidence f hich I m aware--and   have  not i la T e o w a I heard  any  in  the iscussion re--that  ggests    change  in  the  suppression  f  pricing  ower. d he su a o p Indeed,  n  the eigebook  summary, I  have  forgotten  he xact hrase,  ut  it as noted hat i B t e p b w t pressures  n product rices  ere "eerily  alm." That  in  fact s haracteristic hat  is oing  on o p w c i c of  w g at  this  tage. e  have  very  little  idence f  inflation,   we are  beginning  o  see  pressures s W ev o but t emerge in  the  cost tructure,  d  that bviously  s ne  of  the  reasons hy profit  argins  are s an o i o w m beginning o  slip. t

Even though  we continue  o  get  declining it onlabor osts,  e are eginning o  see t un n c w b t some acceleration,  ill t  large,  n  unit  abor osts. n  the onfinancial rporate  ector,  are st no i l c I n co s we seeing n  increase  n  hourly ompensation  at  a  rate f  roughly  percent.  hat  rate  s  not a i c o 4 T i accelerating    this  tage,  nd I  suspect  ne  of he easons s hat irms re  using very  novel  way at s a o t r i t f a e they an devise o  keep  compensation osts  own.  Obvious also re  their  fforts   improve c t c d a e to productivity.

The  productivity  mbers are  very  rough  estimates cause  we are  measuring   whole nu be a set  of roduct utputs  rom  one  set f  data  and  a  whole  set f abor  nputs rom  a  different  t. p o f o o l i f se That  they ome out  even  remotely easuring  actual  abor roductivity   pen  to  question  n  my c m l p iso i

view.  Nonetheless,  e do  see  some slowdown in  the ublished ata,  lthough utput er  hour w p d a o p estimated  hrough he  first arter  f  1998 for onfinancial rporate  usiness  till ows a  2.3 t t qu o n co b s sh percent  ncrease  rom  four uarters  arlier. at  is own  only  modestly rom  a  year go  but i f q e Th d f a down significantly m  the  surge  that  e saw in  the  middle  of  last  ear, hich surely  as an fro w y w w aberration.  you will ecall, S  estimates  hat  utput er  hour  increased  t   6.3  percent As r BL t o p a a annual  rate  n  the  third  uarter  f  1997. It ust  s ot  possible r roductivity    increase  hat i q o j i n fo p to t fast.    think he our-quarter  erage s  more meaningful. roductivity  ins n  these ata ppear I t f av i P ga i d a to  be  sufficiently ong  o  keep  increases  n  unit abor osts own to  an annual ate f bout str t i l c d r o a 1-1/2 percent  or onfinancial rporations. f n co

Basically,   are  observing   very  substantial  alth ffect  ut  one  that as  not  yet we a we e b h spilled  ver  to  a  significant ent  nto he  product rea, reating  hortages  f oods  and  services. o ext i t a c s o g As you know, there re  none.  The National ssociation  f  Purchasing  anagers'  survey a A o M indicates at I  think  s  a  record ull  n  reported hortages  f aterials.  here  is  no  evidence f wh i l i s o m T o tightness    facilities.  re  is xceptional  ightness    labor arkets,  bviously, d if nything, in The e t in m o an a they  are  getting  ighter.   have a henomenon that  on't  hink e have  seen  in  the  post t We p Id t w World War II  period. his  economic  performance  is eally  ifferent. on't  now how one T r d I  d k would  determine hat  it s,  ut  there  s  some "X" factor,  missing ariable   our  basic odels, w i b i a v in m that as  to  be there  o xplain hy even  with  these xceptionally  ght  abor arkets,  e are  only h t e w e ti l m w getting  n increase  n  compensation  per our  of  slightly  re than  4  percent  nd,  more a i h mo a importantly,  y pricing  ower  is ot  evident  n  this  ituation. wh p n i s

Nonetheless,  here  s  very  little  idence o  suggest hat  onetary  policy  s ight.  e t i ev t t m i t W cannot  explain hy the  underlying  emands in  the  interest-sensitive  s f he  economy are  as w d area o t strong  s  they re, nd I  will ven  acknowledge  that  aybe the  weather as  had  some effect  n a a a e m h o

both  housing nd  some sectors  f he  retail rkets hat  re  displaying re strength  han  one a o t ma t a mo t would  expect,  t  least  n a  historical  sis,  iven he  level f  short-term terest  tes. a o ba g t o in ra

All  in  all,  e have  an  economic  performance hat  s ssentially  sustainable.   s w t i e un Iti unsustainable    two  contexts.  ne,  the tock arket  as  far s  I an  see annot  sustain  ts  urrent in O s m a c c i c strength.  he aggregative  irtuous  ycle hat  s mbodied in  it annot eep  going  without T v c t i e c k ultimately nning ff he  track. here  is  no  credible  odel of  which  I  am aware  that  mbodies ru o t T m e all f  this.  n  my judgment, choing  good deal  of  what  has  been said round  this  able, less o I e a a t un either  rofit  argins  decline  r  some other evelopments reak he  back  of his  tock arket p m o d b t t s m surge  in  the  very  hort  un  and  take uch  of he trength t  of  the  forces  hat  ominate his s r m t s ou t d t expansion,  e will ave more inflation.  en so,  the  adjustment  annot appen  very  rapidly w h Ev c h even  though  the  economy could  begin  to  go in  a  different  rection. e alternative  enario  s di On sc i that  he  fallout om the  Asian  situation, ch as  far s  the  Greenbook  is  concerned s  about  to t fr whi a i exert   significant  fect  n  our  economy,  actually  ill o  so.  It s enerally  orrect  o ay  that a ef o w d i g c t s the  economies  of  Southeast  sia  are ery  weak. The Japanese overnment  estimates  hat A v g t industrial  oduction  ill e significantly ative  n  February nd  March. The first arter  s pr w b neg i a qu i very  clearly ch weaker  than  the ourth.    think hat,  f nything, e apanese conomy is  in  a mu f I t i a th J e fairly  ronounced  recession  t  this  tage. hat  is  also he  case  in  Thailand nd  Korea  where p a s T t a production  as  fallen  ery  dramatically. e weakness  associated th  Asian  developments as h v Th wi h not  yet  reached hese hores  ully, t  there  ave  been  some pricing  epercussions  d  orders t s f bu h r an clearly  ave  been affected.  ut  it s  by  no  means clear  hat ven  at  its  ull orce,  s  a  number  of h B i t e f f a you including  ill  oole  have  indicated,  e sian effect  ill e  enough  to  undercut  his B P th A w b t expansion o  an  extent  hat  rives  t ff rack. t t d i o t

Therefore,  n  a  sense esponding  o  Cathy  Minehan's uestion  f  when we will tart  o i r t q o s t move, I  believe  hat  e are unning ut  of  time.  I  think hat nless his  ystem  starts t w r o t u t s to self-correct  irly ortly,   will  have  no choice ut  to  move. In  the  process,  e could  very fa sh we b w well  crack he tock arket.  We  could  affect    lot f hings ecause his enevolent  irtuous t s m a o t b t b v cycle robably as  also  created  n  increasing lnerability  the  sense hat ield preads ave p h a vu in t y s h fallen  o  unbelievable mbers,  the  slack ttitude  ending fficers  s  become a potential t nu a ofl o ha concern,  nd  the isks  hat eople  normally re  worried bout ave  tended o  be  ignored. ll  this a r t p a a h t A means that f e have  a sharp djustment,  ill ccur  at  a  time  when the  vulnerability  the i w a itw o of economic  system  is  far reater  han  is he ase  when we have  a great eal  of ncertainty.  ere g t t c d u Th is  too ittle  certainty   this  ystem.  Human  nature  as  not  changed  and  when it easserts l un in s h r itself, ngs  re  going  to ook  a lot ifferent. thi a l d

To translate  l f  this  nto olicy,  think  e ought o  be  moving back  to  asymmetry at al o i p I w t this  tage ecause  developments ince he  last  eeting  have  changed  economic  conditions s b s t m enough  to  justify  at.    do  not hink  t s  appropriate   move at his tage. ere we to  do so, th I t i i to t s W I believe  e would create  oo  large   shock  to  the  system, hich it ould not  be able o  absorb w t a w w t quickly. ore importantly, on't  hink here  s hat uch urgency.  What we are  observing  an M I  d t t i t m c go on for   quite ignificant  riod f  time.  While  I  agree ith  those ho say  that roduct rice a s pe o w w p p inflation timately s  to  accelerate d  something  has  to  give  at  some point f  he rowth  of ul ha an i t g effective mestic emand continues  t  the  current  ace, hat  s ot  necessarily ing  to  happen do d a p t i n go very  quickly. hat's  ecause he  productivity  mbers are  reasonably  trong nd  the  absence  of T b t nu s a pricing  ower  is  still ry  much a  factor  n  holding  own  inflation.   s  by  no  means evident  f p ve i d Iti i we look, or xample, t  the  chain-weighted  DP  deflator   the  domestic urchases eflator, f e a G or p d that  rices re  in  any  sense ccelerating.  deed,  he  first-quarter  imate  s he owest e have p a a In t est i t l w

seen  in  this  yclical pansion. art f  the  explanation  bviously  s il, hough  I on't  now c ex P o o i o t d k what  that art  s.  But  as  we discussed  efore,  e just  annot ake il ut  of  our  inflation p i b w c t o o measures  and  make believe  t oes  not  exist;  s  too ig  a  factor  n  an  economy. As I ee  it,  he i d iti b i s t overall  nflation te  as  shown no  evidence f  accelerating    this  tage. o be sure,  he  core i ra h o at s T t CPI did  show an uptick, t  a  good part f  that  s obacco,  hich  is  no  longer  n open  market bu o i t w a product. hile  airline res  id  go up and  they re  an open market  product,  e are  not  yet W fa d a w getting  he nflation  essure.  o,  I  think hat e have  to  be, s  the ice  Chair aid,  n a  new t i pr S t w a V s o alert  ecause  if  his  xpansion oes  not  slow  down,  we will ave  to tart   move.  I hink  he b t e d h s to t t clock  is tarting   tick,  nd  my guess  is hat nless he vidence f  an  Asian  slowdown is airly s to a t u t e o f pronounced  and/or he  stock arket  goes  in  the ther irection,   will e singing    different t m o d we b a tune  the  next ime  we meet. t

So,  I  would  recommend  and put  "B" asymmetric  on  the able  or onsideration. eel t f c I  f uncomfortable  bout  switching  ack  to  asymmetry  after  aving oved to  symmetry so  recently, a b h m but  I  think he eal orld  has  changed.  Vice  Chair. t r w

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr.  Chairman,  I  support our  proposal. y I think t ould  be  unwise  to hange  our  policy oday,  ut  what  you  have  said nd  the  general i w c t b a tenor f  the  comments around  the able onvince e that e will ot  hesitate   move when the o t c m w n to evidence s  somewhat more clear  hat hat  s  the ppropriate ing o  do.

MR.  PARRY. Mr. Chairman,  I  certainly pport  our  recommendation  of o  change su y n at  the resent  ime  and  I  very nthusiastically  port  he ove to  asymmetry.  It eems  to  me p t e sup t m s that he  discussion  trongly  upports  uch  a  move. t s s s

I  have  a  question.  t elates  y recollection  at hen we talked bout  how we I r tom th w a were going  to  handle he  public nnouncement  of  a  no-change  decision,  discussed  he t a we t possibility  making a statement  o  accompany such  an announcement.  If ne  thinks  hat of t o t economic developments  are  moving in  a  direction ere  it s ikely  hat   change  in  policy  ould wh i l t a w occur--say,    the ext  meeting--and  iven  that  ou have  stressed e  importance f  laying at n g y th o a foundation  or   policy hange, he  adoption f  asymmetry  clearly  ould  lay  a  foundation.  ut f a c t o c B under  our  current  rocedures  he  asymmetry is nnounced  two  days  after  he ext eeting, o  the p t a t n m s public s  not  put  on  notice  n a timely asis.    wonder  if  here  s ome virtue  o aking a i o b I t i s t m statement  n  our nnouncement  about  the  strength  f he  economy. i a o t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  is  an interesting  estion.    would appreciate qu I hearing ther omments on that. ice  Chair,  o  you have  a comment? o c V d

VICE CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. If he  economy continues  o  move in  this t t direction tween now and  the  next  meeting,    think hat  e would have  to egin  preparing  he be I t w b t way. I  do  not  object  o hat  Bob Parry s uggesting.  arginally,  would  prefer  hat  ou do  it t w i s M I t y in  a  policy  peech. s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  would be  my inclination.  e reason   would feel Th I uncomfortable  ith  a short  ress tatement  s hat e could  not  leave t  t  that.  he question w p s i t w i a T would remain  as  to  why we did  it. f t ppears hat  conomic  developments re  beginning o I i a t e a t move us  toward  a policy  hange,   think  e will ave  a lot  ore to  explain.    might  add, c I w h m I incidentally,  t e cannot e  perceived  s  moving to hwart he  stock arket.  That  may be tha w b a t t m implicit    our  analysis  f  what  the conomy is  doing,  ut  a move to urb  the  buildup n  stock in o e b c i market  wealth s  a very  difficult ue o  put  on  the  table.  e  have  to  be  very  careful  bout hat. i iss t W a t

The argument  is hat he  wealth ffect  s riving  omestic  demand,  which  in  turn s riving  he t t e i d d i d t product  markets, ut  it annot  be  other han  that,  f  ay put  it hat  ay. b c t i Im t w

MR.  PARRY. Mr. Chairman,  can appreciate e  viewpoint hat  ill cDonough I th t B M expressed,  nd  I an  understand  hat  here  ay be  opportunities  r ou to  lay hat oundation.  t a c t t m fo y t f I is  obvious hat f  e do  not  change  our  current  rocedure,  hen  going o  asymmetry  does  not t i w p t t accomplish hat  we want. Asymmetry  would  serve  to  alert  he ublic nly  if   decision  o w t p o a t change  our  policy  ere delayed eyond  the ext  meeting. w b n

On the  issue  f reparing  he  market,  hink   policy peech  by  you at he  appropriate o p t It a s t time  is  far uperior  o  a  two  or  three  entence  ress elease.  here  are  a  couple f easons: ne, s t s p r T o r O I  think hat  f ou need  to  make such  a  policy tatement,  have  to e  prepared o  follow airly t i y s we b t f quickly  ith  policy ction. e  don't  ant  to  get  ourselves  nto   "cry olf" ituation  ere  we w a W w i a w s wh talk nd  do  not  act. o,  I ould prefer  hat ou  wait  until  t  ooks  as  though  a  policy  ction  eeds a S w t y i l a n to  take lace. our speech  would prepare  he  markets  at  that ime, nd a  policy ction ould p Y t t a a w follow. ltimately,  s  actions, t  words,  that  ount, nd  words will nly  matter f hey  are U iti no c a o i t followed y action. econd,  I  would suggest hat  n  addition  o  the sual acroeconomic b S t i t u m rationale r  action,  uch  a  policy peech  should tress  hat e like  ood times,  hat e like fo s s s t w g t w people o  have  jobs,  nd  that  e are  acting  o ustain  he ood  times. he  point as made earlier t a w t s t g T w that  he  lower chelons f he  labor orce re  now  beginning  o  participate    this  rosperity,  d t e o t f a t in p an they  would  be  the irst   be  unemployed  if  hings  ent  awry.

MR.  BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I xpected he  general one f  this  eeting  to  be e t t o m more bullish  han  it as at  the ebruary eeting,  ut  the ullish  omments today  have  exceeded t w F m b b c my expectations!  o,  it ill ot  surprise u or  anyone  else hat  ould still efer  o  take S w n yo t Iw pr t action oday.  Governor  Gramlich's  omments about  operating  ith  a  funds  rate  arget  esonated t c w t r with  me. It s ertainly ue hat e have  had  some movement in  the eal ederal  unds  rate,  ut i c tr t w r f f b we have  pegged  the ominal  funds  rate  or lmost  two years.  Obviously,  f  e do  not  move the n f a i w rate tself    this  eeting,    would  certainly pport ery,  ery  strongly  our  recommendation  for i at m I su v v y asymmetry.

I  have  a  lot f ympathy  with  the oint hat  ob Parry ade, and  I as in  fact oing  to o s p t B m w g raise  he ame issue.  hink hat  f  e do move to  an asymmetric  directive,   ould  be  desirable t s It t i w itw to  announce  that  ecision  ow rather  han  waiting  or ix  or  seven  weeks. I elieve  t s d n t f s b i i important,   use  Bill cDonough's metaphor, or s  to  let eople  know that he uardian s to M f u p t g i there nd  the  guardian  s  awake.

MR. BROADDUS. It ould be more convenient,   doubt  about  it. aybe  the  best w no M way--

MR.  BROADDUS.

We  will ave  enough  other  roblems  in he c o 2 h p t year  2000 without aving  to  deal ith  a  recession  nd a  real state  ebacle.   thought  hat our h w a e d I t y remarks, r.

I  agree hat  t  s ot  a  reason o  do  something,  ut  in  my  view s m t i i n t b

it lso s  not  a  reason ot  to o  something.  I elieve  hat  easons or aking ction ould  be  the a i n d b t r f t a w excessive  rowth  of  the hole constellation  money  and  credit  ggregates, e pward revision g w f a th u of  expectations out  the  growth  of  economic  activity,  d  what  is  going  on  in  the anking ab an b industry  nd  especially    the eal state  arkets. a in r e m A 1/4 percentage  oint ncrease  n  the ederal p i i f funds  rate ow  would  deliver    very  important  essage.  We  are  going  to  get ome first-quarter n a m s numbers  that  ill ake it bvious  to  everybody  why we acted.   am  concerned hat  n the  basis w m o I t o of  the  published  nformation, e ase  on the  surface  or  move may not  be  as  compelling  y  the i th c f a b middle  of  May  as  it  s oday, o  I  would strongly  refer  aking  ction oday. i t s p t a t

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  I  can accept our  recommendation  as  you presented  t. y i There  is nformation  hat uggests  e can wait: he  relatively  gh  real ederal  unds  rate,  airly i t s w t hi f f f low and  trendless flation ght  ow, and  bond  markets  that re  signaling nign  inflation in ri n a be expectations. t  there  s  also n issue f  timing.   believe  e should ove fairly on,  if  ot  at Bu i a o I w m so n this eeting,  ecause f  the  information  n the conomy:  Our labor arkets  are  obviously  ight, m b o o e m t aggregate  emand growth  remains  quite  obust,  onetary  growth  is ccelerating  en  though d r m a ev there s ncertainty out  velocity,  d finally,  ere re  increasingly  equent  eports  f arge i u ab an th a fr r o l amounts  of  global iquidity  eking nvestment  utlets d accelerating  e  inflation    assets. l se i o an th of These  developments o give  me some pause  and some concern.  So,  yes,   can  wait, ut  I  have  a d I b sense  of  some pressure  o  act n a  relatively  ompt  basis. t o pr

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Mr.  Chairman,  I  support our  recommendation  for o  change  in  the y n federal  unds  rate nd  for n asymmetric  posture. f a a

I  have  some considerable mpathy  with  the otion hat,  ather  han ust  xpanding  the sy n t r t j e policy nnouncement,  we have an immediate  release  f  the  directive at ould indicate-a o th w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. You mean the  whole  directive?

MR.  MEYER. The whole directive.  the  other and,  I  think hat  roposal eserves On h t p d a full iscussion  f he  pros  and  cons  before e move forward.  If  e decide o  go  in  that d o t w w t direction,   might  want  to  do  so  at  a  time  when the irective uld not  create   surprise  hen it we d wo a w is  released.  here  are ome relevant sues.   change  from  symmetry to  asymmetry sends  some T s is A indication   partial ghtening   easing o  the  market, nd our  willingness   move from of ti or t a to symmetry to  asymmetry  may be  affected  y  whether r  not  we are  going  to  announce  that  ove, b o m depending  on what  impact  it s oing  to  have  on the  market.  Another onsideration,  . i g c Mr Chairman,  would  be  that  our  signaling   the arkets n  a  speech  would allow  you  to rovide y to m i p more explanation, d  I  think hat  ould be  desirable   this  oint lso. an t w at p a

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  could  I  comment on whether e should ake such  an w m announcement? In  earlier  scussions,  ave  expressed  ome sympathy  with  what  President di I  h s Parry  was talking  bout egarding  nnouncements  because  I  believe  ore information  s f a r a m i o value.  However,  like  thers,  think  hat f  e release statement  n  this  ccasion,  e will ave o I t i w a o o w h set  precedent  nd  we will  have  to  continue  aking statements  oing  forward.   do  think hat a a m g I t requires  fair  mount of  discussion  f hat  the mpact  will e  and  how  we want  to  manage that. a a o w i b For  that  eason,    would also ncourage  you to repare he arkets n  a  sense hrough  very r I e p t m i t a carefully awn up speech  that  utlines e  issues  hat  e face  and  gives he arket  more dr o th t w t m information  han  would  a short tatement  fter  ach  meeting. t s a e

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oole. P

MR.  POOLE. I  am very  surprised  hat  n ecent  onths  the  markets ave  responded t i r m h so  little   he tronger an  anticipated  onomic  data. he markets ave  absolutely lid tot s th ec T h so expectations at e will ot  move. I  think  t s  very  unfortunate at  hat ituation  ces s  as th w n i i th t s fa u we sit  ere oday.  As an outsider, lso ave  been puzzled bout  the symmetric  directive h t I  a h a a because  it ppears ix eeks or  more after  he  time  it  s  adopted. t ay turn ut  that he a s w t i I m o t message  is ot  what we want  at  the ime  it ctually pears.   think  e know  what  kind  of n t a ap I w message we would like  o  give oday  and would expect rom  the  remarks  that he  Chairman t t f t intends  o  give t  the  appropriate me--namely, at  he  markets eed  to  be prepared or t a ti th t n f a tightening   the  future.  he asymmetric irective,    eleased  uickly, uld  be  a  mechanism for in T d if r q co providing  hat  essage.  I  hope  that  e can  deal  with  this  ssue ery romptly.  I  agree hat e t m w i v p t w need  to  discuss  t, t   hope we can  have  it  n the genda  quite  oon  and  perhaps ake a i bu I o a s m decision  n  this  t he  next  meeting. n  my view,  disclosing  e ymmetry or  asymmetry o a t I th s promptly  might  have  some benefits. t  I  find t uzzling  hat f e adopt  an asymmetric Bu i p t i w directive day,  hich I  am prepared o  support,  t ill ot  be  released  ntil  fter e  next to w t i w n u a th meeting.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  think  e  ought o  put  it n the  agenda  for he ext w t o t n meeting.  That  issue  as  not  come up  in  that orm  until  ery  recently,  d  I  think  t s orthwhile h f v an i i w discussing . it

MR.  POOLE. I, like veryone lse round  the  table,  m well  aware  that he  inflation e e a a t numbers look  very  good.  But  I am concerned hat  e are  at   very  vulnerable age. e  could t w a st W have  some bad  news and once  a  rise  n  inflation  ts oing, articularly ur  policy  as  gotten i ge g p if o h behind,  t  s oing  to  be  very  hard  to atch p. So,  I  think e want  to  move before e see  any i i g c u w w worsening  in  the nflation  mbers.  That  is  what  is  going o  keep  it  ll nder  control. i nu t a u

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  tern. S

MR.  STERN. 1,  oo, upport our  recommendation, r.  Chairman,  and  I  share ill t s y M B Poole's  oncern  about  the iming f  the elease  f  the symmetry. We  now release  t t  a  point c t o r o a i a when it oes  not  do us  any good,  and I hink he  implication   that  s hat  Ed Boehne was d t t of i w talking  bout.  You can  give  a  policy peech  that  laborates   our  current  ttitudes. a s e on a

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  oskow. M

MR.  MOSKOW. Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree  with  your ecommendation.  A  lot as  been r h said lready,  nd  I on't  ant  to epeat  t. n  my  view,  the  one  thing hat ay well  undo this a a d w r i I t m expansion nd all ts  enefits  o  society  s or nflation    start   accelerate d  require  s  to  take a i b t i f i to to an u some very  severe ction.  o,  I  think t  s bsolutely sential at  e look  ahead  and  that ur a S i i a es th w o policy  e  preemptive. he last  hing e want  is  to  be  caught n  a  situation  ere we are ehind b T t w i wh b the  curve.  I  do  think  t s mportant  o  lay he oundation  or   policy ction,  nd I hink  he i i i t t f f a a a t t suggestion  f  a  policy  peech  that ou and  Bill cDonough o s y M made is  an  excellent e. I  also on want  to  associate  yself ith  Ed Boehne's omments about  the ature f  the  speech.  I hought m w c n o t that  e  had some very  good suggestions out  how to  explain ur  objectives   terms  of he h ab o in t broad-based  enefits om sustainable onomic growth  that  e want  to  see  continued  or he b fr ec w f t benefit  f  all egments  of  our  society. o s

I hink e should eview  how we use  asymmetric  or  symmetric  directives. elieve t w r I  b we should  have  a  policy or hat. e  should  use  symmetry  in  a  systematic  ay,  and  I ould f t W w w prepare he  markets or  any  changes  that  e may make in  our  disclosure  hat  spect f ur t f w oft a o o policy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Ferguson.

MR. FERGUSON. Mr. Chairman,  I  agree ith  your  recommendation  of B" w " asymmetric.  I  think t  s mportant  hat e signal  hat  e are  both  vigilant d  want  to  maintain i i i t w t w an the  gains hat lready  ave  been made. t a h

When  we removed the  asymmetry from  the  directive    December,  I  asked  one of he in t other oard  members why we did  not  announce  the  change  then.  I  was told hat  t as because B t i w we would  then  be  announcing wo different  licies   the ame time.  I  wasn't  ure  I  understood t po at s s that xplanation  hen, nd e t a I'm not  sure  I  understand  t ow,  but  I  do think hat-i n t

MS. RIVLIN.  It  sounded  okay!

MR.  FERGUSON. It as one  of any explanations!    believe, wever,  that he w m I ho t issue eserves ore consideration.  ,  I  would not  rush  into nnouncing  now,  but  I  do think e d m So a w should  discuss  he ssue  t  the ext eeting.  I ecognize  hat  e will ave  some explanations t i a n m r t w h to make when we move to  tighten  olicy  ecause, hile  inflation  essures  re  building, ere lso p b w pr a th a are  low  inflation  mbers and low inflation  pectations.   my view,  all f hese onsiderations nu ex In o t c point ore in  the  direction   a  policy peech  as  opposed  to  simply   quick nnouncement after m of s a a the  meeting.  I  would associate  yself ith  what  President  oehne had  to  say  with  respect  o m w B t making sure  that eople ecognize  he  context  n  which our  policy ction s  undertaken nd to p r t i a i a remind  people hat he  economic  benefits  have  achieved  to  date  have  come from low t t we inflation. elieve  t  s mportant  o  keep  those wo  things  n  mind. I  b i i i t t i

I  guess  the nly  other  oncern  I  would  have  relates   our  trying  o hink hrough  our o c to t t t policy trategy  oing  forward.  It ight  be  appropriate   some meeting,  erhaps he  next  if t s g m at p t i looks  as  though  we  are n  a  new policy  rend,  o  be  quite  lear  ith  ourselves  s  to  exactly  hat o t t c w a w our  strategy . his  is hat  I  think  overnor  Gramlich  was referring    earlier. is T w G to

MR.  GUYNN. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I,  oo, upport  our  recommendation  and  I t s y am pleased  with  the  return  o  asymmetry. I ake  heart,  s  I uess veryone lse  oes, rom  our t t a g e e d f resolve  ot  to ait  too  long. n w

Just o  finish  hat  hought,   uess t s  obvious n  what  has  been  said y  Bill  oole, t t t Ig i i i b P Gary Stern,  nd  others  hat  ot  only  do  we not ave  a way to  signal  ur  move to symmetry a t n h o a today,  ut  the  minutes hat ill ome out n  a  couple f  days  will how us  in  a  symmetrical b t w c i o s stance  t  the ebruary eeting.  This  development  seems  to  cry  out  for ome kind  of  mechanism a F m s to  correct  hat  I  think  ill e a isimpression  hat  e would prefer  ot  to  give  in  the ext w w b m t w n n couple f  days. o

SPEAKER(?). That's  ight. r

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Kelley.

MR.  KELLEY. Mr.  Chairman,  I trongly  upport our  recommendation. s s y

Relative  o  the iscussion  bout  a  possible  nnouncement,   would  have  a  very  strong t d a a I preference  or ot  making one  today.  That  preference  ased  on a  longer-term  eason nd an f n isb r a immediate  reason.  The longer-term  eason ould be  the  one  that  as  been  expressed round he r w h a t table,  amely, hat  his  ould  have  a  precedential pact  and  one that  e should onsider n t t w im w c carefully,  t ust  ush  into.    will ay  parenthetically--we    not  going o  debate hat  ssue no j r I s are t t i today--that ave  very  great  eservations  out he  whole  idea. I  h r ab t

More immediately,    believe  hat  f e were  to  make a new type f  announcement I t i w o today  that  he arket  has  not  seen  before nd does  not  expect,  t ould come as  quite    shock t m a i w a and  be  very  confusing.  hy  are hey oing  this? hy  did  they  make this  nnouncement  and W t d W a not  change  policy?   can  see  the otential r  eaction  f  fairly jor  proportions at ould I p fo ar o ma th w not  be  at  all  hat  we are  setting t o  do.  So,  I  would  be  very  hesitant out hat. w ou t ab t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  Mr. Chairman,  I  support our  recommendation, ut  I  think  e should y b w remind  ourselves  hat,  ith  the  exception  f ill oole, e have  all een  here  before. he t w o B P w b T situation s  changed  and  we have  a new view  of  the  outlook. t s ot nconceivable at  e ha I i n i th w will  be  back  in  six eeks when something,  resumably  developments n  Asia,  as  weakened the w p i h expansion  and  we may not  be  quite  s  sure s  we seem to  be  today  that verything  oving in a a e ism the  direction   an  overly trong conomy. But  I  certainly ree hat  hat  s ow it ooks oday. of s e ag t t i h l t

I  also ave  a  lot f  sympathy  with  the uggestion  o  announce  our  asymmetry  decision h o s t immediately.   think e all ish that  e had  already dopted hat olicy  o  that  e could  say I w w w a t p s w something  about  asymmetry in  our  announcement  today.  But  if  e change  our  announcement w policy n  midstream  without ny  prior  iscussion,   robably ould  be  better  o aise  he  fed i a d itp w t r t funds  rate  oday han  to  do  this  eculiar  nd  unexpected hing. t t p a t

I  also ould like  o  stress e  importance ot ust  f  your  making a policy  peech, ut w t th n j o s b that  here e  a series  f  policy  peeches ith  all f  us  weaving  into ur  remarks ore about  how t b o s w o o m we feel.   would suggest  hat  he  emphasis  should e  on  our  worries bout peculation,  ose I t t b a s lo credit, d  other oncerns hat eople an  relate   rather  han  saying hat  e think he conomy an c t p c to t t w t e ought  to e  restrained  cause e are  very  worried bout  tight  abor arkets nd  poor  people b be w a l m a earning ore money. That  sounds  silly  hen you say  it hat  ay,  but  sometimes  we come across m w t w as  though  our  real orries  re  tight  abor  arkets ather  han  the  objective,    Bill  cDonough w a l m r t as M said arlier,    keeping he abor arkets  tight  nd  retaining e enefits  f  full  mployment for e of t l m a th b o e the  future.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Phillips.

MS. PHILLIPS.  Thank you. I  think e can  hold  off or ow. I  do not  see  any w f n immediate  pressure  o  act.  But  unless  he conomy cools ff,   elieve  e will ave  to  tighten. t t e o Ib w h

With respect  o  symmetry or  asymmetry,  I  think  hat f  e were  to  act n  the t t i w i intermeeting riod,  e would have  a  telephone  onference  nyway,  so  I'm  not  sure  that  he ype pe w c a t t of  symmetry we adopt  means too  much.  In  that  ein,    would not ote  against  symmetry.  I v I v a think  policy  peech  probably s  better  or ow,  but  I gree ith President  oehne that e a s i f n a w B w should e  prepared o  act  shortly  fter  hat peech.  I  also gree hat  t  s he  sustainability b t a t s a t i i t of economic growth  that  s  the ssue,  nd  that s hat should e  emphasized  in  our  speeches. i i a i w b I believe  hat t robably ould  be useful o  have  a  discussion  o  consider  he  possible  elease t i p w t t t r of the  directive ter  ach  meeting.  I ave  not  at  this  oint  hought hrough he  pros nd  the  cons, af e h p t t t a but  such  a  discussion  ight  clear  p  the uestion  f hether ymmetry or symmetry means m u q o w s a anything. o,  I  look  forward  to  that  iscussion.

MS. MINEHAN. Mr. Chairman,  I  came to  this eeting  prepared o  vote  for n m t a increase  f 5 basis oints n  the  federal  unds ate,  nd  I  also ame prepared o  dissent  f  e did o 2 p i f r a c t i w not  at  least  ove to  asymmetry. I  am  glad hat our  recommendation  is o  move to  asymmetry. m t y t I  support t, t  I  am concerned hat  e continue  o  face he ifficulty  explaining    tightening i bu t w t t d of a move in  the  context f  declining  rice  rends. f  course,  ur  expectations e  that  hose rice o p t O o ar t p trends ill urn  around  over he  course f  the  period uring hich our  current  onetary  policy w t t o d w m has  an effect.    also m concerned bout  what  you have  so  eloquently  escribed  s  the I a a d a vulnerability  financial rkets  and  what  President  oole as  described  s  the  lack  of in ma P h a

uncertainty    those arkets.   think  e face  a  real isk  f  feeding  he peculative cess hat in m I w r o t s ex t will ltimately me to  haunt  us  if  e do not  move soon.  That  may still  an moving when we u co w me have  broad  price rends  hat o  not  suggest ajor  inflation  ticks.   rankly  elieve, ong  with t t d m up If b al I  think  t  least  ne  other  ember  of he ommittee,  that  oving now might  be  easier  han a o m t C m t moving later, ven  the ransitory  fects  f  Asia.  But,  again,  m willing  o o along ith  your gi t ef o Ia t g w proposal.

I ave felt  or ome time  that n announcement  of  no change  is s  much a  policy ove h f s a a m as  an announcement of  a  change.  So,  when we do  not  change  our  policy,  think t  ould be I i w helpful  o  go  beyond saying t :15: the eeting  ended  at  such  and  such  a time."  If  e can t a 2 " m w figure  ut  a  way to  say  in  one  or  two  sentences  hy  we made a olicy hange, e could  figure o w p c w out  a  way to  say  in  one  or  two  sentences  hy we did  not ake a  policy hange  and  what  our w m c general  olicy ttitude  . p a is

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  could e  part f he  discussion at  e will ave  at b o t th w h the  next  meeting ecause t s art f  the  same issue. b i i p o

MS. MINEHAN. Right, nd  that akes e to  the olicy  peech  proposal.  now we a t m p s Ik have  been  commenting on these ssues  n  policy peeches,  nd  I  agree ith  Alice ivlin,  d i i s a w R E Boehne,  and others ho have  talked  bout  the  context  n  which to  describe  ur  policy ctions. w a i o a But  I m a  lot ore comfortable  ith  policy peeches fter    move than  before    move.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Gramlich.

MR.  GRAMLICH. Mr.  Chairman,  I  will upport   no-move,  asymmetric  directive. s a To see  if    have  mastered edspeak, f  omebody had  proposed hat e raise  he  fed  funds  rate  y I F i s t w t b 25 basis oints,    would have  supported  hat,  oo!  I  am worried,  s  I  said,  hat  e could  get p I t t a t w ourselves  n  a position  f eing  too  rigid  n  the  funds  rate.    do  not  see hat  5 basis  oints  s i o b o I t 2 p i that ig  a deal.  It s ot  going o  have  a  fundamental ffect  n  the oom  or  put  a  lot f orkers b i n t e o b o w out  on the  street. ,  I  think hat   25 basis  oint ncrease  ould  be  justified,    I  will upport So t a p i c but s a no-move,  asymmetric  directive.

I  do  think e ought  to  discuss  eleasing e  directive  he  earliest  portunity. w r th att op I agree  that  f  e were to  change  our rocedures  ow, it ould  cause  a  lot f  uncertainty  d i w p n w o an turbulence, d  there  s  no  reason o  do that. ut  we ought  to  discuss  hat  ssue  s  soon  as an i t B t i a possible.  e  would be in  a little  tter  hape, s  Governor  Rivlin uggested,  f e had  a W be s a s i w precedent or nnouncing  an asymmetric  directive day.  So,  I  think e should repare or he f a to w p f t future.

Let  me say  one other  hing bout  this  ssue.   believe, .  Chairman,  that hen  you t a i I Mr w give  policy  peeches--and    read  a  lot f hose efore    became a  member of  the  Board--there s I o t b I is some feeling,    least    had  it,  hat ou are  speaking or ourself.  aybe  that  as naive n my at I t y f y M w o part. ut  I  think ne  advantage f  getting  he  word out  sooner s  in  a  way to  take he eat ff B o o t i t h o you by  indicating at  ll  of  us  stand ehind he olicy r  at  least  hat  he OMC th a b t p o t t F stands ehind b the  policy.  n  my view,  that  ould  be  an advantage f  getting  he ord out  sooner. o,  I  would I w o t w S like o  discuss  hat  roposal  t  an early  ate.   wish  we could  do  it  oday.  I  accept hat  e t t p a d I t t w cannot,  ut  I  would like  o ee  that hange. b t s c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay. I  think e have  a  broad  consensus round  "B" w a asymmetric, o  would you  read  the irective. s d

MR. KOHN. Excuse  me, Norm.  On that  irst ntence f  the  directive,  . f se o Mr Chairman,  one  possibility  uld be  to  keep  essentially   words  that  ere used  in  the  last wo the w directive.   ould  say, fter  hanging  a  few words  in  that  entence:  The  information  eviewed Itw a c s " r at  this  eeting  suggests hat  conomic  activity  ntinued o row rapidly  uring he  early m t e co t g d t months of 1998."

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. That  would  be accurate.
