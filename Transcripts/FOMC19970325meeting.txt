MR.  PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  [Statement--see  pendix.] Ap CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions or ike? f M

MR. PARRY. Mike,  I  was a  little ertain   to  the ealth ffects  n  consumer unc as w e o spending n  the  Greenbook  forecast.  had  the mpression  hat  here  ertainly s  an  impact i I i t t c wa from  higher  quity  rices  n articular,   in he onday  staff iefing  he oard, ou e p i p but t M br tot B y seemed  to  be  saying hat  here  as not uch of n  effect.  ould you go  into  hat    little, t t w m a W t a please?

MR. PRELL.  On our  interpretation,  re  robably as  been  some positive fect the p h f on consumption  over he  past ear r  so  from  the  increase  n  financial  alth. etting  side t y o i we S a measurement  problems,  hat  ffect  ikely s  in eality en  offset  t east  o ome degree y t e l ha r be a l t s b an  increased  ropensity   save ased  on  concerns bout etirement come  and  for ther p to b a r in o precautionary asons. oing  forward,  e would  interpret  r  forecast   continuing  o re G w ou as t incorporate me positive alth  effect, t  again ith  these  ther  actors  ending  o alance so we bu w o f t t b that.  ecause  we have  assumed  that  he tock arket  tops ut  as  we move into  he atter rt B t s m o t l pa of  this  ear nd  then eclines  oticeably   1998,  the ealth-to-income tio  alls ck  a y a d n in w ra f ba considerable  istance  oward  where  it  as several  ears go.  That  tends o iminish  he d t w y a t d t wealth  effect  s  we move out n  1998. Another  factor   keep  in ind  is hat  e have  had  a a i to m t w surge  in  income  growth  over he ast ear r  so. It ould  be  natural, ven  a  permanent t p y o w gi income  view,  for pending o ag  a  bit  nd  for he aving ate, l ther  hings  qual,  o  edge s t l a t s r al o t e t

up a  bit.  s income  decelerates er he  next ear r  so, e might  still    getting  ome A ov t y o w be s adjustment  n  consumption  that  ould  then end o esult   the aving ate dging  lower.  So, i w t t r in s r e we see  a  number of ounteracting  rces  hat  e have  tried,   east  udgmentally,   alance c fo t w atl j tob in  a  sensible y in  the orecast. wa f

MR. PARRY. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. I  noticed  hat  ou  built  nto  our orecast r 998 an  increase  f t y i y f fo 1 o 75 to  100  basis  oints  n he ederal  unds ate. p i t f f r

MR. PRELL.  75  basis  oints. p

MS. MINEHAN. I  gather  rom  the ording  of he reenbook and  your  briefing f w t G that  hat  as  basically   keep  real  nterest  tes  table.  ut  I  wondered  why you  were  doing t w to i ra s B that.  t  least   my memory, it as a  change  from  earlier eenbook  practices,  d  I  would A in w Gr an find t  elpful  o  have  your omments on  this.  f  course,  e can  see  in our  alternative i h t c O w y projections  at  the ffects e  if  ou do  not hange  the ederal  unds ate ssumption. wh e ar y c f f r a

MR. PRELL.  We  felt  uite  neasy  about  what  kind  of essage  the orecast uld q u m f wo convey  had  we retained e  assumption f   flat  ominal  funds  rate.  e  perceived  hat he th o a n W t t underlying  trength  f emand has  been  greater  han e expected. xtrapolating  at  o s o d t w E th t some degree,  t  xacerbates  hat  we already  aw as  a  fundamental nstability. ink  his i e w s i I  th t was highlighted   some of he onger-run  imulations  he  last  luebook, here  we in t l s int B w stretched e  projections  t  a  bit. erhaps t ecame clearer  o  you  there  hat  hat  we th ou P i b t t w foresaw  with  unchanged  nominal  interest  tes  as  in  essence   path here  resource ra w a w utilization   going  to  continue  o e  well  above  sustainable vels.  ollowing p  on  that was t b le F u analysis,  thought hat  he ssumed  uptilt    the unds  rate ould  be  a  natural  ay to we t t a in f w w

indicate  hat  t ome point ominal  interest  tes  robably ould  have  to ise  o  avoid t a s n ra p w r t excessive  timulus.  e built  n  something hat  s n  a  par ith hat  is appening o he ore s W i t i o w w h t t c CPI  and  to ome of he roader DP-related rice easures. s t b G p m

MS. MINEHAN. I  certainly    not bject  o hat  pproach s  a  forecast.  learly do o t t a a Itc is n  line  ith   lot f ajor  forecasts. t  I  thought he hole point f oing  the i w a o m Bu t w o d Greenbook,  at east  he ay we have  been  doing  it, s to ave  something hat  hows  what l t w wa h t s happens  if  e do  not  change  anything. w

MR. PRELL.  For  all  ractical rposes he  assumed  rise  n he unds  rate  s p pu t i t f i tantamount n  terms  of he  economic  outcome  to  your ot oing  anything  ver  the eriod i t n d o p 1997 and 1998.

MS. MINEHAN. True.

MR.  PRELL.  But  I  thought t  ight  be  a  useful  ignal  ere  f hat  we now i m s h o w perceive  o e  the onger-term  nsustainability  he  scenario  hat  e have  been  drawing  in t b l u of t t w prior  reenbooks. G

MS. MINEHAN. Thank you.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  arry. P

MR. PARRY. I  think  t  as useful  o et hose lternatives,   hich  of he i w t g t a butw t alternatives  you  think  ould  be  most  closely  ligned  ith  an  opportunistic  proach? do w a w ap

MR. PRELL.  I  guess  it  s   matter f nterpretation o hat  the pportunistic i a o i as  t w o approach  entails.   t  ntails king  sure hat  he nflation  te  oes  not ove above  the Ifi e ma t t i ra d m recent  ange,  hen  our orecast plies  hat    policy  ove is ecessary  t ome point. r t f im t a m n a s Whether  that  eans a  relatively  gressive  pproach r  something hat  nvolves    continued m ag a o t i a "wait nd  see"  stance  nd  moving later, on't  hink  e can  readily scern.  ut  the act  s a a I  d t w di B f i

that  ur orecast es  imply  that,   an  underlying  ense,  onsumer  price  nflation   oving o f do in s c i ism above  the  percent  ark  in  1998. If  ou  view  that  s  a  ceiling   the ange f cceptable 3 m y a in r o a outcomes  and  the oint here  you  want  to  apply he rakes,  hen   suppose ou  could  argue p w t b t I y that    more aggressive  pproach han  that  ssociated th  our  baseline recast  he ne  that a a t a wi fo ist o is onsistent  th  opportunism. ut  that  s n  the ye  of he eholder.   do  not hink  e can c wi B i i e t b I t w define ts  pplication  at  recisely. i a th p

MR. MOSKOW. Mike,  if  ou  look ack  at our  forecasts  ast  ummer,  you y b y ofl s were  projecting ch lower  growth  than ccurred  t he nd  of  1996  and  that  ou  now mu o a t e y anticipate  rough 997. When  you  made your  comments this  orning,   think  ou used  the th 1 m I y phrase entering    boom at his  oint."  as  just  ondering  if  ou could tep ack  and " a t p Iw w y s b explain  hat  has  happened  here. hy  are  you  now expecting    boom or  "maybe" a  boom? w W a What has  changed  in  this  eriod? p

MR. PRELL.  The "maybe" is  an  important  ualifier. at  is ot  our aseline q Th n b forecast,  t  again hese re  matters  f efinition.   do  have  a  forecast at, ven urrent bu t a o d We h gi c money market  conditions, w sees he  most  likely  utcome  as  above-trend  rowth  for  n no t o g a extended eriod nd  an  unemployment rate  hat  alls   5 percent  r  less.  n  some sense,  ou p a t f to o I y could  regard  hat  s  boom conditions en  without oing o  the ore dramatic,  tronger t a ev g t m s growth  scenario  hat    suggested  as a  risk.  hy  has  this  ccurred?  I  think  e consistently t I w W o w said hat  e did  not ee  the timulus  hat  ould  maintain bove-trend  rowth,  o  we kept t w s s t w a g s forecasting  at  rowth  was going o  fall  ack  to  something ike  rend or ack f th g t b l t f l o a compelling eason hat  t hould ot. r t i s n

What has  happened? That  is ery ard  to ort  ut.  If  e look t onsumer v h s o w a c behavior,  or xample,  we have  not ad  a  drop  in he aving ate. t s rue hat  he tock f e h t s r I i t t t s

market  has  been  much stronger an e anticipated.    have  had  a  tremendous ncrease  n th w We i i financial alth hat  ither  as  reflected    supported    tremendous urge n  consumer we t e h or a s i sentiment.  e  are t  very  high evels  f onsumer  confidence  ccording  o  the ichigan  or W a l o c a t M the onference  Board  surveys. he  current  ichigan  index  is he  highest  ince 965,  and  in C T M t s 1 only  a  few months  in he istory  f hat  ndex ave  there  een  numbers  this  igh.  I hink t h o t i h b h t there  s t his  oint ome buoyancy  in  consumer  demand beyond what  we would  have i a t p s anticipated.    see  very  lean nventories.    continue  o e  surprised   the pside y  the We i We t b on u b strength   computer nvestment;  e have  had  some very  strong  umbers. We  seem  to  be in i w n getting    more solid  erformance n  nonresidential struction  an  we anticipated.  u a p i con th Yo will ecall  hat  e were  somewhat puzzled y  weak contracts ta hrough uch of ast  ear, r t w b da t m l y but  they ended o  catch p  with  an  enormous  burst  n he ourth  uarter.  ll  the necdotal t t u i t f q A a evidence uggests  here s ore momentum  in  that  ector  han as apparent  ix onths ago, s t i m s t w s m and  that  as  multiplier  fects. e upside urprise ems  to e  a  collection   hings  hat h ef Th s se b oft t have  supplied    considerable ft  conomic activity.    this  oint,  hile e are till a li toe At p w w s somewhat in  the  spirit   aying hat  conomic  growth  probably ill ove back  toward ofs t e w m trend,  e see n  economy that  eems  to ave  considerable mentum,  and  we are ot w a s h mo n optimistic  at  he oderation n rowth  is oing  to ccur vernight.  asically,  e  of he th t m i g g o o B on t things  e learned  as that  inancial  nditions  ere  not mposing s  much restraint    the w w f co w i a on economy as  we thought hey  would. t

MR. BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  the ifth  istrict  onomy continues    healthy F D ec a advance.  Labor  markets emain  exceedingly  ight  hroughout  ost  of he istrict, ecially r t t m t D esp

in  some of he ooming areas f he  southern  art f he istrict    the  Carolinas  long t b o t p o t D in a Interstate  . Wages  for killed bor  n  that  art f ur  District  ve  been  moving up 85 s la i p o o ha gradually  or ome time.  We  now hear ore  reports  f ay  increases r nskilled rkers. f s m o p fo u wo In  Charlotte,  r xample,  hourly ay  for ntry-level  skilled rkers  has  risen  bout fo e p e un wo a a dollar  ver he ast  ear o  a  range f   to  8 dollars  n  average urrently.  lsewhere, oth o t l y t o 7 o c E b residential   commercial  real  state  nd  construction  tivity  e  rising  harply.  n the nd e a ac ar s O commercial  side n  particular, see  very  low  vacancy  rates  nd  rising nts  n  some areas. i we a re i That  is specially  e ase n  suburban reas,  ut o  some extent  e see  it  n  central ty  reas e th c i a b t w i ci a as  well. ost  of he ther  necdotal  nformation  e have  received  ecently  s onsistent th M t o a i w r i c wi what  appears o e  happening n  other  arts f he ountry. onsumer spending learly t b i p o t c C c seems to ave  accelerated   recent  eeks. With  respect   prices, though  abor nd  other h in w to al l a costs re ising,  ere  s elatively  ttle  lk  f mminent  price  ncreases   most  of he a r th i r li ta o i i in t comments that  e hear.  Indeed, t heir  ast  eeting,  everal  f ur  directors  nt  out  of w a t l m s o o we their  ay to  say  that  here  as a  general  bsence f ricing  ower in ost  markets  with w t w a o p p m which they ere familiar. w

There  are onetheless    few  straws n he ind.  One director ntioned  that n a i t w me recent  ncreases   trucking  ees ere  beginning  o  stick  or he irst me n  a  while. i in f w t f t f ti i who runs  a  large  arm  equipment ealership ld e f d to m that is ajor  supplier,  hn  Deere, s o  longer uaranteeing ices  or tems hat  ill e h m Jo i n g pr f i t w b delivered  ater   the ear. ut  those ypes f omments are  still  e  exception  ather  han  the l in y B t o c th r t rule.

Turning  to he ational  icture,   s ard,  or e at  least, t  to e  impressed y t n p it i h f m no b b the  current  cross-the-board entum a mom in he  economy. As you  already entioned  this t m

morning, ike,  and  as  the reenbook  points  ut,  he ichigan  Consumer Confidence ndex M G o t M I is ow at  its  ighest  evel  ince 965. That  started  thinking  little  out  1965;  it  as a n h l s 1 me a ab w good  year or he  economy. At  the  time,  rthur kun described  he  situation    "the f t A O t as promised  land f   percent  nemployment  with  no  compelling  vidence f ccelerating o 4 u e o a wages  and  prices  r  stress   financial  rkets." n  hindsight,   ourse,  e know  that  965 o in ma I ofc w 1 was  the  year n hich  inflation  ally  egan  to  take ff.  he  inflation  te  as  below  2 i w re b o T ra w percent  n  1965;  it  ose o ver  percent  n  1966  and  subsequently   over  percent  y  the i r t o 3 i to 6 b end  of he  decade. t

Obviously,  here  re  significant  fferences  tween  1965 and 1997,  not  the east t a di be l of  which  is ur  greater  ommitment,  I elieve,  o ontain nflation  d  resist flationary o c b t c i an in pressures  nd  the reater  redibility t  oes  along ith  it. ut  I  think  here lso re  some a g c tha g w B t a a striking rallels  tween  the  situation    1965,  at east  arly  n  that  ear,  nd  what  we are pa be in l e i y a facing  ow. As in  1965,  the conomy is ow operating  t  a  very igh  level  nd  it trikes n e n a h a s me as  being uite  ulnerable  o pside hocks.  In  the  1960s, f ourse,  he hock  ultimately ok q v t u s o c t s to the  form  of he ietnam military ildup. he  most  likely ock, f  hat  s he  right  ord,  in t V bu T sh i t i t w 1997 would  be  a  more subtle  rocess. t ould  involve    kind f ircular  ocess here p I w a o c pr w increased  pending enerates  ncreases  obs,  hich  generate  ncreases  ncome,  which s g i inj w i ini encourage urther  pending,  nd  so  forth.   think   key  feature  f olicy  n  1965 was that  he f s a I a o p i t magnitude  of he pside isk  as not  appreciated   the olicymaking stablishment    a t u r w by p e as whole  as  we went  into hat  ear.  In  the urrent  ituation,  orry  that  he ublic, t y c s I  w t p as represented   the ndustrialist sat ext o  Mike Prell, es  not  adequately  ppreciate e by i who n t do a th extent f he  current  pside isk,  ainly ecause  of he  damping effect  f hree  emporary o t u r m b t o t t factors  n  wage and  price  ehavior.  hese  are: he ob nsecurity  at  he hairman  has o b T t j i th t C

emphasized  in is ecent  ublic omments,  increased  abor orce articipation,  ch  always h r p c l f p whi occurs t his  oint f he  cyclical pansion ut  which  I  think  s reater  ow than s a t p o t ex b i g n i normally he  case,  nd  the trong  ollar. t a s d

Let  me make just    quick omment on  each  of hose. s you said,  r.  Chairman, a c t A M once  the ownward adjustment  f eal ages  to  the  increase  n ob  insecurity   omplete,  e d o r w i j isc w would  expect he  usual mpact f ight  abor  arkets n  wages to eassert self. t i o t l m o r it

Furthermore,  f  abor  arkets emain  as  tight  s  they  are ow for ny  extended eriod n he i l m r a n a p i t future,   some point orkers re  not  going  to  feel  nsecure  ny  longer.  hen  that  appens, at w a i a W h we could  see  the sual hort-run illips-curve ect  eassert self  st  s  the  restraining u s Ph eff r it ju a impact  of ob nsecurity  gins o  unwind.  We  will hen ave  two  forces orking  on the ost j i be t t h w c side nd  a  considerable side isk  rom  that  irection. milarly, ght  abor  arkets a up r f d Si ti l m encourage reater  abor orce articipation ause ob  search  osts re  lower  and  wages are g l f p bec j c a higher. ooner  or  later, at  ffect ll  issipate en  if  emand remains  strong.  ere  again, S th e wi d ev d H greater  abor  orce  articipation   only elay he  emergence  of  inflationary ssures,  t l f p can d t pre no prevent  hem. Finally, e  restraint  om  foreign  ompetition  n  U.S.  inflation  n  work t th fr c o ca only  so  long  as  the ollar mains trong nd  does  not  depreciate gnificantly. s,  f d re s a si Thi o course,  urns  n  the bility  he nited  States  o  continue  o  attract pital flows.   think t o a oft U t t ca in I we have  been  lucky n  this  ront  ver he ourse f he ast  everal  uarters   that  ur o f o t c o t l s q in o economy has  been  quite trong  ompared  to he  economies  of ther ajor  industrial  tions. s c t o m na Obviously,  hat  ituation  uld  change.  If  rowth  in apan  and  Europe  were  to egin  to t s co g J b accelerate, could  have  some weakening  of he  dollar. we t

The bottom  line  s  I  see t, .  Chairman, s hat    do  not hink he oundation  or a i Mr i t I t t f f our  favorable  acroeconomic  performance  is ery  solid  r  secure t  this  tage. e  need  to m v o a s W

do  all  e can  with  monetary  policy  o einforce at  erformance.   think e have  been w t r th p I w pushing ur  luck ith  monetary  policy  n  recent  onths.  We  could o  this  ecause  we had o w i m d b built    lot  f redibility  1994,  but  I ould  not ant  to ee s  push  our uck uch further. a o c in w w s u l m

Let  me turn o  the ational onomy.

We  would  expect   favorable  roductivity  rprise,  her  hings  he ame,  to a p su ot t t s translate  to igher  eal  nterest  tes.  n  a  stable  rice  nvironment here there  s o in h r i ra I p e w i n discrepancy  etween  nominal  interest  tes  nd  real  nterest  tes, e evel  f nterest  tes b ra a i ra th l o i ra would  shift . In  a  fiat  oney world, f  onetary  policy  ailed  o ecognize  he hanges n up m i m f t r t c i the quilibrium  ituation  d  did  not djust  ominal  interest  tes  igher,  hen ffectively, e s an a n ra h t e to use  the anguage e normally mploy,  we would  have  eased  monetary  policy  ven  if  e l w e e w maintained  he  same level  f ominal  interest  tes.  n  my framework, e would  see  an t o n ra I w acceleration    money growth, nd  that  ould  accommodate,  as  in he reenbook in a w t G presentation,  acceleration   ominal  spending rowth.

Finally  t he  regional  evel,  have  two  new directors is  ear rom  the etail a t l we th y f r automobile  ndustry--one  sociated th  a  group  of oderate-size alerships d  another i as wi m de an who ran  the lamo car ental  ompany until  t  as recently quired  y  one  of he ew A r c i w ac b t n conglomerates.  hose  directors ggested  t  our  last  eeting hat  e are  seeing  hat  they T su a m t w w call    "seismic"  hift   the etail to usiness  s  the onsolidations  at  re nder  way a s in r au b a c th a u continue.  hey think  he  consolidations  ll  ring ignificant  ficiencies perations  nd T t wi b s ef in  o a an  important  hange  in  the argaining  ower  that  ealers  ave  with anufacturers,  l f c b p d h m al o which  they hink  hould ode  well or he  prices  hat  onsumers  will  ay  for  utos own the t s b f t t c p a d road.

At  the ational  evel,  e like  lmost veryone lse ave  been  surprised   the n l w a e e h by persisting  rength  n  the conomy early  his  ear.  We  continue  o xpect   slowdown in he st i e t y t e a t expansion ater  his  ear nd  we hope  we will ot  be  disappointed.   have  not  raised  ur l t y a n We o fourth-quarter r  fourth-quarter wth  forecast  ppreciably.  e  expect rowth  in ove gro a W g expenditures   housing  and  consumer  durables  o e  measurably lower s  we move into he on t b s a t rest  f he  year. e  do  not xpect nemployment to  drop  quite  s  low as  is ndicated  he o t W e u a i int Greenbook. On the  other and,  and  probably s  a  consequence,  e also re ot  quite  s h a w a n a pessimistic  th  respect  o  inflation, ther easured  by  the PI  or he eflator.   still wi t whe m C t d We see  few  signs f tress,  cesses,  r  imbalances  xcept or ersistent  ghtness  abor o s ex o e f p ti inl markets. aving  said hat,  t  s y judgment  that  he isks  re  now somewhat greater  n  the H t i i m t r a o upside. y  view  stems  mostly rom  the  greater-than-expected  sumer  spending hat  e M f con t w can  readily e,  ueled  y  either re  borrowing,  ower  saving ates,   as  Mike Prell se f b mo l r or reminded  us  again his  orning, he  possibility t  e will ee  some additional ck o t m t tha w s ki t consumer  spending rom  the  stock arket  wealth ffect. f m e

One offsetting  sk  n  the ownside, s  Cathy  Minehan also entioned, s ur ri o d a m i o view  that  he utlook or xports  ould  change. Should  the ollar  ot all  ack  or  even  rise t o f e c d n f b further,  d  we think  hat  s ertainly ssible, owth  in  exports  ould  be  less  han  is an t i c po gr c t currently ilt  nto he  forecast. ere  also emains he  strong  nd  growing  probability bu i t Th r t a of increased  age pressures, though  e are  less ure han  some that  hose ill  e  fully  ed w al w s t t w b f through o  price  nflation.  t  again,  n  balance,    think  he isks  re onsiderably eater t i Bu o I t r a c gr on the  upside. hank you,  Mr.  Chairman.

Now, s bu t a k p l t w that  iew  contrasts th  the acro framework  that  hink ays ut  the rospects  or roblems v wi m It l o p f p down the oad.  It trikes  that  here  s   greater  ivergence  etween  the erson-in-ther s me t i a d b p street ew  and  this  acro  framework  than  I  have  seen  in   long ime.  There  is ot uch vi m a t n m appreciation,  hink,  or hat  acro framework  view.  We  have  to  weigh  the isks, d  my I  t f t m r an sense  is hat  he ational onomy has  considerable lf-feeding  mentum. t t n ec se mo Although inflation   emarkably uiescent  or ow,  I  think  he isks  ave  shifted irly bstantially isr q f n t r h fa su toward  the pside f oo uch demand pressing  gainst  upply own the  road.  With  the u o t m a s d strong emand,  I  think  he urrent  ederal  unds ate lmost urely  eans that  e are d t c f f r a s m w pumping too  much liquidity  to  he  economy.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR.  MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I ant  to  focus n  two  key  questions w o about he  outlook hat   elieve  hould hape  our  decision  bout  monetary olicy  oday. t t Ib s s a p t First,  w does  the  economic  environment,  eaning  both he ecent  ata nd  the urrent ho m t r d a c forecast,  ffer day  from  that  revailing  he  July nd  September  FOMC di to p att a meetings--which in  my judgment  were  the losest lls  or   tightening  olicy--and re  generally om c ca f a ofp mo fr that  revailing r he  entire  ecent  eriod f he symmetric  policy  irective? cond, ow p fo t r p o t a d Se h do  today's recasts r  1997  by  members of he OMC fo fo t F compare  to  the entral ndencies  f c te o the orecasts r he ear  that  he embers submitted  t  the ebruary eeting nd  that  ere f fo t y t m a F m a w incorporated   the  Humphrey-Hawkins report? in

This  focus resumes  that  ny  change  in  policy  e contemplate  oday ould reflect p a w t w a  change  in he OMC t F members' readings  f he  fundamentals  nd  risks  n he  economic o t a i t outlook. hat  would  be  the atural  ssumption. owever,  the omments of t east  ome T n a H c a l s members at  the ast  eeting ould  be  interpreted    indicating  at  hey lready  ad  changed l m c as th t a h their  iew  about onetary  policy  ut hought  hat    tightening ould e  postponed ntil  his v m b t t a sh b u t meeting  to  allow n  opportunity  repare he arket.  And the arket  certainly  s  been a top t m m ha prepared!  [Laughter] or  myself,  owever,  some trigger,  me change  in  the undamentals, F h so f is  necessary  o ush  me to ccept   change  in olicy.  ill ocus ere n  whether r  not t p a a p Iw f h o o there  as een  such  a  change  in  fundamentals. h b

Let  me remind  you  of he asic  ramework  that  as  underpinned y judgment t b f h m about  monetary  policy  uring his  eriod.   worry  about  two  risks  o he nflation  tlook: d t p I t t i ou the tilization   the  growth  risks.  he utilization  k  efers  o  the ossibility t  he u and T ris r t p ha t prevailing ilization es  ay already  e  so  high  that  nflation  ll ise  ver ime. he ut rat m b i wi r o t T growth  risk  elates   the ossibility t  uture  bove-trend  rowth  will  aise  tilization es r to p tha f a g r u rat still  rther,  ereby ggravating  he isk  f igher  nflation.  ven  the ncertainty  out fu th a t r o h i Gi u ab how to udge  utilization  es,  have  tempered  our nclination  be  forward-looking  ur j rat we i to ino policy  ctions  nd  have  given dded  weight o ecent  ata n  inflation  d  labor osts.  here a a a t r d o an c T is,  evertheless,  ausal hain hat    believe  e have  been  relying  n--from rowth  relative n a  c c t I w o g to  trend,   utilization es,  age changes,  nd  finally   inflation.  ere  are,  o e  sure, to rat tow a to Th t b complications  ssociated th  changing  profit rgins,  ossible  hange  in he roductivity a wi ma p c t p trend,  avorable  r  unfavorable  upply hocks, nd  change  in  threshold vels  f tilization f o s s a le o u rates.  ut  this  ausal hain s nd  must  be  at he eart f reemptive  olicy. B c c i a t h o p p

Policy ould  be  said o  be  more forward-looking   preemptive  he ore willing c t or t m we are  to ct arlier   his  ausal  hain. he importance    attach  o his  ausal  hain a e int c c T I t t c c necessitates  esponse  o  the lurry  f isclaimers ound  this  able  t he ast  eeting bout a  r t f o d ar t a t l m a the  usefulness  f AIRU. o N I  intended  o  respond hen ut,  rankly, omehow  got  distracted. t t b f Is [Laughter] s the ost  enthusiastic  ampion of he  NAIRU A m ch t concept round  this  able, t a t le me briefly spond ow because  I  think  hat  oncept s elevant   our ecision  oday. re n t c i r o d t

The concept undamentally  nvolves  hree rinciples.  rst,  major  proximate f i t p Fi a source f  higher nflation   xcess emand in  the abor nd/or roduct  arkets. econd,  the o i ise d l a p m S causal hain  is ost  likely  roceed rom  excess emand in  the  labor  arket, o age c m top f d m t w changes  and  hence  labor  osts,  nd  finally    price  nflation.  ird,  s  long  as  the xcess c a to i Th a e demand prevails,  flation  ntinues  o ise  rogressively  d  indefinitely r  time.  I in co t r p an ove frankly  ould  be  shocked  if  ost  of s  around  this  able  id  not elieve  n hese  rinciples. w m u t d b i t p To be  sure,  pplying  hem  has  become more difficult   ate  ecause he mplied a t ofl b t i relationships e  not een  nearly s  tight  s  had  been  the ase  earlier.  ere  are ata hat hav b a a c Th d t suggest  ome decline  n he AIRU. s i t N Nevertheless, ese rinciples  st  in  my view  be  the th p mu framework  for onducting    disciplined  netary  policy,  nd  I  believe  hat  s entral   any c a mo a t i c to decision  o  tighten  oday. t t

Now  back  to he utlook: hat is ifferent  day  in he ata nd/or  he  forecast t o W d to t d a t compared to  what  we had  at OMC F meetings uring he  period f symmetric  directives? d t o a To set  p  my  later scussion  f y position  n  monetary  policy,  will rganize  he u di o m o I o t discussion  rom  the erspective  he aylor ule.  A rough  summary is hat  urrent f p oft T R t c utilization  es  re  about he ame and  core  inflation   ower. Unlike t arlier etings, rat a t s isl a e me the  forecast w shows continued  bove-trend  rowth  immediately head  and, s  a  result, no a g a a

higher  tilization  es  ver he ext  year r  two. The  current  reenbook  projection u rat o t n o G ofa decline  n  the nemployment rate  s ot uch different  om  what  was projected   the ast i u i n m fr at l meeting,  hough  I  would argue hat  his  orecast  ore believable w for any of s.  At t t t f ism no m u the  February eeting,  oth he  Greenbook  and  FOMC m b t members were  projecting ar-trend ne growth  over  1997, ut  the OMC b F members were forecasting able  nemployment rates  n st u i contrast   the ecline  rojected  n  the reenbook. The  current  ata n  utilization es  nd o d p i G d o rat a core  inflation  e  no  more alarming  ow than arlier,  d  perhaps ess  o.  So,  if  e want  to ar n e an l s w justify  tion  oday,  e have  to ook  at n  earlier  age f he ausal  hain. ac t w l a st o t c c

In  his ecent  estimony, e  Chairman  has  focused n  labor  arket  indicators r t th o m as being  of pecial  mportance n  reaching    decision  or   preemptive  ove,  and  I  agree. et s i i a f a m L us  take tock ere.  The data n  compensation  re  somewhat mixed, ut  they  suggest  ome s h o a b s acceleration    balance. he latest  2-month  increase  n  average ourly arnings  s /4  to on T 1 i h e i 1 1/2  percentage  oint igher  han  had  prevailed  he ime  of he uly nd  September p h t att t t J a meetings. n the  other  and, he ncreases  n  average ourly arnings  ere  rather  ame  in O h t i i h e w t the  last  ouple f onths.  There  is ertainly int  ere ut  hardly   smoking  gun.  On the c o m c a  h h b a other and, irtually  l ther  ndicators  abor  arket  tightness e  at  more elevated  evels h v al o i ofl m ar l today:  elp anted  ads  are p,  initial  aims or nemployment insurance  re own,  the ndex h w u cl f u a d i of  hard-to-get  bs s own, and  consumer  sentiment  bout obs eing  plentiful   p.  But  the jo i d a j b isu key  to ur  decision  oday  is he hange  in he orecast. o t t c t f

Ill  ocus ow on  the  Greenbook  forecast,  ich  may be  more aggressive  n ertain f n wh i c respects  han ome of ur  own forecasts. is  will ffectively  rve o  make more dramatic t s o Th e se t the  point    want  to ake.  There  is   significant nge  in  the urrent  reenbook  forecast r I m a cha c G fo 1997  from  the orecasts epared or he uly nd  September  meetings nd  even  that  or  he f pr f t J a a f t

February eeting.  Compared to  the arlier etings,  he  Greenbook  now projects  2-3/4 m e me t a percent  ate f rowth  over  1997 in ontrast  ust  bove  2  percent  t he  July nd  September r o g c oj a a t a meetings  and  2-1/4 ercent  t he ebruary eeting.  This  follows n  unexpectedly  trong p a t F m a s second  half  f 996. To be  sure,  s  is lmost lways  the ase  in  such  projections, wth o 1 a a a c gro slows  to  trend  ver he orecast riod. ut  the  combination f   stronger  econd  half  f o t f pe B o a s o 1996  and  an  upward  revised  orecast r 997  translates  to  n  increase  n  the evel f utput f fo 1 in a i l o o and  hence  utilization  es  n  1997 and 1998. At  the uly nd  September  meetings,  he rat i J a t unemployment rate  as expected o  stabilize  ar -1/2 ercent or  1997. Now  it  s xpected w t ne 5 p f i e to  decline  o  percent  his  ear nd  below  5 percent  n  1998. Just  o nderline  he ifficulty t 5 t y a i t u t d in  making  and  selling y  policy  hange, he ther  mportant  ifference   the reenbook an c t o i d in G forecast   that  nflation  r 997  has  been  revised  ownward relative   he uly nd is i fo 1 d tot J a September  meetings.

To repeat  he  second  question, w did e FOMC t ho w members change  our  forecasts for rowth  over  1997  and  the nemployment  rate t he  end  of his  ear ompared  to he g u a t t y c t central  endencies  f he orecasts at  e submitted  or ncorporation   he t o t f th w f i int Humphrey-Hawkins report?  For  my part,    see  the conomy as  having ore near-term I e m momentum  than  I  did t he ast  eeting,  nd  therefore  now expect he nemployment rate a t l m a I t u to  be  lower n  the econd alf  f he ear nd  into 998. As a  result,  ave  revised  pward i s h o t y a 1 I  h u my expectations r nflation  er  1998. fo i ov

At  this  tage, e  market s xpecting  5  basis  oints.  t as  discounted  uch  a s th i e 2 p I h s move,  frankly, t t as  done  so  in   positive  ay,  not   negative  ay.

MR.  MEYER. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  strongly  upport  our s y recommendation  for   25  basis  oint ncrease  n he unds ate,  nd  I  can  accept our a p i i t f r a y recommendation  for   symmetric irective ough  I  could ave  been  persuaded o  go  for n a d th h t a asymmetric  one.  I ill ome back  to  that  ater.  want  to  focus y remarks,  hough,  n  an w c l I m t o analytical  amework  for upporting  his  ind f   move. First, ant  to onsider  he fr s t k o a I  w c t implications   the aylor ule  and  talk  bout he mportance f  a  flexible proach o of T R a t i o ap t interest  tes  n esponse o conomic  developments.   also ant  to xplain  hy we should ra i r t e I w e w not  leave he ask f ountercyclical icy o  the ond  market  and  present  n  interpretation t t o c pol t b a of tightening   terms  of hat  I  will all  he axi/min  solution. in w c t m

The Taylor ule,  as  Don Kohn noted n  his resentation, ld  suggest  o  move R i p wou n at  this  eeting ecause tilization  es  re  about he ame  as  they ave  been  and  core m b u rat a t s h inflation   ctually wer.  While  the aylor ule  does  not rovide upport  or n  action isa lo T R p s f a today,  t  ould  suggest  hat,    he reenbook  forecast oves o e  correct,   will ant  to i w t if t G pr t b we w tighten  ater. ere  is,  owever,  an  alternative  ecification   he aylor ule  that  ould, n l Th h sp oft T R w i my view,  support    tightening  olicy  oday.  I  will  all  t  he  forward-looking ylor ule. a ofp t c i t Ta R To be  sure,  he tandard  ule s orward-looking   a  degree n  relation  nflation  cause t t s r i f to i toi be i includes  urrent  tilization  es.  ut  in  the orward-looking ylor ule, ctual  alues  f c u rat B f Ta R a v o inflation  d  utilization es  re  replaced  y  forecasts. ere  is   growing  literature an rat a b Th a on forward-looking licy  eaction  unctions.  n early  aper as done  by  Steve cNees  at he po r f A p w M t Federal eserve  Bank of oston  in he  mid-1980s  and  updated n  the arly 990s.  Over  the R B t i e 1 last  ear,  n act, ere as een  a  flurry  f dditional rk  along  this  venue, ncluding  ork y i f th h b o a wo a i w in  progress  t he oard, hich  finds  hat  olicymaking  as  tended o  evolve ver  the ast  5 a t B w t p h t o l 1 years rom  reliance  incoming  data o  gradual esponses  o orecasts. wever,  these f on t r t f Ho

papers re  an  exercise  n escription  d  what  we really  eed  is   normative nalysis a i d an n a a to confirm  that  oving in esponse  o  forecasts,  ven he ccuracy f orecasts,  uld  produce m r t gi t a o f wo better  esults an esponding  o ctual  ata. r th r t a d

Would such  a  forward-looking action  unction  rovide upport  or oving today re f p s f m when we did  not  choose  to ove at  earlier etings?  In  terms f hinking  bout aising m me o t a r interest  tes  oday,  e might  interpret  e ecent  trengthening    a  shift   the S  curve nd ra t w th r s as in I a ask  whether onetary  policy  hould mpose  a  horizontal    curve hat  ould  resist e m s i LM t w th natural  endency or tronger  rowth  to  push  up  interest  tes.  lternatively, uld t f s g ra A sho monetary  policy  nforce n  upward  sloping  M  curve hat  llows   stabilizing ponse  o e a L t a a res t cyclical  trength?  fact, ere as  been  a  lot f iscussion   implicit mmentary around s In th h o d or co the  table  bout he ld egging  strategy,  e istakes f he  1960s, nd  also ore discussion a t o p th m o t a m of  M2  than t ny  of he revious  OMC a a t p F meetings hat    have  attended.  ne of he t I O t implications  mposing  that  orizontal   curve  is llowing  n  acceleration  2  growth ofi h LM a a ofM in  response  o   shift  n he S  curve. t a i t I

Some might  argue  that  ecause ong-term  nterest  tes  lready  ave  risen  long b l i ra a h a with  the ollar, e conomy is oving along  an  upward-sloping  M  curve.  I  do  not elieve, d th e m L b however,  that  e should eave onetary  policy  o he  bond  market.  The question  s hether w l m t t i w we should e  validating    resisting  e ecent  ove in  long-term  ates.  That  move after l b or th r m r al reflected   a  significant  gree he ond  markets'  xpectation    shift  n onetary olicy, to de t b e ofa i m p particularly  a  result  f he hairman's  ecent  estimony  ombined  with  the ecent  trength as o t C r t c r s in  the ata. et's  at he ond markets n  the ack  and  tell  hem  that  e appreciate eir d L p t b o b t w th effort  ut  also et  hem  know that  hey hould ot ave  to  do  all  he ork. b l t t s n h t w

Finally, t  e discuss  he axi/min  solution. re  I  compare  the onsequences f le m t m He c o two  types f istakes  e could ake today: ot  tightening  en that  ould  have  been o m w m n wh w appropriate rsus ightening en it as not  needed.  In  this  pproach,    decision  oday an ve t wh w a a t c be  interpreted    selecting e est f he orst ossible  utcomes.  First,  nsider  hat as th b o t w p o co w would happen  if  e tighten  hen that  urns  ut o e  unnecessary,  AIRU w w t o t b N could urn  out o t t be  lower han  anticipated,  oductivity  owth  higher  han rojected,    demand t pr gr t p or unexpectedly  eaker.  The  unemployment  rate ould hen e  higher  han  would  have  been w c t b t desirable d  inflation  wer han  otherwise.  n  this  ase,  he nemployment  rate ould  still an lo t I c t u w be  at   historically    level  nd  inflation  uld  be  moving  toward  our  long-run  bjective, a low a wo o not  a  really d  outcome. Indeed,  hat  ould  be  a  preferred tcome  for ome on  this ba t w ou s Committee.

On the  other  and, f  e failed  o ighten  hen it  ould  have  been  appropriate h i w t t w w to do  so, he xcess emand gap  would open  or  widen  and  inflation  uld ncrease.  e would t e d co i W then ace  the aylor ule's  riple ammy f T R t wh on  the unds ate.  e  would have  to aise  he f r W r t funds ate o  prevent he eal ate  rom  declining,   ounter  he  rise  n utput  elative r t t r r f toc t i o r to potential,  d  to ombat  the  increase  n  inflation  lative   ur  target. is s sually  n an c i re too Th i u a ugly  affair.  oes  not  end  well or he conomy. Itd f t e

Mr.  Chairman,  because   am guided  by  a  forward-looking ecification   he I sp oft Taylor ule, ecause  I  believe  e should e  flexible  djusting  nterest  tes  o hanging R b w b ina i ra t c economic  developments,  ecause   think  e should nforce n  upward-sloping  M  curve  in b I w e a L response  o  shifts  he t int IS curve, nd  because t  s   maxi/min  solution, upport  our a i i a I  s y recommendation  for ightening netary  policy.  ecause  containing  threat  o igher t mo B a t h inflation   ikely   require  ome further crease   short-term tes  eyond  the mall isl to s in in ra b s

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Vice  Chair.

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. I  think  hat  he t t best hing o  concentrate  n  at he oment, or  at  least  hat  I  find yself oncentrating  , s t t o t m w m c on i what  we do  not now. Even  though  we have  had  a  lot  f ather  ood  albeit rtial k o r g pa explanations,  hink  e are ot,  nd  certainly m not,  ltogether  re  why inflation  d  the I  t w n a I  a a su an cost-push  auses f nflation  ve  been  so  benevolent.  e  are ightening w largely c o i ha W t no because  we as  a  group  have  decided--and  ertainly elieve--that   isks  f aiting  urther c I  b ther o w f have  become excessive  nd  therefore acceptable.  hen the uestion  rises  s  to  how much a un T q a a we should ighten.    think  5 basis  oints  oes  two  things. t ndicates r  concern, t I 2 p d I i ou especially  ven  the act hat    shift  olicy  irection  nvolved, t  it  oes  not retend gi f t a inp d isi bu d p that e know more than e know.  I, t east,  not  so  sure  that  he enign  performance f w w a l am t b o growth  and  inflation, ch  we have  found  acceptable  ince ast  uly,  s oing  to nd  soon. whi s l J i g e Therefore,    think  t  s ppropriate at  ur  response  e  moderate  and  in hat  ense   25  basis I i i a th o b t s a point ncrease  s nough.  I elieve    50  basis  oint  ove would  indicate  far reater i i e b a p m a g assurance  egarding  he  end  of he  benign eriod--that    s ore highly  redictable d  will r t t p it i m p an occur  sooner--than eel ntellectually  n  any  other  ay. I  f i or  i w

The asymmetric  directive--I nk    have  become almost he esident eologian thi I t r h on what  asymmetry  means--is  nappropriate  w.  I  believe  hat  he ombination f   move i no t t c o a with  asymmetry  would  cause  us  to all  nto  he ame trap f  assuming  something hat  e do f i t s o t w

not  know.  If,   is ossible d  not  absolutely  no-brainer,   decide hat  e have  to as p an a we t w increase  he ed  funds ate  gain ither  efore he ext eeting  or  at he ext eeting,  he t f r a e b t n m t n m t lack f symmetry when we announce  it  n  releasing e  minutes he hursday  after  he ay o a i th t T t M meeting  will ot e  very  important  o  anybody.  Consequently,    think  he 5 basis  oint n b t I t 2 p increase  nd  a  symmetric  directive  e  most  consistent  th hat  we know and  maybe more a ar wi w importantly th  what  we do  not  know. wi

Therefore,    clearly pport our  recommendation  for o i c I su y the  25 basis  oint ncrease, d  I  prefer  5  basis oints  o 0  basis  oints  or he easons hat p i an 2 p t 5 p f t r t you  explained.    would  prefer  n  asymmetrical  irective,  t   do  not  feel  trongly  nough I a d bu I s e about  it  o issent   that  ssue. t d on i

MR. JORDAN. We  are  now entering  he  seventh ear f he  expansion s  dated t y o t a by  the ational  ureau.  For  the ost  part,  t  as  been  an  extraordinary  pansion n hat  ot N B m i h ex i t n only  has  inflation  en  contained, t  more importantly   as  tended o  drift wn through be bu it h t do this  xpansion eriod,  hich  is emarkable. ast  summer when Fed  watchers--Wall  treet e p w r L S types specially--were  rtain at  e were not nly  going  to aise  ates  hen ut hat    tighter e ce th w o r r t b t a policy  as needed,   was comfortable  n  not  supporting at  iew.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Given  the  possibility t  e would  do  this, ha w I already  ave  a  draft  f hat  we may want  to  announce.  I  will  ead he hole  draft h o w r t w announcement.

"The Federal pen Market  Committee  decided oday  to  tighten  oney market O t m conditions  lightly,  pecting  he ederal  unds  rate o  rise  bout  1/4  percentage  oint  o s ex t f f t a p t around  5-1/2 ercent. p

This  action  as  taken n  light  f ersisting  rength   demand,  which  has w i o p st in progressively  creased  he  risk  f nflationary alances eveloping  hat  ould  eventually in t o i imb d t w undermine  the  long xpansion. e

In  these  ircumstances, e  slight rming f onetary  conditions  iewed  as  a c th fi o m isv prudent tep hat  ffords  reater  ssurance f ontinuing  he urrent  ow  inflation s t a g a o c t c l environment or he  rest  f his  ear nd  next nd  prolonging  he  economic  expansion. he f t o t y a a t T experience  f he ast  everal  ears as  reinforced e onviction  hat ow  inflation o t l s y h th c t l is essential   ealizing  e  economy's  fullest  owth  potential. tor th gr

No change  was made in  the ederal eserve  discount  ate,  hich  remains t F R r w a 5 percent."

Is  that  cceptable  o verybody?  I  would  put t ut n  the ame of he ommittee a t e i o i n t C because  this  s uch  an  important  ocument.  I  hope  you  do  not ind in his  ontext. i s d m t c
