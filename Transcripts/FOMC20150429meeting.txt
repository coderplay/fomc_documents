YELLEN.  Good afternoon, everyone.  I'd like to welcome back First Vice CHAIR Presidents Holcomb and Prichard, who will again be representing Dallas and Philadelphia, respectively.

the last FOMC meeting for New York meetings, 70 of which she as an alternate voter.  And, as all of you know, Chris has been involved in a wide array On a sad note, my understanding is that this is First Vice President Chris Cumming.  Chris has attended 92 FOMC attended of System work over many years in all facets of what we do and has been a very wonderful colleague.  Chris, I really thank you for your service and want you to know that you will be very much missed.  [Applause]

you know that Brian Madigan has agreed to return to the Board's 1.  I think director of the division and as FOMC secretary from 2007 Next, I'm pleased to let Division of Monetary Affairs as deputy director, reporting to Thomas, effective June all of you know that Brian served as to 2010.  Since he retired from the Board, Brian has been a visiting professor in the Department of Economics at Georgetown University.

you know, in recent years, the job of director of the Division of the secretary of the FOMC, and as leader of a large in the production of the minutes and transcripts of FOMC meetings.  Obviously, these are in the past and for which he is eminently well qualified. Now, as I think many of Monetary Affairs has become increasingly burdensome.  It has entailed serving as Committee's chief monetary policy advisor, as organization with critical responsibilities.  As part of a strategy to create a more sustainable situation, Brian will have oversight responsibility for the FOMC Secretariat and will play a key role things he has done superbly well

ask the FOMC Secretariat to send out a request in early June votes to select Brian as our secretary.  Under this arrangement, Thomas will to serve as the Committee's primary advisor on monetary policy and will also be able to the Division of Monetary Affairs fulfills its critical in supporting our monetary policy and other responsibilities. Accordingly, I intend to propose that Brian be appointed by the FOMC as its secretary. Unless there are objections, I will for notation continue dedicate more of his energy to ensuring that role the first two items on our agenda today will be considered in a joint meeting Okay.  Now, of the FOMC and the Board of Governors, and, accordingly, I need a motion to close the Board meeting.

As the meeting, the staff has assessed calculation methodology underlying the federal funds effective rate concurrent with the change initial feedback on this as a at this rate, and the effective rate is the sum of these As you are aware, the federal funds effective rate is currently calculated volume-weighted mean.  That is, each observed transaction rate is weighted by the share of total volume transacted

I don't see that as a big thing, but I would very few people even know what the of people who know that are probably able to mean and a certainly be sensitive to the views of market participants on that.

In terms of the contracts that are written on the effective federal funds if we were to pursue this, there would be a long lead time during which the market would know that the change is coming.  We would have to weigh the effect that that to the mean, these contracts average over a long period of time.

Those who do that we do know is that the mean is On the market participants' knowledge of this, I know that much about the detailed calculation of would find it pretty understandable, I believe, that we switch from a volume-weighted mean to a volume-weighted median, partly because one of the things

Well, I have a question now.  This refers to the expectations about the RRP facility post-liftoff.  This is anecdotal, but it sounds like there's a systematic buy-side participants, who tend to be predicting a larger facility, and primary MR. POWELL. size of the ON difference between

We do see some distinction between the two.  The median for the dealers for demand.  For the buy side, it is $350 billion.  There is some variation, variation within the dealer estimates as well.  But I think you are correct that the buy MS. LOGAN. is $190 billion at liftoff but there is side is skewed a bit higher.

MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Other questions or comments?  [No response]  Okay.  Then let's turn to renew both the NAFA swap arrangement with to renew the liquidity swap arrangements.  Let me first ask CHAIR to swap arrangements.  We have a proposal Canada and Mexico and a proposal whether there are any questions or comments on these proposals.  President Lacker.

Chair.  I will be referring to the handout MS. MEADE. 2   Thank you, Madam labeled 'Materials for Briefing on Governance Issues Associated with Liftoff.'

month, you received a memo outlining possible arrangements for to the administered rates around the time of liftoff.  In the the liftoff announcement, it may be somewhat difficult to get a clear in money markets to adapt to the new market environment.  For example, other restrictions on their allocation of funds so that they are able to engage Earlier this enhanced reporting of market developments and the governance of decisions on operational adjustments early days after picture of how normalization is proceeding because it may take several days for some participants money market participants may need to revise investment guidelines, counterparty limits, or in the arbitrage opportunities available after liftoff.

During these early days, you may find it useful to prearrange briefings during which the staff could provide updates on market developments and assess the effectiveness of policy implementation, and you could ask questions.  For example, you could schedule two weeks following the liftoff announcement; such briefings could be held via or videoconference.  These briefings or minutes would be prepared.  Should you wish to express developments or discuss whether to adjust the briefings could be readily converted into joint Board.  If the liftoff process does not persistently outside the timing and course of possible policy actions, and the scheduled briefings would be replaced by joint videoconference meetings.

after the first two weeks or so following the liftoff could be helpful if the The memo associated with adjusting the IOER relative to the new target range for of any such As discussed in the memo we sent you, the FOMC and Board may also wish to establish decisionmaking procedures that would govern small operational adjustments to the administered rates announcement.  Adjustments to these administered rates effective federal funds rate were persistently outside its new target range. did not discuss the advantages or disadvantages and ON RRP rates, either separately or together, the federal funds rate.  The memo focused on the governance adjustments, and we provided two approaches for you to consider.

administered IOER rate.  A Under the first approach, each adjustment would be approved by a vote of the Committee or Board.  The Chair could convene a joint FOMC and Board meeting via videoconference at which you could discuss potential changes to the rates; all policymakers would be involved in the discussion of changes to the IOER and ON RRP rates.  Following that discussion, the FOMC would vote on any change to the ON RRP rate, while the Board would approve any change to the variation on this approach would involve policymakers using SDS to submit comments on proposed adjustments to one or both of the administered rates, with

to the ON RRP rate and/or IOER rate recorded via notation FOMC and Board, respectively.  While this would be operationally less the preparation of allow for an interactive discussion and, as a approvals for changes votes by the burdensome than holding a meeting, and would not require transcripts and minutes, it would not result, might be most appropriate for relatively straightforward adjustments that the Committee had previously discussed.

This would allow the Chair to make small adjustments to the administered rates keep the federal funds rate trading in its new target range.  As the Chair could be authorized to make of perhaps 5 or 10 basis points in the administered rates and also they preferred to by adjusting the IOER rate, the ON RRP rate, or both rates in in order to maintain a constant spread between them.  There may be some delegation scenario in that it would the stance of policy-the target range for the Under the second approach, you would delegate the ON RRP and IOER rates, subject to limitations established by the FOMC and Board.  If the first couple of weeks of the normalization process had proceeded smoothly and you felt comfortable with the delegation approach, one of the staff briefings could be converted to a meeting at which you would formally take the decision to delegate authority.  You might prefer this approach to ensure Federal Reserve is delegation if deemed necessary to an example, the memo suggested that adjustments indicated that policymakers could determine in advance whether address such a situation parallel communications advantages associated with the clearly separate your decisions on federal funds rate established by the FOMC-from small technical adjustments to the administered rates necessary to achieve that policy stance.

the questions that were distributed with the rate.  The rate for primary credit was originally set in 2003 at 100 basis points above the twice during above the top of the federal funds target range since February 2010.  The memo discussed two options for the primary credit rate spread:  maintaining that spread at 50 basis points the spread to 100 basis points at the time of issue.  Thank you; this concludes my prepared remarks. The final page of your handout lists memo for today's go-round on governance issues.  Another memo that was distributed at the same time concerned the setting of the primary credit lending Committee's target for the federal funds rate.  The spread was reduced the financial crisis, and has stood 50 basis points rate setting of the above the top of the Committee's new funds rate target range at the time of liftoff and for some period thereafter, or raising liftoff.  During the go-round, you may also wish to share any views you might have on that

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Before we turn to questions for Ellen and our go-round, I to just make a few remarks of my own.  At the outset, I want to emphasize that governance structures, the overall conduct of CHAIR would like although our policy tools, by law, have different monetary policy is obviously the purview of the FOMC.  The governance issues before us this

But it is clear that when the time we will face unprecedented uncertainties, and we need to important that we agree on an approach for initial phase of liftoff and the process for subsequent adjustments that may phase is complete. We have spent a great deal of time and effort in devising our framework for normalization, and I am comes to raise the federal funds rate, stand ready to make adjustments, if needed.  It is managing both the conceivably be needed once that initial

During this time, the FOMC the setting of our tools, including the administered rates, parameters of my own The staff on our calendars to adjustments may need to reconsider the overnight RRP facility, and the use of term tools.  I just want to make clear that, in view, decisions during this initial period should not be delegated to me.

and Board should vote on adjustments that are deemed necessary after and alternative approaches.  For example, if the funds is trading soft relative to the target range, the Committee should decide whether to raise both the IOER RRP spread constant, or to instead adjust only one of the rates. entirely tactical or routine.  My expectation, however, is that after some memo is guessing might be two weeks, we will have a reasonably good working, and only minor adjustments, if any, might be The FOMC debating the relevant policy considerations rate rates, keeping -ON These decisions are not initial period, which the sense regarding how our approach is subsequently needed to keep the federal funds rate in the target range.

I hope all, can be made in a simple and efficient to make modest adjustments, perhaps up to 5 or 10 basis points, to the IOER and in the Committee's target range. example, to the spread Assuming that our approach works roughly as expected, such intensive monitoring on the part of the Committee shouldn't be necessary beyond this initial phase.  We ought to be able settle into an arrangement in which, at most, modest adjustment to our administered rates, will that such adjustments, if they prove necessary at manner.  From a practical perspective, I tend to favor an approach in which authority is delegated to me as Chair overnight RRP rates to help maintain the federal funds rate These adjustments would be in accordance with a strategy pertaining, for that had been decided by the Committee.  In such circumstances, I would, of course, keep the Committee fully apprised of ongoing developments.  If any problems in implementing policy emerged, clearly we would need to convene a meeting.

We have now scheduled a I would expect the Committee to decide on any such delegation only at a time when we feel we have a good sense for how our approach is working and not at the time of liftoff. course, if many of you are not comfortable with such an arrangement, we indicated, work out a method for holding Committee and possibly on short notice, to make these potential modest adjustments once the first couple of weeks after liftoff have passed.  Regardless of the approach we agree on, it it serves Let me stop there.  I very full go-round, so-Vice Chairman Dudley.

At what time of day would it be most appropriate to have those meetings? marketsyou are carrying that forward?  Because the memo didn't into the mechanics of how you would actually implement this.  I was just curious if is any thought given to that at this point. if the funds rate questions of How would it work in terms of having the meeting, making the decision, notifying the what would the timeline look like as really get there that we were trying to be optimistic when writing the memo.

The other choice is say that, if we agree on this, we should that down pretty soon, because, in principle, this could happen as early as June, and it would time blocked out on their calendar.

First, President Lacker,

In this initial period, would you envision all meetings, or a mix of MR. LACKER. briefings and meetings?

My understanding is the idea is that we are going to preschedule When we start the video meeting, we will have some sense of whether things are have decisions to make, in which case the staff could be a briefing.  But clearly, not going very smoothly and we need to deliberate, we would convene that as a CHAIR YELLEN. these times. going smoothly, and we really don't relieved of the burden of doing transcripts and so forth.  I would call that if things are

MS. MEADE.  Yes.

We could then say, 'Look, let's convert this now to a joint Board and CHAIR YELLEN. FOMC meeting.'

follow-up to Vice Chairman Dudley's question.  For how about the closing in Europe?  As timing of the meetings, are there a bunch of short-term instruments that would relevant to act in the morning, because of when Europe closes? MR. ROSENGREN.  Just a many of the short-term credit markets is it important to know we think about the make it

For the repo markets, most of that is going to be U.S. activity, and that is early in the morning.  For unsecured federal funds and Eurodollars, there is going to Europe.  We saw this during the lot of volume done early, and then there is some late-day volume as well United States.  It is going to be a mix.  We are going to do more analysis on the full pattern we recommend a time of 3:30 or 4:00 or 4:30 in MS.

But you can think of the unsecured markets as having two trading periods, and the repo as being mostly very early in the morning.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President George.

IOER or ON RRP rates might be subject to these technical adjustments if we delegate they are described, they talk MS. GEORGE.  I was looking for a clarification.  In the context, the memo offers that both the them.  When I go back and look at the normalization principles, as

April 28-29, 2015

primary mechanism by which we will move the funds rate into the Let's say we delegate on a technical adjustment basis the ON RRP rate.  That take care of itself.  But by delegating some adjustment to the IOER rate, does that a change in policy stance in any way?  Or will it be understood that you are trying to move about IOER as being the target range. seems to signal the spread in lockstep?

to keep the overnight RRP as small and that means it is just trying to get better trading in the arbitrage relationship in you are getting interest on excess reserves.  I view it as the primary way we are lifting is the federal target range. MR. POTTER.  I have gotten this question quite a few times in public.  I use an idea that Jamie came up with, which is that everything we are doing in terms of the mechanics of lifting rates comes from interest on excess reserves.  We are trying as possible, which rates.  But it is not really a measure of the stance of policy.  The stance of policy funds we have talked about, it technical moves, and thatMS. GEORGE.  Okay.  In the context of these basis points would be understood these are

YELLEN.  The Committee has set the target range and decided to make small CHAIR adjustments to keep the funds rate there.

MS. GEORGE.  All right.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo.

Chair.  Do I understand briefings, that all of our calendars will need to be kept open for two weeks following next I-don't-know-how-many FOMC meetings? MR. TARULLO.  Yes.  This is just a logistical question, Madam correctly that what you anticipate doing is, if we agree with the concept of having these prearranged each of the

April 28-29, 2015

about the liftoff meeting.  Oh, well, yes, MS. MEADE.  I think we were thinking initially of course.

MR. TARULLO.  Unless you know something I don't know.

DUDLEY.  You'd have to prepare for the earliest meeting you might VICE CHAIRMAN liftoff for, right?

CHAIR YELLEN.  I suppose-I mean, people will have some conflicts, right?

MR. TARULLO.  They have major ones.

We can't for the next whatever meetings-I mean, we can try to those times.  But some people will have trips presumably that they can't-I suppose if CHAIR YELLEN. block out somebody can't participate- a number of international meetings that several of us will have conflicts with as MR. TARULLO.  There are already on the Board, I think, are going to have-and Vice Chairman Dudley well.

DUDLEY.  That's my point.  I'd prefer to get this nailed down time as efficiently as possible.  That would be VICE CHAIRMAN sooner rather than later, so we can block out the my preference.

Maybe we can call in-I mean, we normally have videoconferences, CHAIR YELLEN. but conceivably we can call.

This is just from a communications point of view.  Would we mode of daily briefings with the intermeeting action?  Or would we simply be silent on that until MS.

minutes of this discussion will reflect that you have discussed some MS. MEADE.  The of these issues.

and I agree we should be about what the rates are going to be the next day.  That is probably MR. POTTER.  I take your question as, 'Let's be very careful,' very, very careful.  Maybe we want to think hard about how this is described, because we don't want everyone thinking every day the FOMC is meeting at 4:00 p.m., and we are waiting for this thing to come over the wires not- contingency plan.

My question is in terms of contingencies-do you anticipate that we could missed the by a BlackBerry anywhere, right? MR. EVANS. do this by notation vote?  Possibly, if there was a conflict and you were traveling, you videoconference and maybe a staff member was sitting in-they could give you a quick executive summary and then the notation vote could be done

is probably pretty good practice to MR. POTTER.  No, no.  After the meeting, it announce the decision.  I would feel more comfortable announcing quite soon after the conclusion of the meeting, rather than waiting, but-

YELLEN.  Okay.  Let's begin the go-round.  President Williams. CHAIR

is 'Yes.' On the second question, regarding approaches, I actually think you laid out comments just a moment ago.  We hope we serious meeting to discuss what is causing the funds to trade outside the target range, understanding what the effects of moving the two different decisions seems like the MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On the first question, my answer It's as simple as that. the approach we should take really well in your won't need to do any of this, but having a rate administered rates would be, and having FOMC/Board of Governors right approach.  But once things have-I think 'settled down' is the phrase you used-I think it

I am still pretty confident that we won't have problems keeping the federal think it is good planning. would be completely appropriate points, say, to the two administered rates.  I fully support the do view this as representing prudent expect funds rate within the range, but I

that came up in the questions asked in the past minute or the extent possible, policy decisions regarding really should be separated from technical issues associated with the thinking back to the good old days when the Desk had wide to adjust the amount of reserves in the System in order to achieve the target federal funds very useful, if we can-and this is going to be the challenge-frame the that we indicate that really communicated as technical means to the policy goals that we have agreed on.  We really want to avoid this perception that think we are doing prudent planning.  It is April issues now makes a lot of sense.  Again, I support the approach I do think that one of the issues two is really important, and that is about the communications in connection with this.  One of the Committee's long-standing principles is that, to monetary policy implementation of policy.  I'm latitude rate.  I think it would be communications regarding these adjustments to the administered rates so these are just mostly technical decisions reflecting, of course, the decisions of the FOMC and the Board of Governors on the policy decisions, but achieve moving around these administered rates reflects some kind of shift in the stance of policy or creating some noise in connection with that.  I now.  Thinking through these that you laid out.  Thank you.

ensure that we attain the policy goals voted on by the FOMC.  This MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am in favor of delegating to the Chair certain tactical decisions that

April 28-29, 2015

but delegating tactical implementation of monetary interest rates will respond to our rates at, and immediately following, liftoff.  I am still will be able to target the federal funds rate and liftoff.  As a result, I could imagine a wide variety of adjustments that is consistent with the FOMC setting strategy policy.  However, determining the scope and timing of that delegation should wait until we have a better understanding of how the constellation of short-term setting of IOER and overnight RRP somewhat uncertain about how successfully we other short-term rates at may be necessary following liftoff.

rates may be comfortably bounded by RRP rates, I can easily imagine situations in which that is not the case.  I imagine circumstances in which some market rates do not adjust as expected to changes In addition, it is difficult to predict how variable policy or market rates will While the federal funds rate and other short-term the IOER and overnight can also in our policy rates. be at liftoff.

along with the flexibility to turn those into joint FOMC market rates to our is better understood, we could agree on the delegation of tactical decisions to the Chair.  Predetermining our arrangements for time serves little purpose, if they are quite likely to change after liftoff.  I much we know now about liftoff and plan appropriately to interest rates from the zero lower bound. My preferred approach, in light of my concerns, would be to have frequent briefings, initially following liftoff, -Board meetings, if necessary.  Once the relationship of the funds rate and other tools, as well as the variability of those rates, appropriate delegation at this recommend being humble about how have significant consultation and adjustments as we develop a more practical understanding of the challenges of lifting premature to determine the normal relationship we expect for the Similarly, it is probably primary credit rate.

Once of tactical decisions for In summary, I suggest relationships are better understood after liftoff, we can discuss delegation achieving our goals.  Thank you.

you, Madam Chair.  I am comfortable with a governance that involves prescheduled staff briefings for a period of time after liftoff and then, initial period when things appear to have settled down, delegating authority to the Chair moving outside the FOMC's target range.  If the Committee agrees on the delegation structure, then this delegation of authority should be communicated at the time of It is important that the Committee be aware of the developments in financial markets and isn't clear to me at this point.  If we opt to prearrange daily briefings for two weeks, we weekly briefing for the remainder of the intermeeting period.  Of course, MS. MESTER.  Thank approach after the to make small technical adjustments to the ON RRP and IOER rates between FOMC meetings. These technical adjustments would be for the purpose of keeping the funds rate from persistently governance liftoff. the effectiveness of policy implementation after the liftoff announcement, and the briefings would be very useful in that regard.  Whether two weeks is the appropriate time for the initial period might also prearrange a the briefings could be converted to meetings, if necessary.

it is important that we demonstrate after liftoff that we have the tools to bring funds rate into our target range.  That may necessitate making modest changes in the a nimble way.  Delegating the decisions for these technical to the Chair seems appropriate.  I believe we should treat the IOER rate and the ON I do believe the federal ON RRP rate or IOER rate in changes

April 28-29, 2015

with respect to delegation.  That is, if we delegate to the Chair, we to make technical changes in both rates. RRP rate symmetrically should delegate the authority to deploy the auxiliary policy tools, like term as well as making larger changes in the IOER and RRP rates and, of if liftoff doesn't go as planned and its target range, the full Committee needs to be for making those hard choices and helping to communicate them to the public.  The to go it alone. Changes that are strategic policy decisions should remain under the purview of the full Committee.  These would include decisions deposits and term RRPs, course, changes in the federal funds rate target.  Particularly the funds rate is trading persistently outside responsible Chair shouldn't have

liftoff.  This whether a technical adjustment is needed.  Let me offer the view that liftoff will funds rate is within the target range on most, but not necessarily all, that the funds rate be at the midpoint of the the funds rate.  Under those conditions, I don't think we should require the to the midpoint of the range. The Committee hasn't had a full discussion of what constitutes successful will help inform be successful if the federal days.  In my view, successful liftoff does not require range.  We plan to operate with a target range of 25 basis points because we don't expect to have precise control over funds rate to be close an issue.  We have indicated to the public to target a range for the funds rate that is 25 basis points wide and target range, If we find that adjustments are necessary to keep the funds rate in the target range, depart from these plans in one way or another.  Presumably, this can better be handled time of liftoff, we acknowledge to the public that technical adjustments to the two rates be necessary and that, as we proceed with liftoff and normalization, the Board of Communication of any technical adjustments is that at liftoff we will continue set the IOER and ON RRP rates at the upper and lower bounds of the funds rate respectively. we must if, at the might

to make those adjustments, and also adjustments would not constitute a change in policy.  Thank you, Madam Governors and FOMC have delegated authority to the Chair that any technical Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I am comfortable needed-all is working smoothly, for example, and the federal funds rate meetings if to the overnight RRP and IOER rates are needed to keep the federal funds rate in its long this period lasts, VICE CHAIRMAN prescheduling the staff briefings during the first few weeks following liftoff.  They can be canceled if they are not is trading within its target range-or they could be converted to joint FOMC -Board adjustments target range.  Obviously, we have to retain some flexibility about how depending on what our experience is.

initial period, I very much favor changes that are tactical, such as small shifts in the overnight RRP rate achieve the federal funds rate target selected by the Committee and changes shifts in the target federal funds rate-this goes to President George's Turning to the governance approach beyond this distinguishing between and the IOER rate to in policy, which are question.

changes needed to implement the monetary to the to the Desk.  If you consider how policy was implemented prior to the crisis, the Desk, its target.  For many years, presumably as a one FOMC member on the call, essentially to keep an eye I think there is a long history that tactical policy stance that has been selected by the Committee can and should be delegated either Chair or in close consultation with Board staff, decided how much in reserves to add or drain each day in order to keep the federal funds rate close to governance measure, there was also on the proceedings.

April 28-29, 2015

Monetary Affairs at the consulted closely with in making those reserve adjustment decisions.  The issue in my mind is whether the overnight RRP and the IOER rates that are small and designed to keep the federal and I think they do. The decision on the amount of intervention and the means of intervention was left during normal times to the staff, the New York Desk, and the Division of Board.  In unusual circumstances-for example, August 2007-the staff the Chair changes in funds rate in its target range meet this tactical criteria, mandated by the Committee.  So this argues for delegation.  One could even argue Chair to make clear that it is receiving the it deserves by senior policymakers.  Also, delegation to the Chair might be more in this particular case, because such decisions are about the level of interest rates on our facilities rather than as in the past, on the amount of reserves we might add or The changes contemplated would be to implement the monetary policy stance that had already been for delegation to the Desk and the Division of Monetary Affairs staff, but I don't see any reason to go this far.  I would favor delegating it to the attention appropriate offered drain.

after the initial period, I would give the Chair the discretion to move range of 20 basis points, down by as much as 10 basis points as needed to keep the funds rate constant spread, widened or narrowed subject to those criteria. To implement this the overnight RRP rate up or down by as much as 10 basis points, so a and the IOER rate up or within its target range.  The adjustments could either be in tandem to maintain a or the spread could be to the delegation of modest IOER and overnight RRP rate changes to the think any other changes-such as implementing the time deposit facility and things like With respect to the overnight RRP cap, this is pretty consequential because it will In contrast Chair, I that or changing the size of the cap on the overnight RRP facility-should be left to the full Committee.

Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lacker. CHAIR

that can be converted at short notice to meetings.  I think that adjustment of the IOER in the first few weeks following liftoff should clearly require an MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Yes, I'm comfortable scheduling a bunch of briefings or the overnight RRP rates FOMC meeting.

the RRP rates relative to the funds rate.  Committee members brought to the tradeoffs involved, and the initial settings involve a compromise tradeoffs.  New information about performance of those inform Committee members' views about those tradeoffs and I would point out that it took us almost a year to figure out how we wanted to set IOER and the overnight different considerations among different views about those settings after liftoff is likely to likely require recalibration of that compromise.

imagine a routine adjustment.  The analogy has been drawn to the market operations.  I'd point out that it has did.  And at times when the FOMC has operational regime, those things have been tricky at first, and the Committee has 1970s, when the instructions to the Desk were very different.  It's going to take a IOER or overnight RRP rates to be seen as routine or technical rather 'All right, we've set up a new regime, we're trying to calibrate the settings For me, it's hard to Desk's draining and adding reserves through open taken decades for those to become as routine as they changed its likely, in many of those instances, been very involved.  I'm thinking about the early 1980s and times in the while for changes to the than something like:

April 28-29, 2015

Committee needs to be involved.  What I'd advocate is that we plan to meetings until the first meeting at which a decision that is made been clearly routine; from then on we can delegate the routine of of these things,' and the make all the decisions at appears, in hindsight, to have changing it.

likely, to my mind.  If you think about it, what's at stake the arbitrage margin between the funds market and the IOER rate.  It seems to 30 or 40 basis points.  I'd be kind of surprised looks like, yes, they should routinely fluctuate by 10 to plan on making these decisions at meetings.  I'm happy to these turn out to be routine decisions that the Committee feels delegating.  Let's go and make one of those decisions at a time like that and then delegate I don't think routine changes are here is the spread: like 20 basis points, 15 basis points, somewhere in there.  That doesn't seem like something that's likely to fluctuate the way the need for adding or draining reserves fluctuated on a daily basis.  If it fluctuates, that's big news if it goes about that, and I think we'd want to get to the bottom of it.  I don't think we have an understanding of those markets in which it or 20 basis points.  I'd urge us just delegate if it comes to pass that like thereafter.

limit spikes in monetary policy implementation in that sense until-2020, I think, is the latest staff their control have a ton of reserves that insulate them against shocks, large reserve I also wanted to talk about the discount rate spread.  The discount rate spread is 50 basis points, and it's irrelevant to monetary policy right now in the sense that it doesn't the federal funds rate when reserve supply is unexpectedly shortened.  It's not going to be relevant to projection.  Its relevance now is basically for small banks that come up short on reserves due to poor planning or some unforeseeable contingency that they could claim is outside but probably isn't.  Now, large banks and they don't come to the window.  Right now, in our current situation of

April 28-29, 2015

balances, this is basically about giving the incentive to small banks to manage their accounts sensibly.

would provide a more appropriate money involved if you actually do the overnight calculation.  I in 2002.  We did some analysis.  There was some thought given to the tradeoff involved.  I It would also signal normalization in a way that would be useful. I think our old normal spread of 100 basis points incentive, given the amounts of think we should move back to 100 when we lift off.  I would favor that.  It was there.  We set that think it makes sense.

low helps reduce stigma. Small banks don't feel stigmatized.  Maybe they feel stigmatized already, but they their borrowing from the window.  It's just a big bank or a toobank kind of issue, and large banks don't borrow now.  In the last crisis, we lowered looked as if there was a rationale for big banks borrowing at the they were getting all of the money they needed from Federal Home Loan I don't think the Chair. When you talk about discount window borrowing, the word 'stigma' inevitably comes up, and the idea is advanced that, well, keeping the primary credit rate That is certainly true in the only model we have of stigma and discount window lending, but the survey research we've done as part of the a group looking at discount window issues-they did some survey work on stigma, and what they found is that it is not a relevant consideration for small banks. don't feel as if stigma inhibits big-to-fail the primary credit rate when it window.  It turned out Banks anyway, so it didn't seem to be particularly relevant to large banks either. stigma is a reason to keep the discount rate spread at 50 basis point rather than 100.  That's import of that.  Thank you, Madam

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  My reaction to the questions posed is that pragmatism.  I agree that planning for daily briefings with the option of MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam they're really matters of

April 28-29, 2015

meeting is sensible and workable.  I'm certainly fine with that.  I'm also with the approach that you laid out, with the Committee and Board making the the first two weeks, and then after that, the delegation of small adjustments.  So I'm in both cases.  There are some details yet to be worked out, and under certain invoking an FOMC comfortable decisions comfortable scenarios, we may have time to work them out.  We could hear a second version of this possibly down the road.

discount rate question, but I'm glad that President talked about it a little bit.  With regard to trying to figure out what that to throw out one thought, and that is a recollection that during the crisis, Home Loan Banks became a sort of surrogate discount window.  And the of our setting of the rates to their operations and their settings may be relevant for us Those are my thoughts.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I haven't given a lot of thought to the Lacker raised it and spread should be, I want the Federal relationship to consider.

with the with the approach described as that to be used for delegating authority to the Chair matters once we have declared victory on a successful liftoff. MR. PRICHARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm entirely comfortable approach described by the staff and yourself to be used for informing the FOMC on the effectiveness of policy implementation during the initial period after liftoff.  I'm also entirely comfortable on tactical the IOER rate and the discount rate, I think it's quiesce and minimize the variability at, and immediately after, liftoff. to stay with the 50 basis point spread until we have some separation of number of moving parts at the time of liftoff could work against us, As it concerns the spread between actually probably best to My preference would be these events.  I think the

April 28-29, 2015

of the different things that could be happening, and one especially as we try to understand all more change, I think, that isn't necessary might best be saved for later.

the earlier discussion on the median and midpoint-a behavioral issue that I the staff to consider to the extent that we talk about changing the definition of the whisper, people think we shout.  I just don't know whether people would make more of than is needed, again, at the time of liftoff.  I understand we're not contemplating the change then, but even announcing the plan of a change could have a behavioral I will add to would just like federal funds rate.  I don't know what the behavioral reaction to that would be.  It seems like when we that definitional effect.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

I know this Committee can will be to say other than getting emails from Simon and Lorie telling us what has MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  First, with respect briefings, I weeks would be in the circumstance that reasonably successful liftoff. meeting on the Friday following liftoff.  Thereafter, I'm just not sure how say unless need meetings and not just briefings.  But I just note that in fill up virtually any meeting that is set with questions and conversation, but I'm just not sure how much there happened on day three.

Chair, but actually I think I would go further than the staff though. going to disagree with the Chair in the interest of giving her more discretion than she With respect to governance, like everybody, I think, who's spoken on this point, I favor giving discretion to the Indeed, I'm

April 28-29, 2015

guess I don't quite understand why we wouldn't give her discretion for this kind of IOER rate or the ON RRP rate or both, even in the immediate post-liftoff new, but we have spent most of the past year talking about how important it is to with the consensus that our that smooth and credible liftoff, and presumably that smoothness and to be most important in the immediate post-liftoff period, which is to say the of days.  It seems to me that if we regard the adjustments as fine-tuning in pursuit of to give her the discretion in that get, as Loretta says, to at least the asked for.  I modest change in the period.  It is have a smooth and credible liftoff.  And, notwithstanding my substantial uneasiness potential medium-term effects of a large ON RRP facility, I've joined the dominant goal should be credibility are going first couple a particular federal funds target rate range, it would be useful first couple of days to make such adjustments in an effort to bottom of that range.

major problem with liftoff, we're going to need another full FOMC meeting. little bit of softness in the floor on the first day or two after modest adjustment in the IOER A quick action of that sort might actually buttress the credibility of our tools and intentions process smoother.  I don't think, in any case, it change, because we can talk about it beforehand.  Now, it's possible that a quick adjustment as indicating that we lack confidence in the efficacy judgment that the Chair could able to discern what market sentiment and intentions may If there's a But suppose, for example, there's a the announced liftoff, and that softness might be firmed by a rate. right from the outset and thereby make the whole represents a policy markets might read such of the decision we had just made a day or two before.  But that's a make in consultation with those best be.

a desideratum, I think I've already explained why an do the trick.  I just think the logic of what we're talking Just by indicating that nimbleness is FOMC decisionmaking process won't

April 28-29, 2015

to adjust those two that we've been talking about and we will set at the time of liftoff in the period in which in changing or shaping perceptions of how this whole process is about here argues for giving the Chair this kind of very limited discretion rates they might be most efficacious going to go.

does seem to me proper to indicate in advance that small, adjustments might be made in the IOER and ON RRP rates between meetings. these are technical changes rather than policy changes.  The the as a whole, also seems to me a good idea since it would reinforce the fact that these changes rather than policy changes. As to communication, it operational Characterizing those as operational adjustments beforehand and contemplating them, I think, helps reinforce the sense that suggestion that any actual changes be noted by the Desk, as opposed to the Chair or Committee rates are more or less operational rate spread, I thought President Lacker's comments were very they are interesting and we should think about them, this difference between small and large bank stigma when we do discuss this, I window are done and maybe a more fulsome memo has been produced seems to me we've got plenty on our right now, and we might usefully put that conversation off just a bit. On the primary credit interesting.  Notwithstanding the fact that particularly personally would prefer to wait until the staff thinking about stigma effects and perhaps other elements of the discount and circulated so that we can have a discussion of that.  It plate

thought about it this way, but I fully endorse what about the criteria for success in how we regard the meeting of the target range postit would be useful for us, through appropriate that expectation out as well so that we're being evaluated by commentators actual intentions and aims are.  Like President I want to end by saying I hadn't Loretta said liftoff, and I think if we all subscribe to that, mechanisms, to get and markets in a manner consistent with what our

April 28-29, 2015

little adjustments even right after liftoff to make.  And, like President Mester, I think using any of the other tools is entire Committee.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Mester, again, this is another reason why I think these are fine for the Chair something that should involve the

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Did I see a two-hander?  President Lockhart. CHAIR

Chair.  Like Governor Tarullo, I came to the critical period and, two, maybe a desire to have MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam meeting prepared to support delegation in the first two weeks.  I interpreted your earlier suggestion as, one, respect for governance in a more of a group decision than an individual decision.  Could you maybe speak more for another moment or two on what your thinking is regarding that?

that in the days after liftoff, if things are not going exactly as is drifting outside the range, I do really think it's appropriate for the to the bottom of what the CHAIR YELLEN.  I feel we intend, and the funds rate entire Committee to meet, discuss what is happening, try to get problem is, and decide on what the approach is.

could make the decision that this is no big deal, the funds rate is just fluctuating target range by more than we had anticipated and this is the 'new normal.' wanted to address it not by moving the band or changing the spread, but by moving one or persistent movements outside the range, and the Committee says, 'Let's just do this.  It's not that big of a deal.  That's the way to that point you regard those adjustments as essentially routine, and it's it along the lines of what Governor Tarullo said, I am comfortable with that, and, of course, that makes life easier.  But I think the Committee First Vice President Holcomb. Now, we around relative to the If we more rates around to deal with this when we see early on address this'-and at early, and then you want to delegate perfectly needs to feel comfortable that we have established procedures that have been determined by the Committee that we think are workable and appropriate.

April 28-29, 2015

should turn out that between the meetings the funds rate begins to trade frequently below the I support the Chair having to restore funds rate control by raising both the IOER and the ON the first days as well.  That these rate changes are not to be subject to a that they are technical adjustments designed simply to implement previouslymain focus would stay on the target band for the federal funds rate set MS. HOLCOMB.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  On the staff briefings issue, I say by all means they should be useful and perhaps important.  If it regularly scheduled FOMC overnight reverse repo rate for a reasonably sized ON RRP facility, limited discretionary authority RRP rates while maintaining the spread between the two rates.  I agree with Governor Tarullo that this could be within vote would signal agreed-upon policy.  The by the FOMC.

the like term and term RRPs, being brought to bear when systematically greater interest rate control I understand that we are entering uncharted territory and may need to act nimbly. FOMC and the Board to give the Chair discretionary IOER-ON RRP band relative to the funds rate target range between The simplicity of a system in which the IOER and the ON RRP rates are set equal to top and bottom of the target funds rate band, respectively, is appealing and easily communicated. Deviations from that simple system should be temporary with reserve-draining tools, deposits is required. Therefore, a good solution is for the authority to adjust the meetings while maintaining the width of the band at 25 basis points.  Thank you.

Even at the outset would be all right with me. tweak the dials as necessary, and I see a communications to this approach, as it reduces the odds of small technical adjustments to the IOER or rates being misread as changes in the stance of policy.  I completely trust that if any to bring us in on the decisionmaking process. After the initial burn-in period-perhaps two weeks-I also favor the Board and the Committee delegating authority to the 10 basis points, if necessary, to keep the funds rate within the target range.  I am comfortable delegating this authority as early as Basically, these are efficient ways to advantage the ON RRP major issues arise, the Chair will not hesitate a question.  I can't remember if this was in the documents or other people have stance of monetary policy before the next policy meeting any intermeeting adjustments would be seen as nimble adjustments, just technically to get range?

Thank analysis and the memos that discuss the intermeeting governance of the IOER rate, and other policy tools during the early weeks of liftoff.  I described of scheduling daily staff briefings during those first meet our needs initially, given that would note is that it might not always be clear what it would mean to 'settle mid-September, things might settle down quarter-end and then you might have this issue of whether that is really of being able to deal with quarter-end.  You might want to the end of December.  I think just the passage of time is not that this is going to be working and working fine.  I think that is One thing I down,' so if liftoff takes place, say, in mid-June or after the passage of settling down from the point of view have staff briefings, again, scheduled for the end of the following quarter, which I guess, if we raised in September, would be at necessarily going to tell you something to keep in mind as we go forward.

But it will become routine, at least.  That's our baseline do think it's

April 28-29, 2015

going to be in the minority on my next point, which is, can we transition to a in which we simply delegate so-called technical decisions to the Chair?  Here I am not considerations.  First, when about the context in which increases in the ON RRP rate would be we weren't sure that those situations would be that technical or tactical.  It be situations in which the effective federal funds rate would be below cap on the length.  The Committee certainly has strong that.  It just immediately seemed to bring substantive issues into play. I think I am situation supportive of that delegation, and my answer there is shaped by three my staff and I thought considered, per se seemed like those would the bottom of the target range, and that seemed likely to occur in conjunction with the ON RRP volume being binding.  Then there would be some interaction, at least, in your discussion about raising the ON RRP rate, and also discussion about raising the cap.  Now, the cap is a big deal.  We have talked about that at views about second consideration is that, as I listen to people talk about analogies with the past, if with that than I say that because I think if it is routine enough to be staff.  This is about the Committee deciding that a decision, which is not sufficiently routine Chair instead.  That is not something I feel as The we were talking about delegating to the staff, I would almost be more comfortable delegating to the Chair.  [Laughter] delegated to staff, we can delegate it to the staff.  This is clearly not routine enough to delegate to the to delegate to the staff, is being delegated to the comfortable with.

For these for intermeeting adjustments to think the Committee could make contingency plans to vote, as needed, between scheduled meetings, be it by telephone, videoconference, telepresence, secure lines-all of the suggestions that the idea of doing more research near term, the June-September time frame, I would favor keeping the 50 basis point to do work on the issue before we decide.

You really don't that we're going federal rate is trading a few basis points below the range, and now you make this move.  Now the rate moves into the bottom part of the range.

is the policy rate, but relatively few trades According to the Committee, the IOER rate is not the policy is the rate that affects the largest banks in the country, and it funding costs.  And, in other contexts, we have said IOER is our workhorse rate. I see a core problem here, which we've talked about before in our discussions.  The Committee insists on saying that the federal funds rate are occurring at that particular rate. rate, but, on the other hand, that affects their that is potentially large at the time of liftoff.  So might say that the policy rate is the federal funds rate, but what does that mean to markets? really the markets that are saying what the policy rate is, and if they think moving these other is more important than where the federal funds rate is trading, then we've changed policy in And then you've got overnight RRP, which we're also saying is not a policy rate, but which is for a market that has many traders and we It's rates a macroeconomic sense.

this is a conflict, but that is part of the situation we're in, given the way we've think it does have potential to sound like a policy move to people inside saying, well, the federal funds rate range has not changed anything different.  The bottom line is that I am worried about Because of that, I don't think you want to do this unless it's absolutely per intermeeting period is okay So, I think decided to do this.

it might be premature to decide on this around the time of liftoff, if necessary. with me.  I would agree with President Rosengren that today.  You could make the delegation decision later around the Federal Reserve will who is the federal funds rate target and that the Chairman could make that adjustment during consulting the Committee.  And the Chairman at that time made a to move at the meeting.'  This was extremely hot and divisive on the to get into any kind of situation like that, and I not your intention, but it is a bit of a slippery slope:  What's going to be delegated? much have you agreed to?  Under what circumstances?  It is a very on this Committee that has been problematic Let me finish with one story that old-timers here remember from the early 1990s.  I am going to mention 'He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named,' former Chairman Alan Greenspan.  At the time, it was considered that the Chairman had 25 basis points on an intermeeting period without bunch of those moves and then came into the meeting and said, 'Now that I've made the move, now we don't have Committee in the early 1990s.  We don't want know that's Who's agreed to it?  How tricky issue, and it has been a situation in the past from a collegiality perspective.

I think it is a bit of a issue about what rates really matter versus what rates we are when it didn't go so well.  Thank I know we're not really thinking about anything like that, but slippery slope.  You've got this calling the policy rate, and you've got this precedent in the past you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

I'm comfortable approach in the first two weeks of scheduling daily staff briefings, but I quickly work out whether we need them every day and we can probably unschedule them within a day or two.  So I think there's

April 28-29, 2015

adjustments in the IOER or ON don't know about previous Chairmen.  I've only had one Chair in my life on the Chair is that if there is going to be any question about a need perfectly willing to give the Chair an agree that we need to specify that the discretion would be With regard to the governance approach for technical RRP rates, I Board, and my experience with that for discussion, she will call for it.  I haven't detected her trying to get around the FOMC or the Board, and I think we can rely on that.  So I'd be adjustment up to 10 basis points.  I granted between meetings.

ON RRP and IOER We may find reasons why we need to move one without moving the I'm not sure about the wisdom of constraining the gap between the rates to 25 basis points. other, and my general approach is, don't constrain yourself if there's no need to constrain yourself, because the law of unintended consequences is very powerful.

rate, I agree with those who think we should try to minimize the make at the time of liftoff, and that this issue is sufficiently important attention than their size would imply.  I'm not sure why rate, and we'd need to look at what would happen when we raise the rate. Thank you, Madam Chair. On the primary credit number of adjustments we for banks to which we give a lot more we would want to start by raising the cost of borrowing by 50 basis points for the smaller banks who do borrow at that And so, for both reasons, I favor examining that after liftoff.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

I'm very well aligned with the original comments and additional comments and response Lockhart's points, and with many others around the table as think it is fine to schedule them, and if we have them I'll attend As for the briefings, I them, but I think the only case in which we would actually want to have them is if things are

And I don't expect that that is taken the cap off the overnight RRP or, for that is concerned, if the test is adjustments that are routine or technical in Chair's instincts on that.  I will say that if what we're dealing with I don't think, in real time, that's going to feel either involved in the ON RRP rates at 25 basis points.  It might make sense to do something different, real time.  So, for all of that, I think it's essentially impossible to anticipate all of these As far as delegation nature, I completely trust the is a very difficult and failed liftoff situation, routine or technical.  I think it's going to feel like something that all of us ought to be and accountable for.  I also would not constrain ourselves by holding this space between the IOER and again, in things, and I would just say that I will do what is reasonable at the time.

it is an interesting subject on which we can have a In my view, it's just not a complication now. In terms of the primary credit facility, lot of debate.  I wouldn't touch it until well after liftoff. that we, in my view, need to be taking on right Thank you, Madam Chair.

I think it's very responsibility for actively being engaged in monetary control and the relative roles of the IOER and the ON rates in maintaining the federal funds rate in the target range for some initial period.  The is that if the decision to a press conference, as seems very likely, I would that period of active involvement to span that quarter-end, but beyond that, I think it too prescriptive at this point. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support important for us as Committee members to take assessing the effectiveness of RRP length of that period, I think, should be determined by events.  My guess lift off is made coincident with a meeting with expect would be unwise to be

I think the judges that the frequent briefings and meetings no their purpose, along with the parameters of the delegation.  It's very important that we activity of the our communications bolster When market functioning has settled down, it will be appropriate to delegate to the Chair the authority possibly to the spread between them, in order to Committee can make that decision once it long serve carefully manage communications regarding the heightened vigilance and possible Committee and the Board during those initial weeks so that confidence in the normalization process and contribute to smooth market functioning.

But like many others around would want to put some distance between the timing of liftoff and the timing of not to further complicate our already challenging With regard to the appropriate level of the primary credit spread, I would be open to a recommendation from the the table, I possibly changing that spread so as communications around the time of liftoff.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  I think this has been a very useful discussion.  Let me ready to go on to item 3, and I suggest we have and then we'll take a coffee break before going into our round.

The data on spending, production, and hiring that we received since than we expected.  On the spending side, the February PCE data and March retail sales report led us to make a sizable reduction PCE growth.  This downward revision to consumer spending accounts for the downward revision to first-quarter real GDP growth shown in panel forecast summary exhibit.  In addition, a number of other categories of spendingparticularly to the downside in recent would note that after

For the most part, we have former interpretation.  Accordingly, our projection calls for near-term real GDP growth to return to a pace that particular, although it is several transitory special factors-including unusually severe winter weather and production disruptions related to labor disputes at drag on first-quarter GDP growth will be held down a bit estimates of state and local construction spending and by a distortion in the BEA's translation of retail sales to PCE associated with the steep decline in gasoline prices and the increased share of gasoline sales at large retail establishments such as WalMart.

Specifically, we trimmed our estimate of consumption growth in the second quarter a bit made a noticeable downward revision to our projection of near-term residential construction activity in response to the lack of a permits in spending, as the latest data on drilling activity suggest that the recent drop in oil prices previously anticipated.

In the establishment survey, March total nonfarm payroll employment growth was considerably weaker than the very strong pace expected.  Incorporating revisions to previous months, the payroll employment over the first quarter now stands at about 70,000 less than we had written down in the March Tealbook.  The news from the household survey also came in a little weaker than we had anticipated:  The unemployment rate held steady at 5.5 percent down one-tenth-while edged lower.

With the level of real GDP at the end of the medium term change to our supply-side assumptions this expected to be in the March Tealbook and one-tenth below our estimate of its natural rate.  The slow pace of decline in the unemployment rate growth projected over the medium term and our assumption that the labor market will draw more individuals back that little revised.  As in previous Tealbooks, we expect that will gradually move higher as resource slack diminishes, energy prices rise, Panels 5 and 6 summarize the inflation outlook.  The incoming data on price inflation have been a touch above our expectations and support our projection both total and core inflation will step up in the second quarter.  Further out, the inflation projection is inflation and prices for imported goods turn up again.

The new intervals more asymmetry, which is most noticeable in the prediction interval miss big on unemployment, it than expected, on this new methodology were presented in a box appendix in the Risks and Uncertainty section of the uncertainty measures in future Tealbooks.  I would note that the bands shown in my exhibit today continue to use the FRB/US measures, to eventually extend the new methodology to compute confidence around our quarterly forecasts as well.  Steve will continue our presentation. Finally, I wanted to call characterize forecast uncertainty the methodology that we use to compute confidence intervals projection errors and have also reworked our presentation of these intervals to include a comparison with the historical are typically a little wider than the ones we reported previously, and they tend to show surrounding the unemployment forecast.

While the pace of economic activity abroad remains quite unsettled, two key external drivers of U.S. economic prospects have been a bit more quiescent of late. First, oil markets have not yielded any big surprises.  To be sure, spot prices, shown in panel 5, are up more than $8 per barrel since the time of the March Tealbook, as falling rig counts and other signs of lower U.S. oil production.  However, prices for futures contracts further curve are up by less, so that our projected path for Brent prices has been raised just bit and last July, the dollar has come down over the shown in panel 6.  This depreciation likely reflected weak fall in expected policy rates here in the United States.  However, I would to remind you that, starting with the March Tealbook, we decided to deviate from a further rise in the dollar.

Well, the simulations come from a DSGE model, but it's not an estimated SIGMA long-term work agenda. MR. KAMIN. model.  So we don't compute those, although I assure you that an estimated version of that would allow us to compute those is on our something might be a 1 in 10 chance of for a couple of years.  So that, The most tenuous thing is whether or not you will actually get a 10 percent additional rise in the dollar.  As you can tell from the chart, that's not a common occurrence.  That's that, broadly speaking, we think there in some sense, is the most tenuous.

effects on net exports and then on U.S. real GDP, that's little bit more straightforward in the sense that the results from SIGMA-particularly the net export contribution-are broadly consistent with our effect of a higher to huge errors. In terms of thinking about the actually a for what I'm showing here, which is estimated trade models, and those don't give you very different results.  So the dollar on exports and on imports is relatively straightforward, and obviously there are errors, but they're probably not subject larger area of uncertainty comes in when translating the effect of the change in net A exports into GDP, because there is some uncertainty there about the multipliers.  And there's

April 28-29, 2015

impact that has.  So, for the net export contribution itself, I would guess that, relatively to real GDP growth. also some uncertainty about to what extent you want to build in a monetary policy response and what speaking, is not a huge confidence error.  The confidence errors would rise as you then translate that through me follow up with a slightly different question.  Over the past have learned how to handle global currency changes, should we be MR. BULLARD.   Let 25 years, firms have become more globalized and fluctuations.  They adopt hedging strategies, and they put production in various countries and switch production in response to currency movements.  In light of those estimating effects of real exchange rate movements using data for the 1980s and 1990s?

Well, that's an excellent question.  Let's just say we periodically do revise There are factors that, of course, are naturally parsed in.  They kind of correlate with what you U.S. economy has grown, and that is in our estimations because our models do incorporate the fact that, as the larger effect on GDP. MR. KAMIN. our import equations, and we do look for signs of parameter instability.  So we're alert to that issue, and we haven't found any strong evidence of these changes in coefficients. other mentioned, which is that, over time, the share of trade in the fully taken into account dollar changes exports and imports, those have a

CHAIR YELLEN.  Thanks.  Any other questions?  President Evans.

question for Bill Wascher related to the Tealbook the inflation outlook is are going to be going up, resource slack maybe imported goods prices-I can't recall the entire list.  Could you MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  I have a inflation outlook.  I think in your presentation you mentioned that trending up because-I think you said-energy prices will be diminishing, and

April 28-29, 2015

that increase in inflation? refresh my memory on the contribution of changes in longer-term inflation expectations for delivering

WASCHER.  So, over the medium-term forecast, our view is that the underlying serves as an attractor for the inflation rate. MR. rate of inflation is 1.8 percent, and that

MR. EVANS.  Inflation expectations, is that- in some sense you may think Over the longer run, that drifts up to in the labor is pushing inflation up.  So it does serve as an attractor, as one reason inflation moves and toward 2 percent in the longer run.  But, in important in getting there over the medium term. MR. WASCHER.  Yes.  We call it underlying inflation, but of it as inflation expectations over the medium term. 2 percent because the FOMC says the target is 2 percent, and because tightness market back up toward 1.8 percent in the medium term addition, these other factors are

mid-2000s.  I project that, and I think that's why the solid line, the median, is above the data MR. WASCHER.  That's largely because of the energy price run-up in the think we didn't there.

MS. MESTER.  But even the distribution looks like- we calculate standard errors around for PCE inflation, for two long way, and two is, we think that this is a which inflation had different properties-it was more stable recently than in previous think the influence of energy prices is more prominent here than it run. MR. WASCHER.  Yes.  Again, I think that's because of the energy price shock.  This is a relatively short sample with which reasons.  One is, we don't have data going back a period over periods.  So, because of that, I might be in the longer

projected paths are virtually on top of each other, total is being influenced by the run-up in energy prices MR. ENGEN.  If I could add just one thing that amplifies that point, if you look in the middle right at core PCE, the median and the which is another way of showing that the and how it feeds into total inflation.

When I talk to asset managers in biggest concern raised is the problem of liquidity in the secondary market for concern probably deserve greater MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Boston, the corporate bonds.  They worry that when we begin to raise rates, a rush to sell positions in corporate bonds will occur, and a crowded exit with few buyers could lead to a rapid increase in the yield on corporate bonds.  At least some elements of this attention.

the average size of trades in corporate bonds has fallen significantly relative to the First, average size of trades prior to the financial crisis.  This may reflect an actual or perceived

This raises the that if a significant portfolio rebalancing were to occur, it may be difficult to sell large a timely manner. difficulty in concern positions in significant decline in the corporate bond holdings of brokerSEC's FOCUS reports, while J.P. Morgan held $29.5 billion in in 2007, those holdings had plummeted to only $11.3 billion by the end of $30 billion in corporate securities in 2007, and their holdings corporate securities concern about potential market. Second, there has been a dealers.  According to the corporate securities 2014.  Similarly, Credit Suisse held collapsed to only $4.4 billion by the end of 2014.

Third, bond mutual stability-and bond exchange-traded funds have grown significantly since the financial crisis.

By the end of February this year, assets under management at soared to $320 billion.  If investors assume that the corporate bond market is liquid and, more specifically, that their sell liquidity as we approach liftoff bonds is likely to be highly sensitive to the to the timing of tightening.

Indeed, it appears main financial-instability consideration for monetary policy at the moment is that a nearcould lead to financial instability.

Specifically, page 4 of the assessment notes that changes in Treasury market could amplify the effects of an initial rate move and lead to sudden swings in prices mitigate this risk?  President Rosengren, I think, highlighted one a slightly different on the answer to this question.  To answer this question, I think we have to in response to a small increase in shortAnd here I believe that a key consideration is the policy signal associated with such a near term.  Raising the federal funds rate in the near term would mean they're when inflation is far below target and the growth outlook has been weakening. that the FOMC is considerably less willing to As a result, they would expect less accommodation in general but especially so in bad rates and lower bond prices in bad times translates premiums.

I'm going to pick up on the same topic that President introduced and President Kocherlakota discussed.  However, I will not be on monetary policy at this time.

the choice of an inflation target was largely based on research both here and abroad, likelihood of reaching the zero lower bound and the cost of being at the zero at the lower bound once In part, this optimistic read could have been based on faith experience of the past major developed countries are at the zero lower has yet exited, even though we are more than six years past the financial crisis.  In short, the research on the expected cost of zero lower bound has not been consistent with the economic outcomes we have First, indicating that the lower bound was small.  This research suggested a relatively low probability of reaching the zero lower bound, typically below 5 percent, and relatively brief spells reached, usually a couple of quarters. in the efficiency of alternative monetary policy tools.  However, the decade has been less favorable.  Today most bound, and, despite employing alternative policy tools, none now hitting the observed.

The most obvious example is the lowering of the equilibrium in the equilibrium federal funds rate rate of more than 50 basis this assessment is echoed among private forecasters and market participants.  If one target is to reduce the frequency of hitting the probability.  On a practical note, the fact that Japan, the United Kingdom, Europe, convergence to a value of 2 percent for the Second, we have revised our assessment of variables that should affect hitting the federal funds rate.  With the same inflation target, a decline should increase the probability of hitting the zero lower bound.  The most recent SEP submissions, for example, report a decline in the equilibrium real points, and of the rationales for setting a positive inflation zero lower bound, a lower equilibrium real rate implies the need for a higher inflation target to reduce this and the United States have each hit the zero lower bound and have remained there for a very long time should make us wonder whether the global inflation target was misguided.

Third, we have learned more about the cost of being at than six years, we have still not returned to the 5 to 5.2 percent unemployment rate range that SEP central While the new tools of quantitative easing-purchasing mortgage-backed securities and lengthening the maturity of our holdings-have resulted in growth faster than we otherwise would have experienced, we have missed both elements of our mandate for more than six years now.

like to ask President Rosengren a question.  You the only margin for adjustment is on the inflation target rate.  Presumably there why we are in this position is because we had a really, really bad financial crisis.  So, to make the probability of a financial crisis lower, and that VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I would are implying that is another margin for adjustment, taking a lot of steps to make a future financial crisis of the type that we experienced in 2007, 2008, and 2009 less likely, right?  Because you could argue that one reason in principle, one could take steps would presumably lessen the need to change the inflation target.  How do you think about that?

you think you can significantly change the probability or MR. ROSENGREN.  If amplitude of those shocks, then you are right.  But the equilibrium federal funds rate has come

April 28-29, 2015

a bit.  Our own internal estimates of what that implies for how frequently we will hit it is substantially higher given that most of the time the equilibrium lower than 3Â½ percent.  So if an equilibrium federal funds rate that is lower, the implication is that you hit the zero more frequently unless you think you can dramatically alter either the frequency or down quite the zero lower bound are that federal funds rate that many of those models were estimated on was 4Â½ percent.  We are now at 3Â½ percent-I actually think you could make an argument that it is you have lower bound severity of having the kind of shocks that we experienced.

The first is, should we be taking from the market-implied measures of inflation compensation? empirical relationship between wage growth and inflation? economy still operating below potential and facing temporary disinflationary factors.  Important questions remain.  In the remainder of what signal And, second, what's the in inflation of late would be a lot more troublesome to me if it was also decline in inflation expectations.

But I want to mention another finding in our work about inflation compensation, and that is that these one- and twoare very highly correlated with recent past inflation, puts into question It is a very similar result that we've found in the past when we looked at movements, and for this reason we have caution when trying to interpret of people's views on future inflation.

And, as a firm's there to be a pretty tight relationship between nominal wage growth and, basically, if you look back at the history of the relationship wage growth and price inflation.  The consistent finding through this literature is that really hard to find any relationship between nominal wage growth and future price inflation.

many times before.  Today I want to articulate three additional reasons the data lead raising rates.  First, forecasting inflation is inherently discussion that we were just having.  This implies a high burden of proof a reasonable period of time.  Second, despite near-zero nominal rates and a large that accommodative to begin Now, I want to spend some time today talking about why this outlook leads me to favor a whites-of-their-eyes approach for our policy response to rising inflation.  I have talked about risk management me to prefer a cautious approach to difficult, and that's the to say we are sufficiently confident that our currently low core inflation will move back to 2 percent in balance sheet, I am not convinced our current policy stance is all with.  And, third, I actually see benefits to risking a modest overshooting of our 2 percent inflation target.

with why it should take strong evidence to have confidence in an outlook of this area are limited.  Indeed, there a rapid change in inflation, and they always imply substantial Most of the commentary I hear at this table centers on the upward gravitational pull of high and I also suspect that simple mean Let me start low inflation rising back to 2 percent.  Anyone who has looked at the forecasting performance of statistical inflation models knows that everyone's abilities in is a body of research that shows it is not that easy to be a random walk forecast.  Even the bestperforming models seldom forecast forecast uncertainty.  That said, we do have many analytical reasons to think our current low inflation will rise at some point. economy regaining traction, resource gaps closing, and the stable inflation expectations, like in the Tealbook forecast.

in these forecasts as well.  I agree that these forces will question is, when?  Taking until 2019 to reach our target is not me. reversion probably plays a role eventually deliver.  The acceptable to these difficulties in forecasting inflation, my own preferred dashboard of is mostly a list of factors coincident with rising inflation.  While measures of labor it is possible something has of the economy that makes those historical benchmarks less trustworthy. continue to look for increasing core inflation, faster wage growth, and firmer of inflation compensation to provide corroborating evidence of stronger As I said, the absence of statistically strong leading indicators suggests these observations are likely to be more coincident than predictive.  But at least once we see that inflation is moving up persistently.  Until then, I remain Given all of indicators market slack are important, I would not rely on them alone, as changed in the structure In addition, I will market-based measures inflationary pressures. that them, we can have more confidence wary.

not as accommodative as we might thinkanalysis.  A fundamental benchmark for thinking about the level of real rate of equilibrium, or Wicksellian, real rate of interest.  As Milton Friedman said, low rates alone do not mean monetary policy is accommodative.  The relevant question is real federal funds rate is far enough below the rate to achieve our policy objectives in a reasonable amount of time-that is, for Now, my second point-that current policy is comes out of the model monetary accommodation and inflation pressures is the difference between the actual interest and the interest whether, after adjusting for inflation, our current equilibrium real inflation to actually get up to 2 percent, as the forecasts embody.

the answer to that question is 'no.'  There are a number of simple observations low.  Namely, even with our interest rate I think that suggest that the current equilibrium rate is quite

Book B, as is negative 0.1 percent.  Some might look at the current real funds the output gap in 12 quarters.  It says nothing about inflation.  In the Tealbook 2019.  That would mean that inflation would have and, to me, that is simply too long to be considered result of appropriate policy. To put a number out, the Tealbook-consistent equilibrium real rate shown in circulated over the weekend, rate of minus 1.18 percent, as reported in the Tealbook, Book B, and say we have adequate accommodation in place.  I don't agree.  Recall that the Tealbook's equilibrium real rate is calibrated to close baseline, the inflation gap is still with us until to run below target for more than a decade the referred to the fact that PCE inflation rose to 2 inflation is that core is a better indicator of what inflation is likely to be next year, shocks in headline PCE often are transitory.  The real test, I would say, is, when did 2 percent or above?  I think that been the case for quite some time. I want to mention that President Bullard percent in 2011 and 2012 on the strength of commodity price increases.  I think the reason we focus on core because the the Tealbook ever forecast inflation two years out as being at has not

all lament the fact that there are large uncertainties regarding the value of of interest, uncertainty over inflation forecasting and the stance of the equilibrium rate has a over inflation itself.  In other words, how can we declare we are confident that While we can the equilibrium real rate monetary policy accommodation go hand in hand.  Logically, because strong bearing on the inflation outlook, uncertainty over it ought to translate into comparable uncertainty

April 28-29, 2015

our policy the equilibrium real rate is able to return inflation to target? current low inflation is headed back up to 2 percent unless we are also confident that setting relative to me to the third reason my outlook is premised on a whites-of-their-eyes inflation to modestly overshoot 2 percent sometime down the road.  But so what?  Is could be a benefit.  Considering how long inflation symmetric inflation objective.  If we find at 1 percent or a little bit above that while inflation is still regret the conservative credibility that we've built up. This brings policy approach.  I recognize that the usual policy lags might mean that a delay in tightening could cause that such a big cost?  No.  On the contrary, it has been below target, adopting a policy that allows the possibility of such an overshoot actually seems necessary to support the credibility of our ourselves with the federal funds rate too low, we could easily

say that if we are not willing to allow an overshoot of our inflation objective, think we should definitely be having the conversation that President Rosengren was appropriateness of the level of the inflation objective, if it is with any reasonability.  I think that's important. I would also then I suggesting we have in terms of the something that we are not allowed to overshoot Thank you, Madam Chair.

This suggests that, on balance, there will be no sustained 2000 expansion.  On both of those occasions, low 4 percent range. The second issue is unemployment projections balancing out forecast horizon despite easy monetary policy, by conventional definition.  I do not think that such a forecast is credible, and I continue to disagree with assumption behind it.  A key paper in the Brookings Papers -by Aaronson and others, published according to demographic factors since 2000, and, furthermore, that this downward trend will continue upward improvement in labor force participation and, therefore, that unemployment will continue to drop into the 4Â½ to 4 percent range over the forecast horizon, barring any major disruption in the U.S. economy.  This dynamic would be very similar to what was observed during the 1990s expansion and again during the unemployment moved into the increases in labor force relied, in part, on this story and have also been wrong.

These reports suggest that it's quite reasonable to rebound in growth in Q2. More broadly, commentary from our directors more positive this month than last, and we've heard numerous reports about transitory factors having affected recent activity.  An executive at an engineering firm in West Virginia said 'weather has been the primary factor in our business slowdown.' production slowdowns attributable to the West Coast port strike.  For example, a manufacturer of industrial safety products stated that of just one critical part expect a these days turns quickly to the subject of noticeable effects. to a lack of drivers.  We also continue to hear about markets to have broadened of late.  This was most apparent in the reports from regional representative from Manpower.  One large staffing firm is all skill levels' later this year.  Two grocers in response to WalAs usual, any discussion of labor markets shortages of skilled workers.  It does seem as if these shortages are having For example, the CEO of a large building materials company told of a trucking company refusing outgoing shipments due experiencing wage pressures, and, while not universal at this point, the scope of these observations appears representatives of several staffing firms, both national and regional, who serve on our roundtables, including a telling clients to expect upward wage pressure 'in Richmond recently announced double-digit starting-wage increases, perhaps in

A that broader wage pressures may be about to Mart's announcement.  A large auto workers at lumber company in West Virginia has responded to a shortage by bringing in entry-level workers from Puerto Rico, renting houses for them, and hiring an interpreter, all of which raise the cost of labor by 10 to 15 percent.  These reports suggest emerge, although I recognize that wage acceleration is not yet apparent in the monthly figures for average hourly earnings.

I said, we've clearly hit a soft patch recently.  Some large part, if not all, of the first-quarter slowdown.  Moreover, this wouldn't quarter we've seen during this expansion.  So the question from here as the effect of these transitory factors I share this Tealbook's optimism on consumer spending, and that's based on robust last month was an important piece of evidence that to boost spending in the months ahead. Turning to the national economy, as of that softness was due to well-known temporary factors.  Combined, these transitory factors could well explain a be, as many have noted, the first flat is how rapidly economic activity picks up again fade. income growth, solid consumer sentiment readings, and continued improvement in labor market conditions.  The rebound in car sales consumers have the confidence at an annual rate from December to March.  The staff's translation is 1.4 percent over the same three months, and that implies that Q4 will on headline inflation Thus, it seems fairly clear to me that we are emerging from this inflation dip, and in coming quarters. Turning to inflation, the latest readings have been a bit firmer than expected.  Core CPI inflation averaged 2.3 percent into core PCE inflation be the low point for core PCE inflation.  Oil prices appear to have bottomed out and the run-up in the dollar seems to have lost steam, so the transitory downward pressures are waning. inflation will be moving towards 2 percent

If so, I believe the case for would be strong, so it seems premature to make any statements at this meeting or in immediately ahead, I believe, that could be interpreted as taking June off the table. Looking ahead, as several of you have mentioned, we will receive more than the usual amount of data over the reports and two reports on personal the Tealbook forecast, we would have solid evidence in hand at our June spending growth had rebounded and that raising rates the days Thank you.

Weather effects and the sharp decline in energy investment look to be important factors holding down first-quarter growth.  However, more persistent factors producing softer export growth and a broader slowing in new investment bear watching.  Alternatively, personal consumption appears spending from lower gasoline prices.

Overall, I expect average 260,000 per month last year to settling down to a pace of around 150,000 next year as the labor market March's payroll numbers were clearly below expectations, though the labor market continues to first quarter better than the 134,000 average in the first quarter monthly payroll growth to drift down from the rapid pace of 200,000 this year before continues to tighten and growth moves to its trend level.

want to say something about the prediction issue.  It's absolutely true, I think, that if races of the kind that President Williams talked about, market-based measures fare that well.  I think it's actually because they're of value to policymakers, not just interested in trying to mitigate monitoring I you do horse don't really to statistical forecasters, because we're interested in a different loss function.  We're not interested in just minimizing mean squared error, we're actually low inflation, especially when it's going to be costly to households.  And I think that these market-based measures of inflation expectations is helpful along those lines.

This builds on some of the remarks that President lower inflation expectations translate to lower nominal translate into little recession-fighting capacity for the it in the neutral real rate noted by President Rosengren.

As I noted in my comments at the March that the productivity growth trend would remain extraordinarily poor, it seemed either GDP growth to pick up or payroll growth to slow down.  As it turns Turning first to the growth side, it strikes me that there now, and it's really difficult in March should not be FOMC meeting, a big gap had opened up between payroll growth and GDP growth, so unless one thought reasonable to expect

Richard Fisher believe it was-at that time he thought that employment growth in Texas, with the country, would slow down to the national pretty sizable for Texas.  And it's interesting in payroll.  So, clearly, the fall in oil effect.  It's rippling through to incomes, and it's construction, so I think it actually has a more sizable become more exposed to the current investment to continue.  As Helen Holcomb pointed out economy, the effect does seem to be quite a bit said-in January, I which was well above average compared average.  But if you look at the payroll data in March for states on a seasonally adjusted basis, payrolls in Texas fell by 25,400 people, which is that Oklahoma was the state with the second-largest decline and gas investment is having a significant rippling through into commercial real estate effect than just looking at oil and gas investment itself.

They are almost all of these crosscurrents, I think the next few and May data, I'm not really sure what to make of it-is this just a new trend? Third, I looks to me like they have been drifting up, and if you look at quarter-well, we'll see what's sustainable over the medium term.  So if you had to ask yourself, 'Are inventories going to contribute positively to growth or certain to be a drag on growth.  In the face of months of data are really important.

If the three-month change in the core CPI, it's now above 2 percent compared with a inflation data and all the that inflation-despite a stronger dollar, lower energy prices, and still-sizable slack in market-actually seems to be stabilizing.  So let you look at 12-month change of 1.8 percent.  Inflation compensation, as measured by the five-by-five forward TIPS versus nominal Treasury has moved up a bit.  Survey measures of inflation expectations are generally stable, and I would argue that wage compensation growth trends are stable to slightly higher.

I had of inflation getting unanchored to the downside seem to have wage growth and cause inflation expectations to be anchored to the downside.  And the haven't seen that at this point, I think, makes that dynamic much less likely.  So I'm So the fears diminished.  I could imagine that things could have worked out quite differently.  We'd have lower headline inflation feeding through into core inflation.  That, in turn, would depress nominal fact that we much more confident now that inflation will return to our 2 percent objective, subject to having sufficient growth to continue to close the output gap.

According to Board staff estimates in the Tealbook, increases in the dollar, which are very unlikely to persist indefinitely, are holding down that figure by 0.3 percentage point this year, bringing what nontransitory core inflation to something like 1.6 percent.  And current energy price reducing core inflation by another 0.1 percentage point, which brings you to a nontransitory core inflation rate of 1.7 percent.

We only need them to abate.  And labor market slack will continue putting inflation on a path that, over the medium term, will take us very close to our inflation target.  Thank you.

I certainly hope that it was an aberration, and an aberration.  And I don't think, personally, that we're going to learn much because we had a really low number in the first quarter of 2014, and that didn't mean very much a quarter or two later. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  A lot of people have talked about Q1 and have posed the question, 'Was Q1 an aberration?' I expect that it has been that much from the GDP number tomorrow morning.  If it's kind of low or really low, it may not tell us very seem to

but more the that was implicit in some of Vice Chairman Dudley's analysis a minute ago:  'Are there growth path for the rest of the year that's Not that it will in little bit Dudley suggested one in his presentation. explanation of that phenomenon, should it occur, is the one that I think lies alternative scenario of a persistent slowdown-that is, that there is a kind inhibiting consumer spending despite the extended improvement in I actually think the question is not so much 'Was Q1 an aberration?' question things at work in the economy that will give us a somewhat lower than what many of us expected toward the end of last year?' any way resemble Q1, but that somehow there are forces that are restraining growth a more than we would have anticipated.  Vice Chairman Another possible behind the Tealbook's of confidence problem that's income fundamentals because of job growth and maybe a little bit of wage growth, as well.

that reason one has to be a little agnostic right now in awaiting data over the couple of months-as President Mester, Vice Chairman Dudley, and several other people think it was Vice Chairman Dudley-also said, even then, much some of the questions we've been asking will be clarified because of snapback.  So instead of trying to speculate about all of little bit more detail something Simon had an exhibit on in the beginning of this meeting and that is the phenomenon of negative interest its potential effects on financial markets downside risks, and-and I'm not going to talk about this, but it may be to the great debate about secular stagnation. I think for next have said.  Although, as someone-I it's not clear how there's going to be a certain degree that, I wanted to put on the table in a his presentation at rates on European sovereign debt.  This phenomenon may be relevant to an assessment of the most likely medium-term U.S. growth trend because of and the dollar, potential relevant

European sovereign debt for seen a qualitative change in the There have been negative interest rates on some shorter-term several years now, but the last six months or so have

And so, as far as Thomas phenomenon in a number of respects.  First, negative rates have moved down along the yield curve in European countries with the strongest credit that Simon distributed, we now see negative interest rates debt in the stronger European sovereigns.  Second, yield curves, as he mentioned, are quite flat in these countries.  I government bonds is about 40 basis points.  That for U.S. Treasury securities.  The 30-year which is a pretty low number for a 30-year.  As everybody knows, the Swiss 10-year sovereign issue earlier that any sovereign debt Jordan knew, he was setting a precedent, or at least his country's government was setting a precedent.

As recently as two weeks ago, I think, it was up over There's been a little bit of an interest rate change since then, which has affected the notably Denmark and Switzerland, also are priced at negative rates, and some also priced at negative Currently, as Simon's chart shows, more than 35 percent of all euro-zone government debt carries a negative interest rate. 40 percent. yields in some of those medium-term tenors.  Substantial portions of some non-euro-zone sovereigns, shorter-duration corporate bonds of the highly rated European firms are rates now.

this is all related to long-standing European economic problems-and, more scarcity of sovereign debt instruments issued by countries like Germany tight fiscal policies and large current account surpluses, notwithstanding Clearly, immediately, first the prospect and now the reality of the ECB's QE program.  It's also related, I guess, to the relative that continue to run

April 28-29, 2015

in the euro zone more generally.  The unprecedented nature of this most thoughtful analysts to offer only tentative views of the relative stories that explain why investors would hold longer-term sovereigns with categories.  First is gloom the long-term prospects for the countries in question.  Now, it's true, there's not a whole this as a dominant explanation-that is, the idea that there's going to be negative economic conditions phenomenon has caused importance of various negative yields.  Logically, I think the explanations fall into three about lot of high optimism to be found about European growth prospects, but almost everybody discounts growth or deflation for 10 years in Europe.

inertia, basically-whether institutions, which may be required by law unforced, as in the case of this negative rate stuff means and are what happens, and maybe change their investment decision if things The second group of explanations are based on investor forced, as in the case of pension funds and some other or regulation to hold certain percentages of extremely low-risk bonds, or of other investors who are themselves unsure of what all waiting right now to see don't turn around relatively soon.

a lot of may territory, or you may get exchange rate currencies or from appreciations of currencies with very low inflation or even deflation.  That is, if you inflation in the United States, you took note of one analyst's advice to his clients that the best play may be in bonds with a The third set of explanations is that, in an environment that doesn't offer appealing investment options, there may be some plays available here.  For example, you get capital gains if yields go even further into negative gains whether from short-term developments that cause quick swings in longer-term think that there's going to be very low inflation in Switzerland for a long time to come and you are a U.S. investor, and you think that there's going to be might actually end up profiting by that play.  As an example of this search for an investment play, I

good bit of convexity so as to maximize the chances of catching the wave of large market movements when these trends reverse.

New York MarketSource report is the point at which Herb Stein's memorable aphorism comes to mind, because prospects for Europe are a lot worse than most people think, there's a reversal of negative rates at some point.  Even if there's no near-term reversal start elsewhere. To date, as a very good Federal Reserve Bank of indicated, there have been relatively few discontinuities observed in European debt markets.  But I think this unless the medium-term going to be resulting from sufficiently enhanced growth prospects or from sufficiently significant policy moves, a nontrivial number of investors might, over time, overcome their inertia and seeking positive nominal yields of potentially greater concern.  For example, if enough investors were caught flatwould have to ask ourselves how much the financial turmoil even greater the negative rates any longer.  The the existence of modest retracing by halted and reversed pretty significantly. There are a lot of potential outcomes here, some of which are relatively benign.  Others, though, are footed by an unexpected change in ECB policy-and, paradoxically, an unexpected improvement in European economic prospects-there could be some pretty significant turmoil in relevant markets, although there we would be offset by the prospect of improvement in the real economy.  I think of concern to us would be a decision by those investors who did not initially move out of European sovereign debt that they couldn't take the uncertainty or natural destination for these investors is, of course, U.S. Treasury securities, and I think that some of the dollar strengthening we've seen this year has been attributable to investors who have already made such a move.  And it is possible, though very hard to judge how likely, that many more could follow.  If they were to do so, the recent the dollar could itself be

April 28-29, 2015

possibility, it's worth mentioning that, notwithstanding the notable spreads bunds and Treasury securities, some European investors have apparently concluded that bond rates is to compensate for currency-hedging costs and other risks.  And this calculus is, I may be contributing to some of the otherwise-hard-to-explain changes in the yield movement in those yield curves, which I take to be everybody to be right now.  So investors may be are either euro-denominated or effectively tied to the euro. On this last between the roughly 80 basis point difference between German and U.S. two-year insufficient think, what curves of some of the stronger European sovereigns, since fundamentals are not really changing there but you're seeing some repositioning, trying to figure out the best defensive place moving around within bonds that

This is pretty speculative right now, but the past few months, I think this situation is another reason for us not to be in a raise rates, at least not until we've had a chance to see how investors are adapting, and, means for the dollar.  Thank you, Madam Chair. But if that spread between were to widen, either because we raise rates or because QE and other developments in the EU drove yields down even further there, then more European investors might be tempted to take Atlantic plunge.  And this, in turn, could cause some unwelcome certainly in a context in which the trajectory of U.S. economic performance is at least in some question after hurry to most importantly, what their adaptation

that's different from last year, when payroll gains very strong right through the first quarter.  And the question, of course, is how to take.  One reason to discount these data somewhat are the transitory factors that as well as have been discussed.  Another is that GDP data may eventually be revised and is a noisy signal-and I thought that the new exhibit in Tealbook, it makes staff forecast strikes a reasonable balance for the rest of this year not a significant catch-up quarter like we had in the second of 2014. was also much weaker than expected, and continued to be much signal are likely to reverse, including bad winter weather and the West Coast port disruption the technical factors that significantly Book A, on prediction intervals was interesting and useful on that point.  In any case, sense to me to take some signal from this year's weak first quarter, both for labor markets and for GDP.  I think the baseline by assuming higher GDP growth, but quarter

I feel a little better about inflation, which is now to run at about 1Â½ percent for Q2, well above the Q1 readings.  Survey expectations meeting, and liquidity rather than changing expectations.  In light of recent market readings that suggest concerns about low inflation, it's an improvement, levels and less risk of very low inflation.  Of course, we may a return to 2 percent inflation over term, given GDP and labor market outcomes as forecast, continues to make sense to On inflation, I would tentatively say forecast remain stable.

Looking forward, the positive narrative is that consumer spending will levels supported by low energy prices, high confidence, and much better In fact, going back to Stan's basic equation, you could say that the U.S. economy has about 2.7 percent over the last two years, with net exports at around zero.  With net exports now contributing negative 0.7 to negative 0.8 percentage point, you have to ask, where is going to come from housing investment, and it's not going to come which drilling is being significantly reduced.  So it really has to come from consumption.  And, in fact, in growth.  That narrative, I have to say, makes sense to me, but it does flying on one engine.  So far, the combination of the weak spending data and high consumer confidence says that the disappoint.  Another one, world of still-slow growth, a return to stronger growth here could well lead through the dollar a rate tantrum that is really the threat this time.

In short, I am very pleased that we are putting intense focus on this issue, and I think it will turn briefly to the outlook in the United States.  The recent data on the labor have been disappointing.  The key question wrestling with around this table is how much of this unanticipated weakness a slowing in the underlying momentum of activity and how much is due to transitory the negative impulse to U.S. aggregate demand from the combined effects of the plunge in seem to be at least as strong as we had expected, while the Now let me market, aggregate spending, and industrial output that we are represents disturbances?  The preliminary conclusion I would draw from the surprises in the recent data is that oil prices and the surge in the dollar expected positive effects have not materialized so far.

the recent data have been disappointing.  Some of the Turning first to the positive effects, recent shocks were expected to be reflected primarily in stronger consumption growth, but

Indeed, auto sales-among the most reliable of months, suggesting that temporary influences or statistical noise are not fully to possible that the forces boosting consumer spending may not be as might have hoped.  Weaker-than-expected consumption would be very unfortunate, data on that this sector continues to struggle. preliminary indicators of consumer spending are should not indicators-rebounded strongly in March.  Nonetheless, subpar data on retail sales have now persisted for four blame.  On balance, it's strong as we because strength in other categories of aggregate demand remains elusive.  The recent housing starts and permits, for example, suggest prices was expected to curtail business reduce net exports.  A shipments of capital goods, as well as business overall business investment will edge lower year.  A variety of indicators also suggest that the stronger dollar is subtracted 1 percentage point from growth in the minus percentage point in the first On the negative side of the ledger, the drop in oil investment related to drilling, while the dollar's rise was anticipated to broad variety of indicators suggests that these effects are materializing with greater force than had been anticipated.

The national manufacturing purchasing managers' diffusion index of new export orders has been in contractionary territory for the past three months.

It's entirely possible we'll underlying activity that was apparent in the second half of the year promise that aggregate demand will strengthen. creditors remain challenging.  And although the macro data GDP growth looks to have slowed noticeably in the first foreign economic outlook suggests continued weak demand in some of faltering growth in some important emerging limited. Of course, there's see the stronger trend in reassert itself.  But it's important to keep in mind the international context.  On the one hand, we have seen some encouraging data from the euro area-data on retail sales and industrial production, in particular-which holds out some And the dollar's sharp ascent seems to have stalled, at least for now.

Even so, current estimates of both the 3- and 12-month of only 1.4 percent.  And while it's measures, the latter are still materially below the of last year.  The overall picture should suggest at least Let me close by touching briefly on inflation.  Recent data have provided some reassurance further since March, and the very changes in core PCE prices point to an underlying trend rate reassuring that survey-based measures of inflation expectations are remaining stable, and there has been some improvement in market-based levels that prevailed until the middle

As usual, I'll try add a few remarks of and the labor market, everyone agreed that the news has been last meeting, although views differed about its implications.

But, as President Williams implications of movements in wages for inflation and for our criterion of wanting to debatable, and at least in recent look like there's that much of a close link between nominal wages and inflation. business contacts are beginning to hint at a broader acceleration in wage gains and labor market pressures.  That said, many of you noted that wage pressures are confined to particular and sectors, such as high-tech noted, the have reasonable confidence that inflation will move back are years it doesn't remarked on the unexpected weakness we've seen in goods, nonresidential construction, drilling, exports, and industrial morning we receive the first-quarter GDP preliminary for future growth is this point.

The underlying cause of the Q1 slowdown and its implications obviously very important and unclear at from your business contacts, of the importance of bad winter dispute.  A number of you mentioned the fact that we have a pattern here-over many years-of Q1 being unusually weak, suggesting some residual seasonality in the GDP figures.

Some these are welcome developments from an inflation perspective, as they indicate the downward impetus provided by oil and the dollar to inflation is ebbing and shouldn't We had a nice discussion of measures of inflation expectations, with survey measures were last summer.  President Williams's relevance of these inflation expectations to inflation forecasts was noticed that these measures are more heavily influenced by oil prices than, it would seem, is reasonable.

summary of what I heard.  Are there any comments or anyone wants to offer?  [No response]  Then I'd like to offer some comments of my another soft spot, akin to indicators of over the medium term.  I guess if I were updating my SEP forecast now, minimum, I am more worried Okay.  Let me just stop there as a corrections own, then we can quit and go to dinner.  I, of course, was also disappointed in incoming data on employment, spending, and production.  I recognize this may be just what we saw last year and in a number of years past, and I definitely think we should be careful not to overreact to what is a few weeks' worth of news.  I find it reassuring that consumer confidence remain pretty upbeat, and I really haven't altered my modal outlook for employment and output I would mark down projected growth this year, but modestly.  That said, I do find the widespread nature of the recent negative surprises disconcerting, and, at a about downside risk and am more uncertain about the outlook.

slowdown in business investment appears to have become more widespread. In March my concerns focused on the external sector, and now I see question marks pertaining to the underlying strength of domestic aggregate demand as well.  I find it particularly disturbing that the

April 28-29, 2015

March the weakness appeared concentrated in drilling activity, and I think now we are seeing and nondrilling, nonresidential construction as well. that investment in intangibles is still growing at a solid pace, but we sales and output via an accelerator effect, but conceivably other factors may also be at work, and I worry about that. In outright declines in real equipment outlays The Tealbook assumes actually have no idea what's happening there because reliable source data won't be available for some time.  The broad weakness in business fixed investment may be partly explained by the slowdown in aggregate that may prove to be more persistent that we may not see a pickup in residential investment nearly as large faster pace of building.  According to staff calculations, if housing remains weak it Â¼ percentage point or so off the Tealbook projection of real GDP in the second half and in 2016. I'm also concerned as the Tealbook forecasts this year.  Housing starts and permits have been incredibly weak even though mortgage rates are low, employment and income are rising, and demographic trends seem to call for a could shave of this year

retail sales having been soft for several months now.  Savings rates large gains in employment, a the fact that we in March, and consumer sentiment, even though the Conference Board the Tealbook forecast that projects that large.  And as several of you have mentioned, at this point the I worry most about moved up 1 full percentage point since the fourth quarter despite sharp decline in oil prices, record equity prices, a solid increase in house prices, and low borrowing costs.  I suppose one could explain this by saying that bad winter weather and other transitory factors are at work here.  I suppose supporting such an explanation is did see strong auto sales number fell today, is still pretty high.  And I suppose, for those reasons, the Tealbook forecast seems reasonable to me, but I must say my confidence in PCE growth is going to pick up to 4 percent really, to me, is a leap of faith, and I worry that we may not see a pickup that's that

April 28-29, 2015

marks a lot of question marks on the outlook overall. only real source of strength in the economy is consumer spending.  If there are question associated with consumer spending, that puts think the risks from the external sector have diminished.  Maybe they have even some degree.  The staff has marked down estimates of export growth in the first appreciably.  It may well be that the drag generated by past dollar appreciation and slow Greece were to put in place controls on capital movements or, worse, the euro, I think it's hard to know what effect that would have on the dollar.  I'm not sure the dollar to appreciate or depreciate, and I think there are reasonable I don't increased to quarter foreign economic growth could be greater than previously assumed.  I also worry about the Greek debt situation.  If exit whether it would cause stories either way.

We will see, certainly, two more employment reports and a range of soft patch if there's a more significant loss in momentum.  But by June, the spending data for the second incomplete, and we shouldn't underestimate the possibility that new data will clarify our assessments of the state of the economy. I certainly am hopeful that information between now and June will help us resolve some of these uncertainties. indicators on spending and production that could tell us whether we've been through a or quarter will still be confuse rather than little changed.  Both core inflation rates are running well below 2 percent and are likely to do so for the some major surprise in oil prices or a fall in the dollar.  And the April under 1 percent this year on a Q4-over-Q4 basis, As for inflation, I don't really have anything to add to what's been said.  Even though core CPI inflation came in a touch higher than expected, overall, the incoming data on wages and prices has been roughly in line with expectations.  My own outlook is and headline PCE rest of the year, barring Tealbook projects that headline inflation will be

April 28-29, 2015

core inflation this year is only going to run at 1Â¼ percent.  Those forecasts seem quite and that reasonable.

inflation outlook, the likelihood that employment and output will expand at conditions we've set out for a firming of policy will be met I have an open mind.  We've agreed to be data dependent, and that assessment could as we receive additional data on real activity and inflation in coming weeks. Given this only a moderate pace in coming quarters, and uncertainties about the global economy, I personally think it's unlikely that the by June, but certainly change

We may have to make some changes in the statement when we see what's in I think we have enough time tomorrow morning to do that.   We'll begin at 9:00 a.m. So let me stop there.  We should probably break for dinner.  Tomorrow, Thomas will give his briefing. the GDP report, but tomorrow

April 29 Session

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  I guess we should get started, and I'd like first turn to Bill Wascher to give us an update on this morning's GDP announcements. CHAIR to

Product Update.'  You have a table that the first thing I it's nice to be lucky once in a while.  [Laughter]  As you can see growth in the was 0.2 percent at an annual rate.  That's one-tenth of 1 percentage point MR. WASCHER. 6   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll be referring to the handout titled 'Material for Gross Domestic summarizes some of the key aspects of this morning's GDP data, and would say is that from the first line of the table, the BEA's advance estimate of real GDP first quarter higher than our estimate in the April Tealbook.

the first quarter, about as we had expected. labeled here by its official title, nonresidential fixed investment, fell 3.4 percent, and residential investment edged up Among the major spending categories, real PCE growth slowed from 4.4 percent in the fourth quarter to 1.9 percent in Business fixed investment, which is private 1.3 percent.  Again, both of those were close to our expectations.

turned out not to have much than we'd written down.  In terms of their contributions added Â¾ percentage point to that, for these two categories in particular, the BEA does not assumed values for the case, for March. The next three lines show some offsetting misses that effect on the top-line GDP number.  In particular, government spending fell by less than we were expecting, net exports fell by more, and there was a greater accumulation of inventories to growth, net exports were estimated to have subtracted 1Â¼ percentage points from GDP growth in the first quarter, while inventories growth.  I should note have complete data for the first quarter.  In the advance GDP estimate, inventories and net exports are based on two months of data and BEA's third month-in this to look at the monthly assumptions and other details of mentioned to me that his colleagues in the are inclined to discount some of the negative miss and the BEA's estimate.  Going the other way, it might be inclined to discount a little bit of that.  So I don't know that top line.  But I believe our thinking at this point exports aren't quite as weak as the BEA has estimated, and that may not be quite as large. Our staff had a chance both of these components, and Steve Division of International Finance in net exports between their forecast looks as though the BEA wrote down a very high assumption for inventories in March, and we it would have much effect on the would be that net inventories

Are there questions for Bill?  President Bullard. CHAIR YELLEN.

Bill, is the staff embarrassed that you missed this by 50 percent? is a good call, and I think it was useful information tough job, and when you get something right, you should MR. BULLARD. [Laughter]  No, congratulations on this.  This to bring to the Committee.  It's a definitely take some credit for it.

MR. WASCHER.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Okay.  Great.  Then let's turn to Thomas, who is going to brief us on CHAIR our monetary policy decisions.

MR. LAUBACH. 7   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll be referring to the handout labelled 'Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.'

meetings and, indeed, yesterday, several of you discussed the market turbulence in the run-up to, or following, the onset of policy did not have at the start of previous tightening cycles, unexpected path does not shift markedly.  The upper-left panel of your first term premium over the past 25 years.  The vertical bars highlight three moved substantially.  But they also did so at other times-and likely in to factors other than monetary policy. At previous possibility of tightening.  Although the Committee now has communications tools, including the SEP, that it movements in yields and volatility, up or down, may nevertheless occur even if the expected policy rate exhibit provides some perspective by showing the staff's estimate of the 10-year Treasury episodes:  the beginning of the tightening cycles in 1994 and 2004 and the taper tantrum in 2013.  Within the shaded 18-month windows around these events, term premiums response isolates the episodes associated with the three shaded September meeting.  As shown by the red line, in 1994, the term of tightening.  By in to stronger economic data that moved up the expected timing of policy The upper-right panel regions and, for reference, the current episode conditional on the staff's assumption of liftoff at the premium rose substantially in the months following the onset contrast, in 2004, in blue, it moved up several months before the federal funds rate response

apparently reflecting market participants' reassessment of the outlook for movements may, to some extent, have reflected uncertainty about the monetary policy.  The panel shows the width of the 90 percent The term premiums are highly correlated with this proxy for 1994 and 2004 episodes, but less so in 2013, presumably tightening.  But the term premium then began to decline and continued to do so over the remainder of 2004-the well-known 'conundrum' episode.  Finally, in 2013, the term premium began to rise around the time of Chairman Bernanke's JEC testimony in late May, asset purchases and possibly policy rates.  As shown in the middle-left panel, these term premium future course of confidence interval for the federal funds rate 12 months ahead, derived from options on federal funds futures. policy uncertainty in the because uncertainty in that episode was driven less by the path of the federal funds rate over the next 12 months than by the course of asset purchases and longer-term rates.

The magenta line presents the term premium in a scenario, labeled 'Tightening Tantrum,' that is similar less persistent than, the rise in the term premium that began in lower-left panel, in the 'tantrum' case, increase in the federal funds rate for running, on average, 35 basis points the optimal control path associated with the Tealbook baseline (the black line) These experiences suggest that, even in a context communications tools are more extensive than in the 1994 and 2004 cycles, it may be prudent for the Committee to consider its likely response to unexpected changes in term premiums that special exhibit in the 'Monetary Policy Strategies' section of the Tealbook, Book B, provides some background that might be useful.  As shown by the dotted black line the middle-right panel, the staff projects modest pace after the Committee is assumed to start raising the federal funds rate. This slow projected rise in the term premium reflects in part the waning effects on longer-term path for the in magnitude to, albeit May 2013 (the green line).  As shown in the optimal control would call for a more gradual several quarters, with the federal funds rate below over the four years following the shock.

premiums might occur through the effects of the very large asset purchase programs 2004 episode.  In this instance, optimal control would call for a federal funds points higher, on average, over the next four years. Recent public discourse has largely focused on the specter of another market tantrum.  However, a repeat of the 2004 experience, in which term remained surprisingly low for a while, is also a possibility.  For example, such an outcome that are under way in Europe and Japan.  The yellow line in the middle-right panel shows a scenario for the path of the term premium that is similar to the conundrum rate path that is 40 basis lower-right panel highlights a few caveats.  The tantrum scenario abstracts scenarios do not examine movements that are associated with other fell because of weaker economic The from the possibility of widespread liquidity or solvency problems, a point worth mentioning in light of recent commentary about reduced liquidity in key markets, which Simon discussed in his briefing.  More generally, the the consequences of term premium disturbances.  If, for example, the term premium

Finally, the appropriate policy response to either scenario depends importantly on the persistence known only in retrospect.  In response to such scenarios, policymakers may wish to emphasize that they will respond to financial conditions with the achievement of to the excellent work of Bill how to convey the implications of recent and top of exhibit 2, assuming that the Committee decides to remove whether its criteria for liftoff have been met or to be met.  In broad terms, with alternative B, the Committee in place, while alternative C would suggest that those conditions will likely be met in the near future. Turning to the draft policy alternatives, thanks Wascher and his colleagues, I can discuss the alternatives as distributed yesterday.  A key issue for your decision today is incoming economic information for the likely timing of policy normalization.  First, as indicated at the time-based forward guidance from the statement, it will primarily rely on paragraphs 1 and 2 to speak to its assessment of when they are likely would communicate that the conditions for an increase in the federal funds rate are not yet in place in the near future.  Alternative A would indicate that the preconditions for liftoff are unlikely to be

that it that was little changed' over the intermeeting period, the Committee would need to be 'reasonably will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium B updates the description of recent data in paragraph 1 and retains, change in confidence inflation outlook. The second set of bullets summarizes how each of the three alternatives may shape expectations for the timing of liftoff.  On the Committee's criterion would need to see 'further improvement in the labor market,' alternative B states 'underutilization of labor resources citing the moderation in the pace of job gains and the steady unemployment rate. Regarding the second criterion, that confident that inflation term,' alternative in paragraph 2, the expectation that inflation will 'rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium term.'  Thus, alternative B does not signal a about the the Committee noted in the March minutes that the timing of the first either 'in part' or 'at the first-quarter slowdown, the lead to further about how soon the met. In addition, increase in the federal funds rate would also depend on the evolution of economic conditions and the outlook.  In that regard, alternative B provides the judgment that the Committee sees the recent weakness in economic activity least in part' as transitory and indicates that, despite Committee still expects economic growth at a pace that will improvement in labor market conditions.  Under alternative B, the Committee would remain fully data dependent and offer no time-based guidance conditions for liftoff are likely to be

C would communicate the Committee's readiness to begin term.  Paragraph 1 indicates that, despite a steady rate, 'some labor market indicators suggest that underutilization of labor to diminish.'  It expresses a more positive reading of recent news By contrast, alternative policy normalization in the near jobless resources continued

that, although inflation remained below the Committee's transitory factors.  Paragraph 2 moderate economic improvement in labor market conditions, but also that it now has more (or perhaps somewhat more) confident that inflation 'will rise 2 percent over the medium term.'  Having made those assessments of the March an increase in the target range for the federal funds rate.'  While to the forward guidance, it also retains on inflation and notes objective, 'it was no longer declining.'  In addition, paragraph 1 of alternative C attributes this winter's economic slowdown largely to suggests not only that the Committee continues to anticipate growth and further become gradually to recent developments and the outlook, the Committee would adopt new guidance in paragraph 3.  Rather than repeating the criteria for liftoff adopted in statement, the Committee would announce that 'economic conditions may' or 'likely will soon warrant alternative C reintroduces a time dimension the more general data-dependent statement that the timing of the adjustment would depend on realized and expected progress toward the Committee's objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.

A, the Committee would express heightened concerns In as in alternative B, the Committee describes resources as 'little changed,' but it stresses that inflation longer-run objective.'  It does not much of this winter's slowdown may have been Additionally, in paragraph 2's assessment of the outlook, under alternative that the Committee now sees the risks to economic activity 'tilted to the downside.'  And the statement would voice Finally, with alternative about the underlying strength of the economic expansion, downside risks to the outlook for the labor market, and possible persistence of below-target inflation. paragraph 1, in alternative A, underutilization of labor 'continued to run well below the Committee's offer any judgment on how transitory. A it would be reported and the labor market as concern that 'inflation could run substantially below' 2 percent for a protracted period, and possibly that 'the pace of improvement in the labor market could remain slow.'

risks to the outlook, alternative A introduces a somewhat more initiation of policy firming, stating in paragraph 3 that inflation 'clearly moving up toward' the concern about the inflation outlook by that 'the Committee is prepared to use all of its tools as necessary to return to two years.'  All told, alternative A would liftoff appears unlikely for some time. Given these stringent precondition for the the Committee would need to see Committee's 2 percent objective rather than being 'reasonably confident' that it will do so.  In addition, alternative A emphasizes indicating inflation to 2 percent within one communicate that concludes my prepared remarks, and I will be Thank you, Madam Chair.  That glad to take any questions.

YELLEN.  Are there questions for Thomas?  President Lockhart. CHAIR

Chair.  Thomas, I'd like to ask you about your C.  Specifically, I'm referring to the bracketed choices in MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam thinking as you drafted alternative

April 28-29, 2015

the choice of the 'has an increase' language, as opposed to 'has become more confident' and 'likely will soon warrant an increase' language. paragraphs 2 and 3, and I'm interested in how the staff is thinking about become somewhat more confident' and 'may soon warrant the of the Committee or increasing can imagine choosing between these two at the meeting ahead of liftoff, with the choice depending on the probability of liftoff decision.  So I can see a case for both of these interpretations of the alt-C bracketed something we might consider in the future, and I wonder if the staff had either of if it's just providing an option for this meeting alone. These two language options could be seen as a sequence of statements over, say, two meetings.  They could convey increasing certainty on the part probability of a liftoff decision.  Alternatively, I language options the language as these ideas in mind or

We also explored the choice between 'may' and 'likely will' in I remember correctly, were sent to meeting.  In my view, just focusing for now on that, one key think one key you at some point will be, how firmly do you want to express that the next meeting the fact that, of course, over any will receive data that may change the course of policy?  That's some of into the considerations about 'may' and 'likely will.' MR. LAUBACH. previous drafts of alternative C and in other materials that, if the Committee ahead of the January question is how the Committee wants to strike a balance between, on the one hand, sending some advance notice and, on the other hand, emphasizing data dependence.  So I question for might be likely for liftoff, and how do you balance that against intermeeting period, you the thinking that went paragraph 2, you're right that you can see a pair betweenparagraph 2 could perhaps fit better with 'may' in paragraph 3 because it still As to the 'somewhat' in 'somewhat' in emphasizes a little bit more that you're reserving judgment.  So that's certainly a possibility.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

April 28-29, 2015

Chair.  I had a question and a thought that was a very nice set of experiments, and I like the idea of out.  My own thinking is, focus more on the MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes-thank you, Madam comment.  The comment is on page 1 of the handout that you provided, 'Market Expectations and Policy Issues.'  I having these three possible cases and laying them tantrum case, but, certainly, it's useful for us to keep in mind the conundrum case as well.

as a way to evaluate the appropriate that with policy I believe, when I was listening to you.  But optimal control, assumption that what we were trying to achieve with policy is all pretty My comment is about the use of optimal control policy response here.  When I think about what was going on in these episodes, it was really there were uncertainties in markets about what the Committee was trying to achieve -and you used the same language, of course, involves the much common knowledge.

a more aggressive response in order to achieve.  In the might want to be even tighter than what's built in here, really concerned about inflation might be even easier than what's described by we have this need to rebuild reputation in the eyes of the markets about we really care about getting inflation back up to 2 percent. For example, in the tantrum case, we might want rebuild lost reputation, in some sense, about what we're actually trying to conundrum case, the same is true-we because we're actually trying to convince markets that we are getting too high.  But in the tantrum case, we optimal control, because the fact that comment.  The question I had actually builds, I think, on what Dennis was C.  I'll ask the same question about alternative B.  As you described on in the various alternatives, we're really and 2 to speak to the Committee's assessment of the criteria for liftoff.  I That's a asking about alternative page 2, which was a great way to summarize what's relying on paragraphs 1

April 28-29, 2015

relying on the evolution of the data over time to allow the public to figure out what relevant. guess we're we think is in the alternative B.  And I guess my question is, what were you thinking in not doing Another way to proceed is to actually be more explicit about, 'Okay, we've had some incoming data-paragraphs 1 and 2.  We just saw GDP now.  How does that affect the likelihood of liftoff in, say, June?'  So we could have provided more explicit guidance about that statement in this?

I have two thoughts, perhaps, on that, and maybe Simon can also dealer survey on which factors market participants view as most relevant for the is an indirect route in the sense that what you the Committee is now more or less confident than before.  Presumably, market your characterization of these various factors and draw conclusions from shifted. MR. LAUBACH. weigh in on at least one of them.  Namely, as Simon showed you yesterday, there was a question in the primary achievement of reasonable confidence.  So there say in the statement will be evaluated even though you may not have a direct statement in there about how participants will look at that about how your confidence has come up with a summary statement for guess is that various participants rank different evident from your comments.  Therefore, I believe this is a and the public in general to draw conclusions about this. I'm not quite sure how easy it would be to try to the degree of confidence because, well, my criteria differently, and I think that's step that's left to market participants

Prior to the GDP release, I think the dealers put an average probability of assume that's moved down to 8 percent or something right GDP release.  If you felt that that 8 percent was way too low compared with indicate something. MR. POTTER. 13 percent on liftoff in June.  Let's now based on the the likelihood that you might lift off in June, then you might want to try to

April 28-29, 2015

seems a little bit less likely that you would want to indicate Before it was way too high, but it something at 8 percent.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  That's helpful.  Thank you.

Are there other comments or questions?  President Lacker. CHAIR YELLEN.

Committee's memory about the extent to which overnight short-term interest rates economic activity in the model independently of the values of the 5-, 7-, and 10-year interest rates, which appear MR. LACKER.  Thomas, I wonder if you could, to help us understand these scenarios, refresh the that we influence directly through the federal funds rate target can affect FRB/US to figure prominently in these scenarios.

policy transmission in the FRB/US model is largely through MR. LAUBACH.  Monetary long-term rates, so I'm-let me think.

MR. LACKER.  Entirely?

yield.  But it's true that the funds rate, in and of itself, doesn't carry a whole the scenarios are a substantial macroeconomic effects. MR. LAUBACH.  Largely-well, to varying degrees.  For example, there are some rates in there, like the rate on auto loans, that arguably are not quite as long term.  So they are not only a 10-year Treasury lot of weight in monetary policy transmission, but only through its effects on longer-term yields. By implication, these shifts in term premiums that we are considering in actually quite powerful.  So they do have

Well, I have two follow-ups.  One is, when I think about this, I have with the impression that a sizable volume of bank lending MR. LACKER. difficulty reconciling that structure among the bankers I talk to seems to be priced off LIBOR and other short-term interest rates.

imply for Taylor rules?  Have we been wrong for The second thing is, what would this years?  Should we have been including a term premium thing that we accommodate in the Taylor

April 28-29, 2015

Should we think about policy differently now that we've got this transmission mechanism strength varies depending on what the term premium does? rules? whose if monetary policy through term premiums?  That means that term premiums interest rates.  To some extent, that is actually the the FRB/US model-namely, that the term premium is an endogenous function of affect MR. LAUBACH.  There are two separate aspects to this.  One is, what transmission also importantly works systematically vary with the path of short-term case in expected future output gaps.  So to the extent that choices about the path of the funds rate the outlook for future output gaps, that has an added effect by moving term premiums endogenously as well.

into account other financial broadly?  And there, arguably, a Taylor rule that responds only to current financial conditions that you observe today, like movements and things like that, clearly affect your outlook in the future.  So that is not an aspect that just mechanically respond to current conditions.  Of course, perfect foresight.  Therefore, agents anticipate that changes in financial conditions A separate question is, should a Taylor rule also take conditions more economic conditions may have a shortcoming because it responds only to current inflation and, say, the current output gap, whereas in the dollar that is captured by Taylor rules for example, if you look at optimal control, it obviously knows about these things because it's run under today more broadly, including changes in term premiums, will affect the future outlook.

Let me follow up further.  When I look at the plot in the upper-left-hand that mean that an 2 percentage points higher for 1994 than MR. LACKER. corner, if I took Taylor rules and incorporate this term premium, doesn't augmented Taylor rule should now predict interest rates would a Taylor rule without that augmentation?

April 28-29, 2015

rate, but the equilibrium real rate could be moving, too. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That's assuming you have a time-constant equilibrium real the gap.  There's inflation.  But now we add MR. LACKER.  Yes, there's that.  There's the term premium, and that's pointing in the other direction by 2 percentage points.

or at least a highly persistent basis, the term premium seems lower than it was back then.  That is an effect that arguably ought to be MR. LAUBACH.  If you look just at, say, the lower-frequency movement, it now seems as though, on an almost secular about 2 percentage points reflected already in current conditions.

MR. LACKER.  Current conditions.

MR. LAUBACH.  If you thought about a sudden drop right now-

What about the current Taylor rule?  Shouldn't it be in the current it. MR. LACKER. Taylor rule, too?  We should include in the current Taylor rule through current conditions. MR. EVANS.  It's

the point I'm trying to make is that this is a secular in the term premium from a mean of what looks like around 2 percent in the 1990s to persistent since the in the term premium, in and of itself, arguably had, at some point, a isolation, as I referred to in my briefing, MR. LAUBACH.  Well, I think downshift about close to zero now.  But that's not a recent development, that's been mid-2000s.  The decline stimulative effect.  Assuming that this really occurred in you could see- and the current inflation rate. MR. LACKER.  So it's affected the current gap

MR. LAUBACH.  Exactly.

to the term premium. MR. LACKER.  But your optimal control says that, even given the current gap and the current inflation rate, there should be some response of the funds rate

April 28-29, 2015

Yes, but those are projected future changes in the term premium, not is today.  So my point is, if you had just observed in recent history a 2 percentage point affect caveat 'all is a little bit of rule response only to current conditions.  If these that decline in the term premium, then there is a bit since you project that that decline in the term premium, in itself, actually is going to MR. LAUBACH. where it decline in the term premium, then if that had happened in isolation, that should indeed your outlook.  Your outlook should be stronger, all else being equal-again, with the else being equal.'  If the 2 percentage point decline occurred in the context of a flight to safety, that's no longer so obvious.  But if that had recently occurred, then, indeed, there a discrepancy in terms of your standard Taylor current conditions haven't responded yet to of a tension provide a boost.

staff projection, it is, very importantly, driven by our conditions today and over the projection period.  So the Taylor rule does the projection period. If you think, for example, about the assessment of financial take account of that over

Governor Fischer, do you have a two-hander? CHAIR YELLEN.

Yes, it's a two-hander.  What is the correlation between the term MR. FISCHER. premium and the difference between the short-term rate and the long-term rate?  Is it high?

LAUBACH.  The correlation between the term premium and the slope-sadly, I do MR. not know this right off the top of-

POTTER.  It has to be high on a daily basis. MR.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  It has to be high.

Yes, it would be high. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.

That's because the short-term rate is not moving that much, because the MR. POTTER. FOMC is not moving it, but the 10-year is moving around every day.

April 28-29, 2015

YELLEN.  President Williams.

MR. EVANS.  Yes, arithmetic, I guess.

CHAIR

WILLIAMS. My question is related to President Lacker's topic, but I guess it's in general.  As I FRB/US model and the way you described it, Thomas, is that these movements affect all asset prices.  They affect mortgage rates, the exchange rate.  These movements are really spilling over throughout so have a very powerful effect on GDP, employment, and inflation. MR. really more about how we think about movements in the term premium understand the have very powerful effects because they stock market, and the financial conditions, and the effects of QE-I'm thinking of the work of Vissing-Jorgensen and the research has looked at this and seems to have called into question pass-through of Treasury term premium effects onto private rates, such and mortgage rates, as well as asset prices in general.  I guess the term premium doesn't model would tell you?  Or how do we think The research on Krishnamurthy-a lot of whether there's this full as corporate bond rates question is, to what extent are you buying into the story that maybe the affect financial conditions as fully as the FRB/US about some of the more recent research in terms of these simulations?

I have here on the handout and 'Monetary Policy Strategies' section of Tealbook, Book B, of course, fully into the FRB/US view that, to the extent that long rates matter for real activity, the term premium are in long-term rates.  So no distinction is drawn between whether is in the expectations component or in the term-premium component. MR. LAUBACH.  I think the short answer to that is, what what is being shown in the buys changes in the movement try to look at how the results will change.  Broadly speaking, my that the lines you see in the lower-left panel are based on 100 percent-that We could certainly expectation would be

April 28-29, 2015

exactly as much as changes in expected future interest rates.  Then if you thought that a more reasonable estimate was, say, 50 percent. is, term premiums are worth you can shave that time-varying  *.  In my view, this is the argument for thinking about the fact the term premium changes over decades.  Other factors, such as risk premiums, the equity and the sovereign risk premium-lots of things change in the economy, which is a constant MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you.  The second comment is really to President Lacker.  This is why you have a r that premium, basically the argument not to have r *.

Laubach-Williams, which just tries to let the data term premium down.  The way I view this is, there are these factors pushing  * up, headwinds and the other things, are just so much more powerful that, on Your point is exactly right.  On its own, the term premium going down would argue for a higher r *.  So what's really striking is that decide, has r * falling all of the way to zero, despite the fact that QE and other factors have pushed the r but the other factors, the net, they push r * down.  Through the lens of r *, everything makes sense.  [Laughter]  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Okay.  Why don't we begin our round now?  Our first speaker is CHAIR President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I'm looking forward to hearing goes. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam President Williams's remarks through the lens of r *.  [Laughter]  We'll see how that alternative A.  My rationale for alternative A is based on the modal prices and employment, the risks to that outlook, and the zero lower bound.  On the Tealbook, Book A, you see that inflation does not return to the steps to return of inflation to target.  These additional steps would also help boost Madam Chair, I favor outlook for benchmark outlook in the FOMC's target of 2 percent until 2019, which is four years from now.  We should take facilitate a faster

April 28-29, 2015

us to achieve employment over the medium term.  Our congressional mandate calls for maximum employment and stable prices.  If we are able to simultaneously create more jobs and improve our performance on the price-stability goal, we should do so.

just based on the modal outlook alone.  It provides a clear I think this argument is enhanced agree with the Tealbook, Book A-the risks to the prices and employment are to the downside.  The standard risk-management are often advanced by the Committee suggest that these future downside risks case for current accommodation. That's the argument justification for the policy course described in alternative A. by consideration of the risks to the outlook.  I outlook for considerations that bolster the bound, as recent Brookings conference paper by and his colleagues makes crystal clear, these risk-management considerations enhanced by the presence of the zero lower bound.  The past five years have that when we're close to the zero lower bound, as we expect to be over the medium downside risks as effectively as we would like.  As points out, this means that we should make policy choices so as to A. When we think about the zero lower President Evans are significantly taught us term, we will not be able to mitigate President Evans's paper strengthen the economy in advance of these shocks hitting.  That, again, argues in favor of the kind of stance described in alternative

to the So I see three arguments in favor of alternative A-the modal outlook, the risks outlook, and the constraints on policy imposed by the zero lower bound.

past, I believe that it is important for monetary policy decisions instability.  My own As I've indicated in the to take account of the macroeconomic risks created by potential financial reading of the QS report is that the main financial stability risk we face right now is actually

April 28-29, 2015

we'll be receiving important not to signal anything today about a June decision. June's decision is going to be data dependent, and information, including two monthly employment reports, to help come to a decision about liftoff in June.  Thus, I think it's important the spirit of alternative B today because, at this point, I favor data dependence it is appropriate to to the outlook for economic activity and the labor market as nearly from focusing too much on short-term in economic indicators instead of providing the Committee's assessment of changes in that matter for a policy decision.  I do appreciate some of the changes that was circulated and the draft on the today that addressed this issue of tone, but we have to remember that the public doesn't see I support and the meeting-by-meeting nature of the decision of liftoff.  I believe acknowledge the slowdown in growth and employment in paragraph 2, but then to maintain the characterization of the risks balanced.  However, in my view, the tone of the first paragraph on intermeeting developments is too negative.  I think some of that negativity comes changes economic conditions were made between the first draft of statement language that table the evolution of our drafts.

Tealbook, Book B, tells us that the intention of alternative B is to avoid any datealternative B doesn't seem to achieve this.  My concern is, read as our signaling that we've taken June off the table when that's not the case, and it The based guidance and retain the option of beginning policy normalization in June if the data and outlook justify it.  My concern is that it'll be would be inconsistent with our data-dependent approach.

meeting on both policy and statement as straightforward.  So I'd to spend a few minutes looking ahead and thinking aloud about statement language I see the decision at this like possibilities in alternative economic scenarios, obviously evidenced by incoming data, and alternative liftoff decision scenarios.

there is some desire to keep June an active think having various communication strategies in mind could help the my part, I'm not so optimistic that by make a clear and plausible case that the economy is on track in terms of data dependency of our liftoff to scratch their heads about liftoff decision.  I expect that the data picture will be by the time of our next meeting to justify waiting a bit longer. I expect it will be evident in this round that option.  In any event, I Committee achieve as smooth a policy transition as possible and reduce the chances of avoidable and unwanted market volatility associated with liftoff.  For June we will be able to our two decision criteria.  Having repeatedly emphasized the decision, I think it's important that we not cause impartial observers the data on which we're basing a sufficiently inconclusive my earlier question to Thomas indicated, I'm trying to think through how alternative C might serve as a template.  The 'has become somewhat more increase' language option, combined with the 'has become an increase' version, could be viewed as a statements over two meetings in advance of the liftoff decision.  Alternatively, the the other selected depending on the meeting. As communication might evolve in the coming meetings should we decide not to move in June.  As I suggested in framing the question for Thomas, there are a couple of ways the language options in this meeting's confident' and 'may soon warrant an more confident' and 'likely will soon warrant sequence of two versions could be viewed as distinct choices, with one or degree of certainty or probability the Committee wishes to convey, presumably in a statement of the meeting just ahead of the liftoff

April 28-29, 2015

of that, my sense of opinion in the Committee is that there is not a lot of signaling liftoff two meetings in advance, even if couched in very tentative terms.  I there's much support for a move to language along the lines of alternative C unless difficulty actually envisioning circumstances in might choose to use the softer 'has become somewhat more confident' and 'may soon an increase' version in alternative C.  Where this leaves me is the view that the most is the 'has become an increase' choice.  I apologize for walking Having said all appetite for also doubt the liftoff decision is highly probable.  So I have which we warrant feasible approach to some amount of guidance in advance of a liftoff decision more confident' and 'likely will soon warrant everyone through my tortured thought process.  [Laughter]

certainly possible that we will receive a string of data reports between now and June is strong enough to justify pulling the trigger.  If we were to move in June, the advancesome more concrete guidance on It's that signal decision will be moot, of course.  In that case, the question becomes whether the June statement ought to address what comes next-that is, provide what is the Committee's expected path of policy over the subsequent meetings.

I think it would be helpful to further discuss the question of whether to provide advance guidance and, if so, how to phrase it.  And it's not too early to start to prepare the public for

end of my remarks. MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, although with a language change, which I will get to toward the people that once we have removed the forward meeting in which the possibility of the federal funds rate can be on the table.  Having said that, though, we still have that we think we're going to want to raise the federal couple of meetings.  I, for one, don't think it's very likely at believe that we should not do anything that formally takes it off the table. I first wanted to say that I agree with guidance, as we've now done, every meeting should be a live a change in different assessments as to how likely it is funds rate target range in the next all.  But I do

President Lockhart's thoughtful observations did to say a couple of things on how to begin moving forward.  I think I'm coming out place, although only in a tentative way, and would like to hear other is, I think that read it as calendar guidance, I think the same thing is going to happen now if we put in I wasn't going to comment on this, but provoke me in a somewhat different people's views on this.  I'd be reluctant to put back into paragraph 3 at some point an indication that, one or two meetings from now, we are more likely to move.  The reason becomes a form of calendar guidance of its own.  Just as, when we put in the quasi-calendar guidance before, saying, 'Well, this isn't really calendar-it's all data dependent,' the markets all language such as that included in paragraph 3 of alternative C.

that we use paragraph 2 as the vehicle for beginning to increase some volatility a little bit as people My preference would be communicate a change in the Committee's collective view as to where the economy is headed, which, it's hoped, actually begins to, I would say,

That way, we don't have a surprise at it is not de facto occurring just by we've actually decided to lift the begin to think liftoff is more likely but is not the meeting in which we eventually lift the target range, but the inclusion of language in paragraph 3 at a meeting before target range.

time to increase range.  I thought that paragraph 1 as originally circulated a week or two ago actually economy.  It's fairly hard to argue with the were rather disappointing and pretty bad, yet paragraph 1 began with 'in part reflecting transitory factors.'  Most important, I think, the and employment to expectâ¦'  In other words, the basic the Committee's expectations hasn't changed, notwithstanding the disappointing reported in paragraph 1. As I said, my current view is that June is very unlikely as an appropriate the target hit about right the factual characterization of the proposition that the data something saying that it was beginning of paragraph 2 communicates that 'Although growth in output slowed during the first quarter, the Committee continues direction of developments sentence March, that sentence below the Committee's longer-run objective, largely So the phrase 'largely reflecting declines in energy prices' Notwithstanding the fact that I thought the original paragraph 1 got it about right, I'm okay with most of the changes that have been made since the original language was circulated, although I wouldn't want to see us going too much further to try to look for the cheery in a way that would obscure what's actually happened.  The one exception, Madam Chair, is the on inflation, which is the second-to-last sentence in paragraph 1.  Back in said 'Inflation has declined further reflecting declines in energy prices.' was, in effect, explaining how the decline had gone further below.  It was an explanation of the delta.

was circulated originally to the Committee a week or two ago is 'Inflation continued to run well below the objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices and 'largely reflecting' in effect explains the 'well' part-why it longer-run objective, largely reflecting earlier declines in energy prices non-energy imports.' I think the language that now in alternative A, and the language is as follows: Committee's longer-run decreasing prices of non-energy imports.'  There, the way I read it when that language was circulated was that now this phrase is 'well' below.  But as it's been modified, the sentence now reads 'Inflation continued to run below the Committee's and decreasing prices of based on the earlier declines in energy prices and decreasing inflation target for quite some time now.  And if housing inflation-which, of course, is largely a function of rents imputed to about how much inflation I don't think it's the case that all of the difference between the Committee's target and where we are right now is explained prices of non-energy imports.  On the contrary, as many people pointed out yesterday and a little bit today already, we haven't been hitting the you pull out homeowners-then you have an awful lot of continuing questions there is.

matter, I think we should modify that sentence to say something like the 'Inflation continued to run below the Committee's longer-run objective, partly prices and decreasing prices of non-energy imports'-or that that second phrase does not account for all of the difference where we are right now. As a factual following: reflecting earlier declines in energy something just making clear between the Committee's target and those who have gone before me, I would prefer removing 'at least' in the Finally, like first sentence.

Our guidance only as far ahead as this meeting, meeting-by-meeting, data-dependent approach to decisionmaking.  From thing to do, and I think that's important.  This means we will not be in telegraphing interest rate President Lockhart made on this.  An important corollary encouraging people to believe we won't raise rates without having sent a telegraph on the issue in the previous meeting's

C as a stalking-horse for future statements, I don't feel the need to language like that in paragraphs 2 or 3 at a meeting prior to liftoff.  So I agree with that we have the without forewarning, perhaps. Concerning alternative include Governor Tarullo-every meeting should be live, and we should, to the extent opportunity, condition people to expect that we could move critical aspect is today's characterization of the economy, especially in the first scheduled to arrive A paragraph.  As I said in the earlier round, a substantial amount of data is between now and our June meeting.  If those reports are reasonably close to what the Tealbook is forecasting, they're going to show a rebound in consumer spending growth, and they're going to show a firming in the monthly inflation figures.

could well be a strong argument for raising rates in June.  Now, we data will come in that way, and we don't know for sure there won't be on the horizon that alter the outlook.  We could find we've hit a more going to get, I think important not to take June off the table. In that case, there don't know for sure the some looming concerns prolonged soft patch.  In that case, we may be inclined to delay raising rates when we get to June, and I'm open to that possibility.  But, in view of the information we're it's very

the beginning of last week in the first paragraph were good, important, and necessary.  But I that the first paragraph still has somewhat of a 'glass half-empty' also support Governor Tarullo's change I think he's right on there.  But I believe that the inflation sentence in C is more balanced and fair, as it acknowledges that inflation is no longer declining. Central bank communication is all about what you choose to call out, and I As I said, the critical aspect is how the statement characterizes the data, and that focuses attention on the first paragraph.  The revisions that were made between week and the end of last agree with President Mester tone, emphasizing the empty half of the glass I guess you'd say.  I support her suggestion for changing the characterization of household spending.  I of 'largely' to 'partly.' alternative It calls that out. think it would be fair to call out that inflation isn't declining.  So I'd put that suggestion on the table.

But, on the other hand, 'at least in part' means the amount that's attributable to transitory factors is 'in part' or 'greater than in part.'  From least in part' seems to me like a more upbeat assessment than just 'in part But I could be persuaded either way on that.  Those are my comments on language, Regarding the phrase 'at least,' I've broad-brush kind of way, you can see how including it might make things a little more dour than they ought that that point of view, 'at reflecting.'

April 28-29, 2015

and how that thinking shapes policy choices.  So that would be an thing to do, if we could fit that in at some point. how we're thinking about it excellent me with two comments.  One is about building credibility for data-dependent is about shading policy to prevent asset price bubbles.  On the credibility as we all discussed yesterday, recent data have been relatively weak.  We have been a data-dependent policy being the basis for rate decisions as go forward.  I guess my assessment so far is that we have indeed built some credibility, even a data-dependent policy rate for the period ahead, despite the haven't moved the policy rate for six and a half years.  And that's an achievement. That leaves policy, and the other question, trying to build credibility regarding we considerable credibility, regarding fact that we

data dependent.  If we can maintain this type of data wax and wane during 2015, we'll be in excellent shape at the time of liftoff, whenever that should arrive, in the sense that there will be few surprises in the Markets-appropriately, in my view-moved the likely date of liftoff back in response to weaker-than-expected readings on the U.S. economy during the intermeeting period.  That's exactly what you'd expect to observe if policy is credibility as the policy markets at that juncture.

I'm hopeful that the day of the that that's what we were the way to The more we can do to convince people that we're going to react to about what first move will be an anticlimactic event because we have credibility going to do.  Then we make the move, and it's pretty smooth.  I think we're well on that, but we probably have more work to do during the spring.

language about household spending growth that President Mester that it's going to sound like the message you communicate when alternative to that is a recession.  If household spending doesn't grow, that's fine. I'm indifferent on the indicated.  I'm a little worried you go out and say, 'I support so-and-so 1,000 percent.'  When you say, 'Household spending continued to grow,' the it's a recession, so I'm not quite sure-but, at any rate, these are factually correct observations, but I'm thinking that the energy price declines are are going to go up, and we know that sentiment goes down when gasoline might be providing a different bright line for people looking for a bright On 'consumer sentiment remains high,' a little worried that it might be risky.

I support alternative B and the latitude offers the Committee to guidance that we can glean from policy rules, the benchmarks in the that the funds rate should be higher than its Granted, the equilibrium real rate, or and raises questions as to whether these benchmarks are providing appropriate In terms of Tealbook, Book B, continue to generally suggest current setting. r *, we've been discussing remains depressed guidance today.

So, while policy should incorporate a appropriate setting of the funds rate, it also should not neglect output gap in the Taylor (1999) rule with inertia suggests a higher current funds the lower equilibrium conditions by any may also imply a smaller output gap. At the same time, common frameworks used to r * also provide an estimate of potential GDP in which declines in r * go hand in hand with lower potential.  For example, the current Laubach-Williams it also implies that output is actually lower equilibrium real rate into the the implications for potential GDP and the output gap.  For example, using the lower r * measure and positive rate.  The Taylor (1993) rule indicates a setting above 1 percent, even with real rate.  I don't take the positive output gap to completely reflect current means, since some labor market slack remains.  However, this example illustrates that taking on board a lower equilibrium real rate

draft B to finally contain entirely data-dependent language.  This is a very positive MR. PRICHARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I view the evolution of the alternative development and, I believe, an essential step on the path to policy normalization.  I also interpret the language in alternative B as leaving our options open for beginning normalization at any future meeting as we are informed by incoming data.

concern with alternative B is its overly weak interpretation of the current for Q1 over the past adjustment.  An our Data Research Center this morning, indicates that the first quarter may not be nearly My biggest economic environment.  As I mentioned yesterday, expenditure-side data 30 years appears to be suffering from poor and perhaps incorrect seasonal indicator that incorporates income-side data, GDPplus, which was posted to the website of Real-Time

on a year-over-year basis in 2014:Q4. as weak as many of the nowcasts being reported.  GDPplus grew at 1.65 percent in the first quarter after growing 3.3 percent future, simplifying its market.  Many labor market indicators paint a relatively healthy picture market.  For that reason, I would favor deleting the third full sentence in adds little to the the FOMC statement down to its essence by eliminating sentences that don't Further, I suggest that the Committee consider, now or in the assessment of the labor of the labor paragraph 1-again, either now or in the future-and simplifying it.  That sentence begins with 'A range of labor market indicatorsâ¦'  This sentence is fairly imprecise, and it meaning that is already embodied in the preceding sentence.  The idea would be to seek every opportunity to boil add particularly to meaning or understanding.

to eliminate 'at least' and of the other I am otherwise supportive of the suggestion suggestions that have been made.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Williams. CHAIR

That's just accurate really the place in which we do the heavy lifting and explain Paragraph 1 is really about the data. On Governor Tarullo's suggestion, I reflecting earlier declines in energy exactly right.  In the recent data, core is running about 1 percent.  Overall around zero over the past couple of quarters, but There are a lot of factors and, I think, better.  Paragraph 2 is how we interpret things.

April 28-29, 2015

make a comment about data dependence in paragraph 1.  This is part of life.  We're in the data.  We had only a month, small sample, but these are the data we have, and I think we describe them accurately. I'll the data-dependent mode.  Paragraph 1 is going to describe really, of data here.  This is a very have to just in which we try to explain how we interpret them is paragraph paragraph 2 did a nice job of making the point that, yes, the data we've had these factors in terms of inflation.  But, basically, our outlook weakness or the signaling in 1 as currently stated, because I think that's the way the data have been.  It's just a our next meeting.  So I'm fine with The part of the statement 2.  In that respect, I thought have been weaker.  Yes, hasn't changed much.  I'm not concerned so much about the paragraph small sample, and, of course, we'll get a lot more data before that.

Governor Tarullo and others who've commented on where the future in there.  That whole thing of how of steps before we act is a kind of straightjacket we don't want to get We're in a good place now on our statements, and I wouldn't want to see us move In terms of statements should go, obviously President Lockhart started us down that road.  I strongly agree with Governor Tarullo and, I think, President Evans as well as some others that we shouldn't be going back to trying to put some quasi-date-based guidance we have to take a couple ourselves in. back to that.

outlook hasn't really changed based on the data we've in the past month, which is similar to what others have mentioned.  First-quarter data seem seasonal factors and other factors.  We've been down this road before. I still have the view that will come back over the next couple of years to our target. Now, my own view in terms of the seen to be distorted by some In terms of the inflation data, I haven't changed my view there, either. inflation

I try come in, how they influence our outlook, and what the right policy is.

That's a hard September versus December or whatever.  So I've been thinking a little about how we can, beyond this statement, get to a more data-dependent approach.

YELLEN.  That's a good suggestion.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

like to first discuss briefly the inflation alternative B. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'd target issue that arose yesterday, and then turn to the monetary policy decision and explain why I support inflation rate, a suggestion that's also been made by Olivier that we should constantly be reexamining all of our assumptions about behavior of the economy, but that, particularly in the case of targets, we Yesterday President Rosengren, supported by President Kocherlakota and one or two others, suggested raising the target Blanchard.  I believe monetary policy and the need to be very careful about our public stance.

The setting of a those outside the System, a major surprise.  We need to be very careful indeed about that decision and that discussion.

is that the higher target would permit to attain a more negative real rate of interest than is now possible.  That there's not so far been public discussion of the negative aspects of a higher inflation The main cost, I believe, relates to Alan Greenspan's definition of the desired inflation routine economic decisions.  In return of indexation into short-term contracts, including labor contracts.  Monetary policy becomes much more indexed economies, in part because the inflation rate typically becomes more The argument for raising the target inflation rate normal monetary policy is true, but target. rate as a rate such that inflation is not taken into account in particular, at around 4 percent inflation, we very likely would see the relatively difficult in heavily

and of the FOMC.  It is that we should, at some future point, raise the inflation target.  But if we go out now and inflation target, we will undoubtedly be asked why we're target and what the effects of doing so are likely to be.  There are answers to these a time when reasonable most credible and most professional of the macro policymaking A second cost relates to the credibility of the inflation target possible start a public discussion about the raising the questions, but the answers may well reduce our credibility precisely at people regard us as the institutions in the United States.

At the is why our discussions of the target inflation rate should continue within the Federal Eric raised the issue in We-that is, the participants in go public with any doubts that we might have about the goals moment, we're in the middle of the process of trying to normalize monetary policy.  We should always be reconsidering our policy framework, but there are times to go public and times not to do so.  That Reserve System and within the Committee, and that is why it is fine that yesterday's go-round, but we should not go public with that discussion.

the key issue is whether first-quarter weakness is transitory or weakening of growth, and this morning's announcement of the first GDP growth make it clear that we should wait before making a decision the interest rate.  I say that while bearing in mind an almost true maxim I once heard: clearer in the future.  It's just unclear in a different way.'

I support we are watching the data carefully, and that June remains on the table. many black clouds that are out date.  How could it be possible?  Well, we'll receive two more employment reports before the June meeting.  If we see very high payroll gains comes down to, say, 5.3 percent while the spending data firm as expected, it would be reasonable to argue might suggest that we should wait just a little longer to be sure, since September that different from June, to perfect our communications about liftoff or to reexamine intend to use to raise the interest rate.  That would mean that even in the face of very importance of our credibility, which would require us to act acting that we have set out are fulfilled. Some isn't really the tools we good data, the June versus September decision would be a close call.  But in making that call, we need also to take into account the when the conditions for

Tetlow, whose results I quoted in the March FOMC meeting.  In that paper, they their decisions under early and late the probability that 10 percent if we wait a year longer.  In contrast, the difference probabilities that we would need to retrace our steps if we go earlier, 10 percent, 5 percent, was not as great. Turning to the bigger picture, my views on when to lift off were influenced by the very helpful paper that was sent to this Committee in January by Oliver de Groot, Etienne Gagnon, and Robert compared the probabilities that policymakers might regret liftoff scenarios.  Using random draws from historical shocks, they show that we would fall behind the curve and wish that we had tightened sooner was negligible if we go on the early side but was close to between the rather than later,

April 28-29, 2015

very good paper, but it's not obvious where we are today relative to going interest rate than have to raise the rate faster or slower than we stage, we have to work with expectations. Now, it's a early or going late.  Nonetheless, all in all, I found that analysis very useful, and it helped persuade me that we should seriously be contemplating lifting off soon.  It further helped convince me that 'early and gradual' is a much better approach to raising the 'late and steep.'  Of course, in the event, we may anticipate, but, at this to relate to the argument that we're only in this relatively good position on potentially good position on inflation because the interest rate is so low, U.S. in this relatively favorable position if the FOMC had not moved rapidly to the zero lower bound and then undertaken three rounds of QE as well Operation Twist.  I believe history will show that the Federal Reserve-together with the played But we need to realize the interest rate back into action as a tool of monetary policy. to businesses and households that, after I'd also like employment and this and that, therefore, we should not move anytime soon.  It's undoubtedly true that the economy would not be after Lehman Brothers as decision to recapitalize the banking system, in which the Treasury and the Congress critical roles-saved the United States from a second Great Depression. that, at some point, we have to put In so doing, we'll not only begin to activate a more normal way of undertaking monetary policy, but we'll also be sending an extremely important signal seven years, the American economy is ready to exit the Great Recession and begin the return to normal.

answer is, we should do it when an interest rate higher with the closing of the output gap.  I believe that, on the staff forecasts we heard yesterday from Bill Wascher are far less pessimistic true we've got negative inflation in the When should we do this?  The than we have now is still consistent inflation rate, the than what I've heard around this table this morning.  It's

that even the real federal funds rate, suggesting that a sooner liftoff would not be situation improves.  Or, to put the alternative B, we should move when the Committee 'has seen further market and is reasonably confident that inflation will move back to its the medium term.'

anything, the softer tone of the aggregate spending data raises the market help with our assessment before the June FOMC deliberations. In my view, the incoming data, on balance, do not suggest we're appreciably closer to our two conditions for liftoff.  The incoming data on the labor market do not provide evidence of further improvement.  If possibility that labor market improvement may stall this year.  My reading of the data on unemployment, labor force participation, and the number of employees working part time for economic reasons is that slack remains.  Nonetheless, we'll have two additional labor readings to floor under inflation falls standard of reasonable confidence.  We've seen some encouraging movement in PCE remains persistently soft relative to our 2 percent target.  The recent plateauing in dollar appreciation raise the possibility that we seems likely, accelerating wage yet to materialize, and market-based measures of inflation expectations remain soft, Meanwhile, the modest improvement we've seen in putting a short of our core CPI, although core firming of oil prices and the recent might be seeing an inflection point, but further appreciation growth has although they've shown some improvement as the price of oil has firmed.

It's really what the to be 'largely' or 'partly.'  I would slightly favor 'partly' I'm not as concerned about inflation today as I was six weeks ago, but I'm happy to the judgment of the Committee.
