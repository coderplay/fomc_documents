YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  As you know, we had a farewell hours, we will also luncheon.  In light of those departures, I to welcome Helen Holcomb back to the table.  She represented the Federal Reserve Dallas here before President Fisher took office and will be representing the Dallas Bank to welcome Blake Prichard to the table, representing the Federal Philadelphia.

At recent meetings, we have discussed the fact that it is important for there is a postmeeting press conference scheduled.  And a number me that I schedule press conferences after every meeting.  Now, a every meeting is likely to be irreversible.  It is something I my decision is that it would be to schedule press conferences after every meeting. Before we begin today's agenda, I want to briefly update you about developments that relate to press briefings. the Committee not to feel constrained from taking action whenever we deem appropriate, at any meeting, regardless of whether of you have suggested to decision to have press conferences at have, therefore, carefully considered.  For now, at least, I think best not time that is required for me and all of our In part, that is because also on all matters pertaining to Federal Reserve-related issues.  And all of that occurs at exactly the same time when all of us are preparing for these meetings. Let me just say that, by way of explanation, the senior staff to prepare for these press conferences is truly nontrivial. preparations involve being up-to-date not only on matters pertaining to monetary policy and the economy, but preparation

That the same time, though I am not inclined now to go to important for us to feel-and also to convince press conference, so that market expectations of our As I reflect on it-and, again, this is just be revisited-it seems to me that when we are in a more normal policy, and I hope that every-meeting press conferences, especially after updates, are What I believe will happen is they will become opportunities nonmonetary policy issues, which ultimately could be a distraction rather than a help to would all occur on meeting days.  But, at press conferences every meeting, I do think it is the public and market participants-that we are not constrained from taking decisions at meetings for which there is not a subsequent future actions can be appropriately responsive to incoming data.

And, to firm on the second day of our meeting in April, the Board's Public Affairs a test of our system for media conference calls.  We will permit news that we conducted this test, and we will state that the reason for refresh news organizations' familiarity with how the system works, so that we can if necessary, on meeting days when no press conference is scheduled.  That is currently that any of you would like to offer on it.  But that is what we moment. As I have mentioned in the past, we briefings by telephone on very short the financial crisis.  So the plan I would like to propose is and the press that we have that up that expectation, late office plans to conduct organizations to report afterward the test is to use it, the plan, and I welcome any input thought, for the

YELLEN.  Other questions for Simon?  President Evans. CHAIR

In table 4, exhibit 1, you have expectations for inflation at liftoff, and it two-year-ahead a little out of order, but I was looking at the SEP and I noticed that there is an appendix to table 2 that shows our responses on the timing of everybody has in there.  I see 1.1, 1.2, Simon, do you think that the market participants would find this piece of MR. EVANS. looks like more people in the markets are thinking that we will lift off when the inflation outlook is under 1¾ percent.  It is tables, our liftoff and the economic conditions in the quarter that we do that.  And I was a little surprised by the very low core PCE inflation numbers that 1.3 percent.

If the Committee released details on what individual participants thought MR. POTTER. economic conditions will be at liftoff, it would be noteworthy for a number of reasons.

MR. EVANS.  Yes.  In terms of the informational content.

the core inflation numbers you quoted to me sounded like a little bit below the lower quartile of 1.3 percent that we got from our responses.  So I the inflation data came along, the information would have some effect on of the timing of liftoff.  If you did not see firmer core inflation data but saw data about the same as what we are currently receiving, people might view that as suggesting quite likely. MR. POTTER.  I do think that they were would imagine that, as expectations that is that liftoff would still be

I was actually surprised with the data, as thought those probabilities were most likely to have gone down, in response to the inflation we saw over the intermeeting period.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you.

YELLEN.  Further questions for Simon?  [No response]  Okay.  I'm going to the briefing.

Consistent with the idea that take-up at term did not attribute movements in market rates to these term test operations. The staff estimates that the majority substitution from the ON RRP-the light blue bars in the bottom-left panel-or rollover of funds allocated to previous term RRP operations, the dark blue bars.  Only about 15 percent of take-up appears the term operations was just 1 basis point higher than the ON RRP rate, it the additional return required to move $50 billion from overnight one week was relatively operations primarily represented substitution from ON RRP operations, market participants

However, secured rates were somewhat soft over parts of the intermeeting period, with example, as shown in the dark blue GCF repo transactions-which are a subset of triparty repo interdealer market-the volume-weighted average rate of remaining triparty briefly dipped below the ON RRP rate.  Market participants attributed dynamics in secured decreases in financing needs around the April

These developments, which market participants indicate partly reflect dealers' more conservative risk management practices since the crisis as well as ongoing regulatory changes, may affect the constellation of market rates and the tools for

repo market and the smaller or less creditworthy dealers that seek to borrow GCF market.  This can be seen in the widening spread between the the GCF market and the broader triparty market, For example, some dealers with large, stable repo funding bases have demanded increased compensation to intermediate between money funds or other lenders in the triparty funds in the volume-weighted average rates in excluding GCF, shown in the top-left panel.

Morgan and Fidelity, further increasing instruments. At the same time, regulatory changes are increasing the demand for high-quality money market instruments.  Over the intermeeting period, Fidelity announced that it would convert prime retail the 2014 SEC reforms.  Combined, these three funds have about $130 billion in assets under management.  Additionally, J.P. Morgan announced its intention to reduce certain non-operating wholesale deposits by up to $100 billion, either by introducing fees on certain institutional clients' deposits or by asking clients to move deposits other products, such as money funds.  Market participants anticipate that other firms are likely demand for high-quality money market changes reflect, at least in part, actions that firms are taking to align their reliance on short-term to improve the resiliency of the system.  They may, however, increase segmentation in money markets and, in the system, put some downward pressure on some for Fed RRPs or similar during policy normalization. These business models with upcoming regulatory changes intended to increase the safety of money market funds and decrease banks' and broker-dealers' funding.  These are, of course, important steps financial given the high level of reserves money market rates.  This could in turn increase demand instruments

markets expectations of the ON RRP facility during or after liftoff.  As shown in the middlethe median respondent to the most recent Desk surveys expects that usage RRP at liftoff will be $300 billion and will decline to $250 billion three years to expectations in recent surveys.  The range between the percentile and 90th percentile of respondents' views, shown in the red bars in the Despite the announcements emphasizing a shifting landscape in money and the discussion of the possibility of an elevated ON RRP cap at liftoff in the January minutes, market participants have not materially increased their for the size right panel, of ON after liftoff, broadly similar 10th bottom-left panel, is also largely unchanged from the January survey.  The distribution of views remains skewed toward higher usage.

The first of two planned term RRP operations Thursday.

the Committee may wish to consider authorizing term tests over future RRPs as part of a strategy to RRP facility at liftoff or potentially at some other point capacity in the ON RRP allows sufficient headroom, even at quarter-end-putting the term and implementation, there is potential for money market rates to the federal funds target range leading up to the quarter-end. Lastly, quarter-ends.  If the Committee envisions using term limit the size of the ON during normalization, continued testing may be useful, particularly for operational readiness.  Even if the Committee plans to provide elevated facility-one that RRP test operations in place may also be helpful, particularly if liftoff occurs around a quarter-end date.  This is because, in the absence of public information about the Committee's intentions to trade soft reasons, the staff has outlined two options for authorizing such testing if to do so.  As discussed in a memo distributed prior to the the first option is for the FOMC to resolution that authorizes term RRP test operations for the June, Reserve to conduct those operations.  A resolution of this mistakenly interpret future decisions about testing term RRPs over likelihood of liftoff.  Alternatively, its current practice of authorizing term RRP test meeting regarding both approaches are provided in the event that the Committee decides to proceed with For these the Committee chooses meeting and outlined in the bottom-right panel, approve a September, and December 2015 quarter-ends.  This option is substantially similar to the resolution adopted for the 2014 year-end term RRP tests and authorizes, but does not obligate, the Federal kind would more closely align the authorization for term RRP testing with that governing testing of ON RRP operations and might reduce the probability that market participants quarter-end as containing information about the the Committee could continue operations each quarter, each time using a resolution approved at an FOMC well ahead of quarter-end.

Presumably, tests are designed to provide information to than waiting after the March meeting.  We would have as much lead time until the June quarter-end as at the end of March. MR. LACKER.

I am wondering why we are deciding this now rather until we provided when we decided in January to test

Doing it now in advance versus April, which would be more in line with it to be viewed as a technical adjustment and removes it market discussions about the timing of liftoff.  It has some technical benefits.  It lines up flexibility to we are going to use it or not.  I think those are the benefits of doing it now. MS.

No one thinks we are going to raise rates in April.  So, doing it in April we used in January wouldn't be some tipping of our hands.  We didn't MR. LACKER. with the same language tip our hands in January.

the reason they haven't taken a signal is because forward guidance has been in place. in MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, we went with $200 billion in January.  This one has $300 billion, so that would be a small change.  I agree with you completely.  We have been running testing operations for a long time now, and no one has taken any signal from those.  You could argue We are now going to enter a period, it appears, in which we won't have such forward guidance

So it is somewhat ironic that is the way some of the funds are actually reading that proposal. MR. ROSENGREN.  I am going to change the comment, then a question.  The comment is that money market funds had the probably unintended consequence, from the SEC's perspective, of encouraging some of the fund families to eliminate the prime money Treasuries, that

Treasury-only money market funds are becoming this period, so it is not an immediate example, at Fidelity-what do we think the money market fund behavior will be if rates in June?  What does that imply for money market funds using than holding longer-term Treasury securities?  As we move into periods in the money market funds to substantially increase their use of overnight RRPs just because caught with a potential capital loss if they were holding longer term?  What facility?  Are we surveying the Treasury-only The question is, to the extent that the more important-and that is going to be phased in over change, for they think that we might raise overnight RRPs rather which we don't know whether we will be raising rates-say, in June and September-would we expect they don't want to be does that mean for use of the overnight RRP money market funds on a regular basis to get a sense of the behavioral changes that might be

that management has changed for some of these, it becomes expected?  And, to the extent probably more important to sample a little more deeply than we might have in the past.

The staff is talking with the money funds on a regular basis, almost daily, doing in the operations that day or what they are planning to do over the weeks.  We haven't heard from the money funds any discussion that the anticipation trying to maintain their relationships private counterparties, given the constraints that they are seeing from some of those private losing that sheet.  And they are even willing to give up a couple of basis points to maintain those in the discussions. MS. LOGAN. related to what they are next several of raising rates is moving their expectations for usage of the overnight RRP.  Most of the commentary we hear from the money funds is that they are with counterparties, and that they are only coming to the overnight RRP when they are balance counterparty relationships.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  Let me start by noting that at your meeting, most participants agreed that it would be useful at coming meetings staff memo titled 'More Finalizing the FOMC's Operational Preparations for Liftoff' provided March minutes; these revised in light of your earlier comments.  At the end of the go-round and Plans by providing these additional in the minutes for this meeting; for reference, the bullet points are the end of this handout. MS.

Your of this cap might depend on your willingness to use term RRPs at purposes, an ON RRP cap of the take-up of both term and ON that we saw at year-end 2014.  It would also be more than 3½ times the largest to date.

Indeed, although as RRP take-up immediately after liftoff, a few market participants surveyed did rates persistently below the target range, or other money the Committee desired at liftoff because the cap Of course, there is chosen, could turn out Lorie mentioned, the majority of respondents to the Desk's surveys expect moderate ON anticipate that demand will be greater than $800 billion.  If that were the case and federal funds traded at market rates did not firm as much as was regularly being hit or market participants perceived insufficient headroom at the facility, you could subsequently increase the cap size.

Thanks, Jane.  In my remarks, I will discuss options available to the ON RRP cap, as presented in the memo titled 'Lowering At this January's FOMC meeting, most indicated that a temporarily elevated ON RRP cap would be appropriate At the same time, a the ON RRP facility is temporary and that it can be phased out once it is federal funds rate.

Specifically, once the aggregate level about $500 billion, banks' demand for reserves regularly for federal funds.  An ON RRP offering rate funds target facility would be expected to diminish.  This process would make elimination of ON RRPs straightforward.

If usage remains well below the elevated cap, that cap could be so long as the facility's remains sufficient.  Such a buffer might be on the order of $100 billion to and could potentially change over time to accommodate seasonal or Soon after liftoff, perhaps the most likely outcome is that ON RRP usage will remain well below the most recent Desk surveys expects that $300 billion with reduced with likely little effect on money market rates, headroom $200 billion other variation in take-up.

The in several ways to maintain example, policymakers could wait longer after cap, could lower the cap but be prepared to raise it if increased materializes, or could institute a cap that is responsive to demand. One potential complication with reducing the that underlying demand for ON RRPs some regulatory reforms potential for rising demand could be accommodated adequate interest rate control.  For liftoff to reduce the demand more interesting scenario.  If usage is high, the rate control of elevated ON RRP usage would need to be weighed against its costs.  In particular, substantial use of other supplementary tools In another scenario, rates remain well controlled and demand for ON RRPs could remain persistently high.  This is the ON RRP facility would likely be playing an important role in supporting rates, so the efficacy for interest carefully

However, the due to the IOER rate is unclear, so there is uncertainty increase might have to be term RRPs for ON RRPs.

there questions for Jane or Antoine before we begin the goCHAIR YELLEN.  Are round?  Governor Powell.

Really, if the concern is that is as much capacity as the supply, I guess the point would be that rates would be going up, which is MR. POWELL.  For Antoine.  We talk about $50 billion a month in Treasury sales.  Can you talk about the derivation of that? market has to accept our intention.  How do you think about why that is a hard limit, or could it be substantially higher?

could say one thing.  If you look at the amount of securities we portfolio that's three years or less, as Antoine said, it's about $800 billion.  And if time frame that's in this projection, the projection represents much you could do per month.  In some sense you are limited by what is time.

Of course, the later you wait to sell, maturities of securities getting shorter, and shorter-dated securities come into the window.  As you can see, that's in that's just in terms of what we have.  I guess Lorie can talk about the market have a lot of short-dated securities. are part why there's a kink here in this projection, because you kind of start running out of securities to sell.  But conditions.

POWELL.  What I'm saying is, if the exercise is to have rate control and put a floor MR. under rates, we'll always be making more short-term securities as time passes.

assets will the concern, if you start selling higher amounts, is the risk of a intention and the possibility that the sales could raise more MR. MARTIN.  I think it's undoubtedly right that selling these short-term help lift rates.  I think misperception of the Committee's than short-term rates.

don't think, operationally, we would have any limitation to sell moresold about $40 billion during the MEP, and that did put some upward pressure on rates.  And a demand for those securities.  That's why we have high overnight RRP are going to redeem very shortly, and we're just the the Treasury would then have to raise those funds, and that may as it would prefer.  That would be just one other factor that you have when you think about the pace of sales. MS. LOGAN.  I we in this context, there is usage. So, you would think there would be demand to sell them.  But all we are doing is just speeding up the redemptions.  The securities speeding that up by selling them.  I think the other consequence you have to think about is for Treasury.  It will be refinancing as we let these securities run off, and so we'd be putting more pressure on them to account not only for the securities that are rolling off, but also for securities that we're selling.  The not be as smooth a process to consider

it's a theoretical possibility, in the uncapped bids would aggregate to more than reserve MR. LACKER.  I believe it's the case that scenario, if every counterparty bid their limit, the account balances right now.  I believe you alluded to that fact, Jane.  So, what would we do?

First, let me say that it's true that if you took $30 billion per counterparty SOMA, but I think that's not a the 164 counterparties, I think 24 are banks who get imagine that the banks would be coming in when they could get IOER.  If you small.  Many tend to just be investing cash that any cash needs of the institutions that are members.  Freddie and Fannie come in, those are kind of special one-off that we know about.  The primary dealers are very sensitive to interest rates right now. they are finding market rates are higher, and as So it's really the the facility.  Right now, they have about $700 billion of short-term Treasuries or would say that might be an upper bound, but again, they have only been MS. IHRIG. times 164 counterparties, you would get more than what's in the very realistic number.  In part, if you look at IOER.  I couldn't look at the GSEs, they've been coming in quite they have for and they do come in around the cap when it's P&amp;I day, but situations They are not coming into the facility because long as market rates are higher, we wouldn't expect them to come in as well. money funds, and you'd want to look at how much of their portfolio you think they might want to shift into repos on their books.  I coming in a little over $100 billion over the past couple of months on average.

it's really unlikely, but you're not zero, are you?  We have taken a fairly risk-averse approach as a MR. LACKER.  I'd agree.  I'd find it persuasive that arguing the probability is Committee, and it seems to me we ought to have a plan.  What's our plan?

MR. POTTER.  President Lacker, can you outline exactly what event you are thinking about?

to cap it and stop it out at less than full allotment? equilibrium analysis.  In all these funds into the overnight RRP is going to have an money market rates, and that is going to prevent the funds from flowing into the RRP.  It can't be that you can just drain $4 trillion of reserves from the system and not market rates to rise, something that would prevent this outcome.  I really think it's MR. LACKER.  Wouldn't we have VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think you're doing a partial general equilibrium, the flowing of effect on overnight expect money impossible.

DUDLEY.  I am saying the probability is zero because it doesn't overnight RRP facility if doing so market rates?  It has to. VICE CHAIRMAN make any sense.  Why would all of this money flow into the would put significant upward pressure on other money

It's just that there are there in the market who are smart enough to do this math.  We call this 'uncapped,' would have to be some backstop, upper limit, or this cap to something-I don't knowof $2 trillion.  The only point I'd make about this is that calling this a suspension of is really a bit misleading, and the money market letters are going to smoke this out. MR. LACKER.  Look, I'm not arguing that this people out but we'd have to have some sort of cap.  There cap.

you have a two-hander?  President Rosengren. CHAIR YELLEN.  Did event than President Lacker.  Let's the time of liftoff that the cap is binding, so the federal funds rate is trading that we publicly announced.  We have two options.  We can either the IOER rate, which would be a Board of Governors decision, or we can raise or ON RRP.  So either we have to have an emergency meeting of the FOMC MR. ROSENGREN.  I have a less extreme tail suppose at substantially below the target change eliminate the cap on

meeting to decide if the IOER rate we decide to do the IOER, but we don't really understand what the and ON RRP.  After the Board has raised the IOER, we find out that's RRP. that night, or the Board of Governors has to have a formal goes up.  Let's say that spread is between IOER not sufficient either.  So then, following that, we have to eliminate or raise the cap on this action would be?  We seem to be viewing this as an innocuous event.  I IOER and that context-it seems, from a risk-management standpoint, it's highly and have no certainty whether it's binding or not versus no cap, at least at me a little bit more about the costs and benefits as you think about the what happens if there actually is much more demand?  I I think it could exceed $800 billion. think the likely behavioral actions around this time are highly uncertain.  I hope it's much less that.  If it's not binding, is binding, there's a very different events, and it's unclear how our plan is to react to that.  Can you talk a little bit more calculation? What do we think the market's reaction to the degree of uncertainty that the Federal Reserve has around guess thinking about the decision trees-whether we do ON RRP or whether we do how the market reacts in risky to have a cap initiation.  Could you tell benefits of that cap and think about don't think it's going to exceed the amount of reserves, but I than $800 billion, but I have no certainty about any of our estimates of both no cap and the cap have the same result, but if it sequence of about that cost-benefit

When I think about what I would do if I were a policymaker, I think about key considerations, which are, how certain are you about setting the cap, and how much do regarding those two can lean you toward setting a cap of a certain size, and you're very and you think that's more than plenty and you think that you won't even need you think you do, and that's just part of doing monetary MS.

I key concerns, which are, how comfortable are you at a certain cap size, much do you really care about monetary control right around the time of liftoff so that policy and it's not a big deal.  Or you're at the other extreme, where you're really worried that if we set a cap too low we'd be nervous, and it might hurt our credibility right at really critical time.  I personally don't have an answer that would state think that these are two and how you don't have to come back and make adjustments?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Further questions?  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  I have a quick question for MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, thank you, Madam Simon, which I should know the answer to.  If you were going to put the cap based on the size of the Treasuries we have in our portfolio, what would that cap number be?

Another important consideration for principles we've communicated to the public.  Further than confusion.  Both of always important, but it's arguably even more important as we begin to implement normalization.

the overnight reverse repo facility will be a memo lays out, various combinations of tools could be used to control of short-term interest rates and allow for the eventual phaseout of the overnight in a position of having to raise the cap after liftoff.  I think we would send a confusing have adequate interest control or that we're reconsidering whether or not the facility will be temporary.  That leaves lowering it over time as we gain liftoff and then imposing one later.  I don't have strong one seems consistent with the normalization plans that accompanied by appropriate communications. We've communicated our intention that temporary one.  As the staff achieve repurchase facility.  Regarding the initial setting of the aggregate cap on reverse repos, I'd rather not put us message, and it could undermine our credibility.  It could signal we don't rate me with the choice of setting a high cap at the start and then experience, versus setting no cap at preferences for one over the other.  Either we've laid out, provided it's purpose of whatever design choice we make, Then we need to reiterate that we to the extent necessary; that we plan to phase it out; and that phaseout over time; of this and our other tools.

I wouldn't want to putting ourselves in the situation of having to raise the cap at a later date.  Rather start without one.  As I read the staff perhaps in option 1 as well.  This gives me pause.  Even if today we think it reduce the cap size fairly soon after uncertainties surrounding interest hurt our credibility by having to go back on an earlier communication.  That's similar to my distaste for than commit now to a timetable, I'd prefer more general communication, as I just outlined. Thank you, Madam Chair.

moments ago, I think the an initial cap we are going to adopt?  To me, $800 billion seems like a size of our Treasuries portfolio, to $2½ trillion, whatever that calculation is that Simon alluded to.  Regarding how to liftoff, the case in which usage falls fairly rapidly of its own accord is MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  As I said just a few question is, what size of fine number.  I could support $1 trillion.  I could go up to the $2 trillion scale back usage after straightforward.  The harder case is one in which usage remains elevated and high.

memo, my attention was immediately attracted to the phrase began fantasizing about auctioning off our holdings of MBS and longTreasuries at a fairly rapid clip.  However, I suspect that option may fail to garner a the Committee.  In that case, I would favor selling short-term assets, a quantity sufficient to make reserves scarce enough would favor raising IOER above the top of the federal funds starting with 5 basis points and seeing what happens, moving to 10 or 15 basis As I reviewed the staff 'asset-side tools,' and I term majority of support from although it seems unlikely that we could sell any time soon.  As a third choice, I target range, points if that is not enough.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

we are raising the range for the federal funds it is critically important that we are successful in quickly moving the federal funds rate market response when short-term rates are initially raised above current against any cap on the ON RRP facility at the time of liftoff. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  President Lacker's fantasy is my nightmare.  [Laughter]  When we announce that rate, within the range and then keeping it there.

I think, though I'm honestly would favor something like an explicit commitment to reduce the cap early stage of normalization, but that the possibility of a little tools memo.

I think the specific invocation of other tools in the countering expectations not entirely sure, that I beginning within a few meetings following liftoff, because I believe that the imperative is to have a successful liftoff at the softness in the funds rate six or eight months later would not be damaging to our credibility. Also, a specific commitment of this sort would force us to make use of some of the other mentioned in the staff first group of speakers this morning, I'm not at all sure approach-which, by the way, whether it's reducing the no cap or $2.5 trillion cap at the outset is basically the same exercise.

By setting cap, we could err on the low side by ending up with a cap that initially binds, resulting In this as quickly as is prudent, impose a cap based on our initial experience.  We would initially refrain from imposing a cap because of a specific

On that front, I would say that obviously good quarter-end control the funds rate will be process. achieve relatively illiquid and not continuously on offer, and thus are less likely to facilitate bank runs than our overnight RRPs.  So, I would oppose discontinuing quarter-end RRP operations, as noted in our period of transition, the to make in-flight corrections, either operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis or We lean toward whether or not to actually conduct the operations, as was pointed out.

term RRP operations with term RRPs seem lower than those associated with overnight RRPs.  If overnight RRP take-up away raise unacceptable financial-stability concerns, we see term RRPs, not quarter-end RRPs, as the first line of defense.  Interest costs from the low, and term RRPs are likely to be nearly as effective as overnight After liftoff, we've looked at the remaining tools under consideration and have a few comments.  As previously indicated, we favor continuing end-of-quarter through at least early phases of normalization.  These operations help achieve good monetary policy control at quarter-ends, and the financial-stability risks associated likely to be from the quarter-ends is so high as to additional term RRPs are relatively

financial-stability risks are lower.  We agree to phase out reinvestment of principal sheet shrinks and both overnight and term RRPs are no RRPs in supporting short-term interest rates.

The best way to reduce that footprint is relatively quickly so that the balance longer necessary.

I do not have strong we have sufficient knowledge to judge the risk of an $800 billion aggregate cap versus a temporary suspension of the cap on or our footprint in markets.  Therefore, to ensure we will have the control we is temporary and capacity as needed, potential financial stability risks and issues should be minimal.  Accordingly, we should make sure all other tools are ready, the overnight RRP cap.  So, I would continue with the testing of the term facility.  And, by authorizing quarter-end tests for the remainder of the year, we reduce our this proposal. we preferences regarding whether that control should be achieved with an elevated cap or a suspension of the cap.  I don't think at this point relative financial stability seek, I would be willing to suspend the cap, if the Committee forms such a consensus.

If a high take-up rate materializes, and weigh the costs and benefits of alternative approaches in Turning to the strategies to limit very high overnight reverse liftoff, the best course of action is difficult to determine in advance.  And although, like President Lockhart, I think it makes a lot of sense to war-game in connection with that, I do think the appropriate the we will have to examine its causes this light.

In general, I see term RRPs as the tool for curbing demand for overnight reverse repos while still facilitating monetary in the context of the very high sustained usage of the overnight reverse RRP tool provides some flexibility, because we can of overnight reverse repos by raising the IOER rate.  Now, I find that we would be widening the target range for reasons other than monetary muddle our communications.  I am also concerned about the negative payments going to banks at a cost to the taxpayer might that case. Having said that, we were asked our preferred control.  Again, this is repo facility.  Importantly, the term determine the time and size of offerings.

Just think about the economics tighter overall Now, on the other side of the ledger, sales of short-term Treasuries would likewise provide a sensible of it.  It would put upward pressure on short-term rates while having little, if any, effect on longer-term rates.  However, as has been mentioned by President Rosengren and others, asset sales during the early stages of normalization could be misconstrued as signaling a

To me, right rate on excess reserves seems like the best way to resolve that remain open. With that said, I understand that we might well face tradeoffs between the size of the ON RRP further discussion of the now, it seems like the interest tension.  But, as I said, I

make is that I think having an occasionally binding constraint is experience with having a binding constraint.  If at which we have, say-I will just name a number-a $300 billion cap that induces us to have a very low federal funds rate at that time, I don't think that will be good in terms of both markets and our own with a binding constraint. One point that I want to a positive thing for us, not a negative.  It gives us we evolved to a point binds at quarter-end, and that see that as a negative at all.  I experience tomorrow.  I think the Committee is going to drop the word 'patient' had that discussion yet, but I do anticipate that happening.  Because I To wrap up with some final comments, I favor testing through year-end, if we do indeed drop the word 'patient' tomorrow.

comments on the wording.  I am comfortable with having the In the first sentence, there is a reference to 'the FOMC will use, when it I would suggest, Madam Chair, changing 'will' to 'intends to.'  I think sounds overly definitive and determinative.  Similarly, in the next sentence, '[w]hen the commencement of policy firming, the Federal Reserve will,' I don't necessarily want to get into the new game of defining what 'fairly And, I have a couple of update to our principles in the March minutes as proposed on page 3 of the staff handout, with three emendations. becomes appropriate.' 'will' economic conditions warrant would suggest replacing 'will' with 'intends to.'  Finally, President Williams raised, I think, a very good point that we

that were asked.  The first question is, should there be an aggregate cap on the at liftoff?  My counsel is that we not have a cap at liftoff and then set a the aftermath.  On the second question-general views on limiting the take-up after liftoff-in what the memo calls the 'complex case' in liftoff, I generally think control trumps the issues associated with potential financial instability.  I would MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have just a few comments on the two questions overnight RRP program reasonable cap during overnight RRP program which demand for overnight RRP is significant during the period after that interest rate not wish to put an artificial limit on overnight RRP if it would damage the Committee's interest rate control credibility.

in a large post-liftoff take-up scenario, as I understand them, include, one, rate to increase the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates; two, use the Term Deposit Facility; and, four, use some type of controlled asset sales The options raise the IOER term repo; three, use program.  I find myself in general agreement with the analysis in the memo evaluating these options.  Asset sales, in particular, would presumably be a slow approach to reducing dependency on a high-demand overnight RRP facility.  Even though I've advocated asset sales in the past, I don't think they'd be useful for this particular purpose, and I agree with President

The fastest and most direct response, in my opinion, would be to increase the spread between the IOER and overnight RRP rates. tool the Committee will need to rely upon in real time.  I'm not opposed to Rosengren in that assessment. raise the IOER rate in order to That seems like the experimenting further with term repo, the TDF, or both, to reduce reliance on a high-demand overnight RRP program.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Vice Chair. CHAIR

Chair.  On the first question, I favor cap and then imposing a cap based on expected usage.  I 'no cap' in place for maybe the six weeks between FOMC meetings so back to the next FOMC meeting without any drama.  Then you would just put the question marks concerning when are they going to put the cap in place.  In my opinion, that very low-key way of doing-it would avoid a lot of drama.  I'd set a cap after headroom so that the market could reasonably expect that it the term RRP slack?  That would allow you to operate safely with a lower overnight RRP cap. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam operating for a short time without a would actually keep the you'd come cap in place, so you wouldn't have to have a video conference.  You wouldn't have to have all of the would just be a that six-week period with sufficient would bind rarely, if ever.  I would supplement that cap with term RRP around quarter-end.  The reason is that we see usage increases around the quarter-end.  So why not just have take up that the series of term RRP tests that we're talking the next three quarter-ends-June, September, December.  Because you have the tests no errors of signaling to the market that liftoff was going to occur soon. To put that all in place, I would authorize about over in place, there would be That way, you could go 'live' if you actually decide to lift off in June, September, or December.

slightly more prudent than having a high cap because, obviously, little bit of tail risk that the high cap might not be high enough.  I also think it's superior To me, having no cap is there's a

March 17-18, 2015

much headroom you think you need so that it's not binding.  It is actually very terms of how much you expect the overnight RRP to be used over the medium because, by having no cap, you're not sending any message about how big you think the usage is going to be, how content-free in term.

memo made it very clear that we have managing the demand for overnight RRPs.  We can change interest rates, or we can drain the amount of excess reserves in the system.  But my it's premature to make a precise think all we really need to know at this point is that we have runoff and growth of currency outstanding, if we thought that a steeper usage were desirable.  It seems to me that we should see what happens may not have any problem at all that we need to address. think making too big a fuss about this now about how committed we are to monetary policy term. With respect to the second question, I thought the two broad sets of options in terms of the relative own view is a little different, maybe, from others'.  I think decision about what we should do.  I sufficient tools available to make overnight RRP usage go down faster than would occur just from balance sheet decline in overnight RRP after liftoff in terms of demand.  We The take-up of the overnight RRP could be low.  I sends a mixed message to market participants control over the medium that raising the IOER relative to the port of call.  Then the reserve draining tools, like the Term to going to the asset sales just because I think it would be very confident that that wouldn't leak out into a bigger market reaction in terms of financial much support, though, all the other people that have called for more would we do?  I think there are a lot Now, in terms of ordering them, I would think overnight RRP would be your first Deposit Facility and term RRPs, would be a second port of call.  I'm sort of where President Rosengren is.  I'm pretty averse hard to be conditions.  I would very work on a decision tree to understand, if this happens, what

I'd love to come up with better language, but anything that's more precise at this point.  Thank you, Madam Chair. One final thing:  I thought the language in the minutes was fine.

I'd also like Federal Reserve Bank of New York staff who have carried out the experiments that long way to persuading us that it will be possible to use the ON RRP tool to help and after liftoff. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm grateful to the staff for writing memos on these topics. to thank the have gone a achieve the target federal funds rates we set at primary aim with regard to the use of our new method of setting RRP rate must be to make sure insert and maintain the federal funds rate in the ranges that we decide and saying for years that we have the tools we need, and we've been as announced.

Now, I wish I had a probability figure to attach to the scenario in which, if we $800 billion, we'll hit $800 billion, because if that was an extremely low number, on the a smaller cap than a bigger one.

Obviously it will be better but I think that we just have to accept the fact no attention to developments that happen afterward.  So we're this, with enough people being around the table to persuade us that we'd better not be too flexible

I that, but it does seem like that's enough.  Again, I may be in a take the cap off MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll start by saying that I'm of the view that it's very To $800 billion cap.  It seems very likely-and, I think, today got even likelier-that we're going to be lifting off into a quarter-end. already prepositioned $300 billion of additional capacity in term over the quarter-end, which really is $1.1 trillion over the quarter-end and then $800 billion in equilibrium. four times the highest previous between-quarter-end take-up. can't give any assurances about minority.  That would be my first choice, although we also have the flexibility to after a week or so.

cap off, then I would say two things.  One, I would wouldn't preannounce either of these.  I would announce these right at a bad idea to give too much information.  For one thing, you want ahead of time, If we're going to go with taking the not preannounce this.  I the time of liftoff.  I think it's to overwhelm demand with supply here, and to the extent you send a long signal

March 17-18, 2015

ON RRPs to go up.  So I would wait.  In addition, I think risk in going without a cap for any long period of time.  There are really two risks. in the markets.  And the second is, if you're going to keep it on for two or three a chance that some kind of an event would happen-and there are plenty balance sheet. you give a chance for the demand for there's real One is that it's subject to a lot of criticism from people about being insensitive to the size of our footprint meetings, there really is of them that we have talked about-that could cause a real run to the going to do it, I wouldn't preannounce it, and I would do some off on the 16th or 17th, which are which the next three press conference meetings end, then I would want to prewould want there's no notice of it, and then, second, we impose a that is that I do support now authorizing, but not specifically deciding term RRPs at quarter-ends. So I would say, if we're sort of pre-commitment to imposing a cap.  Again, if you lift the dates on commit to imposing a cap no later than Date X.  I don't know what Date X is, but I to say that so people know.  First of all, cap.  And I would impose a cap that's $200 billion-ish over the non-quarter-end amount, and then I would continue doing $300 billion at quarter-end.  That's what I would recommend doing, and, of course, implicit in about, testing

is similar to Bill's, which is that we have a available.  I like lifting the IOER rate 5 or 10 or 15 basis points.  It is a perfectly to me.  In addition, TDF is a good tool.  We can do more term.  We can increase the RRP.  I think any and all of those would work. In terms of the tools, I guess my takeaway good set of tools useful tool size of the ON

that idea of using asset sales to shrink the balance sheet we promised to do.  If it's there to be done, I would take it.  Again, at that point when I do really like the idea of asset sales, but I think we've kind of promised not to do them for six months after liftoff, and I don't really think we can revisit that.  But let me just say after that six-month period, I really like the faster than

March 17-18, 2015

the risks that some have talked about are less. we've already six months earlier started shrinking the balance sheet, and things are moving along nicely, I think

I wouldn't so much eliminate 'fairly soon' from the last sentence as make it a lot kind of a a cap, and I wouldn't wait long.  Thank you, Madam Chair. I guess it goes without saying, then, that I like the proposed March minutes language, except stronger, particularly if we're going to go with no cap.  I would want to make some time-specific commitment to create

liftoff, and our deliberations suggest it is highly likely the off will take place at a meeting with a press conference, and, thus, proximate to MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Establishing monetary policy control should be our paramount objective at decision to lift quarter-end.

quarter-end, the risk, in the presence of a binding cap, of a downward drift in rates following the RRPs has has likely received some support from the zero that will be necessary to of these reasons, to minimize the federal funds rate falls below our target range immediately following liftoff, it would to operate initially without a cap. We have seen previously that demand for overnight RRP tends to rise at raising announcement of liftoff.  Moreover, our experience so far with demand for overnight taken place with rates near zero, where the floor lower bound.  So, we don't really know the level of overnight RRPs keep the federal funds rate in our target zone at liftoff.  For all risk that the be prudent significant cost to the temporary suspension of a cap to balance achievement of monetary control.  By contrast, I do believe the establishment of a money will be addressed by being unambiguous from the outset, as we have Furthermore, I don't see against that permanent overnight RRP facility would raise important risks of changing the structure of markets.  But these risks

March 17-18, 2015

the overnight RRP facility will be available only to the extent, and for the to reestablish effective monetary control.  For the same reason, I support frame at language that is proposed for the minutes on capacity 'fairly soon,' so as to avoid starting a debate on what, precisely, that away from levels of interest, we can more comfortably set a cap that is credible and that has the headroom.  By that point, it will also be clear that we have established monetary in this area will be less subject to doubts so that our been to date, that duration, necessary planning for the phaseout of the facility.  But I would be wary of trying to specify a time the outset, and I also am uneasy about using the reducing the means.  Once we have gained some knowledge about the demand for overnight RRPs near-zero appropriate control following liftoff, and our credibility risk tolerance can be a little greater.

protracted period, relative patterns that we have seen so far, I would support increasing the IOER rate and, rate.  Of course, we don't know precisely how a higher IOER rate will affect the demand take other policy options off the table.  Should it prove would be open to considering additional liability-side options, including term tools, rate, to limit the usage of the overnight facility over time. depend on the circumstances, which argues for addressing we have some experience with the new policy framework. If the demand for the overnight facility remains elevated for a to the usage thus, the gap between the IOER and the overnight RRP rates in order to reinforce the pull of the IOER for the overnight facility, so we shouldn't necessary, I in addition to raising the IOER Precisely what the mix will be will this issue only after purpose, nor the range of available liability-side tools at our disposal. into play could risk that being taken by markets as a signal regarding the monetary policy.  Deliberations surrounding asset sales should be determined By contrast, I do not believe that asset sales should be on the table for this do I expect it will be needed in light of Putting asset sales overall stance of

Then, in the says that we will '[a]llow aggregate capacity of the ON RRP facility to be I think it is, first of all, unnecessary, in view of these very clear existing statements our intentions and related things.

The Committee will use the extent necessary and will phase it out when it funds rate.' new addition, it temporarily elevated to support policy implementation.'  The issue associated with using 'fairly soon' is that about being in terms of weeks or even a month or two, and having this time dimension when, really, I think our discussion is around the economics of this and what there is a way to fix this.  Vice Chairman Dudley mentioned that he a replacement.  It could be that we could just have in that first sentence something to the repo facility to be temporarily elevated as may be stronger than that.  It's the I think could be misinterpreted, not only in the way you're talking about, lowering it from infinite to $1 trillion or something, but really more a that we are going to bring it back to a low level fairly soon.  That is my Now, I think that didn't have the effect of 'allow the aggregate capacity of needed to support policy implementation,' or something that 'fairly soon' that which is just logically misinterpretation concern.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Chair.  As I listened to the table, I heard a wide range of what 'fairly soon' meant being expressed. in what 'fairly soon' would mean.  So I Fisher would like, here it is:  'The Committee expects to reduce the available capacity of the facility at an time after it commences policy firming.'  I think it gets away from, if you are asked time frame is.  Well, it depends on the conditions.  That is what MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thank you, Madam discussion around the President Dudley talked about six weeks.  I'm happy with six weeks, but I also heard people talk about six months.  Those are pretty big discrepancies will offer up again my preferred language, which is more bland than President but appropriate a question, what the 'appropriate' means.  So I will offer that as a suggestion.

say on that, I appreciate President Kocherlakota trying to alternative worse than just I am afraid it reverts to this notion we will keep using the ON any more for any purpose.  But I like 'fairly soon.' MR. TARULLO.  If I could just help us get somewhere in the middle.  But I actually would find that taking 'fairly soon' out, because RRP until we really don't think we need it

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I see.

YELLEN.  Okay.  So let's go to the proposed March minutes language and see if issues outstanding.  First of all, President the FOMC will use,' to 'intends to use.'  And, in the subsequent sentence, you also 'will' with 'intends to.'  Can I ask, is there anyone who would be unhappy if to 'intends to' in both places?  [No response]  Okay.  So let's make that CHAIR we can reach agreement, and there are several Kocherlakota proposed a change in the opening paragraph, in which it says, 'the operational approach proposed replacing we change 'will' change in both places, from 'will' to 'intends.'

of the third bullet point.  On this, we have views on Tarullo, would be to remove the sentence entirely? And now we have the final sentence both sides.  I guess our options are keep it as is and leave 'fairly soon' in, or, I suppose the alternative you would see, Governor just deleting it to the substitution of 'appropriate MR. TARULLO.  I think that is what President Williams proposed.  I obviously prefer to keep 'fairly soon' in, but I think I would prefer time.'

YELLEN.  Deleting the entire sentence. CHAIR

MR. TARULLO.  Yes.

Well, if we are, then I am opposed to the facility, I think, because that used-it is the instrument-which is the direction in which think the 'appropriate time' language, or the 'as to the extent it is ON RRP that is going to get us monetary policy control. language.

CHAIR normalization augmentation, my guess would be it is something that maybe we should think about.  But the will be 'temporarily elevated.'  Isn't 'temporarily' enough this?  I mean, 'temporarily' is telling you that the intention is for it to be elevated for you that.  Maybe that is enough. MS. MESTER.  Well, okay, that first part of the last bullet point says to assuage a temporary period-unspecified, I grant

If you go back, President Mester, to the dynamic that I hypothesized, in place for another meeting is the best terms, then it can just elongate.

Let's see if we can issue that we need to today, which concerns the resolutions on term RRP testing. sheet with options 1 and 2 in front of you, option 2 at the bottom is the one that term RRP testing over quarter-ends for the remainder of the year.  Not everyone to comment on that?  [No CHAIR resolve the final If you have the would authorize weighed in on that, but I did hear during our go-round a considerable amount of support to approve authorizing testing through year-end.  Would anyone like response]

MS. BRAINARD.  I have a question, Madam Chair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

March 17-18, 2015

lift off at one of these quarter-ends.  Is this an authorization to also do term RRP at that make that decision intentionally at that point?  Or is this testing that or not we've got unlimited overnight RRPs? MS. BRAINARD.  I don't understand.  Suppose we temporarily suspend the cap, and we decide to quarter-end, and would we simply would take place whether would look at the circumstances.  We would contact the Chair.  The to any operations that we do.  We're just putting the authorization in place, tried to explain.  Whether we would necessarily use that capacity would depend a lot on MR. POTTER.  We Chair would decide on the terms, and we would be informing you.  You would have the chance, as always, to object as Lorie the situation we're in.

We make the announcements that the term transactions are going to take beginning of the month, which would be before the meeting, but if you lifted the cap, on the dates we had already announced or have a very low to make the announcement at the MS. LOGAN. place at the we could run very small operations cap to adjust for what you've decided.  But if you don't end up lifting off at that meeting, we would conduct them as we have been.  We would continue beginning of the month that they would take place on certain dates, but we may adjust the sizes based on the decision you make at the meeting.

I understand.  We're going to announce these at the announce the amounts at the beginning of the month? MR. POWELL.  I want to make sure beginning, but we don't would have announced, and we would say 'up to' and give them the MR. POTTER.  We provisional schedule.

the meeting. MS. LOGAN.  Right, but we would do the 'up to,' and markets would be comfortable with us adjusting those once they have known the decision at

We could do zero. MR. POWELL.

it would be a large cost for just holding a very small term operation. MS. LOGAN.  We could, or for credibility purposes, we may want to run them in very small amounts just because we committed to running something on a date.  You could cancel them, but I don't see

We could also run them at the same rate as the overnight RRP, and if to use it, they could at that point.  There's a lot of flexibility.  Actually, it would be to say we said 'up to,' but then have an operation that's smaller than just indicate that it is flexible in that way. MR. POTTER. people want at some point quite nice that and

thing?  If you preannounce that you're going to MR. POWELL.  May I just add one waive the cap, which I don't think we should do-

YELLEN.  I thought we weren't going to do that.  I thought the plan was that we waiving the cap. CHAIR would not preannounce

Judging what was said today, you would be announcing that at a meeting liftoff happens. MR. POTTER. at which

YELLEN.  We would announce it. CHAIR

MR. POWELL.  At the meeting.  Okay.  All right.

MR. POTTER.  One-day preannouncement.

MR. LACKER.  As I noted earlier, I'm going to decline to support term testing.

Since we put the oil prices have fallen back toward their January remain very low, boosting prospects for economic growth here and headline inflation rates. Beyond Greece and the number of global developments are exerting an unusually large influence on the U.S. economy.  Our near-term forecast for Brent oil about $10 per barrel counts March Tealbook to bed, spot Brent lows (not shown) as market participants focused on growing inventories.  All told, these prices abroad and, as shown in panel 4, depressing already low pass-through of previous declines in oil central bank to ease policy in recent months, including the Bank of seeking to avoid of their currencies.  Low prices for oil and other commodities have led several commodity exporters, such as Canada and Australia, to of emerging market We have inflation moving back up as the prices wane.  In principle, central banks should see through such transitory dips in inflation.  But concerns that falling inflation would destabilize inflation expectations have led several Japan and the ECB.  The ECB's decisions, in turn, have prompted a rush of rate cuts-including to below zero-in neighboring countries appreciation the central banks of provide greater monetary accommodation.  Finally, a number countries, notably China, loosened policy in response to varying combinations of weak data and falling inflation.

These are then aggregated across the cumulative policy changes are displayed over time.  By this crude measure, from late 2011 through 2013, foreign monetary conditions then they leveled off for a spell but, since last have become still easier. Panel 5 provides a crude summary recent years.  For 37 change tightening and a minus-one (-1) for countries, and admittedly became steadily more accommodative, summer, a number of influences on the U.S. economy. have pushed the broad real dollar have come to believe that a continuing market focus on in the prospects for monetary policy here and abroad, dollar up by capitulating to the trend of Monetary easing abroad exerts First, and perhaps most prominently, it pushes up the dollar, which would tend to contract U.S. exports and production.  As shown in panel 6, the combination of continued relatively robust readings on the U.S. economy, mounting anticipations of Fed liftoff, and actions by foreign central banks exchange rate-the black line-up some 4 percent since the time of the January Tealbook.  Going forward, we prospective divergences combined with ongoing anxieties about foreign economies, will push the further over the rest of this year.

To more on this latter channel, panel 7 shows that major economy yields have correlated, and the rundown in these yields since the beginning of Committee last week reviews some of heightened for safe assets in response to recent regulatory initiatives.  Second, investors risks fueling safe-haven demand for U.S. Treasury rates abroad may be encouraging investors While, as David will discuss, the higher dollar exerts appreciable drag on the U.S. economic outlook, foreign monetary easing has positive spillovers to the United States through two other channels:  It raises demand abroad, thus boosting our exports, and it focus a bit long been well 2014 is no exception.  A note circulated to the the reasons for the simultaneous decline.  First, yields here and abroad may be responding to common factors, such as fears of secular stagnation or demand may worry that weakness abroad may directly restrain the U.S. economy, leading to lower growth, inflation, and thus bond yields.  Third, anxiety about tail abroad-Greek exit or a hard landing in China, as well as anxieties about the global outlook more generally-may be securities and depressing our term premiums.  Finally, and looping back to the beginning of this discussion, lower interest to switch to higher-yielding U.S. assets, thus depressing our term premiums through portfolio-balance channels.

the low level of U.S. yields may all be valid to some they have different implications for the future path of yields, the dollar, those effects are depress U.S. yields for several years; all else being equal, unless a further in the dollar fully offsets the stimulus from these lower yields, the Fed's policy may have to rise faster to achieve the desired tightening of U.S. financial the foreign outlook and to be well founded, Federal Reserve policy may need to be in response.  Finally, a more complicated and ambiguous case is posed if our for the global economy materializes and risk in the United States and elsewhere may rise for easier Federal Reserve policy, regarding the relative strength of the factors watching global financial markets developments.  David will now continue our These explanations for extent, but and monetary policy.  If term premiums and yields are low because of portfoliobalance spillovers from accommodative foreign monetary policies, likely to rise rate conditions.  Conversely, if low yields reflect worries about those worries turn out looser relatively benign baseline forecast events pass quietly:  Longer-term yields quickly as risk premiums unwind, which would call but sentiment might improve and the dollar could fall, which would call for tighter policy.  In light of our uncertainties pushing down U.S. yields at present, we will be very carefully for clues about future presentation.

Part show, it happens to be more or less The small revisions that we've made to the domestic outlook lately surprising extent of the appreciation of the dollar and the plunge in dollar causes us to trim a little out of our forecast for the steeper net drop in oil prices December meeting put a bigger dent in near-term topline our baseline forecast for the longer-term longer-term inflation expectations may have crept down some in At long last, I'm finally that our forecast hasn't of the reason I'm going to say that is that, as I'll partly true. mostly reflect the oil prices.  The stronger growth of real GDP over the next few years, while the than we'd expected as of the PCE inflation; that said, core PCE inflation has been running below forecast, too. While we haven't yet seen fit to alter trajectory of inflation, we are keeping a close eye on a few shreds of evidence suggesting that recent years.

Average monthly job gains as measured in the unemployment rate in February was one-tenth higher than we present-came in a few basis points higher than we had Turning to the specifics:  The labor course than establishment survey have been running about 50,000 per month stronger than we had expected.  Although the projected, the employment-to-population ratio-which we think is giving a better fix on labor market slack at forecast as a result of slightly better-than-expected labor force participation.

But given the than we normally would be about development off as transitory.

Moreover, yesterday's industrial This morning's data on housing starts and permits were that is the easy the recent weakness in anticipated very substantial effects.

But the weak path of retail past three months is a production release was pretty drab, with manufacturing production estimated to have posted another small decline in February, and the figures for December and January were revised down.  All told, manufacturing IP now looks to be on track for zero growth in the first quarter. pretty bleak on their face, with single-family starts and permits both posting large declines in February-considerably underperforming relative to our expectations they would roughly tread water in the near term.

In the Tealbook, we reconciled these two developments by marking down structural productivity in history by enough to leave our estimate of the output gap roughly unrevised in issue of slack by providing measures of resource utilization gaps that we line shows the judgmental estimate that is reflected in the red line shows the production function version of the output models that we maintain at the Board. market, and price measurement error.

a little puzzled to see the unemployment rate revision to the unemployment rate is that we margin, this revised assumption will allow a slightly greater amount of labor the baseline forecast in light on the unemployment rate that we've had during the past would have revised up another 0.2 percentage Reverting to panel 1, you may be revised up by such a slight amount, in view of our more-guarded outlook for the path of real output.  The reason for the small extrapolated forward the slower pace of structural productivity growth to the tune of 0.1 percentage point per year.

If we had left our supply-side assumptions unchanged in this projection, the unemployment rate point or so over the medium term.

assumptions that we rate as better balancing the risks in judgment that probably not all of the extraordinarily low level of longterm premiums, and that lower equilibrium may have been playing a larger role in driving the downtrend in recent I should also briefly mention our deliberations over two other use to calibrate the longer-term forecast.  First, we revised down our estimate of the long-term equilibrium funds rate by ¼ percentage point.  As was reflected in the discussion we provided in the Tealbook, the confidence intervals surrounding this parameter are a mile wide, but we view the lower light of our term rates around the globe reflects low interest rates years than we previously thought.

percent, which is the same level that we At least two factors militated We also debated whether to lower our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment from its current level of 5¼ think prevailed just prior to the Great Recession.

the eve of the financial crisis and recession, the moving onto disability rolls also tend to have higher unemployment rates, and the rate is lower now than we think it was before the recession felt distinctly the historically large increase in permanent job long-term unemployed still make up an unusually large share may still not be as efficient as it was before the crisis.  Furthermore, in light of curve is, wage and price inflation are doomed not to be in this regard.  Finally, we think we've probably had some tendency toward making such a downward revision.  First, younger workers tend to have higher unemployment rates, and since share of these workers in the labor force has declined.  Second, workers at the margin of number of individuals reporting themselves as out of the labor force because of a disability has increased significantly since 2007.  However, moving to assume that the natural uncomfortable, especially in view of losers, the fact that the of overall unemployment, and the suggestive evidence that matching in the labor market how flat we think the Phillips very informative in the past to adjust our estimate of the natural rate to hew too closely to movements in the actual rate of unemployment.  In the end, after many hours of debate, we left our assumption unchanged at 5.2 percent, though with no pretense of having settled the issue.

5 summarize the inflation outlook.  As shown in panel 4, the recent discussed led us to temper the decline in headline for the current quarter, relative to our January we expected in January.  Most of this miss was attributable to lower-thanservices and core goods prices; because we don't expect medical continue to expect that inflation will pick up as import prices accelerate, we did not carry downward surprise to core inflation beyond the near term. Panels 4 and upturn in crude oil prices that Steve PCE inflation that we are projecting projection.  However, as you can see from panel 5, core PCE inflation has come in softer than expected medical services prices to continue to surprise to the downside and we goods price forward the back toward your Over the remainder of the medium term, the inflation forecast is essentially the same as in recent Tealbooks, featuring a slow upward creep 2 percent objective.

inflation expectations are well anchored-an assumption that we have central role of inflation expectations in 6 presents some data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters inflation rate for headline PCE price inflation.  This inflation measure, has dipped to 2.1 percent, its lowest level ever.  Thus far, we are not inclined development as persuasive evidence that longer-term inflation to deteriorate.  First, the most recent decline appears to the change in the composition of the survey panel; holding the panel's The staff's medium-term inflation forecast is predicated on the assumption that longer-term maintained in the latest projection.  Given the our analytical framework, we have been keeping our eyes peeled for evidence that those expectations might be starting to come unmoored, either on the upside or on the downside.  Panel that we found a little disquieting in that regard.  The black line shows the SPF's median 10-year average expected measure, like the Michigan survey's long-term expected remained pretty flat in recent years.  However, as shown by the red line, the SPF long-term CPI projection has moved down more noticeably in recent years and most recently has to view this expectations are starting reflect

over this horizon would probably give us a better read on discussion is putting a professional forecasters, who are the professional forecasters are reluctant to be seen objective.  All told, we will certainly composition constant, the first-quarter median response for the CPI forecast would have remained at 2.2 percent.  Second, a measure that focuses on CPI expectations 6 to 10 years ahead has declined less over the past few years; we would expect that respondents' projections what they view as inflation's longer-term anchor.  Third, this fine point on small changes in the expectations of not, after all, the people setting wages and prices throughout the economy.  But, by the same token, we are wary of taking too much comfort from the stability in the PCE responses because it could be that as betting quite so overtly against your 2 percent be keeping a close eye on these and other measures of inflation expectations going forward.  Don will continue.

Consequently, only one will go below its longer-run normal level by more than 0.2 percentage point, down from six in December.  As the bottom panels indicate, all of you marked down your

the paths of assumption have you made on Chinese foreign exchange policies? MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Steve, in your projections of real dollar indexes, what

We're assuming that China's exchange rate is flat through the end of the MR. KAMIN. year.

Against the dollar? MR. TARULLO.  Flat?

March 17-18, 2015

MR. KAMIN.  Flat against the dollar for the remainder of the year, and then, after that, they allow it to again start appreciating at a very slow, around 2 percent, pace.

MR. TARULLO.  Relative to the dollar?

through, the effect so that even though they have actually allowed their renminbi to depreciate slightly to point out-over six months, because the dollar has been rising against most other currencies, the RMB that, at a minimum, they'll continue to depreciate it very working assumption in our projection is to keep it flat until the end of the MR. KAMIN.  Again, relative to the dollar.  As you're thinking it far has been against the dollar-very, very minimally, as Simon is using finger language the past also has been rising.  Our view is slightly further, but our year.

But if one believed that they were likely to adjust their policy so as to renminbi appreciation on a global trade-weighted basis, but to depreciate the dollar, would that change, in a nontrivial way, the projections of real dollar MR. TARULLO. continue to have somewhat against indexes?

way.  They've already been doing appreciation, but less broad, real trade-weighted appreciation than they have now been trade-weighted appreciated very strongly because they're following the dollar up. MR. KAMIN.  Yes.  Let's put it this if they basically wanted getting, then, if the dollar continued to rise at its previous pace, they would have to depreciate against the dollar more strongly in order to make that happen.  Right now their RMB has

They've moved up their fix, and the trading band has widened.  One trading band and just let the CNY trade at the top part of that. MR. POTTER. choice would be to widen that Remember, it's not a convertible currency.

If you were thinking that somehow they wanted to go back to a balancing in a big way, but just not deliberately. MR. KAMIN. trend, they're actually already doing that

TARULLO.  Lael, do you want to follow up? MR.

To the extent that they widen the band because it's already up at the much in terms of our trade, and how much does that affect our GDP forecast? MS. BRAINARD. top of the band and they slow, essentially, the rate of appreciation against the world, how does that matter to us because China accounts for about 20 percent of our change in the pace at which the RMB moves for the overall value of the dollar. very small depreciation of the RMB against the dollar that they've been in previous periods, are all very much second order compared with the dollar's the euro and others.  For plausible changes in the rate in against the dollar, it might not make much of a material MR. KAMIN.  It could be material trade-weighted dollar, and so a reasonably large against the dollar would, indeed, have important implications Now, I will say that the doing lately, as well as the relatively small appreciation of the RMB against the dollar that had been taking place movements against other currencies, like which they would change the RMB's value difference, but if they wanted to make some big changes, then it certainly could have implications.

A 30 percent gap has opened up between the the advanced foreign economies.  What does have depreciated by 30 percent against the emerging market economies?

Yes.  Basically, the foreign industrial countries have depreciated against MR. KAMIN. the dollar more than have the emerging market currencies.  Therefore, the AFE currencies must have depreciated relative to the emerging market currencies.

The emerging market economies, relative to us, still look more or less six years? MR. FISCHER. where they've been for the past five,

EME currencies has not changed so much is because China is in about 20 percent of the trade-weighted dollar.  EMEs are around, if for a big hunk of the non-China EME currencies, they've moved the dollar than you would see just from MR. KAMIN.  Well, harkening back to our earlier discussion, first of all, one of the reasons why the aggregate of the aggregate.  China is memory serves, 55 percent of the trade-weighted dollar.  China accounts EME aggregate, and, therefore, when you look at much more.  They've depreciated much more against that picture.

CPI inflation for the next 10 years from the Survey of Professional Forecasters was the rate of change, and one level.  I'm not quite sure.  What makes you look at the rate of change? MR. FISCHER.  Right.  Then the other question was for David.  David, I'm never quite sure when there's a move in the mean of some expectation.  For example, for the average expected 3.3 percent in 1995, and it is now approaching 2 percent.  You look at could look at the the profile of responses is because an inflation expectations are anchored.  That's current projection, and on the lookout for evidence that could call that into in the towel on that touchstone we MR. WILCOX.  Part of why we're looking at important touchstone of our projection has been that been our statement, full stop.  We've maintained that assumption in this we feel obligated to be vigilant-to be question.  The CPI responses haven't yet caused us to throw

For suppose it's really the CPI forecast that matters for their clients' more normal spread between the CPI and the PCE index has been neighborhood of 30 basis points than 10.  If you took that historical from the 2.1 percent that they're currently reporting, you'd have something that's for a longer-term PCE inflation expectation.  In level terms, where we, at the But, as I suggested, any further The level vigorous conversation about these professional forecasters, interests.  Historically, a something more in the average spread in the neighborhood of 1.8 percent to go to your question, that wouldn't be particularly worrisome because that's moment, have pegged our longer-term inflation expectations. downward movement from there would begin to give us some greater concern.

Okay.  Well, I suggest we follow this up when the meeting concludes that we want to make progress. MR. FISCHER. because I have a feeling that in the survey that we do with dealers which asks five-year, five-year-forward expectation-we're not seeing We've seen a little bit, and these are pretty similar people to those who MR. POTTER.  Can I just say explicitly for their assessment of the that much of a change. submit to the Survey of Professional Forecasters.

It feels like the water temperature has just moved up from MR. expectations from the SPF regarding inflation in the consumer price database, they too show less downward movement.

I think we attitudes are affected by gasoline or, effectively, oil prices. more what went into your forecast of oil prices and how because you're showing oil prices there's some interplay prices. of future prices.  There's a lot of noise in the market today on both sides of this question of whether oil prices This is, I know, a little bit of a roundabout question, but can you talk a bit about your in your

Actually, it is based on futures take the futures curve for different categories of oil out several that represents the basis for our forecast.  Frankly, that's the best basis we can come MR. KAMIN.

that we basically used for decades.  And moving into 2008 when fluctuations, there was a lot of concern on the part of we could improve it.  In the event, we we couldn't improve it by very much.  One thing we could do was take a look at with our own, and if there were the futures curve for oil prices to take that into account.  We effect on our forecast path is not great.  Right now, we alter the path to 0.5 percent per year, which is very little if you take into account the fact that we may exchange rate appreciation than the market, to take into account That was the approach oil prices were experiencing tremendous the Committee that our forecasts weren't very helpful in predicting the future.

will reduce already and in declining investment in the energy sector. Another premise that seems to underlie the upward curve is that, over time, declining rig counts seemed so tangible that markets decided they were sure that, prices rose and the whole futures curve rose. Basically, we're stuck with the futures curve, and the upward slope is predicated on a couple of very reasonable premises.  One of them is that, over time, the low oil prices the incentive for production and production should decelerate.  And we're certainly seeing evidence of that in declining rig counts Directionally, that's a very reasonable premise, and that should give you, eventually, some upward tilt to prices. the global economy should strengthen, and that, too, should lead to some increase in prices. Again, the direction seems reasonable.  What's happened since January has been, first, the evidence of indeed, production was going to slow, and so oil

March 17-18, 2015

markets took note of soaring inventory levels, and as concerns emerged these inventories might actually exceed the storage capacity available to put aside this oil, sense an overflow of oil onto the market, those oil prices Then more recently, as that thus basically leading in a figurative have come back down.

are reasonable explanations, and that leaves us, again, with our upward tilt for oil lot of conviction that for sure that's going to transpire?  No.  There have how low oil prices could go, analyses looking at different fields in terms enough to bring oil prices back up. the longer term, the oil should start trending upward. Those prices, but do we have a been a lot of analyses of of what are the operating costs for those fields.  Those analyses suggest that oil prices could go down to $40 per barrel before you see shutdowns significant We do have a lot of uncertainty.  It seems perfectly reasonable that, over prices

I want to estimate for the first quarter of 2014 because you made the choice that the was all potential.  That's a tough judgment, I understand that, and I was reminded of looked at the staff's decomposition of potential GDP:  You've got 1.6 percent for wonder if you were instead just 2014:Q1 as a missing observation-never even saw that number and used monthly data it-some Kalman filter might put something in between there.  I think the Could you discuss again your thinking on that? MR.

And I look at this curve is alive and well here. relationship seems to be why people have so much confidence.  The important go back to the GDP bad number that when I 2011 and 2013, half a point for 2014, and for 2015, it's 1.6.  I treating to forecast implications of this choice are modestly important because those gaps would be more negative if we had that.

WILCOX. Bill, does this fall into your supply-side portfolio? MR.

try to be helpful. MR. EVANS.  I tried to mention this at the outset of the question so that you could think about it while I was talking.  [Laughter].  I

continue to consider 2014:Q1 GDP are treating it as measurement error.  Because we don't gap, we also build that into potential may not be the right assumption. MR. WASCHER.  I think the basic answer is, we growth as anomalously weak, and we want to let that measurement error affect our estimate of the output.  That may or on a hypothesis like that, MR. EVANS.  It is very unusual to put a 100 percent weight though, isn't it?

March 17-18, 2015

MR. WASCHER.  We put a lot of weight on that explanation.

Now I heard the discussion about the choice you made about the natural that after careful consideration it might be not the right time to move it down to 5 from more of an gap than looking at unemployment, you might kind of go, 'Well, a lower natural rate larger gap, too.'

But if you made the judgment in the first quarter of 2014 that there was output would be more in line with a back, do you still have

CHAIR YELLEN.  Vice Chairman.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have a question for Steve. terms of the implications for the economic growth outlook, in your VICE CHAIRMAN How unusual is dollar appreciation of this magnitude over this period of time?  How concerned should we be about it in opinion?

In terms of the big picture, there have been two much larger long swings the 1970s-one of them in the early-to-mid 1980s, and then We did take note of the fact that our upward revision to the average level of the dollar We looked at our data going crisis, around early 2008, to see whether we had made other revisions that we just did was the largest.  But there were a few in the 5 percent crisis, but basically we are in very unusual MR. KAMIN. in the dollar since we floated in more recently in the late 1990s, peaking in 2002 and coming down.

I view this as a very different episode, because U.S. fiscal policy getting so much firming of the dollar.  I guess I am a concerned VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  It analysis, because the 1980s fiscal policy in the United States, which drove up U.S. real rates really high, causing capital to flow here to push up the is pretty neutral, and we're citizen.

my colleagues and I have certainly started to think a might be the case if we really are at the-not really the beginning now, the earlier stages of another what I will call 'dollar super cycle.'  Now, what is true, that the most recent dollar super cycle in the late 1990s was actually very much a is. that analysis, looking at those earlier episodes to see what dollar is going to continue to go up, we are cognizant of the risks. MR. KAMIN.  I take your point, and little bit more about what but let's say of course, is feature of our strength.  But that may not be true this time, although to some extent it Anyway, we are going to continue clues they might have for the future.

The Sierra ski resorts are short of snow, and Honolulu was a few degrees cooler Of course, we will run out of water at the West Coast.  This resulted in losses for time-sensitive cargo, including perishable goods.  However, with workers back on the docks, and a tentative labor ratified, any hiccup in GDP growth should be modest. We did have our own transitory setback to business activity from labor disruptions ports along the foods and seasonal retail agreement likely to be

that economy's sustainable benchmark economic growth.  This is evident in the Tealbook, which has lowered the average growth half of last year and the first half of this year, by almost half previous meeting.  And, to a lesser extent, I have also revised down expectation regarding the growth rate of potential output.  Continued weak productivity we will discuss in a minute, remain hurdles for potential growth. Some of the disappointment in the recent spending data also seems to reflect expectations were set somewhat too high, particularly for the for rate of potential output in the second a percentage point since our my growth and stagnant labor force participation, as faster sustained of potential, I have also revised down my average real GDP growth over this year and next year by a couple of tenths to medium-term projections for unemployment and inflation, however, are a June funds rate liftoff.

In fact, I Since December, with a slower underlying pace forecast for 2½ percent.  My modal little revised, as is my assumption of that monetary policy seeks to overcome the inflationary headwinds from a stronger dollar and lower commodity prices

My assessments of the appropriate year and next year control policy reported in Tealbook, Book B.  Research by myself and others has highlighted the good performance of difference rules, like that reported in robustness particularly relevant today.  In fact, given that my projection for higher inflation and a touch lower unemployment than the Tealbook baseline, my projected path is somewhat

changed, despite a fairly dramatic shift in months.  Quantitative easing by the ECB has helped push here and abroad.  As described in the box in the size of these effects, the ECB's QE program either calls for funds rate.  Of course, to the downside, the U.S. growth outlook will While a negative shock from Europe remains an appreciable downside risk, despite upside risks as well.  Notably, household formation has long-awaited recovery in single-family housing may finally get going this year.  Overall, I view the risks to the outlook as broadly My medium-term outlook is relatively little financial conditions over the past few up the dollar and lower longer-term interest rates Tealbook, depending on the relative no change or even less accommodation in the optimal path for the federal if foreign economic growth does surprise deteriorate. the ECB's actions, we face potential recently jumped, which could portend that a construction balanced.

with the recent spending news, the employment data have been amazingly In contrast good.  Besides creating jobs hand over fist, the unemployment rate has fallen more than

March 17-18, 2015

to under 5 percent by the end of plentiful.  In view of the surprisingly broad base of been seeing, there is a very good chance that pessimistic.  For example, let me do a little months at the same pace that we years.  Just assuming the same average pace we saw the past 24 1 percentage point over the past year, and I expect it to decline this year, falling below my estimate of the natural rate of 5.2 percent.  Other measures of labor market underutilization have also made significant progress.  Involuntary part-time employment has fallen, job vacancies are piling up, and households that believe jobs are hard to get are balanced by those believing jobs are sustained improvement in labor markets we have my unemployment rate forecast will prove to be simple math here.  The labor market improves over the next 12 have seen over the past few months continues for 12 more months, the resulting U-3 unemployment rate will fall below 4½ percent, and the U-6 measure of underemployment will be closer to historical normal levels by spring of next year.

that hasn't made obvious improvement is the labor force rate.  Like the Tealbook, I expect only very modest cyclical recovery in labor force 2007 reflects trends that predate the Great Recession.  And new research and a member of my staff investigates this issue from the perspective of how an rate varies with income. The one labor statistic participation participation going forward.  As I have argued before, much of the large drop in participation that has occurred since by Bob Hall individual's participation is on the so-called prime-age individuals who are 25 to 54 years old-a little bit tired of-and might be expected to show the greatest cyclical to 54-yearin prime-age participation since the start of the The focus category I am getting a rebound in participation.  Let me say it again.  Basically, we are focusing just on 25olds and looking at what has happened to their participation over the past couple of decades. What they find is that virtually all of the decline

March 17-18, 2015

Recession can be attributed to the decline associated with individuals in households whose are above the median.  It is the higher-income households that have had the drop in lower income.  This finding suggests that an improving labor market and these higher-income individuals back into the labor force. be at work, especially because these income-based trends to have begun actually back in around 2000 or 2001.  Altogether, this analysis implies the economy Great incomes participation, not the greater job availability may not drive Other more secular factors appear to appear that only a very modest recovery in labor force participation can be expected as improves.

the recent soft readings, my core inflation projection is essentially unchanged for the of this year and through 2017.  In this projection, the disinflationary impulse arising lower unemployment rate trajectory.  Therefore, I end of next year.  Thank Finally, turning to inflation, the recent stronger dollar and lower oil prices have pushed headline inflation down, and, to a lesser extent, have had the same effect on core inflation. Despite second half from the energy price shock is confined to the first half of this year, and the effects of the continuing dollar appreciation are offset by a still expect that we will achieve our 2 percent inflation objective by the you.

my take on the incoming data, I've marked down I've left the basic narrative of my forecast unchanged.  I have real GDP the Tealbook projection over the next three much the same as that of the Tealbook.  I have not yet fully path of the economy.  We have argued that the economy is in a 3 percent world, or a to mid-2013.  That's been the basis 2 percent world for the forecast horizon.  The Tealbook forecast is now in turn, reflective of lower Turning to the national economy and once again my near-term economic growth, unemployment, and inflation forecasts, based on the tone of the data, but growth about a half of a percentage point above years.  Otherwise my outlook looks bought into the downshift reflected in this meeting's Tealbook outlook.  In internal discussions in our Bank over the past two years, my staff and I have employed a simplifying device to describe the 2 percent world that prevailed from the start of the recovery of our economic narrative.  The staff preparing the Tealbook seems to have concluded the economy is back in that underpinned by slightly lower longer-term growth potential that is, productivity growth.  The staff seems to expect a fundamentally slower economy over the medium term.

the forecast risk to economic growth and inflation tilted to the downside.  I find the of the current economic growth and inflation data versus the payroll concerning.

I do expect this decline with an increase in labor input as measured by per capita employment and per capita hours.

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have become a bit more outlook for economic growth, for several reasons.  First, as many have noted, a economic a positive.  But I significant conundrum right now.  Payroll growth looks to be employment growth falter in response to weaker-than-expected in line with recent payroll trends?  I was a bit surprised the Tealbook both revised down its Q2 real GDP growth estimates and revised up its in Q2.  I expect the conundrum to be resolved by some convergence have much confidence the brunt of the adjustment. VICE CHAIRMAN worried about the broad array of indicators have shown less forward momentum right now in terms of activity, with real GDP estimates for Q1 and Q2 coming down significantly.  Some are taking comfort from the strong recent payroll employment growth trends, and that is think we actually have a unsustainably strong in relation to the underlying trend of GDP growth.  So the question I would ask is, why couldn't payroll demand rather than demand growth rise that expected payroll gains between economic growth and payroll employment growth.  But I don't about which side is going to bear are some reasons to be more pessimistic about the outlook for One issue we have already talked about is the is only just beginning to be felt. previous meeting I said that the dollar's strength was an important risk to the outlook, and This issue seems to be shifting I would encourage the staff to consider in the Tealbook a more extreme Second, I think there economic growth over the medium term. consequence of the dollar's persistent strength, which I believe At the the dollar has appreciated significantly further since that time. from a risk to a reality.

I note that right now a much stronger alternative scenarios in Steve Kamin basis, the U.S. dollar interest rates and QE are interacting in Europe implications these have for capital flows and currency valuation.  It may be that euro currency weakness.

For several reasons, my expectation is that oil and gas investment will fall prices, especially on Intermediate.

It the United States continues to increase, and prices, despite a very cold winter, remain very low.

United States will run out of storage capacity, remembering the fact that the United prohibits the export of crude oil.  If this was the case, we could expect the WTI-Brent could see Brent oil prices falling further, too. Second, as others have noted, there is some risk that if production continues to outstrip demand, the States spread, currently around $10 a barrel, to widen even further.  Of course, if global storage capacity began to run out as well, we much that is surprising.  Core services prices are rising about should persist for some time, as the dollar to show through.

We pushed down our medium-term unemployment rate trajectory slightly so that 5 percent estimate would help pull productive capacity of the United States, and it would also help push inflation back faster toward our 2 percent objective.

The second is that despite the relatively low rate of unemployment, core inflation, expected a year ahead shows few signs of raising its head. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  We face two significant puzzles in understanding the current macroeconomic situation.  The first is have been improving impressively.  Hiring has close to SEP estimates of the natural a good deal inflation, even

That's could be a GDP data problem, one that would lessen as successive GDP data but I suspect that even the final data will continue to show that fallen dramatically.  This could reflect the mix of economic growth, with 1 percent and a growth rate of 2 percent is 100 percent.  This means it's not directly relevant to our immediate policy concerns, which relate to unemployment. Now, by definition, the first puzzle-the difference between GDP growth and employment growth-can be explained by the behavior of productivity, but that just pushes the problem to another question, which is, can we explain the behavior of productivity? difficult.  It estimates are presented, productivity growth has employment gains being more weighted than usual to low-tech and low-productivity service jobs.

All of those carry at least some the international financial sector if, as appears at least possible, large Brazil is not a small emerging market, so if tensions and rise there, we may see some spillover in other parts of Latin America. An additional international issue-which is, I think, beginning to loom a bit the situation declines, the rise risk of spilling over into Brazilian companies have difficulty servicing their external debts-in particular, obviously, dollar-denominated external debts. problems do begin to drag on economic growth.

March 17-18, 2015

goes back to China-as my little colloquy with Steve Kamin during the quite likely that China is going to change its exchange rate to appreciate on a global trade-weighted basis but will depreciate against the that's the side, and I count the dollar as mostly an externally driven phenomenon for these what even reassessed fundamentals would have suggested.  There are momentum trades in which people just get caught up in the direction of bets, and they sometimes overshoot.  Second, as I was alluding to with Brazil, under conditions of the dollar strengthening, those abroad who hold dollar-denominated debts sometimes find it more difficult to roll those debts over.  Thus, they're required to go out and get dollars by selling domestic resources, which, of course, strengthens the dollar.  Third-and this staff briefing suggested, I think it's policies in reaction to a sustained dollar appreciation, and that they will change the band so the renminbi continues dollar.  That, I believe, is going to actually be a stronger response to the degree that the dollar itself continues to appreciate.  For all of those reasons, I think it's more than a small possibility that dollar strengthening continues beyond what's projected in the Tealbook.  So international purposes.

months, when the dollar's strength seemed to be the only warning sign for the domestic economy, a recent string of data at least gives some how we're doing domestically as well.  And I would say that, since that in the month, just about every number has been disappointing. Wilcox, I believe, mentioned the retail sales numbers, which probably ought to apply a year.

As far as the overall development of the economy since the January meeting is concerned, we've had two stronger-than-expected employment reports balanced-and probably more than balanced-by a run of weaker data suggests a modest weakening, let's call it, including the manufacturing reading; the Michigan survey.

Low oil will support consumer confidence and spending, and they'll also hold down inflation, a little while longer than we expect.  I think we will see continued strong job growth, also support consumer spending.  I Overall, I continue prices perhaps for which is based on stronger business confidence, and that will believe the dollar is going to be a significant headwind and threatens to be an even bigger one.

to watch the co-movement of rates, the dollar, breakevens need to be taken with a grain of salt.  The pattern supports the view in one of the memos that a lot of the movement of long-term rates-and breakevens, and global flows, which probably don't have expectations.  That's not to express great inflation, but just to say I don't think there's a big signal in and will need careful monitoring. On inflation, it has been interesting breakevens, and the price of oil in the intermeeting period and before that.  Of course, the spot price of oil tells us nothing about inflation 5 to 10 years ahead, which does tell me that the longer-term expressed in particular-has been driven by global events important long-term implications for inflation confidence in the situation regarding breakevens.  And I admit that's far from certain submissions.  I did lower my estimate of the natural did reduce my estimate of the longer-run neutral federal Tealbook, but I think reasonable likelihood that unemployment will decline more than the Tealbook forecast, the headline unemployment I have a couple of points on my SEP rate of unemployment to 5 percent.

It's worth pointing out 210,000 per month, which is certainly lower than the level of recent history and-as President George, I think, pointed out-lower the rate declines to around 5 percent.  I'm reasonably confident that we will see an inflation later this year, but I would emphasize that it's actually, to me, very notable there is around the inflation creation process as well as the natural rate of which are tremendously important in the short term.  In fact, I would say the alternative scenario that the staff offered at our Board further to 4¼ percent; productivity and economic growth are a little bit and inflation is a little bit lower, thanks to the wider unemployment gap.  Now, that's not is certainly that.  But it me as not at all wildly implausible.  So I think that, as we get closer to full of these supply-side constraints become ever more To conclude, as a modal case, I do see inflation returning to 2 percent as unemployment increase in how much uncertainty unemployment, both of that I found some real attraction in meeting on Monday.  In that scenario-this echoes what Governor Fischer was talking aboutthe natural rate declines higher; just a more pleasant way to align the output and unemployment gaps.  It also strikes employment, the level and character important.

Employment has shown further strong gains, while inflation has softened further away from the 2 percent target.  My outlook for the economy has darkened somewhat, in light of the strong headwinds from the continued appreciation of the dollar and lackluster domestic spending.

Since we last met, the data for January and February paint a noticeably stronger picture of employment growth. quarter.  Since December, labor utilization have all improved:  The unemployment rate has edged lower, the time for economic The news the economy is moving closer and the revisions to previous months In particular, payroll growth is now reported to have averaged 280,000 in the second half of last year and appears to have maintained that pace into the current measures of participation rate has moved up, and the number of employed working part reasons has declined.

Once those price movements might expect to see headline prices moving fairly close to the underlying rate of low, according to the recent The 12-month change in core PCE prices in January was 1.3 percent, similar to the rate a In that regard, I note that even the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas trimmed mean rate was only 0.7 At the same time, the news on inflation suggests our 2 percent target.

that the natural rate of unemployment may be lower than many and wages have increased little or not at all over a time when resources, by many much closer to full utilization suggests we may be further away from full a reduction in the natural rate, and there may be some Obviously, one possible way to reconcile the disconnect between employment and wage and price developments is observers have been assuming, and that the participation rate gap may be greater.  In particular, that inflation measures, have moved employment.  Consistent with that hypothesis, a shift in the demographic profile of our workforce would be in keeping with structural aftereffects of the financial crisis that also support that story.

Although auto and retail sales softened in Februarybecause of adverse weather-strong job growth, the effect of lower oil prices on incomes, and increased confidence all point in the direction of supporting consumer components of domestic aggregate demand appear quite tepid. hope that low levels of homeownership and some hopeful Business fixed investment looks to increase only modestly this year, particularly economic growth, is also not likely to add much. In recent months, we've seen some crosscurrents demand domestically.  On the positive end of the spectrum, consumer spending appears to have increased robustly at the end of last perhaps in part real spending.  But the other Residential investment remains very weak, as shown by the most recent data on housing starts. Of course, we all keep holding out signs on household formation still point toward the possibility that pent-up demand will start to materialize. with lower oil prices pushing down drilling investment.  And, of course, government spending, while not subtracting from are exerting a material drag on GDP growth.  The broad nominal more than 15 percent since June of last year, and with that appreciation net exports.

Thus, the the outcome of a 'tug of war' between domestic consumer spending and net exports.  The hopeful scenario is that faster appreciating dollar and that increase in inflation and expectations, and a stabilization or even some reversal of recent gains in the dollar.  In asset prices in Europe is promising.  One could even imagine that, economic growth leads to reversals in both energy and previous gains in the dollar.  Such a confluence of events could push inflation higher, effect of to the very nature of the financial system in the euro area.  Furthermore, many interest rates in uncertainty about the effect of negative particularly as they fall further.  This greater uncertainty, together with sizable downside risks. But there are risks, I think, on both sides.  On the upside, the advent of quantitative easing in Europe may finally lead to a convincing recovery, a noticeable inflation fact, the effect of QE on further out in the medium term, faster foreign prices with the attendant implications for monetary policy.  On the downside, however, the quantitative easing on European domestic demand may be somewhat attenuated due bankcentric the euro zone are now negative, and there's considerable interest rates on activity, the ongoing uncertainty about the outcome of difficult negotiations between Greece and its creditors, suggests

that labor market conditions are range of indicators as well as in very welcome development.  Most important, payroll gains three months in spite of harsh winter weather in much of the U-6, have declined by similar amounts.  Labor force participation has Starting with the labor market, I think everyone agrees continuing to improve.  We see broad evidence of that in a anecdotal reports.  It is, of course, a have speeded up over the past country.  The unemployment rate has been moving down, and broader measures of labor underutilization, such as

In spite of the decline in the but two of you, based on your SEPs, continue to think that some slack a few of you revised down your estimates of the round. moved sideways.  But, as some of you noted, the fact further in mentioned that surveys unemployment rate, all remains in the labor market.  Interestingly, quite longer-run normal unemployment rate this as average that could ultimately be consistent with 2 percent and trend productivity growth.  But, as discussed in the Tealbook box-and a number that wage increases among firms are way, although there were also comments suggesting that the is still not broad based and is confined to some specific sectors. Wage developments garnered a good deal of discussion.  Measures such hourly earnings, hourly compensation, and the ECI all continue to show sluggish nominal gains of around 2 percent or so, well below levels inflation of you mentioned this-business surveys are finding becoming larger and more prevalent, and that result seems to be consistent with many reports that you're hearing from your business contacts.  That evidence suggests that a pickup in nominal wage growth may be under pickup in wage growth

agreement that the the January meeting, and a the rest of the year and beyond now look a little less favorable the outlook as still Turning to developments in the broader economy, I heard general current readings on overall activity have, on balance, moderated since number of indicators have come in quite a bit softer than expected.  Some of you noted that prospects for GDP growth over than in December partly because of dollar appreciation, but also some of you have lowered your estimates of trend growth.  I think most of you, though, continue to view sufficiently favorable to support continued improvement in the labor market.

A number of you mentioned that nonresidential business large part reflecting lower oil prices and something that could intensify over Many of you cited consumer spending as a bright spot for the economy, reflecting low gas prices, rising employment and wealth, and other factors.  But there is the caveat that we've had three disappointing retail sales reports.

Export growth appears to have slowed to have a persistent effect.  On the other side, some economic growth in places like Europe, in part due to the to Greece; and mention of Brazil and other for which a strong dollar could affect corporations that have borrowed in dollars, and we could see defaults and spillovers. Many of you commented on the likely influence seen, the fact that it's already continue to appreciate markedly, and the appreciated dollar is likely of you mentioned slightly stronger ECB actions.  On the other hand, there was a lot of concern about downside risks from developments in the global economy, including ongoing risks related to China and Russia; renewed and perhaps intensified risks relating countries from which was roughly as the staff expected.  I think we all will run well below our 2 percent goal in the near term because of earlier most of you don't see materially affecting the longer-run outlook.  Overall, I heard general agreement On the inflation front, incoming data anticipate that inflation declines in energy prices and decreases in core import prices.  But incoming data as

Exactly what's going on there is hard to little bit perplexing that there seems to be such a strong correlation of this and the dollar.  Nevertheless, for some of you, a significant concern and points toward a possible loss of credibility of the Committee in A number of you expressed confidence in your outlook that inflation will return to 2 percent.  However, a number of you also expressed some doubt about confidence in this forecast.  Some of developments and the fact that core inflation is moving down.  In addition, a number of you commented on the fact that, even though survey-based measures of long-run inflation expectations have largely remained based measures of inflation compensation, after a short-lived rise, have declined more or less back to determine.  It's a measure of inflation compensation with oil prices it is meeting its inflation commitments.

to add some comments of my own. Let me stop there.  Would anyone like to comment on that summary?  [No response] Then, if I might, I'd like

I see solid evidence that the labor market is improving, and that to normal conditions.  But, like many of you, I, too, think we still have a few of you, I also estimate that the natural rate of unemployment is at note that the Beveridge curve has yet to shift all of the way back to its pre-crisis that the evidence overall is relatively thin that the natural rate is higher the financial crisis. Like everyone else, we're drawing closer ways to go.  Like quite a 5 percent.  I position.  Even so, I see now than it was prior to

In addition, labor market measure U-6 rate, and the conventional unemployment rate is percentage points higher than the average spread in the years preceding the reaches its normal longer-run level, the labor spread is returned to While I recognize that there are alternative wages, I take that slack is showing up in forms that are not included in U-3, particularly involuntary part-time employment and depressed labor force participation.  The spread between the broadest of labor market underutilization, the currently 1¾ recession.  So even when the unemployment rate market will still be putting downward pressure on inflation until this normal.

My optimism about the near-term outlook for marked improvement in consumer confidence.  I'm cautiously low mortgage rates and demographic pressures, the housing market.  But I am concerned that and weak activity abroad, will constrain overall the tone of recent spending and am worried about the disappointing reports. Turning to the outlook for economic growth, I'm reasonably expand sufficiently fast this year goal, but not all of the real activity rests in large part on factors like rising employment, low gas prices, expanding household wealth, and a optimistic that these same factors, coupled with will enable a somewhat faster pace of recovery in other factors, particularly the dollar appreciation GDP growth and net exports.  I, too, am concerned that production indicators has been weaker than I expected, and I string of retail sales to expect inflation to move up gradually to 2 percent market tightens.  The core price data have come in roughly On the inflation front, I continue over the next few years as the labor as I expected, at least after adjusting for the one-time effect of the surprise in ACA

As Simon Potter noted the correlation of recent movements in inflation compensation with recent shifts in oil some type of overeffects of shifts in energy prices. reimbursements.  And survey-based though, as we discussed, market-based earlier, prices suggests that the decline in inflation compensation may reflect extrapolation by investors of what presumably are transitory

B, one criterion for an initial tightening is that we need to be the medium term.  For the that it will be hard to point to data demonstrating that a development that I think is likely, we will have to inflation forecasts using indirect evidence, historical experience, and economic If we adopt alternative reasonably confident that inflation will move back to 2 percent over remainder of this year, my guess is inflation is actually moving up toward our objective.  Measured on a 12-month basis, both core and headline inflation will very likely be running below 1½ percent all year.  That means that if we decide to start tightening later this year, justify our theory.

abroad teaches us that, as resource utilization tightens, eventually inflation will begin to rise. The argument from history and economic theory seems straightforward.  Experience here me, this seems like a simple matter of demand and supply.  So the more labor and product the lags in is coming down, it would, to my mind, be imprudent to wait until much closer to 2 percent to begin to normalize policy.  I consider this a strong still at low levels, and it's one that I plan to concerned that, at least in recent years, the empirical and To markets tighten, the more confident I'll become in the inflation outlook.  Because of monetary policy, the current high degree of monetary accommodation, and the speed at which the unemployment rate inflation is argument for an initial tightening with inflation make.  But I also recognize and am relationship between slack and inflation has been quite weak.

indirect evidence will be more complicated.  One important thing to the continued stability of survey measures of expected inflation, and I a backup in market-based measures of inflation compensation I'll also feel more confident in the inflation outlook if any dollar, which I expect to be transitory.  Thus far, as the nicely done box discussed, it looks as though the pass-through of energy prices to The appreciation of the dollar is holding down import prices, apparel, which has a relatively has two implications import-intensive categories The argument from point to, I hope, will be would certainly welcome seeing that would improve my confidence. downward movements we see in core inflation can be relatively easily attributed to movements in energy prices and the in the Tealbook on the topic core inflation has been quite small. and that's already showing up in goods prices such as those for high import content.  However, price increases for items with low import content, such as nonenergy services, have been little changed over the past year.  This pattern for our communications.  First, we can probably point to these data and stable inflation expectations as evidence that we don't face a growing persistent deflation problem.  Second, if the dollar doesn't keep rising, then we should see inflation in these moving back up over time.

Some have gone further and urged that we hold off tightening until models view as a basic equilibrium condition.  Although, in common with the Tealbook projection, I faster wage growth as a prerequisite for an initial tightening, for several reasons.  First, we don't know what trend productivity growth is or will be, so we

Third, downward nominal wage rigidity may have given rise to pent-up cuts that could restrain wage growth for some time to come.

That sentence is still in there.

Let's now briefing.

That provides me also with a segue into my briefing, and I you to the material that was distributed yesterday, 'Material for Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.'  I should mention that does not reflect these two changes that I results that I'm showing in this information that Don showed in the fourth median dots and central tendencies of end of 2015, 2016, and 2017 that a noninertial Taylor based on your individual estimates of PCE inflation through 2017.  So the symbols in the Taylor rule shown to letter these the federal funds rate.  The median and the rule's prescriptions is close to minus 1½ left; by 2017, it in 2015 are, on average, As Don Kim noted in his briefing, many of you made downward revisions to your projected federal funds rate paths.  The upper-left panel of your first exhibit presents, in somewhat different form, the same exhibit of his briefing, the one that included the the Taylor rule prescriptions.  In particular, I first calculate for each of you the values for the federal funds rate at the (1999) rule, shown to the right, would prescribe the longer-run normal unemployment rate and your projections for core and the unemployment rate the right-the symbol 𝜋𝜋 denotes four-quarter core PCE inflation, and the u stands for the unemployment rate.  In these calculations, I use your estimates of the longer-run real federal funds rate as intercepts, the r *LR.  I then subtract prescriptions from your actual projections for difference between your projections percentage points in 2015 and 2016, as shown by the blue dots to the narrows to about minus ½ percentage point.  The differences slightly smaller than they were in your December projections, and in 2016 and 2017, they are slightly larger.

it might appear that your policy projections imply the macroeconomic outlook remain asymmetric as long as the is at the lower bound.  But are these shortfalls relative to the Taylor of monetary accommodation implied question, I use a version of a textbook, as it's rate ( level ( real rate has the that, if the actual real rate was kept at its equilibrium level, over time the is a that varies over time, capturing persistent shifts in the position Given these sizable differences, a high degree of policy accommodation, perhaps reflecting considerations such as an assessment that risks to federal funds rate (1999) benchmark a good measure of the degree by your projections?  To answer this called, IS equation, shown in the middle panel, which relates the unemployment gap ( u minus u *), as a measure of the cyclical position of the economy, to the real gap, defined as the deviation of the real federal funds rate r ) from a time-varying equilibrium r *).  As shown by the equation, this equilibrium property unemployment gap would close.  Thus, in this set-up, the equilibrium real rate medium-run concept of the IS curve.

I use the staff's model that President I estimate the coefficients on the lagged unemployment gap and the lagged real rate gap in this equation using historical data for the fourth quarter of each year so as to be consistent with the historical estimates for u * and estimates for r * taken from the

the real as well as his or her estimate of the longer-run normal Williams and I developed some years ago.  With these coefficients in hand, I then insert each participant's projected values for the unemployment rate and federal funds rate, unemployment rate, and solve the equation for the implied value of the time-varying r * at the end of each year.

In such it must be the case that rate to be particularly large. These implied values are shown in the lower-left panel.  The zero in both 2015 and 2016 and rises below the longer-run median estimate of 1¾ percent.  These the implied federal funds rate circumstances, the IS equation, shown in the middle panel, would predict substantially faster declines in the unemployment rate than shown in your projections if r * was at its longer-run value.  To reconcile your unemployment rate projections with your real rate projections, r * remains depressed for some time.  Put differently, the fact that most of you expect the unemployment remain close to your estimates of its longer-run normal value over coming years implies that the real rate gap cannot longer-run  * value as the intercept may be somewhat misleading lower-right panel, I repeat the calculation shown in the upper-left panel after replacing your longer-run rule is close to zero at the end of both 2015 and 2016 point in 2017, substantially narrower than the ones shown in This analysis suggests that the differences relative to the Taylor (1999) benchmark with the r as an indication of policy accommodation.

turn to today's policy decision and the draft alternative statements. to thank everyone for responding to our earlier drafts with valuable that maintains the target range for the federal funds rate at any meeting, beginning determine that liftoff is Let me now First, I want feedback.  Judging from those communications, the key judgment that you face today is how to replace the 'patient' language with new forward guidance the option to raise in June, and describes broad conditions under which you will warranted.

to your decision the middle panel, all three of the statements report that inflation has of confidence in the outlook for inflation.  Alternative B inflation compensation remain low, but that measures remain stable.  Alternative B also retains the earlier will 'rise gradually toward 2 percent over the medium inflation 'will' reach the 2 percent objective.  It also notes that survey-based In contrast, alternative A expresses clear concern that the Committee's 2 percent objective and Moreover, alternative A emphasizes that, given the drop in crude oil prices in recent describing Rather than go through each alternative statement separately, I want to focus on how the alternatives address the issues that appear to be central today.  First, the revised statement will provide an update of your assessment of the current inflation situation and your confidence in the outlook for inflation.  As indicated in declined further below the Committee's longer-run objective and is anticipated to 'remain near its recent low level' in the near term.  However, the alternatives offer different options for characterizing recent movements in inflation compensation and express varying degrees notes that market-based measures of survey-based expectation that inflation term.'  Alternative C states that measures of inflation compensation have increased, and that measures remain stable. inflation will return only 'very gradually' to could remain below it 'for a protracted period.' that measures of inflation compensation 'remain well below levels observed last summer.'  I should also point out days, the alternative B in front of you deletes the reference to 'earlier' in energy price declines in paragraph 1.

issue before you is how to revise the in order to both communicate more specifically the data dependence of a range for the federal funds rate and shape expectations further improvement and expect that will have declined another couple of tenths by the time that maximum alternatives differ on the characterization of inflation prospects warrant a liftoff decision.  Alternative B indicates that you would want to that inflation will return to your 2 percent you are already liftoff soon.  And alternative A states that you would Moving to the forward guidance, the guidance decision to increase the target regarding the likely timing of liftoff.  Regarding labor market conditions, your SEP submissions indicate that most of you anticipate the unemployment rate liftoff will be warranted.  Thus, your expectations for progress toward the employment goal are broadly represented across the forward guidance in all three draft alternatives.  The that would be more, or at least not less, confident objective over the medium term.  Alternative C suggests that sufficiently confident to signal need to see clear evidence that inflation was moving up to 2 percent.

Moreover, in order to bridge the forward guidance from the presumed time dependence associated with the 'patient' language, alternative B specifically says that an April liftoff is unlikely.

I'd find that interesting to know, in light of line with history. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thomas, that was a very interesting analysis, which led me to think about a couple the Taylor (1999) rule benchmark, asking whether they are a good measure of accommodation.  Is there any empirical work that you did with this that might indicate, when you see residuals of this stronger growth over the time series our increased inflation expectations, whether that's in issue:  'What if you Taylor rule with a constant intercept?  At times that followed when you saw large I haven't looked into an interesting idea. MR. LAUBACH.

There's been a lot of changes in the description here, and now it's just was relative to points. MR. LAUBACH.  I've been looking at the five-year, five-year-ahead breakevens.

In the sentence that says rising moderately,' it refers to 'earlier declines in energy prices have the paragraph, it says 'Inflation has declined I was wondering MR. about, again, the change 'Household spending is boosted household purchasing power.'

No, obviously not.  I think the statement in the inflation sentence was that they feed It is our assessment that, actually, the boost to time.

WILLIAMS.  If I can break right now from the rules on making a comment on just saying MR. language, I think symmetry would suggest not having 'earlier' in either case and 'declines'-unless we're trying to say something.

MR. FISCHER.  I think they relate to different things.  What could make them consistent is simply that households take a while to react.

WILCOX.  This could also reflect the staff taking a while to react.  [Laughter]  It energy prices came back down. MR. might be about 48 hours out of date, before

MR. LAUBACH.  So would you prefer to go, actually, back to the old language and just say 'recent,' or would you drop 'earlier'?

WILLIAMS.  I would just say 'declines' in both cases because I think they're true. MR. factually

yesterday afternoon, I saw the first two panels to myself, 'Okay, you're comparing what Taylor (1999) with our submissions the interest rates with what we actually put in for the interest rate, MR.

MR. LACKER.  Great.  Okay.  Thanks.

Let me stop there go-round with President the keeps June on the table, which I think is essential, because if the data think we should raise rates in June.  While I support forward-guidance language, it's important to be aware that it introduces some important tension into the statement.  The new language states that the Committee anticipates 'when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably will move back to its 2 percent objective over the medium term.'  This possibility that we are not now reasonably confident that inflation will we expect 'inflation to the medium term.'  In the broader context of that paragraph, this to mean that we are confident that our future policy actions will bring inflation back to MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I can support alternative B.  It drops word 'patient' and thus come in reasonably close to our forecast, I the new internal raising rates confident that inflation seems to leave open the move back to our objective.  In contrast, the second paragraph states that rise gradually toward 2 percent over I take 2 percent.

to be in conflict with the second confident about our future conduct of monetary the two passages is to change the forward-guidance language to read 'remains reasonably confident,' implying that we are now confident. the 'reasonably confident' language as conditional on So our new forward-guidance language appears paragraph, because it seems to suggest we're not policy.  This is an awkward and potentially confusing implication to convey.  One way to reconcile reasonably confident' instead of 'is Another approach would be to interpret

March 17-18, 2015

words, to interpret the forward-guidance language as meaning to say that that an increase in rates is consistent with inflation moving percent objective over the medium term.'  Now, rewording the forward guidance the language in raising rates-in other the Committee anticipates raising rates 'when it has seen further improvement in the labor market and is reasonably confident back to its 2 this way would eliminate the apparent conflict with the second paragraph.  The language there is about our confidence that our policy will get inflation back to 2 percent, while paragraph 3 says that, to raise rates, we want to be reasonably confident that raising rates won't prevent us from getting back to 2 percent.

deliberations that have gone into a late-in-the-game suggestion to make, so I'm not going to about is something you might have to address in conference this afternoon, Madam Chair.  And it's something that, as I said, I think I understand that, given the weeks and months of crafting this language, this would be insist on this change.  But I think that it's worth being aware of this tension as we talk policy in public going forward.  In any event, this your press we should be continually aware of.

it's about inflation then-as you said, to bounce around at a Certainly, we'd rather not see persistently soft core inflation, but our focus think we a substantial rise in reported core inflation is in some way a precondition for risks a return regime that made monetary policy a driving force behind real fluctuations. Looking ahead at how the data might come in between now and June, I believe important to recognize that we could be reasonably confident Madam Chair-even if the monthly readings on core inflation continue relatively low level. should be on the outlook for inflation, not on realized values.  In particular, I don't should convey that lifting off in June.  Setting a high bar by waiting to see a vigorous rise in actual inflation ignores the long and variable lags that we know are associated with monetary policy, and it to the 'go-stop'

What do we know about those past three years, we've seen the following:  Consumption has grown at 3 percentage points, from 8.3 percent to 5.5 percent; and rate, a number we last saw in the spring of 2001. As I noted at the outset, if conditions evolve close to expectations over months, then I'm likely to argue for premise that we should set our monetary policy instrument so as to align the real short-term interest rate fundamentals?  Over the an average annual rate of 2.5 percent, a number we last saw in the fall of 2007; the unemployment rate has fallen almost employment has grown at a 1.9 percent annual interest rate has been below negative Our understanding of the relationship between the natural real rate, as it's called, and the real economy.  Granted, the natural real rate may have shifted down in recent years, but I'd note that attempts to quantify that work of Laubach and Williams, did not generate anything a strong case can be made that our policy rate the first opportunity to raise rates without Over the same time period, the short-term real 1 percent. observable variables is admittedly imprecise.  But I think both theory and experience tell us that a real interest rate of negative 1 percent is unlikely to be consistent with continuing low inflation in the face of the steady growth we've seen in interest decline, such as those based on the like the current level of real rates.  So I think should be higher right now, and June represents contradicting our past forward guidance.  Thank you.

Taken together, all three of these facts-that realized inflation has been as low as it has been for as long as it has been; curve than inflation compensation have outlined in the permanently below 2 percent.

This statement, if adopted, puts the Committee in a new decisionmaking and messaging phase.

We do returning to full employment by being too wedded to our uncertain estimates and relationships that may have changed.

It just says that we need to have in order to have It appropriately captures with President Lockhart that we really should be thinking ahead Looking ahead, I agree to the future statement language.  I've thought some about that and have some comments.  My own view is, we don't want to be writing the statement in the meeting before, stating what we're

as a ceiling.  In looking to prolong this to ease off on policy accommodation relatively we don't need to take stronger and more risky action later.  As President Fisher already pushed past I see a June liftoff as likely to be appropriate not because of an immediate inflation threat or because we see our 2 percent inflation target expansion, we think that the best approach is soon so that emphasized, the track record in withdrawing accommodation after we've full employment is not good.

Well, there are basically three reasons.  First, there's the background of us agree with, that it is actually good to get this phrase out of the transitional phrase and, another one of those phrases to which I think markets are attaching potentially rid of a lot of the speculation about it.  The second How do I reconcile those two positions-that I'm actually now quite strongly supportive of removing 'patient'? reason, which almost all regular FOMC statement because, number one, it was intended to be a number two, it's excessive weight.  So by removing it, we get

Chair has been very effective in her monetary policy testimony in the 'kitchen timer' phenomenon, 'patient' is removed, the kitchen timer is flipped and we're on course believe the recent softening of economic news makes it less Helen's terms, that way, but that's a risk the benefit that I noted earlier.  I don't see the case, as I said a to be thinking actively about our reason is that I think the shifting perceptions of what I have previously referred to as which is to say that once to a two-meetings-later federal funds rate liftoff.  The additional language in the statement reinforces that.  Third, and somewhat contrary to some of you who are looking forward to a potential June liftoff, I actually likely the markets will think that there's a kitchen timer phenomenon here-or, in that the countdown has begun.  There's some risk that it'll still be read worth taking in order to achieve moment ago, for liftoff any time soon, but it's healthy for us monetary policy stance at each meeting.

So in thinking theory and history that are relevant, I'm not entirely sure what history is most changed from more recent episodes of Now, on the substance, we environment, but the conditions out there remain very unusual, with the aftermath of the financial about the instructive, given the number of things that have recessions and recoveries.

It will presumably be based on something specific isn't present right now.  We're all emphasizing our data dependence, and so I look forward to hearing what specifics people have that make us think we should conclude I do understand the abstract point that a will, at some juncture, push inflation up, but I haven't yet heard the particular point, we'll know that we have crossed that confidence that that's that in future meetings

confidence.  I presume that those of you who have been ready some time don't need any more data, but, for those of us who have not, I think it is that now we have that reasonable to move for important to have that conversation and, specifically, to say, again, what has changed so that now we can have that kind of confidence that we didn't beforehand.

a couple of other background reasons why my instincts are for than sooner.  One is just a conversation to which I shouldn't attach enormous it did have an effect on me.  Some weeks ago, I asked an economist markets pretty closely what his explanation for the low level of inflation to give me several interesting technical explanations, and then 2 percent.  I think it's closer to what he was seeing in markets, and that did concern me. Committee have raised:  While lot of ways to tighten, we don't really have that many ways to be accommodative, I will say that there are later rather significance, I guess, but who watches financial compensation was.  He proceeded he said, 'I don't actually think that your inflation target is 1.7 percent.  So the amount of inflation compensation required is actually less than you seem to have been assuming.'  Now, that's one guy's view.  But he's a straightforward, smart person who was just purporting to interpret I'm also concerned with the issue that many in and out of this we've got a and so moving prematurely could risk putting ourselves into a circumstance in which we had a limited number of efficacious responses.

back liftoff, December, in 2016 and 2017 I move back closer to the pack-that is, my rate of me back into the pack.  That reflects a view that we really a high degree of confidence.  Maybe my implicit reaction function is a The final point I'd make, though, on the substance is that, although I pushed as I said, to increase of the federal funds rate will be somewhat faster than the norm.  It doesn't quite get me to the middle of the pack, but it gets should be sure and have

March 17-18, 2015

than reasonable degree of confidence, but, once we get there, I think that it will more appropriate to normalize more quickly. high rather probably be coming months by the that will help me, at least, come to the conclusion that the relevant corner has been level of confidence that we're moving back toward a 2 percent inflation In conclusion, I'd just say that I hope I am surprised in the intensification of economic growth and maybe some wage growth and the diminution of downside risks.  Short of that, I look forward to discussions in April and thereafter of the specifics turned, and that the target, while giving more opportunity for employment to grow, has been reached.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Governor Fischer. CHAIR

As I said yesterday, I believe we're closing the medium term, not least because I'm confident that this Committee get there.  So I support alternative time to take 'patient' out of the statement and to signal that it is not unlikely that want to raise rates in June.  At the same time, I support the language that says we've not it's easy to envisage circumstances that will make us prefer after June, because either the incoming data we've seen recently or unanticipated B, which seems to be generally accepted, are correct, and that that's MR.

So I think that those who are supporting alternative the right way to proceed.

mentioning because they're likely to be to the debate we're going to have about timing over the next several months.  First, there But I'd like to discuss a few issues that are worth relevant

March 17-18, 2015

with which monetary policy actions affect the real economy. monetary policy multipliers imply that the decisions we make this year effect until 2017.  While we cannot now place much faith in the 2017 the economy, it's more likely than not that a smaller punch bowl will be labor market and rising inflation that we may well face a year or is the issue of the length of the lags Estimates of dynamic may not have their greatest forecasts for the state of wholly appropriate for the tight two from now.

Rather, we'll be rates that are low enough to continue to support the recovery while to normalize monetary policy, itself a relevant positive factor in making our decision. to have less momentum than we are-or at least I amlooking forward to a time when rates might more regularly be expected Second, we need a sense of proportion.  Raising the federal funds rate ¼ percent is not akin to shifting monetary policy from accommodative moving from an ultraexpansionary monetary policy to an extremely expansionary monetary policy.  We'll still have beginning Moreover, if the economy turns out currently estimating or if we're hit with more negative shocks, we can lower the rate again. Indeed, we should all be to move in either direction.

we can to reveal to the way we're thinking, but without committing ourselves to tying our hands going could give forecasts.  That's what's being done in many other countries.  I don't particularly helpful to have those forecasts, but what they do do is to make it clear as Third, if I can just insert a brief comment relating to the discussion on forward guidance-namely, the interchange between Presidents Lockhart and Williams on forward guidance-I, too, believe we need to avoid date-based guidance.  But, even more, I think we should avoid constraining ourselves going forward.  We should do what markets the ahead.  We think it was

rate path is sometimes described as a choice between an main argument given for starting later of the lower bound should make us wait at least longer to raise rates than we would have otherwise.  But that argument is always true, and, means, on average, staying at the lower bound mind, also has costs.  What we have to do is to calibrate when the costs exceeded the benefits.  That's very difficult, but I think we're very close to that point or a bit more. Fourth, the choice of interest early and gradual path and a later and steeper path.  The has been that, all else being equal, the existence a bit at every moment, you can say that.  That choice longer, which, to my have will be within, say, a couple of months or perhaps me explain a factor that I think we overlook.  If the situation to if we had stayed at So it's not that we get away from In addition, I do not believe, although I've heard it said repeatedly, that having to reverse course is the end of the world.

But if the situation is sufficiently dire move us from plus 25 basis points back to zero, it would have been very dire zero, and we're going to have to respond in that case as well. having to confront situations in which it will be very uncomfortable with being at the zero lower bound.

I'd like to add a detail about when to lift off.  We're all familiar with the because of the possibility that, by lifting off earlier, we'd lower bound.

The memo has in it the 'The probability, under the [earlier and gradual] within eight quarters is moderate, at percent under the [later and steep] strategy; however, the federal funds rate climbing to at least 3 percent within a year of initial negligible under the [earlier and gradual] strategy, and about 10 percent under the and steep] strategy.'  We've really got to look at the alternative paths and not at staying There are consequences to delaying, and we need to take them into account as well. the gradual strategies because I think that will enable us to deal I received but haven't, unfortunately, had time to read the paper by President Evans and his colleagues, but I did look at in January by de Groot, Gagnon, and Tetlow, whose Alternative following, among several other, conclusions: strategy, of returning to the [effective lower bound] 10 percent, and falls to only about 5 chance of the prescribed departure is [later here or not.

estimate of the most likely liftoff date from June to September modest inflation readings, I could liftoff in June, but I think it's more likely that the date will slip to In this SEP, I moved my in light of the run of weaker data, the strength of the dollar, and the likely continued weakness in inflation readings.  But, as several have noted, there will be three employment reports between now and the June meeting and a smaller number of inflation readings.  If we continue to get very strong payroll numbers, declining unemployment, and at least be prepared to support September.

long run not much rides on whether the first rate increase that the Committee have a plan to deal the range of possible data and events as well as a consistent and clear way of plan as we go forward will be the If the Committee does choose to lift off this inflation objective.  And that remain weak or that diminishing slack will monetary policy works with long lags.  The Chair last evening and then again this morning.  I think that case seen as defending the 2 I'll say again that, to me, in the happens in June or September.  Far more important is with communicating that plan to the public.  And the center of that test of continued improvement in the labor market and reasonable confidence that inflation will move back to the 2 percent medium-term objective. year, which today seems to me both desirable and highly likely, there will be a need to explain how that decision is consistent with our 2 percent medium-term will not be easy-particularly if the dollar continues to strengthen and oil prices even decline.  I see this explanation as based on the thoughts eventually produce inflation, and that persuasively outlined these points needs to be made consistently-and no doubt repeatedly-if we're to be percent objective.  There will also be a need to foreshadow liftoff at least one meeting ahead,

inflation will move back to perhaps by signaling that the Committee is gaining confidence that the 2 percent objective over the medium term.

near cliché to say that the path of rates is more important than the date of long run but not that helpful in the short term we're trying to do is to choose the date of liftoff.  But it is appropriate that the after liftoff, we can move rates up fairly gradually, particularly if to be weak, as seems likely.  We don't need to be in a hurry. It's become a liftoff, a statement that is obviously true in the when what Committee now turn to thinking about, and communicating more about, the path of rates after liftoff.  And I do think that, inflation continues longer, and gradual path of rate increases after liftoff.  Thank you, Madam Chair. In my view, policy should remain highly accommodative for quite a while that is consistent with a

over time that temporary and dollar appreciation, will fade, continued increases in resource utilization will begin to put upward pressure on wage expect.  In particular, the effects of the dollar may fade only slowly, and marketthat they are softening in the face of stubbornly low are slightly tilted to the downside. The outlook for inflation is more uncertain.  We should expect factors holding down inflation, such as energy price declines and that and price inflation.  But the fading of the so-called temporary factors may, in fact, take more time than we currently dollar appreciation may well have some distance to go, exerting a significant tightening effect. At the same time, we've seen little convincing evidence that tighter resource utilization is yet having a significant effect on prices and wages.  And we can't dismiss the possibility that the lingering effects of the financial crisis may have some persistent effects on the relationship between resource utilization and inflation domestically.  While the partial retracement of based inflation compensation measures gives some support to our hope that inflation expectations will hold steady, it's possible inflation, which would be highly troubling.  Thus, I think the risks around the outlook for inflation highly significant that the removal of the word 'patient' is accompanied by a later and more gradual path of policy combination accurately conveys to the public the high degree of nuance in room.  Let me be clear about how I interpret the removal of I view this statement as announcing the end of forward guidance-which is rate path for some time into the future-and the return I view it as economic projections from the Committee that point to firming.  I hope this the discussion that we've had in this the word 'patient.' to say, the commitment to a stated policy to data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting policy determination starting in June.

It's also very important that the public pace or even the direction of policy moves In fact, the economic and price developments since we last met in January will see the appropriate conditions for liftoff in June. the removal of the 'patient' language to communicate clearly that we will the option of altering the policy rate be moved without understand there is nothing inevitable about either the following liftoff. cause me to be more hesitant that we Nonetheless, I support be very closely attuned to the incoming data and will have path to respond to those data starting in June.

to our target, the set of factors that might give inflation is likely to move back toward our target are that resource utilization gaps continue to close the same pace as over the previous year; measures of inflation expectations continue to now believe to be transitory that by June, I find it more conditions will not be met in June.  Thank you, Madam Chair. The policy reaction function in alternative B places great weight on our being reasonably confident that economic conditions and a monetary policy based on contemporaneous liftoff would be consistent with inflation moving back toward our 2 percent goal over the medium term. Assuming that core inflation remains soft relative me reasonable confidence that employment growth continues at or near current rates; at about firm; and we observe an inflection point in the forces that we are weighing on core inflation-in particular, oil prices and core import prices associated with dollar strengthening.  Although the confluence of these events is possible likely that many of these

Taking out the 'patient' language makes sense, given that there off in June.  At the same time, the statement earlier testimony, and, I expect, the statement at the press conference today that removal of the 'patient' language in no way indicates any commitment just means that June is not off the table.  I also like the fact that we'll no consistent with that.
