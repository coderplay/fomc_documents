October 27 Session

YELLEN.  Good morning, everybody.  Let's get started.  As most of you know, meeting for President Kocherlakota.  Later today we will have a chance to farewell at a luncheon, but in view of Narayana's service on the to take this opportunity to thank him in the setting of meeting as well. CHAIR this is the last FOMC thank him and to wish him Federal Open Market Committee, I'd like an FOMC

The insight and to the monetary policies to address the challenging macroeconomic issues me say thank you in this venue for your service and say how Narayana became president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis in October 2009.  He has participated in 54 regular president, he was a highly successful and as a research consultant for the Federal Reserve Bank of creativity that he demonstrated as a researcher were also hallmarks of his work as a monetary policymaker.  Over the past six years, President Kocherlakota has contributed greatly Committee's formulation of facing our nation.  So, Narayana, let much we will all miss you.  [Applause]

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you very much, Madam Chair.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  And, as we did the previous time and probably will from throughout joint meetings of the FOMC and the Board of the Board meeting. CHAIR now on, our meetings will be Governors.  I need a motion to close

MR.

FISCHER.  So moved.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  Without objection.  The first topic on our agenda is Real Interest Rates,' CHAIR 'Equilibrium r *.  Let me ask Chris Gust to start us off.

We will be referring to the package MR. GUST. 1   Our briefing will be delivered in four segments by Kei-Mu Yi, Andrea Tambalotti, David López-Salido, and me. labeled 'Material for Briefing on Equilibrium Real Interest Rates.'

real policy models, neither contractionary nor expansionary.  This rate has been given several more-specific definitions, summarize.  Kei-Mu, Andrea, and David will focus on longer-run trends What level of the real policy rate would be consistent with moving the economy to, or keeping it at, full employment?  This benchmark rate is often referred to as the 'neutral' or 'equilibrium' real rate, or r *.  A policy stance that sets the rate equal to r * is, in some general concept of a neutral real which I will in r *, on shorter-run variations in r *, and on the policy implications of having to rely on uncertain estimates of r *.

different concepts that have been referred to as is tightly linked to a model or class of models; others are statistical in nature. Exhibit 1 identifies r *-that is, different definitions of a 'neutral' real rate.  Some have a very specific interpretation that the list are associated with formal economic models.  The real rate is the real interest rate that would prevail in the nominal rigidities such as sticky prices and wages.  Thus, it is the real rate of resource utilization that would prevail if there were no efficient real rate is the real rate that would prevail if there imperfect competition or taxes levels.  The optimal real rate is the that would be prescribed by optimal monetary policy based on maximizing some from the efficient rate if policy is constrained by the instruments to achieve the rate associated with the optimal control presented in Tealbook B is one example of an optimal real rate. The first three entries in natural, or Wicksellian, absence of consistent with the level nominal rigidities.  The were neither nominal rigidities nor distortions such as that move allocations away from their efficient rate welfare criterion.  It may differ effective lower bound or if there are not enough policy most efficient outcomes.  The real simulations

By steady-state real interest rate, which is the short-term real prevail in the long run once all shocks die down, requires a model.  These two concepts are often used interchangeably Continuing down the list, a focus on the long-run r * to be the This definition is statistical and does not rely on a specific contrast, estimating the interest rate that would fully specified economic

However, as Kei-Mu will explain, long-run real rate as fixed, as is often assumed in the formulation of in simple policy rate treating the simple policy rules, does not appear to be realistic.

It provides a medium-run perspective on  * and is the level of the federal funds rate that, if r 12 quarters, gap,' which is the gap between the actual real stance of monetary policy.

The panels use a simple saving-investment framework to investment determines the equilibrium real interest rate.  Forces that alter equilibrium real interest rate. Next, we examine some long-run panels of illustrate how real interest rates are determined.  The interaction of desired saving and desired desired saving and desired investment shift the corresponding curves, thus leading to a new

In that story, due to upper-left panel, this right, leading to lower real interest rates, countries like the United States that offer attractive investment causes global investment demand to fall, such as interest rates and lower investment, as shown in One example of a force affecting desired saving is the hypothesis put forth by then Governor Ben Bernanke the Asian financial crisis and to increased earnings by oil-producing nations, desired saving by many emerging market countries increased.  In the shows up as a shift of the saving curve to the higher equilibrium investment and saving, and, as a byproduct, increased capital inflows into opportunities.  Similarly, a force that lower productivity growth, would show up as a leftward shift in the investment demand curve, leading to lower real the upper-right panel.

We are not saying that the global saving glut in global investment least as important.

Rather, we are pointing out that a decline demand had to be at couple of key determinants of investment demand.

This decline, as well as the decline in growth that we show in our memo, is consistent with the The top panel of exhibit each year and the U.S. long-run MPK.

This story fits those that went through a period of rapid economic growth-because of recovery from through 1980s.

I will summarize the key results presented in the memo titled 'Monetary Policy at about 𝑟𝑟 ∗ ' that Tetlow.  I will focus on the implications of uncertainty about 𝑟𝑟 ∗ for its use conducting monetary policy.

In models of this class, demand and supply shocks are the stance of monetary policy can be defined in terms of the deviations of the rate from this natural rate.  The model is monetary policy is determined.  In this choose the optimal rate optimally in response to incoming data on a period-by-period basis, but cannot make implications of uncertainty about 𝑟𝑟 ∗ for simple policy rules.  Whether policy is discretionary or follows a rule, the policy rate lower bound on short-term nominal interest rates, which introduces an important nonlinearity in the model economy.  Finally, policymakers observe only an imperfect estimate of the natural rate.

So, if you think of the current r * as r *, the real rate is ultimately going to have to rise to meet r * as we project out.  There's the simple Fisher equation that has to hold.  In that projection, we'd see either nominal interest rate or a fall in the expected place, it would pull down the actual

If, under those assumptions, nominal interest rate near zero long enough, would that cause inflation to fall?  The the odds that such a mechanism might be depressing inflation now? I'm interested in the staff's views on the following question. we held the second related question is, how long is 'long enough'?  And then a third related question is, what are

YELLEN.  Does anyone want to take that? CHAIR

I can take a stab at it.  I can tell you what happens in the FRBNYmodel.  That model has an interest rate rule that governs monetary policy as we lift off. rate is not very different over time quite well behaved in that context. output gap, quite slowly converges back to the steady state. the context in which the existence of this gap doesn't create any particular problem for the effect that you are suggesting, in which MR.

Everything is And inflation, actually, as well as the That's economy, and, in particular, you would then observe this inflation would be driven down along that.

One premise was that we hold the nominal interest described of following the rule you've implemented in your simulation than you just described, in essence.

whole analysis is based on a a linear model approximated around that steady state.  Even zero policy rate, there's no other steady state that you can converge to or that.  The paper by Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe says there is another zero policy rates, and that, they say, would exist in your model, just ignoring the steady state altogether. MR. BULLARD.  I think one thing you could say is that the unique steady-state equilibrium.  It's when you're at the anything like steady state.  It is associated with but the way you analyzed it, either you're assuming there's no convergence to that steady state or you're there an argument that if you were to hold the nominal rate at zero, in would be higher, you would end up generating went, if you kept the nominal interest zero, the lower the actual real rate would move over time, the gap would increase, and you But that's equivalent to saying, instead of going to a steady CHAIR YELLEN.

I think President Lacker's comments really get at the heart of the matter, which is funds rate low low is actually because their target for inflation has lower my inflation and that becomes consistent in equilibrium.  I really think that the question is less an empirical one about whether that is the way the public forms inflation MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I don't know if I'll [Laughter] what would happen to inflation expectations if the FOMC were to keep the federal over a long period of time.  And there are models in which the public thinks through, 'Well, the reason they're keeping the federal funds rate fallen, and so, because they're keeping the federal funds rate low, I must expectations,' a theoretical one than expectations.

There are two assumptions used in the simulation.  One is, of MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO. course, that inflation will go down further, and the policy that we show is the policy under discretion.  So the policymaker is just optimizing period by period, taking expectations as given.

to really drive home is that the that inflation expectations always stay anchored is a pretty strong ends up potentially driving some of these results.  I think that what's attenuation outcome needs to be brought out a little bit more. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I guess what I'm trying expectation in these models assumption, and that driving that to opine about that here [laughter]. MR. LAUBACH.

He is a former Board staffer by the name of Athanasios Orphanides. MR. LAUBACH.

that it's the imprecision about the really making you that came out of the Orphanides-Williams line of work was rather than on these imprecise estimates.  And so, the key arising from that, for example, was that you want to particularly weigh in on observations if your estimate of the natural rate turns out to be wrong, this is where the to the hope I'm presenting that fairly. One key point is r * estimate that is cautious.  I think one of the key lines that, in the presence of uncertainty regarding these estimates, you try to pursue strategies that rely much more on observed data lesson on inflation, because information should show up.  And so that's why you give relatively little weight r * estimate.  I

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  Two questions for Kei-Mu, I presume. remarks that rates seem more synchronized.  Is there a hypothesis of why that has MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam On the global dynamics, exhibit 3, can you explain the convergence since, say, 2000 or so?  You said in your happened?

countries have rates differ across countries most natural story for the past quarter-century. MR. YI.  There are hypotheses.  I think the most natural one is that become more financially integrated over time, globally.  So, barriers to capital flows have come down, and when that happens, various wedges that make interest tend to become smaller, and then the rates become more similar.  I think the financial-integration story is the

My second question is probably an economics or monetary I won't be embarrassed asking it.  There was so much talk a few years savings glut.  As a practical matter, where does it show up, and through Is it from foreign exchange Treasury securities?  Is that the channel that most influences real activity in the MR. LOCKHART. policy 101 question, but ago about the global what channels does it have the most effect on our rate structure? reserves to

October 27-28, 2015

channels by which that global savings glut has an influence on United States, or are there other our economy?

Chairman Bernanke's view of it, and I story had both a private-sector and a public-sector element to it.  I think the publicelement was that a number of governments-for example, those coming out of the Asian mechanism, it would be useful to build up a lot a lot of So that was a force to drive down real interest rates.  I think you can a similar argument for some of the oil-producing countries, too. MR. YI.  I'm going to think in terms of former think his sector financial crisis-decided that, as a precautionary of foreign exchange reserves.  And the way they built up those reserves was, they bought U.S. Treasury securities. make emerging markets-for example, China, Indiacountries that are growing rapidly, but they also world, if it were not for the financial these countries would have high interest rates because are very high.  But because they are financially rates at home are actually quite low, and they are looking to save capital controls there, but from is another force to drive down U.S. and other At the same time, there are stories of joining the global economic scene.  These are are financially underdeveloped.  In that type of underdevelopment, you would think that their productivity prospects and growth prospects underdeveloped, their interest abroad.  And so, once these economies start opening up, then these private-sector resources go abroad.  Maybe not so much in China, because there are still other emerging market countries.  And that advanced foreign economy interest rates.

MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you.

question for Andrea, though it also relates 10, you have a natural rate of interest and a federal funds rate. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.  I had a to Kei-Mu Yi's memo.  On exhibit

That picture does your long run, all the models are going to go back to the is something around 2 percent; that is is no long-run variation in the long-run these 'short-run estimates of So, if I perspective with some of the work that President Williams, for example, to say that you would want to sum the two sources the way in which the two components cothe type of exercise that you want to do. MR. TAMBALOTTI.  Thank you.  That's a very good question.  The models are built around a constant steady state.  So, in the steady state.  Let's say that the natural rate at that point generally across the models.  In that respect, there r * in these models.  So that's part of the reason why we call r *.' wanted to integrate this has done together with Thomas, I don't want of variation, as that would probably involve misstating vary.  But, roughly speaking, that's

really no variation in the very long run in these models.  So you would want to natural rate that comes from this exercise. There is take that into consideration as well if you wanted to have a complete picture of the short-run and long-run variation in the tend to MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  So, to push you a little harder, if you were to try to integrate some of the thinking that was in Kei-Mu's memo with what you had done, would that push the blue line downward or upward?

want to say that that there are very models that do keep the natural rate depressed below the steady state, want to add up whatever effects from Laubach-Williams-type estimates.  But, certainly, the bias could be toward MR. TAMBALOTTI.  It would definitely push down.  Again, I wouldn't you want to have a one-to-one addition there.  Another consideration is persistent shocks in our potentially for very long.  That's the reason why you wouldn't might come

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.

staff for the memos.  I found them very useful, good policy.  I have three questions about the policy I wasn't that surprised about the attenuation result within the context of you have investigated models that cost of financial stability of keeping interest rates low.  In particular, MS. MESTER.  I want to thank the conceptually and also in terms of the prescriptions.  I guess the models you were looking at, but I was wondering whether actually think about the ones that have true microfoundations of that.

Marquez have a Economic that actually provides some microfoundations regarding some of the costs of the interest rate is very more leveraged, and they no longer as much as they did.  So you get this aggregate increase in risk to the models don't have that; the DSGE model is just going to have the what the policy prescription would be in a model kind of financial-stability cost of low interest rates?  That's one question. Giovanni Dell'Aricca, Luc Laeven, and Robert Journal of Theory paper financial stability.  In their model, they have a banking sector in which, if low for a long time, banks take on more risk, they become monitor their borrowers financial system.  The DSGE macroeconomic risk.  Have you thought about that has this think about uncertainty associated other artifacts in the Taylor rule-in particular, the output gap.  We know that's measured it.  And if there is uncertainty, for example, in The second question has to do with the type of uncertainty.  You only look at uncertainty or measurement error associated with r *.  But you can also with with imprecision; there's a lot of uncertainty about some of the parameters in the model-for example, the degree of relative risk aversion-you can

October 27-28, 2015

there would be a negative correlation between the  * and the output gap. Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff analysis indicated that that attenuation the measurement errors would offset one another.  You'd on that. think about whether r Some of the result would then go away, because have to think about how that would interact when you consider a policy prescription.  I was wondering if you have any thoughts my third question, in the Tealbook we sometimes use the inertial Taylor in which you are keeping interest rates low and then not reacting totally to it.  My third I'm wondering whether you are going to propagate the measurement error in  * would interact with your attenuation result, if you think about a different With regard to rule question is that r over time, and how that kind of rule.

context of what we did, so I'm going to go in reverse order. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.  Thank you, President Mester.  Those are very good questions. I'll try to answer in the inertial aspect of the rule, we experimented the first-difference rule, and you have a problem of 'nowcasting' actual gap or even inflation.  Then you actually translate persistent mistakes an probably going to make the attenuation less important, and we discussed that in the You are absolutely right.  Thinking about the in the memo with variables like the output into the level if you respond wrongly to the variables.  So, that is obviously going to have effect that is memo.  So you are absolutely right.

a way of introducing this in character, in order to capture many things to illustrate a potential way of thinking about a smooth response, or a gradual the nominal interest rate by thinking about uncertainty about  *.  That's the way we issue. The idea that we have in the memo, though, was trying to get smoothing parameter that is kind of a reduced-form and to try response, of r thought about that

October 27-28, 2015

me just rephrase that.  So what you're saying is this is an alternative an inertial Taylor rule, because part of the reason you want an inertial rule is not interest rate. MS. MESTER.  Let to looking at because we don't like fluctuations in the financial-stability consideration, that this idea of smoothing interest rate is another way of thinking about how, without having that in the rule as, it can with incomplete information.  That's absolutely MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.  That's an alternative view.  In your first question, you probably have in mind, too, because of this the arise because policymakers have a problem right.

form of uncertainty. little model; it's very much a 'toy' the nature of the fluctuations underlying actually know exactly what variation was behind a parameter; that is going to enter your model, it is going to lead you exactly in the Brainard was emphasizing, to some attenuation. Your second question is about the uncertainty of r * and another What gave us some perspective on that is that we use a model.  In it, the r * is moving because we can control the economy.  The r * is moving because there are different shocks, whether a discount factor shock or technology shocks, and there are potentially shocks that matter for the Phillips curve too.  Those are what we call macro shocks.  We what we call uncertainty about r *.  Of course, we can introduce other forms of uncertainty into the model.  You mentioned uncertainty coming from model in a nonlinear way, so, in terms of the direction that William much is saying something about the relation between the real interest rate and that's related to risk aversion in this model, that's going to lead to some counteraction to what we call attenuation here. We didn't consider those kinds of uncertainties.  But in the case of all Of course, that's going to depend on what parameter.  You mentioned one, risk aversion, which pretty aggregate demand.  Of course, if you change that, because kind of You're absolutely right.

that we did consider, the ones that we discussed always led in the same of in the memo. the uncertainties direction, in terms r *, that we just put here to pin it to one parameter.  With the I chose, of course, you get the negative correlation. MS. MESTER.  But even if you didn't want parameter

that.  We have these kinds of model, in order to think about markup shocks or technology shocks, and persistence-this kind of negative correlation.  And you're on the other hand, you don't want that in which they can cancel each other.  We see that we consider, either technology or the one that preference in terms of savings, they both lead to the conclusions that we have. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.  You can think of situations like situations in the create-sometimes it depends on the right.  On the one hand, you want to attenuate your response; to do that.  So, you can have situations like in our model, too.  But for the kind of shocks that changes the last question was about how to introduce financial-stability considerations these models.  That's a really interesting question.  The only thing that I can say there is that searching yields into the model, we follow a very simple practical and empirical approach.  That is, we with regard to a policy decision.  We incorporate that matter for future inflation and output or other And then, the into we have a paper in which, instead of going through theory of how you might introduce for made a probability of a crisis endogenous into a New Keynesian model, and we try to understand how this kind of framework matters when you take into account that your policy decisions through changing the probability of a crisis in the future because of searching for yields

October 27-28, 2015

of that you leading to less attenuation when policymakers endogenize or internalize that and that is then to move the rates in the direction of increasing as small.  So, really difficult, taking as given the correlation that we see in the data between the nominal and the probability of a crisis.  You need to have a really large effect on changes in to that probability to get some results along the lines that you suggested. mechanisms.  We leave that completely outside the model.  We introduced such kinds nonlinearities into the model, too.  And that's, of course, going in the direction mentioned.  That's there is a potential cost, opposed to attenuating.  However, when we calibrate the model, the effects tend to be it's interest rate the policy rate on credit minimax person, right, the fact that MS. MESTER.  Of course, it depends on, if you're a you may end up with this crisis-

Well, if you think in terms of robust control, too, yes. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.

YELLEN.  President Evans, did you have a question?

it is. CHAIR YELLEN.  Let's say

MS. MESTER.  Right.

MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.  You're absolutely right.

MS. MESTER.  All right.  Thank you.

CHAIR

MR. EVANS.  I do.  Is it my turn?

Thank you.  First, on page 10, when you describe the experiment in which MR. EVANS. the volatility in inflation and the output gap are reduced when you follow the natural rate, what is

October 27-28, 2015

lot higher, because it the volatility of the policy rate process in that case?  Presumably, it's a doesn't have inertia.

We only focused on the volatility of inflation and taking a stance on what would that imply for the policy instruments.  It is estimates of the natural rate, you will see how volatile they are. MR. TAMBALOTTI.  That is correct. the output gap without quite volatile.  If you look at the those types of lot. MR. EVANS.  Right.  So if anybody wanted to try to pocket improvements, we'd be apt to move policy around quite a

MR. TAMBALOTTI.  Yes, absolutely.

I to build these types of shocks and structures in place.  So, really quickly and in a big way.  One of the is, it kind of tells us how to close inflation gaps and Now, if we're going to build in another mandate, financial stability, I'm presuming those three things. MR. EVANS.  President Mester's question was fascinating and related to something had been thinking about, too.  If you think about the financial-stability issues and try them into these models-obviously not having seen that model-it's going to imply some type of real cost to the economy when you've got you're going to lose your 'divine coincidence' result nice things about these types of analyses is, if you think about r * movements as indicative of what almost-optimal policy or optimal policy output gaps. that we're not going to be getting closure of inflation gaps and output gaps if you've only got one instrument to achieve

That's absolutely correct. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.

Any ideas on how far away the wedges might be or how you go about that? MR. EVANS. thinking about

No.  [Laughter] MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.

an imponderable. MR. EVANS.  Fair enough, fair enough.  It's

October 27-28, 2015

Very quickly, President Evans, just for clarification:  In the analysis goals actually remain the traditional dual-mandate policies may have implications for your dual-mandate objectives through a that wasn't previously present, which is that it might contribute to the probability of a in the future. MR. LAUBACH. that David just was referring to, the objectives.  There is no third objective of financial stability per se.  It is simply that you take into account that your channel financial crisis whatever the optimal credit-to-GDP is in the absence of any friction.  In that sort of model, we don't have a loss function that variable from that only look at the usual deviations of output from potential output and inflation from the gap. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.  That's right.  You can think about how any financial friction you can bring into the model may involve an additional gap from ratio incorporates into the policymaker's decision the deviation of any financial target.  We target.  If you accommodate that, it's going to bring another tradeoff, as you mentioned.  I wasn't sure whether that's what you meant when you referred to

MR. EVANS.  Well, it's kind of open-ended, really.

You definitely need to think about all of the instruments. MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO.

If you consider models that are more structures, now you go Wicksellian version in which you close out rigidities, not the efficient real rate? MR. EVANS.  Let me see if I'm following this. complicated and they introduce these financial-instability risks with those to compute your definition of r *.  It's going to be the the nominal

rate.  So in the analyses without that friction, you could our dual mandate.'  Now, in the MR. EVANS.  Okay, the natural take some comfort in saying, 'Gosh, if I know what that r * is, I can kind of judge policy and move it in that direction and feel like I'm on track to achieve

October 27-28, 2015

these additional wedges following that in order to close the gaps. more complicated model in which we compute that, there's going to be preventing that closure.  So it's not going to be enough to be r *, but we're going to need additional strategies

Exactly, exactly.  The optimal policy will never be to close the its definition.  For example, that's precisely what effective lower bound, because once the effective lower bound, you recognize reaching the effective lower bound as a you will come back to it.  It's like a shifter that creates another to close inflation deviations and the output gap.  So tracking the MR. LÓPEZ-SALIDO. gap between the real rate and r *, whatever happened in this simple model when you acknowledge the you are at credible threat and the possibility wedge.  You will never be able natural rate is not going to be the optimal policy in that case.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you.

But I also think it is important for thinking about our policy strategy, and I'll come to that in a few minutes. MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I think this reasons.  One is, I think it is situation we longer-term very useful and the discussion we've had already Laubach and that was summarized in the paper that we was distributed, I Kocherlakota saying, and I quote, 'As you think about I found the memos and the briefings this morning very good, but my remarks will focus on the research on  * that Thomas r and I have been working on for the past 15 years distributed to the Committee last week.  And, by the way, after the paper received a nice e-mail from President

he found our work useful input for the Committee's thinking. the e-mail was not addressed to the FOMC but only to [Laughter] your policy intervention for the upcoming meeting, I highly recommend this thoughtful paper.' Now, I found it very gratifying that But upon closer inspection, I noticed that me.

MR.

EVANS.  It's still relevant.

WILLIAMS. In my reading of the literature and my own work with Thomas on think a robust finding across pretty much all the studies is that What remains unanswered is, what are the forces that have the natural rate of interest down?  Numerous explanations have been put forward, economic growth, global factors, and so on, but it's not possible to draw This inability to identify clearly the makes it hard to know how much of the shift will be temporary and be long lasting. MR. this, I r * has declined considerably over the past decade and, although point estimates differ, nearly all the current readings on  * are near historic lows. r driven including slower definitive conclusions based on the available evidence. sources of a decline in r * how much will among researchers, of this distinction, for policy definitive answer.

Does our current zero represent emergency levels of monetary policy accommodation, or is it just The fundamental question before the sufficiently accommodative to support currently low inflation rising to our 2 percent objective over the medium term. interest rate policy slightly accommodative, or is it not really accommodative at all?

too much good material in these memos to cover all the interesting observations. messages that I took away.  First, that got us there.  Other analyses, like Laubach-Williams, permanent changes that persist indefinitely.  I agree with President Kocherlakota's elot.  [Laughter] There's Here's a few r * has been falling over time.  I think President Williams was on target there.  These reductions are quite persistent.  Some analyses, like the DSGE models, assume stationary deviations, and they turn out to be potentially very persistent, depending on the driving process assume  (1) I mail to you quite a zero and permanent.  A very implies that dealing with the zero lower to be a big risk even once we get inflation back to target.  So it's important when our policy rate may be forced to zero.  I that we should continue to study our tools that we could bring to situation when we find ourselves at the effective lower bound again. The most recent Laubach-Williams r * estimates are close to low  * combined with our 2 percent inflation objective r bound will continue that we know how to deal with future situations agree with all of the suggestions bear on that

I agree with Kei-Mu and Jing that r maybe fall even lower, leaving us frequently binding.

Third, with  * currently r is providing large equilibrium nominal rate by something on the order of 150 basis points.  Some have characterized our current policy rates as being at an emergency setting, a comment that's clearly meant to imply that emergency rates

My view from these memos is that having the r not really an emergency setting.  Maintaining a zero funds rate is just prudent policy following a long period when we would have liked to have put rates much, much lower but couldn't because of the effective lower bound.  These low r * estimates also mean that increases finally now is a prudent risknot enough to simply point to wide uncertainty bands surrounding  * We need to assess the variety of policy losses under different realizations of losses are asymmetric at the zero lower bound, and, hence, in David, Chris, Ben, and liftoff and prescribes lower rates until uncertainty about Fisher, Gourio, and Krane reached a similar conclusion on the basis of a different Fourth, uncertainty about r * most likely implies that 'lower for longer' management policy.

President Bullard, some years ago, when he was talking should start doing more asset purchases, work commitment to that interest rule, and that knocks that equilibrium out.  It's outside the model, but in talking about these it begins to ratify this.  That's why I think it's so important for us to recommit in an aggressive symmetric approach to so that people won't be left with that wrong impression and perhaps validate that type of kind of about this issue, similarly argued that maybe we the money angle on this.  That's another attempt to break the slavish rate things, as President Lacker mentioned, if the public starts thinking we're going after lower inflation, ourselves firmly to our inflation objective of 2 percent that outcome.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIR

Chair.  I want to thank all of the and the authors for a great set of memos.  I find the analysis to be highly informative, believe I will illustrate through my comments.  And, as others have noted, I think this is a not only of the current policy considerations facing the Committee but in terms of the policy considerations that may be facing the Committee for years to come. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Madam presenters as I very timely topic, in terms also high-level takeaways from the memo.  Short-run  * has risen from to expect short-run to rise. to persist, we should expect short-run 2007 level for years to is broadly consistent with the pattern that we see in longer-term TIPS yields.  There premiums from the behavior of expectations of broadly consistent with what we see in longer-term TIPS with the preceding two statements.  In general, I have three r recessionary lows, and there are good reasons r * to continue However, there have been significant downward trends in long-run and steady-state  *.  If those r trends were r * to remain below its come.  This are some issues there about sorting out term short-run real interest rates, but it is yields.  There are many uncertainties associated because of the presence of the effective lower bound, those uncertainties argue for moreaccommodative policy.  My summary of these takeaways is that it would be appropriate for the

October 27-28, 2015

much lower, than the familiar Taylor rules. FOMC to use a reaction function, both now and in the future, that has a lower intercept, potentially a potentially important FOMC policy reaction low  * and financial stability. I want to make two additional comments.  The first concerns takeaway from the memos about the nature of the slope coefficients in the function.  We focused a lot of the discussion on the intercepts through our conversation about r *. The second comment I want to make builds on President Mester's questions about r measures of

at the end of the memo, which I'll note that most of my are about our assessments of  *, with the idea that we could rule.  As I have heard from the comments made by Vice Chairman Dudley-it is pretty hard to know is going to be pretty hard to formulate and communicate My first comment is about the nature of the slope coefficients in the FOMC policy reaction function.  The questions colleagues have neatly sidestepped, r plug those different assessments into a policy others around the table-President Williams, what is driving  *.  And so I think it r measures of r * on an ongoing basis.

memo by López-Salido and others was potentially helpful along these It points out that if we use a Taylor rule with a high coefficient on inflation deviationsthat this is a lesson from President Williams's former work as well-we are to real rate of interest.  So there are no shocks to the Phillips curve.  In that case, it is the natural real rate of interest, this so-called 'divine Now, I think the lines. and Thomas pointed out can substitute for this kind of uncertainty while essentially using a policy rule that tracks variations in r * around its long-run value, without having to measure those variations.  And the intuition behind this finding, I think, is simple to understand when the only shocks present the natural optimal to use a rule that tracks

that it's always optimal to tighten further if inflation low.  That suggests we can get good outcomes by that has a high coefficient on inflation gaps.  In a recent working paper, Chris House student coauthor show that we can get arbitrarily close to that has large coefficients on inflation.  So you don't have to measure the variations in have to track inflation and respond to inflation very Another way to say that, though, is is too high and to ease further if inflation is too using a rule of the University of Michigan and a desirable outcomes in this no-shocks-to-the-Phillips-curve case by using a rule arbitrarily r * around its long-term value, you just aggressively.

is potentially an important lesson.  As we all talked about already, measuring why you might want to do that. true that inflation isn't perfectly measured, and this is an important consideration that drives inflation in a lot of our communications.  But we could filter it inflation instead.  This was, indeed, a favorite prescription of Chairman also very similar to the goal-oriented approach that President Evans and I you put a lot of weight on your goals, and that drives what setting of the policy rate would be. I think this r * and communicating about it could be very hard.  Responding a lot more aggressively to inflation is not.  I think it's easy to communicate to the public It's us, for example, to talk about core by using forecast Bernanke, and it is have advocated for some time-that your in the memo suggest we can track variations in  * memo by López-Salido and others settles on a coefficient of 20-about So that's my first comment.  Results r around its long-run value, if you were to use a rule that was more aggressive, potentially a lot more aggressive-the responding to actual or forecast inflation gaps.

for the words 'financial stability,' and it came up blank.  I reference to financial stability.  I think this is an important omission that I work will fill.  About two and a half years ago, I gave a speech about low  * and stability, and I pointed out that if to be low permanently or even high persistently, able to achieve our dual-mandate objectives in the presence of signs of in California, or potentially in the nation as a whole, were unduly frothy because low by previous if things like the rent-to-price ratio are indeed low by previous historical standards. My second comment follows up on what President Mester was saying about financial stability.  I did a search of the papers didn't find a single hope future r financial r * is we are only going to be financial stability.  President Williams, at our previous meeting, expressed concern that housing markets, at least rent-to-price ratios had fallen back to 2003 levels.  But if r * is going to be historical standards for years to come, then we are only going to achieve our dual-mandate objectives

Jing are right, that there are good reasons to believe low for years to come.  If so, it will be even more important for central QS a valuable first step along those lines for this Committee, and I will talk about some hope we can build on it.  Maybe you can build on that analysis in the next go-round. My own thinking is that Kei-Mu and that r * is likely to be banks to integrate financial-stability considerations into their policy assessments.  The analysis is ways that I

thought there already were some very thoughtful comments-I will just echo that I President Williams and President Rosengren made.  If  * is low for quite some time to come, that really suggests the need to reevaluate the like LSAPs an emergency tool, a break-thereally should be part of the toolkit if has certainly proven to be useful in Europe as well as I agree with them very strongly-that r going to be whole framework of the Committee.  Are things glass kind of tool, or something that r * is going to remain low?  Contemplating negative interest rates potentially contemplating a change in the inflation target itself.  All of these, I think, are things

In the short term, while for three reasons:  We have inflation below mandate; we economic growth that is barely above trend; and we have, as page 10 of the handout shows, make up for when the Committee was unable, probably despite significant economy. What are the implications of this? r * may be low, short-term rates are now substantially negative.  So real short-term rates are providing a good deal of stimulus.

I agree that the zero lower bound.

This work, to me, doesn't speak directly to that question.  There is also the argument that uncertainty about r * as well as about unemployment should lead us to de-emphasize those factors lead, then, to something that focuses on the inflation gap, which we are better

I would say that r clearer and more troubling.  If economic growth is going to continue along just a bit above its lackluster trend rate, it would not surprise me if every single rate decision will be very challenging in the coming years.  On that growth path, it is going to be extraordinarily difficultindeed, it would be And, over time, as others have stressed, episodes at the effective

point, I read one of Andy Haldane's clever speeches over the summer titled with Bill English and many others. Based on historical data, experience suggests that 400 basis points, give or take 100 basis points, in a path for rates, or even the latest primary dealer will see that almost any recession for the next several years will return us to zero So I would echo what others have said around the table.  There really is a need to of our tools, including forward guidance, the balance sheet, and negative rates, to admit it, we may very well need them.  In fact, we are likely On that last 'Stuck,' which caused me to get into a series of discussions And Bill ran some numbers, which I'll share. the chance of a recession over the next four years from today is about 40 or 50 percent.

Empirical estimates also vary widely constructs.  The initial table explaining different definitions.  This, of course, leads to considerable uncertainty the associated policy advice.

The rate of return to capital, as calculated by Gomme, Ravikumar, and Rupert, and by others, no downward trend since 1985.

The third the marginal product of capital versus returns to government debt call into question the advice useful as that model is, there is no capital expected to be falling in tandem with the returns which is arguably not happening in the data.

A second comment on policy:  Taking on a more r *, an estimate like the which is minus 2 percent, would imply that U.S. monetary policy is currently not accommodative.  At least that would be one interpretation.  This would require, in my opinion, a dramatic shift in Committee rhetoric, which has repeatedly emphasized 'highly accommodative' policy over the past five we wanted to go in that direction, we could do it, but we have told people that we can, we have supplemented zero rates with We could make that argument, but it would be a shock, maybe to ourselves and to how people outside this Committee have been I think if we are aiding the recovery, that we have done all many other actions, promises to stay at zero longer, and quantitative easing.  So we have said that we have a highly accommodative policy.

That's what I always took the rhetoric about high tools, because of the evolution of the economy, had believes that the the past five think it will come as a shock for them to find out that inflation has been for seven years, or that output has been growing so slowly.

It clearly implies is currently below normal.  We haven't, I don't mean by 'normal,' but the central tendency, or the median, of might reasonably be considered a rough guide.  And by that proxy, the course of the of what normal is.  I think today's discussion, and the work that we do more in mind with 'normal.'  It also perhaps can help educate the MS. BRAINARD.  I will follow up on this conversation about communications.  I think the very helpful work that the as well as how we talk about what we mean by 'normalization.'  I went to our website, and it equates normalization to more normal levels. that the target range for the federal funds rate think, explicitly defined what we the path in the SEP definition of normal has moved down noticeably at all horizons over the Committee's discussion based on it, does provide a common analytical framework that should help us get to a common definition of what we have public, which I think is very important.

stands out from the work that was presented here, from the empirical models and the other been done in this area, is that a wide variety of models suggest that in recent years and is only now approaching or is close to zero six years into previous decades, it implies the accommodation associated with any given level of the federal funds rate has fallen short terms.  And those shorter-run estimates likely to be mildly accommodative, I think what estimates of the shorter-run natural rate of interest from the DSGE important work that has r * has been negative the recovery.  With these estimates far below the average level in that of what one might have been thinking about in historical imply that the current level of the federal funds rate is something that might help explain the very gradual pace of expansion in activity and, in

And, as we know, seen a very large shift down in 10-year sovereign bond shift that has been persistent over the past year or so.  But also, interestingly, if we look rates with average real percent earlier to around zero in recent times. There are, I think, a host of observable reasons that the natural rate might be low currently.  And, of course, earlier in the recovery, the dominant explanations focused on domestic factors and headwinds from the crisis.  More recently, I think it's likely that outlook has r Weak in the other G-7 economies we have yields, a at emerging markets, we have seen a broad-based reduction in interest Treasury bill rates falling from about 5

staff provided a useful simulation to get a sense of how big an might be necessary to restore monetary policy to 'normal' in insulating domestic employment from an appreciation in the dollar.  So let's just appreciation of the dollar, which is the experiment that they ran, which is about have seen in the past year alone.  It suggests that in the Taylor (1999) rule with a fixed intercept, normalization of monetary policy in the intercept about in the neighborhood of the effective lower bound, that the path down. The way this would spill over into our rates would be through adjustments in the exchange rate.  I think the adjustment in the federal funds rate the sense of take a 10 percent two-thirds of the movement that we context of a sense of insulating us from this exchange rate shock would call for lowering the 60 basis points.

What is important, I think, is that that benchmark, it gets us to on the output gap, and we are still shy of our 2 percent target at the end of the 12 quarters, suggesting that if we cared a lot about inflation, we Or, similarly, we are pretty far along in the policy normalization as closing the output gap what constitutes lower federal funds rate would be appropriate right now. accommodative relative that, if that benchmark actually takes no account of inflation.

CHAIR discussion, and especially to the staff for an excellent set of memos and presentations. just say that r * has always played a key role policy, and, at various times, a related notion we have called the neutral funds rate has played a central role in FOMC communications about monetary policy strategy.  Frankly, I potentially assume a back to my economic and policy remarks later on.  But, for now, if you to add a couple of comments of my own on the three questions I will come r * in would permit me, I would like posed by the staff.

For fiscal policy, we assumed that the Congress and the Administration would find their way to avoid a government shutdown and raise economy, and, fortunately, that does now assume that the federal funds rate will lift off from its effective lower bound after the December liftoff date.

meant to talk about core.  The 12-month change in PCE in July was 1.2 percent, and you expect it to move up to 1.5 in December.  If you go to story for the contours of that forecast? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Sorry.  I core Tealbook A, the outlook for 2016 is actually, I think, 1.4 percent.  So I was just wondering, what's the

That's right.  For 2015 as a whole, the four-quarter change is 1.4 percent, the 12-month numbers you're seeing in the fourth quarter are at is a little bit of residual seasonality, is not as visible because the September CPI that we just got into our monthlies for the couple of months, and that affects the three-month change pattern that you're seeing, in from 1.5 in November to 1.2 in December. MR. LEBOW. and so it's not surprising that that same level.  One of the factors built into our projection as we've talked about before.  That was higher than expected.  We do have some low-ish numbers built next which it falls back expecting that some of the effects of the import prices what import will do.  That in itself would lead you to expect a little higher inflation in 2016.  In fact, maybe a couple of tenths.  In 2015, that 1.4 is actually a little higher than we predicted on the basis of the fundamentals, including the movements of the dollar and So that slight positive surprise in 2015 goes away and offsets the dollar effects same 1.4 in 2015 and 2016 in our projection of inflation edging up from there as the import and energy price Broadly speaking, in 2016, we are holding down core inflation are going to be waning, according to our projection of prices that's worth would've import prices. coming out in 2016.  That's why we've got the core inflation.  Then we have core effects on core dwindle further.

Certainly, the evidence from the examinations that our declined over the past year.  At the same time, there was a in late 2014 and the in which there's a volume of leveraged the increase in risk aversion, it seems to reflect more risk aversion or risk appetite or the outlook for MR. LEHNERT.  Yes. supervisory colleagues have conducted is that the number of so-called nonpass loans-that is, loans violating the guidance-really pretty substantial increase in risk aversion.  We had the oil price declines associated concerns about the outlook for that sector loans.  So between supervisory pressure, guidance, et cetera, and it's hard to judge.  I guess I'd say that the spread widening probably can't be explained by guidance per se, and that that sector.

I'd like to ask a question about Tealbook A box on page 54, 'The Recent For a r *, and one of the things that that is, it depends a little on your modeling strategy-whether your shocks are basically stationary and you're not going to have your estimates or whether you allow them to be permanent.  Our FOMC statement, for quite some time, has pointed to market measures of inflation compensation moving down but survey measures being

What's cake, of the box-most of our term structure like that, so they can't move very far from endpoint inflation expectations.  But in the box to a new model that has  (1) properties, so it has the possibility of seeing them move. it right, its estimate is potentially 50 basis points viewed as an upper bound.  I'm not quite sure how to put all If I remember right, the inflation attractor that the Tealbook uses is the assumption that it's going to move up, and we don't Now, taking it to the yield curve data-the topic models have baked into them I (0) stationary assumptions about inflation and the yields and things you allude I This came up with President Lacker's comment about different equilibrium and whether inflation expectations can move down.  If I understand lower inflation expectations.  That's of those things together. around 1.8 percent, and then there's really know.  Could you discuss some of that?

Perhaps I can pick up on the upper-bound notion.  That really has to possible persistence of shocks to inflation.  In that sense, rightly, this model takes the these shocks might leave a permanent imprint.  You might view that as one polar implications for whether, technically speaking, you have a unit root, or the reason, the data also don't speak very loudly on the matter, so we're our this assumption or what's built into the standard model, it would be is.  As you know, even some persistence-at the 5-to-10-year horizon, you can generate MR. LAUBACH. do with the view that assumption.  You're right in pointing out that it matters a whole lot for the longer-horizon inflation expectations root is 0.99.  It makes a huge difference as you forecast further and further out.  Of course, I'd add that, sadly, for that presenting this estimate as an interesting case to consider.  But if you asked us about confidence as to whether it's very difficult for us to confidently say anything about which of the two it in our standard model, there's

October 27-28, 2015

revert back very quickly.  Nonetheless, it you literally have permanent confidently in some decline in inflation expectations, and so it doesn't matters a great deal whether you move to the possibility that imprints on inflation expectations.  I wish we had greater ability to discriminate the data between these two.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  I'm sympathetic to all of those issues.

Regarding the inflation projection itself, just to be clear, our projection is stable for some more.  In other words, we're not taking signal for our baseline inflation projection from this TIPS spreads moving lower.  Our assumption is of stable expectations that are to be consistent with 2 percent run, but there would be no support for that assumption in the TIPS dataopposite. MR.

I don't just risk to the macroeconomic outlook, actually also focused on risk to economic growth.  Which should I think of as the In the QS report, chart 1-11 shows mentioned are at very, very low levels-in fact, I would say the lowest we've seen since 2006 and 2007.  Also the want to think about financial stability, I want to think about because when I talk about financial stability, we immediately go into leverage of banks and this and that.  I'm

Is it the price-to-rent ratio relative to a a historical norm, or a cap rate that's adjusted for where rates and other right-hand-side variables may be? better metric, or historical norm, a cap rate relative to interest as we saw in the mid-2000s, that basically all assets were overvalued, and so estate cap rates with Treasury securities, everything looks as I understand from the to mean interest rates and things like that.  The way I read the house-price-to-rent that the house prices are about 35 percent above their historical norms, but once you put trend and the carrying costs and other things, it actually looks pretty good. It could be, when you compare commercial real great because everything is in a frothy state while, in fact, there are problems all over the place. Also, in the house-price-to-rent ratio, you have this long-run trend that, footnote, reflects not only some trend in the house-price-to-rent ratio but also carrying costs, which I take ratio is in this

long-run in both the Tealbook and the QS report really comes from.  To what extent is that it really reflecting just interest rates?  At the last FOMC meeting, I said house roughly 30 percent overvalued based on a chart like this, and of course the Tealbook that's not correct, they're actually overvalued by 6 percent.  I want to know the right way to MR. WILLIAMS.  But then that would argue, 'Don't tell me cap rates are low because Treasury yields are low, so that's okay.'  But I also don't quite understand where this trend that's some view about trend price-to-rent ratios-which I don't have a good understanding of-or to what extent is prices were says think about the risk to the outlook.  Maybe they're both good ways to think about it, but it's a question.  It's a leading question.

The question from a decline a lot?  What I tried to lay out for you was an argument there wouldn't be any externalities or spillovers from leveraged intermediaries suffering capital losses and That is doubly true in the residential space in which all the credit risk is worse, on the public-sector balance sheet.

about the price-to-rent ratio.  I have to talk about that, too. I think I might be the original progenitor of the price-to-rent ratio.  As I recall, Josh worked on it 15 years ago.  The problem in residential is that there's no equivalent being both available for rent and way to approach that problem is to compare indexes with indexes-the with the index of rents.  There are many measurement problems, but the most I heard some questions [Laughter] Gallin and I of cap rate.  There's no way that you really observe a house available for sale.  One index of prices

October 27-28, 2015

is that the stock of rental housing and the stock of owner-occupied housing are terms of their hedonic qualities over time-the willingness of people to pay for the main underlying source for the price-to-rent ratio trend. obvious one divergent in them.  So that's bunch of different ways to correct for this, including Census data directly and actually doing a regression of hedonic characteristics and much simpler just assume that there's some kind of trend in real let's say that the All of these kinds of approaches-the paper that I wrote with our former colleague Morris the trend-all give you answers that housing is no rich.  I don't know if that helps you. Then the question of the sensitivity of the overvaluation estimate to the trend is a fair one. Back when I was doing this, I tried a looking at the trying to construct an equivalent rental house and an equivalent occupied house.  A way to do it is to forget about rent.  Let's house prices for whatever reason-population growth, what have you.  And bubble period began in 2000 or 2001, and let's estimate the trend through there and then jump it off.

I want to build on President Williams's Andreas actually has more to say about it than he has to this point. was, I think, implicitly drawing an important distinction between, on the one stability considerations, in which leverage is implicated-meaning that there's effect MR. TARULLO. question, because I think President Williams hand, financial some significant risk to the intermediation function-and, on the other hand, the potential of leverage as a macroeconomic matter.

Andreas, I thought we had a pretty good case study of at least thinking that leveraged-lending context that Governor Fischer was mentioning a moment ago. were pretty confident that financial-stability risks, as conventionally understood, that implicated by this big growth of leveraged-lending originations because so themselves intermediators, leveraged intermediators.  But then there was a complementary analysis, you would still be concerned because this is risk of quite a few bankruptcies-more bankruptcies with a minor dip than would may not have supervisory or regulatory tools to it, it still ought to be relevant.  That was what I understood John to be getting at, which more granular data on, as he would put it, how to 'disaggregate' that curve. characterizing fairly what you said 6 or 8 or 10 months ago. Nellie and through in the In that case we were not all much of that was getting passed on to ultimate holders who were not or at least not highly which I think came from your office, saying that upping the otherwise take place-and, thus, although we deal with then does argue for I think I'm late 2014, as I recall, we asked what the concerned about the growth of the leveraged finance sector.

One could say that about people who own commercial real estate and MR. TARULLO. people who own houses, too, even though they're not intermediators, right?

Thank you, Madam intervention was really food for about thinking about the decomposition of price-to-rent ratios into a of-short-rates factor, and a term premium should feel about the current level of the time-series properties of these various factors.

DUDLEY.  Yes.  I'd like to talk about something that we haven't the VICE CHAIRMAN talked about yet, which is Puerto Rico.  Time is running out there, and nothing that will facilitate an orderly restructuring has yet emerged.  On the positive side, you've probably seen that

October 27-28, 2015

in proposing that the Congress pass legislation that would territory-not just the public corporations, but the territory itself-to have the option If they got that authority, that would be important, because that would pressure on creditors to agree to a voluntary restructuring or, failing that, to have a more earned income tax credit for Puerto Rican residents, improving aftermath. U.S. Treasury has taken the initiative enable the of filing for bankruptcy. put organized process for restructuring under bankruptcy protection.  Also, the Treasury has advocated increasing the Medicaid access, and having an oversight board to monitor the restructuring and its response to the U.S. Treasury's the Treasury proposals go far could be addressed that the Treasury is silent on, including exempting Puerto lower minimum wage for Puerto Rico, or taking steps to tax base, because Puerto Rico has a very large informal economy. On the negative side, I would say that the congressional proposal has been lukewarm at best, and it's unclear whether enough, frankly, in putting Puerto Rico on a sustainable course.  There are many other structural impediments that Rico from the Jones Act, allowing a broaden the

At this juncture, a hard landing for Puerto Rico months, and much needs to be done transpire, it's past, the systemic effect on the broader U.S. economy and the financial very modest.

MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  This follows up on one of Andreas's charts.  Recently, a number of economic research papers have focused on assessing the

Not so long ago, we were concerned that credit spreads is noteworthy that spreads have is somewhat incongruous that we are seeing credit spreads information content were unusually low, suggesting an underpricing of risk.  It moved from their unusually low levels.  Particularly at a time when we are actively considering tightening monetary policy, it reaching multiyear highs last seen several years ago when concerns over European problems were particularly acute.

If one looks of America Merrill Lynch high-yield corporate bond index, high-yield spreads have America Merrill Lynch high-yield index, high-yield spreads It should be to Treasury bonds are significantly below the peaks seen during the financial at the Bank risen 267 basis points since June 2014.  Although this increase has certainly been aggravated by the oil and commodity downturn that has significantly affected firms in those industries, the rise in high-yield bond spreads is not coming from that sector alone.  For example, when the energy sector is excluded from the Bank of ex energy have widened 210 basis points.

If so, we should be considering the implications for how these high-yield bond characteristics may affect the performance of these bonds in a future investors to rapidly reduce their One explanation for the However, if so, concerns being expressed in bond spreads are policy and the need to tighten rates.  An alternative is that high-yield securities are now viewed as being more risky because of loosening underwriting standards and the investors changes in downturn, as well as how such a downturn might cause willingness to hold risky assets, further adding to any instability in bond markets.

The earnings for 19 times 2015 earnings. when earnings are rising, but these earnings are actually declining.  This multiple really me as full.  Having said that, unlike that could lead to a boom and a bust, what I see that worries me maybe as much is a significant and prolonged trend in behavior between bonds and more risky assets, and carry trade taking place in various forms.

particular aspect of this that probably bothers me the most, and that is in the behavior of people running companies and what it means today to run a would say that in the sixth year of an expansion, you would in the area of people running companies. CEOs have had to become not so much operators as financial engineers.

This is because-even though there have always been activists-in the past several years, pools of capital frames are shorter, but also the tenure of CEOs country is much shorter.  It's not a coincidence.  These pools of capital have an extremely at which I would call them renters of the stock, not owners of the stay around long enough to get a CEO-or groups of them will get a because the people themselves have made allocations away from bonds to riskier assets.

QS report we received on well summarized in two charts.  The first risks and vulnerabilities are moderate.  The other one that is sometimes known as 'the spider's web.'  If we look at the 32, it tells a very interesting story.  On the side that says 'Financial Sector relative to what there was before the crisis, there's almost nothing that looks real estate sticks out as in which we're now in worse shape, according to this, than we were in 2006.  This is story in a very vivid way.  By the MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I want to say a few words about the QS and the work that's being done in the Office of Financial Stability.  The October 20, 2015, is really extremely useful, and it's one is on page 3, which we've talked about already.  It's the overall evaluation of what's going on, with the overall assessment being that is on page 32-the radar chart one on page Vulnerability,' dangerous until we get around to consumer credit.  And then commercial the one area a very useful chart for concentrating the mind and telling the way, on page 32, there are a few things for which we don't yet have the data-as far as I can see, we don't yet have the data for nonfinancial business-so there may be something more that is problematic.

the question is, 'what are we supposed to do with this if we detect a problem area?' likely to say, 'Use macroprudential policy,' but we don't have a whole lot of capital buffer, which is gradually making its Board.  We have margin requirements, which we haven't to those lenders we to try to control risks.  And we've got OMP, which is 'open mouth works, and something we'll have to feel our way into. Now, We're macroprudential tools.  We have the countercyclical way into regular examination by the used for a long time.  We have supervisory capacities, which, at least supervise, we can use policy,' which may do well in some circumstances.  We don't know how well this all it's

We hope there will be all of that, and we can the effort that Nellie and her colleagues are putting into the surveillance is very, very The other half of this-the stuff that are doing-is structural reforms, and that becomes the far more important to do to reduce the potential costs of future crises a lot going on there.  There improved resolution procedures soon.  So we can feel a bit better about feel that useful.

this and the work that goes on in which is monitoring, is essentially an intelligence exercise-it's the exercise of an inherently difficult.  History tells you that however good the means, once again, is very, very important.  Getting the structure right, getting the ability to absorb losses is what is being done by the people But we also have to remind ourselves that surveys like the FSOC, intelligence agency, which is intelligence agencies are, they make mistakes and they miss things, which that this probably more important, without detracting in any way from doing financial stability analysis.

The stance of monetary policy should not bondholders will lose money monetary policy is whether that is not readily ex post monetary policy tools.  We need to have a way to trace the There are two key points as you think about how to become more systematic.  First, as already noted, our statutory mandate employment.

The current approach implicitly treats financial briefing to be more seamlessly integrated into Tealbook A. more specific about what I have in mind.  Tealbook A currently focuses on monetary policy influences the modal outlook, which is grounded in the certainty principle that emerges from quadratic objectives.  As I've discussed both here and in which monetary policy influences the risks to the outlook beyond just the modal Tealbook A that allows the Committee a systematic and quantitative way, how its monetary policy decisions will influence associated with that outlook.  I'm optimistic that through around the System, this goal could well be As I said at the beginning, I feel the current financial the FOMC well, but I see it only as stability as an add-on concern for the Committee's consideration.  The Committee and its staff should aim for the financial-stability Let me be somewhat how equivalence various conference settings, we can incorporate financial-stability considerations by seeing them as a way in outlook itself.  I would say the ultimate goal should be a to gauge, in both the modal outlook and the risks the collective effort of QS and monetary economists achievable in a couple of years.

When those risks mature, it is a very big deal because they tend not to go incrementally, it's a tail-risk wondering how the Tealbook kind of approach could be modified to incorporate a sensible fashion like that. MR. TARULLO.  Can I I'm not going to have this opportunity again-on that point you just made, I recall the fact risk-management systems, particularly quantitative risk-management systems, of banks broke down because they were so bad at dealing with tail events.  I'm wondering whether there's similar problem here.  The risk to understanding of it-is indeed, as we saw a few years ago, but issue.  And I'm tail risks in people in this room to try to address this.

It starts to to force yourself to think about them is to think about not just the mean, just the variances, as I've emphasized in some of my talks or that Svensson has, but also higher moments. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I think it would be useful to actually draw upon thinking beyond the Governor, made reference to the nature.  So force you to think about tail events.  Tail events are hard because they don't occur very often, but I think the way you start not these

So it probably means thinking a bit more in terms of trying to do what the Survey of Professional Forecasters does captures tail events, and very rarely did seem to widen prior to actual problems occurring. MR. ROSENGREN.  Just one follow-up to that Forecasters distribution, particularly in simulation exercises rather than because my past experience with that is, it almost never the tails with what President Rosengren is saying.

With the August tumult and no notable effect on firms with the largest is not surprising that the U.S. economy has not suffered the potential to defer the onset of tightening at our September meeting. Financial markets have recovered abroad.  Boston staff analysis of stock market movements since the middle of August finds little effect on the stock prices of firms with large foreign exposure.

In fact, the range of estimates is clustered at or just above zero.

As we discussed earlier semistructural approaches, such as the restrictive VAR approaches, such as those but they are

So if any slack remains in the labor market, it continues to decline.  Some of the slowdown in payroll employment certainly may represent demand, particularly in manufacturing.

is no longer any slack in labor markets, then wage growth.  The presumption of a relationship between wage growth and the elimination of slack makes intuitive sense, but the staff memo on that slack is just not a major driver of nominal wage growth.  This consistent with a long line of empirical research on the cyclicality of real wages, most real wages.  Furthermore, what attributable to observations increases in the unemployment rate.  During periods of declining low unemployment, you don't see much relationship at all between wages and count on wages as our canary One often hears the argument that if there we should see increasing nominal nominal compensation points out analysis is of which finds, at best, only weakly pro-cyclical aggregate evidence there is for procyclical wages seems predominantly associated with large unemployment or the unemployment rate.

And whether you want to go through QE is interpreted as promising to stay at the zero bound longer, either any effect if you've already converged to this equilibrium outcome. Second, promising to remain at the zero lower bound simply reinforces the equilibrium, and it you're going to stay at the zero lower bound.  So that's where the steady you want to promise directly that you'll stay at the zero bound longer or a QE route, in which the way you wouldn't have target, and you would not be able to get inflation to idea the energy price shock is going to wear off and inflation is going to come back to target.  I'm et al. steady state here.  But if we did get stuck in that target. Third, inflation would remain below the target.  And just so that you're not completely giving up hope with me, I do buy into the that not completely buying into the Benhabib steady state, inflation would just stay below

in the recent mixed data and anecdotal input, my staff and I are putting estimate for the third which is essentially unchanged from the robust second quarter.  That said, we see the growth as weak compared with the second quarter, suppressing effect of net exports.  Our numbers indicated off the real final sales top line, so to speak, and sales is the also sticking to my belief that recent subtarget inflation readings are mostly due to a global situation stabilizes. To find the signal emphasis on real final sales.  According to our most recent GDP tracking quarter, final sales to domestic purchasers appear to show growth at an annual rate of around 3½ percent, bottom line for third-quarter real GDP reflecting inventory swings and the that net exports could take 0.7 percentage point inventory rebalancing could reduce growth another 2 percentage points.  Nonetheless, I am prepared to look through these effects, and I think the continuing strength of real final story.  I am stronger dollar and falling global commodity prices, and that stronger inflation readings are likely as the notice of the reduced speed of job growth in August and September.  But, as labor market is hard to see from a single indicator over just a months.  The level of unemployment continues to fall.  Jobless claims are still pushing share of workers working part time for economic reasons and the associated broad U-6, both fell sharply in September.  Layoff and discharge rates remain I have taken we know, a complete picture of the few lower.  The measure of joblessness, low and steady, and job openings are elevated.  The entirety of the labor market data, at this date, at least, has me leaving my unemployment rate projection unchanged and essentially the same as the Tealbook.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm going to offer a bit of a brief against data dependence and do that as cover for explaining why my outlook hasn't changed very much since September.  And when I say 'a brief against data dependence,' I don't think there is anything terribly original in what don't manifest themselves very much in this actual outlooks.  But I think these problems have been manifesting themselves communications, in which a focus on one or a few pieces of data somehow implies there are, for example, three good and two bad data points over the two is going to make a difference we all know, what's going on in the economy generally doesn't change fundamentally have, either implicitly or explicitly, our own narrative as to what is economy.

We all basically going on in the resistant to a few, or something that suggests economy.  Those subtleties often don't come through in public communication, though,

There was no evidence of a pickup in inflation or, to the degree nominal wage growth in the context of a globally disinflationary environment. in the and correlations, or the degree to which secular way that mean that those conditions and correlations may not reappear. a very high degree of uncertainty about the global economy, with dollar. I want to now explain why my basic much for a while now of having been externally characterized as being in the members of following:  We particularly in the it's relevant, There were continued puzzles in various economic developments-again, particularly labor market-reflecting the continued difficulty of determining the degree to which we are just in an elongated reversion to pre-crisis conditions changes may be under And, finally, there was potentially dramatic downside risks following the August market movements in China, and there was resulting increased upward pressure on the there has been some softening of gaining strength.  But, as several of you have commented, consumer think it is probably too early to much the labor market has slowed down or whether it has slowed down as So what have we seen since September?  First, incoming data, particularly in industrial production, employment, and recently even in housing, which had looked to be spending has stood up fairly well during this period.  Second, I know exactly how

October 27-28, 2015

current September numbers suggest.  People have already noted that August and As to the external environment, possible downside risks seem less dramatic than at the September meeting.  But as reflected in the actual and Bank of those major economies are still quite uncertain, with significant much as the September job numbers are more susceptible to revision than your average monthly job numbers, so we may see some change there. certainly anticipated actions of the People's Bank of China, the European Central Bank, and the Japan, economic prospects in remaining downside risks.

in the coming quarters really does matter-I think significantly. a major effect on economic performance this year, and it certainly could be a well.  It's hard to say at the moment upward pressure on the dollar created by the various anticipated central bank moves rest of the world will be offset by significantly enhanced economic growth abroad or more or both.  However, in light of the regarding earnings reports, to which President Kaplan referred this this will be the case. The trend of the dollar It's had disappointing source of downside risk over the next year as whether the in the than transitory effects on asset prices in the United States relatively sober expectations morning, we can't be sure that much.  Looking at our dual criteria of continued improvement that inflation will return to target, I don't see these to be seeing some slowing.  Thus, while I'm still inclined to believe we further improvement in labor markets without negative inflationary me, at least, even more likely that any pickup in inflation won't get natural rate of unemployment What are the implications of these changes for my outlook and, thus, for policy?  As I said, I don't think it changes them in labor markets and reasonable assurance data as having provided a reason to change that outlook very much.  With respect to labor markets, we are likely can have some consequences, it seems to away from us.  And I think the case for a lower short-term

I am not going to repeat what I said last meeting-or, for that matter, in numerous down, with any degree of precision, the natural rate or relationship of unemployment to price inflation.  I Okun's law are two further reminders of how sensitive the assumptions about unobservables.

But there is probably some fact that both the Labor Department's and Conference Board's total job been trending down a little bit of late, though I'm not sure how much is there. Several of you have mentioned job openings.  The run-up to a historically high level of job openings over the past year moved much in tandem, or even with a lag, in relation to openings.  Decomposition of the data showing that, for example, professional services past year suggest the measure may be a bit misleading, a conclusion that using the Conference Board's numbers for openings would leave the Beveridge curve information value in the openings numbers have information value there that over the rest of this go-round the familiar arguments on both sides I don't want to take direct issue with the argument that most of the to observe, again, that we are in a generally disinflationary also worth noting that the pattern of the past several years has been that most increase in inflation than turns out to be the case. With respect to inflation, the arguments here are pretty familiar.  We have already heard a couple, and I'll bet you will likely be repeated. current downward pressure on inflation can be attributed to declines in energy prices and increases in the dollar, but I do want environment.  It is observers keep expecting a bigger

Similarly, the what core PCE inflation will be in the succeeding year. core inflation in 2013 was 1.7 to 2 central-tendency percent.  In September 2014, the here at the end of which the projection was made, it that there was only one projection of inflation among all of us during that period that anticipated inflation would be lower I am going to take a If you look at the inflation 0.4 percentage point above where it current projection SEP shows repeated overestimation of In September 2012, the central-tendency projection of percent; actual inflation in 2013 was 1.5 percent.  In September 2013, the projection for 2014 was 1.5 to 1.7 percent; the actual was 1.4 central-tendency projection for 2015 was 1.6 to 1.9 percent, and as we sit October, we are now expecting somewhere around 1.4 percent.  In fact, if you look at those three SEPs in September preceding the beginning of the year for appears turned out to get the number right, and no projections that than it actually turned out to be.

There is quite likely some correlation in GDP and inflation, but something is going on with respect to unemployment.  That pattern suggests that there may be some economic growth, in a more persistent itself being transitory. As a group, we have direction.  As consistently else underlying fundamentals affecting inflation, and possibly way, and that we mistake the transitory nature of specific depressing factors for below-target inflation

But when I put the difficulties of using past correlations what inflation will be as well as with the number that many of us are asking inside and outside this room about possible secular me in a position of wanting to rely on data that provide more meeting the inflation target than what I would term 'inferential evidence,' or be drawn.

To be not arguing that; In addition, as recently shown in a paper by Ekaterina Peneva and Jeremy Rudd, as well as many other papers over the years, wages have not been a reliable predictor of price inflation for a long time.

Across different models and force participation, estimates suggest that monthly payroll growth in the is sufficient to put downward pressure on the unemployment rate.  So growth.  Last month declines in many of the broader estimates of underemployment, such as the longand the U-6 measure.  Taken together, I think September's employment further improvement in the labor market.

As oil prices and the value of the dollar have begun the downward pressure on inflation remains well below our the core, trimmed the year-over-year change in the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's median CPI to 2½ percent in September.

But if economic developments along the lines we've seen in recent months, I would view them as indicating that the we've set for liftoff have been met, and I think a prudent course of action would be to With inflation expectations anchored, the effects on inflation of past declines prices growing at an above-trend pace after that imply that there are no risks associated with would shake confidence spending or continue conditions follow through in December.

And if you look at its current level of about 8.5 percent, that kind of has historically been associated with an unemployment rate of 5.3 or 5.4 percent.  That is than the current 5.1 percent, but it suggests that, at least on this broadest definition of least based on measures of people who actually say they want a job, there really lot more slack than the is a pretty broad definition of unemployed.  It's broader than U-5, so you could think 'U-5 extended,' or 'U-5 plus.'  That point number higher underemployment, the unemployment rate is only understating the degree of slack by about 0.3 percentage point.  If you narrow it down to U-5, the difference is only about 0.1 percentage point.  So at isn't a lot more slack out there.  There's somewhat more slack, but not a U-3 measure.

It is possible that Chinese policymakers, in an attempt to minimize economic underperformance and the attendant political risks, will institute a full-scale fiscal stimulus, which would boost economic growth, with positive ramifications globally.  Under this scenario, the U.S. economy might move somewhat more rapidly toward our goals than is currently expected.  However, the for Chinese policymakers to expand is to channel have work against the result, we may see continued hesitation to reemploy this method of stimulus.

And, at this answer to that.  Nevertheless, it is a positive development.

Although we haven't seen any meaningful uptick in nominal pressures.  For example, you hear the story about point.  But nominal market slack very helpful in terms of that growth has faltered, and that those two factors may be offsetting the is, in fact, closing in on full employment.  What I take away from that is, one, I'm pretty uncertain, and, two, as a consequence I wouldn't be comfortable making a pickup in wages a

in inflation compensation.  I understand why inflation term because of the weakness in oil prices and other the five-year, five-year-forward measures are have any reason to results-that this is mostly about the liquidity risk premium and what people disentangle the sources of the decline in inflation compensation. in such a way that they beg the conclusion and of inflation protection makes me a bit more to dismiss the decline in five-year, five-year-forward inflation The fly in the ointment on the inflation side, which people haven't really commented on very much, is the persistent decline compensation is coming down over the near commodity prices, but the persistent declines in more difficult to explain and, therefore, more troubling.  Although I don't dispute the model are willing to pay for inflation protection-I do have some anxiety that we're putting a lot of weight on particular models to The fact that some of the models are constructed push that weight onto liquidity risk and the price concerned.  So I wouldn't want compensation altogether.

I need to see is economic data that make me comfortable that the economy is to grow at an above-trend pace in 2016, that core inflation is flat or rising, and I see that, I think we can definitely justify liftoff liftoff at the next meeting. I think what likely to continue that inflation expectations are well anchored.  If and probably justify a we need to talk about alternatives to that scenario, and I'm going bit about what should happen if the economy should fall meaningfully baseline forecast.  I do think we need a Plan B for monetary policy in case the don't lift off in December, the next question for the Chair is I do think, though, that to talk tomorrow a little short of the economy disappoints, because if we

October 27-28, 2015

And I really don't think we've had that conversation around the table yet to a sufficient degree.  I think this is very important, and I very much on that tomorrow.  I'm going to go at the very end, as I always do, but if and we don't lift off in December, because I think we need to have an answer. maybe you'll have a few thoughts on that.  Thank you, Madam Chair. going to be, what happens if the economy continues to weaken, and what are you actually prepared to do about it? Committee welcome your thoughts you have anything to say earlier, I'd love to hear what you think we should do if the economy disappoints Narayana,

her contacts saw patches of growth coexisting with patches of decline. at least not as strong as what we had been hearing in the past Ninth District.  Our recent data are pretty much consistent with that.  It even outside the oil patch in North Dakota, the labor market in the Ninth District is Kaplan outlined. Madam Chair, the recent reports from our directors in the Ninth District and other contacts in the intermeeting period were somewhat mixed.  I think one of our directors summed it up best by saying that That's a little bit more nuanced, or from our contacts in the suggests that showing signs of stagnation, if not actual deterioration.  In North Dakota, obviously, the situation is much worse than that, but that's pretty much what you would expect given the challenges facing the oil industry that President

October 27-28, 2015

to level-set everyone, Minnesota is a very diversified economy that is not reliant on anything like that.  The employment-to-population ratio in Minnesota has the past year.  Since April, payroll employment in Minnesota has been essentially surprising because of some external demand issues. also not be a surprise, but it's quite disturbing to me that we have seen a economic recovery is flagging, including in sectors that you would generally view as Just oil, agriculture, or fallen over flat.  Over that time we have seen declines of 1 percent or more in employment in construction, manufacturing, and mining.  Mining is not as Manufacturing may decline of such magnitude in construction.  In short, I think that you have to say the Ninth District's sensitive to policy-related changes in the value of the dollar and the expected real interest rates.

the Vice Chairman's demand for it, I will talk about inflation the story is a familiar one.  Inflation is well below target. I think it would be useful to have more conversations about why Someone specifically to target more rapidly.  What are the elements of lead you to have that confidence? Let me turn now to the national economy.  I will speak first about inflation and then turn to employment.  And, just to satisfy compensation.  In terms of inflation, Tealbook A projects that inflation will get back to target in 2019, four years from now.  One comment I will make is that some principals don't agree with Tealbook A's forecast for inflation. mentioned they expect inflation to get back your modeling that myself, I think the staff's analysis of inflation is a compelling one.  But there inflation expectations:  Longer-run inflation them, are at 1.8 percent, then something happens and While that's good for us, it's a very optimistic piece of the it could make you want to think that inflation might not get back to target in 2019. you are just assuming it Frankly, for is a leap of faith about underlying inflation or expectations, or whatever you want to call they get pulled back up to 2 percent. outlook.  But So following up on some of President Evans's comments about whether

October 27-28, 2015

by something more fundamental, I think a conversation on this would be or whether it is driven interesting and useful.

We will get of inflation to target by than in Tealbook A.  The question is, what would more accommodative stance?  The main cost identified in the optimal in Tealbook B is that the unemployment rate would fall below the rate that we think is the natural rate.  I have two comments about the supposed cost of having that I take our congressional mandate to maximum employment literally.  If we can create more jobs without causing excessive to do that, and that's what promoting maximum employment me.  The second comment is on the economics of the situation:  I remain considerably than most of you about our ability to create jobs without creating inflation. of that optimism is due to the inflation picture that I described earlier, but a lot of it is tied to what President Williams described. My outlook under Tealbook A's baseline policy assumption is the same: back to target in 2019.  Now, the FOMC could facilitate a faster return adopting a more accommodative policy stance be the cost of having that control exercise currently supposedly unduly low unemployment.  The first is promote inflation, the Congress requires us means to more optimistic Some to data on household employment.  Here I am going to be giving, I suppose, a countervailing story with regard this group more finely by age, the story remains the same:  If you look at those aged it by sex, EPOP men aged 25 to 54 is down by 3½ percentage points; for women in that age group, it is down Among African Americans aged 25 to Household employment fell dramatically during the recession.  Recovery from that decline, even for prime-age workers, remains highly incomplete.  The fraction of those aged 25 to 54 who have a job remains 3 percentage points below its pre-recession peak in early 2007. If we split 25 to 34, 34 to 45, and 45 to 54, EPOP is down 3 percentage points.  If you split for by only 2½ percentage points.  You can split it by race:

October 27-28, 2015

lower than in 2007. rationalize this large decline as being due to structural changes in the labor for inflation, and this strong decline in prime-age employment as well. 54, EPOP is down by 3 percentage points compared with 2007.  The bottom line is, however you want to slice the data, prime-age employment is about 3 percentage points Given what we know about labor supply elasticities for prime-age workers, it seems very challenging to markets.  So we have some room that suggests that we have more room to work on that front have already noted, inflation has been to come.  Prime-age to we should be providing more continuation of the gradual Let me turn, then, to inflation expectations.  As I low for years, is currently low, and is expected to remain low for years employment has been low for years, is currently low, and is expected to remain low for years come.  To achieve our goals more rapidly, it would seem like accommodation.  But the tilt of policy is very much toward a tightening cycle that the Committee began in May 2013, as opposed to providing an increase in accommodation, as seems appropriate given where we are.

is a disconnect between our policy direction and our policy goals, and I think credibility risk.  The public and the markets may come to achieve our stated longer-term objectives.  And I don't think of this a theoretical one.  As alternative A correctly states, the Federal at historical about this point, simply saying that it has slipped a little bit. I would counsel the Committee to be more transparent about that in the statement.  Then if that information, that's fine.  But I think the facts of the matter are that near or at historical lows. So there this disconnect creates a significant believe that we will not credibility risk as being Reserve's measure of five-year, five-year-forward inflation breakevens is near or lows.  Alternative B is more cagey So you choose to ignore inflation breakevens are

October 27-28, 2015

in liquidity premiums, risk liquidity premiums, we see the same low longer-term inflation expectations in zero-coupon inflation swaps.  And this was not end of 2008, zero-coupon inflation swaps did not fall or TIPS did.  So I would say that there is little are the key driver of the low breakevens in 2015. Low breakevens are often dismissed as being due to a decline premiums, or inflation expectations.  In terms of measures of always true.  If you go back to the anywhere near as much as inflation breakevens evidence that liquidity premiums terms of risk premiums, I thought the Tealbook box was very interesting in terms of premiums and expectations and how complicated is.  But, as I have argued before, our point of view in Minneapolis is that you should think inflation will be unduly low at exactly the same time that economic is low.  Put another way, investors are increasingly betting that the FOMC will be to miss both of its mandates at the same time, in the same direction, over the longer term. aren't crazy.  They seem entirely reasonable given the persistent disconnect between somewhat share President Bullard's concerns that the being in a low-inflation, low-economic-activity I don't think it is because we have committed to a In fact, the decline in inflation expectations that you see in market-based rates. In how you might try to decompose between risk that about risk premiums as being highly informative from an economic point of view.  Investors are increasingly betting that activity willing These bets our actions and our putative objectives.  I markets, at least, are putting more weight on our outcome.  Where I disagree with him is that low interest rate policy. measures really set in in early 2013.  That is associated with the Committee beginning its gradual tightening cycle, not with committing to low interest

Madam Chair, I will summarize briefly.  Inflation is low and is expected to remain low for years.  Prime-age employment is low and is expected to remain low for years.  And yet the tightening cycle and talk about it continues, and that creates a troubling belief in markets that we

YELLEN.  President Williams. CHAIR

WILLIAMS. This is President Kocherlakota's last meeting, and I know he would contradict him contradicting me.  [Laughter]  I do think we know why labor force participation for prime-age men and women is low.  If you compare outside the labor force between1999 with 2014, and look at the answers increase in retired, people who are taking are a lot of reasons for these 'deltas' in relation to the groups that want a job but are not in the labor force and ask why they the staff looked at this very big group, and it has changed very little.  The other group that is of this group at all.  In the survey responses, the answer to the question fewer prime-age people in the labor force relative to 1999, which was a very strong basically that the number of those disabled and retired has increased.  I suppose MR. be very disappointed if I didn't more about the shift by age of those to the question of why they are outside the labor force, there has been a significant the number of people who designate themselves as disabled or care of family, and people in school.  There 1999.  If you look at aren't in the labor force, those are higher.  But, again, this is the reason very carefully.  It's not a not explained is not part 'why are economy?' is the question I have is, can monetary policy change that?

Chair, may I answer President Williams's question? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Madam CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

'yes,' President Williams. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  The answer is

MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you.  I feel better.  [Laughter]

October 27-28, 2015

I think it's important to keep in mind.  With that in getting a job do transit to a job all the time.  And I think that's important to keep in us is, how much of an inflation cost do we have to pay to bring these labor force?  When I look at men aged 25 to 34, maybe you're happy with MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  I'll say a couple of things by way of response.  I think this information is very valuable, first of all, and said, when you look into the flows, as your staff does so ably, you do see that people who have no interest mind.  The question for folks back into the their being retired from the labor market.

Women's ratios are down considerably less.  So I think are margins on which we can work.  I certainly agree that there are limits to what monetary MR. WILLIAMS.  They're in school, which you should like.  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Men aged 25 to 34, their employment-to-population ratio is down 5 percentage points from 2007. there policy can do, but I don't think we have plumbed those limits yet.

Thanks to everyone for an interesting and thoughtful round of to add some my own on the outlook, and in the process anticipate tomorrow's policy discussion. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. comments.  I know it's been a long day, but with your permission, I would like comments of if the federal to 200,000, and the effects of low oil and dollar appreciation on 12-month inflation had totally dissipated-something that in which the unemployment rate likely.  I that excessive pressure on resources could well develop under these conditions, I want to start by reviewing how, in my view, the economic situation has evolved over the past few months.  At the time of our July meeting, my expectation was that funds rate remained near zero, monthly payroll gains would remain close unemployment rate would steadily decline.  Delaying liftoff until the transitory prices looked quite unlikely before spring of 2016-risked a situation might well hit 4½ percent by the middle of next year, with further declines quite worried

To avoid ending up in a situation in which we might need to tighten policy abruptlysomething that could easily disrupt the economy-I anticipated that it would be appropriate to start tightening at our September meeting.

and the associated potential to the U.S. economy.  Although downside risks surely remain, I would say I am less confident now than in July that resource utilization rising at the solid pace I anticipated then. In September, of course, we decided to keep the funds rate unchanged, in large part because of concerns about global financial and economic conditions for adverse spillovers that developments on the global economic front have been largely reassuring.  That said, incoming information, primarily pertaining to the labor market, has for me served to cloud the outlook, with the consequence that will in fact continue midsummer assessment of the modal is warranted.  If that's true, I would see lifting off meeting as entirely appropriate.  But I think it would be wise for us to collect some information before making up our minds on December. Now, it is entirely possible that no change in my economic outlook and its policy implications at the next additional

As and the Vice Chairman noted, our staff's labor market conditions index was flat that the labor market just treaded water-although I did take on board comments, and I think we should pursue those issues with the What worries me more are the weaker readings we have received on the labor market. Monthly payroll gains rate stopped falling, and the labor force participation rate declined appreciably.

Fortunately, with two more labor reports in hand, we should have a better sense of what is going on by December.  If payroll growth does pick up to 180,000 per month, as the staff projects, and data on spending suggests growth at least in line with the Tealbook, I Specifically, liftoff would be appropriate prudent rate.

We have had a good discussion about labor force participation.  But if the staff is correct that the participation rate and the ratio of household employment to payroll employment is likely to edge down, then payroll gains of this magnitude would also be consistent with little or no change in the unemployment rate in 2016.

in the labor market.  On this issue, my assessment has changed slightly since late in leading me to revise down my estimate of the longer-run unemployment rate in my revision still seems appropriate to me.  Not only rate of unemployment equal to 4½ percent, on assuming, as I do, that longer-run inflation expectations are currently anchored at An important consideration in deciding when to begin tightening is the amount of slack that remains July.  As I noted at our previous meeting, the disappointing news on wages was an important factor September SEP submission to 4.8 percent.  This have the wage data remained disappointing, but the recent memo by the Board staff confirms that wage data are informative about slack.  Interestingly, the state-space model used to examine this issue yields an estimate of the current natural conditional 2 percent.

Now, I readily admit that all estimates of slack are confidence intervals are sufficiently effectively back to full employment, on this metric. the current unemployment gap at more than ½ percentage point, and because involuntary parttime employment remains elevated while staff's estimated trend, I have fulfilled our employment mandate.  Furthermore, allowing the unemployment rate to move lower for a time may be necessary for us to achieve our inflation mandate within period of time.

In addition, the on inflation and optimized policy rules-a how low inflation is at present, as strengthening the case for The staff memo r * uncertainty supports this The memo demonstrates that when estimates of r * are uncertain, optimal markedly attenuates the response of the funds rate to signs that the natural rate is rising, as long as the risk is high that adverse shocks could cause the zero lower bound to bind in the near future.

And its assessment of recent inflation of yesterday's close, 5-to-10-year inflation compensation As indicated in the bullets in the alternative been expanding at a moderate rate, supported recently by 'solid' gains and business spending and further improvement in the housing sector.  The Committee's overall assessment of labor indicators in paragraph 1 would continue be that, despite some softer data recently, 'on balance, . . . underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early trends would be largely unchanged, although you will need to decide how to adjust the description of the change in measures of inflation compensation over the intermeeting period.  As from TIPS had declined 10 basis points since the September meeting.

With regard the outlook, paragraph 2 drops the separate sentence on foreign the risks to the outlook as 'nearly balanced,' it is that the Committee is now less concerned about the implications of than was the case in September. In summarizing the outlook, paragraph 2 would convey that expects economic activity to expand at a moderate pace.

These changes would signal developments abroad increasing the target range for the federal funds alternative B would convey that the Committee still needs to see 'some further market' and is not yet reasonably confident that 'inflation medium term.'  However, in timing of the target range for the federal funds rate.  Rather than focusing on the current target range, the Committee would suggest that will be raise the target range later this year'-or, alternatively, 'at its next 'based on incoming data,' assess realized and likely suggest to some On the Committee's criteria for rate, improvement in the labor will move back to its 2 percent objective over the paragraph 3, the Committee would update its communications about the first increase in the 'how long to maintain' such a decision may be close by indicating that 'in determining whether it appropriate to meeting'-the Committee will, expected progress toward its objectives.  Although this guidance would leave the Committee wide latitude at the December meeting, it would market participants a higher likelihood of a December liftoff than they perceived in advance of this meeting.

Alternative A would provide a less sanguine the leveling out of the unemployment they have tilted the risks to the outlook for A would also the outlook for inflation by citing 'subdued' rates In contrast, alternative date of the first increase in the target their expectations reading of recent data on economic activity, citing the 'drag' from inventory investment and net exports, and it would note rate.

Alternative convey much greater concern about

Accordingly, alternative A would set aside that 'if incoming information does not soon indicate move back toward 2 percent, the Committee is prepared to use all tools necessary to return inflation to 2 percent within one to two years.'

want to ask a question about much to make of the dots that you show because MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Thomas, I exhibit 1.  It's always hard to know exactly how we don't really identify who the dots are.  I do think we have a missed opportunity, in that we

It would be so much more the good explanations that I read in the SEP with everybody's the second row, is it the case that the of people's funds rate dots is largely preserved?  Is there something about your don't share effective if I could associate commentary.  But, having said that, on these calculations in relative ordering IS calculation that scrambles the identities around very much?

There can be instances, actually, in which they are being scrambled, somebody who still has a relatively low unemployment rate but sees a and, consequently, must see a whole lot of approach to backing out the estimates. MR. LAUBACH. because it really depends very much on your projected path for the unemployment gap.  You can have someone who has, say, a relatively high federal funds rate but who has a very shallow unemployment rate path.  Therefore, actually, that person sees very little accommodation, whereas you could have sharp decline in the unemployment rate accommodation.  That's basically the

Is there a lot of that action, then?  In principle, I can see that. MR. EVANS.

high the median and departures of funds the median.  I think that's what you would like to know.  I'll get back to you on that. MR. LAUBACH.  I'd really have to go dot by dot to give you a good answer of how the correlation is between departures of r * estimates from rates from

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.

Yes, I have a comment on exhibit 1.  This is interpreting people for the real rate of interest. MR. BULLARD. through the lens of this particular model.  People could have other materially different models that have very different implications

Absolutely. MR. LAUBACH.

interesting to look at this, but it's not clear that everyone is MR. BULLARD.  I think it's using exactly this model.

fairly confident that this is not the model that everyone used. may say, it is, of course, based on an estimated historical relationship. MR. LAUBACH.  I'm [Laughter]  If I

There are other models that would have different implications that are historical relationships.  So there are a lot of assumptions about how MR. BULLARD. also based on estimated you're going to interpret the data.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Kocherlakota.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'm going to turn to exhibit 2 and on alternative B.  The last bullet says that alternative B leaves the Committee 'wide the December meeting.  When we discussed the changes in language in alternative B, paragraph 3, at the Minneapolis Reserve Bank, we were concerned that those not leave the Committee with a lot of latitude at the December meeting.  Let me the very first FOMC statement of all that considerable latitude would be left by that language at the December choosing with intention to bring up a specific the next meeting at this time.  Our concern was that it would be read by market as signaling a relatively strong intention on the Committee's part to initiate liftoff in Clearly, the staff here had a different perspective on this.  I'd be interested in hearing MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. the panel latitude' at particularly changes did explain our thinking on that.  If the Committee were writing time, it would be true meeting.  That is not the case.  The Committee is reference to participants December. your thoughts.

share my perspective.  A literal reading of this red in my view, desirably agnostic because, effectively, all it states is that the this question at the December meeting.  That, of course, There is nothing here that says anything about the likely about how, at that meeting, the question will be on the table. MR. LAUBACH.  I'll be glad to language is, Committee is going to wrestle with should come as a surprise to no one. timing of the liftoff itself.  It is only

October 27-28, 2015

the literal reading is one thing and what it's taken to signal is a very Now, I understand that different one.

your literal reading, but it's really choice to make the change to this particular wording at this time, signaling an MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes, I think I would grant about the intention.

One question is whether the public will look at this and say, 'Well, lot more pointedly, but they chose to say something fairly hands-off.' least admits the interpretation that the FOMC is not yet very certain that it will want to will be interpreted by market participants, for MR. LAUBACH. they could have said it a So it at lift off at the December meeting.'  But how this example, is very difficult for me to predict.

large changes to paragraph 3.  So they know that we know suggests that there is some signal in that if people MR. POTTER.  I would add one thing.  I think the market or the public, however you want to say it, knows that we know that they're not expecting the fact that understand it.

DUDLEY. Well, the changes are clearly designed to put December to some degree, and the question is, how much signal does the market want to take VICE CHAIRMAN on the table from that?

MR. POTTER.  Yes, that was President Kocherlakota's point, I believe.

There is some uncertainty about how the market will VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. actually take this.

October 27-28, 2015

Committee in adding at this time?  How people will interpret our intent is one of the who are betting with their money in the markets, what is the intent of the this additional language questions.

DUDLEY.  I think the expectation is that it would push the agnostic in its true language, the probability today-roughly 30 percent for VICE CHAIRMAN probability expectation up somewhat, but because it is expectation is not that much.  Simon, what is the

December?

MR. POTTER.  Somewhere between 30 and 40.

It's 30 to 40 percent.  So maybe it takes it to 40 to 50. a literal interpretation, or does the market say, 'Oh, gee, you changed this, and therefore signal.'  I think there's a range of uncertainty about that. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. But we don't really know, and that's the hard part of the parsing we do.  Does the market look at it with you're trying to provide a

What might also be helpful is the insertion of 'based on incoming that this can be read as be received between now and your December MR. LAUBACH. data.'  Again, this should come as news to nobody, but my sense is saying that it really depends on the data that will meeting.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair, it's worth mentioning, I think, that you have some further in the next few days. MR. LOCKHART.  Madam opportunities to elaborate

Next week, I will be testifying on supervision before the House during the hearing I might be asked questions comes out-I'm going to give a speech on the outlook and monetary policy, CHAIR YELLEN. Financial Services Committee, but, of course, about monetary policy.  Then, in early December-a couple of days before the November employment report

October 27-28, 2015

and, arguably, one in the very near term, at least next week, if there misinterpretation of what's happening. and the next day, I'm testifying on the economy and monetary policy before the JEC.  So I will have some opportunities seems to be some reacts that this is probable as opposed to makes clear that what this language 'probable.' VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think the intent here is to make people view this as possible, not probable.  If, for some reason, the market possible, we're going to have to communicate in a way that is meant to mean is 'possible,' not

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Brainard.

On the same point, I also reacted to the 'wide latitude' as perhaps a out of context with what I've been reading in the market newsletters, which have been this language.  If we say 'whether it will be appropriate to raise the . . . , the Committee will, based on . . . ,' I think that will be seen as a lean and as or 'at its next meeting,' that closes a bit and leans even further.  So it's a question at this juncture as to whether that next meeting' and 'later this year' really does not just I understand is the intent here-but also locks us into we then will need to try to figure out how to exit, if the world doesn't turn out the MS. BRAINARD. little looking very carefully at target range providing wide latitude.  When we also add 'later this year' the latitude additional precision regarding 'at its boost the probabilities-something that something that way we expected.

From my perspective, the hardest piece is to anticipate how the incoming data say about the likelihood of liftoff.  That is, suppose be read?  What inference will market this good enough, or is it not good enough?'  All this language can do is MR. LAUBACH. markets will interpret what the we get middling employment reports.  The world is easy if you get very strong or very weak ones.  If you get middling reports, how will they participants draw:  'Is

the fact that your mind is not made up one way or the other.  In that regard, the 'based is helpful. to point to on incoming data'

YELLEN.  President Williams.

CHAIR

yesterday, and that's about this issue of 'based on incoming data.'  I with the sentence.  It is a compromise.  It's an uncomfortable compromise for of some of the concerns that were just raised.  But this Tarullo made dependence.  I absolutely love the phrase 'assess realized and expected-toward its objectives,' because it is a medium-term about our objectives.  When you say 'based on incoming data,' we have to that we are falling, in my view, into the trap that Governor Tarullo talked about, in which one employment report and the next employment report, each and every one of us to focus on whichever data release it is.  The reality is, we and every speech I've done, 'I'm not employment report, these trade data, or whatever piece of news MR. WILLIAMS.  I'm going to pick up on a point, which I completely agree with, that Governor Tarullo made have no problem me but perhaps on the opposite side 'based on incoming data' does, I think, feed right into the point Governor yesterday.  I'm a big believer in data progress-both outlook and it is accept everybody is going to be looking at looking for have to say, as I've had to do in every interview I've done going to say anything about this comes out that morning.  I'm going to talk about the medium-term outlook in terms of our progress-both realized and expected-toward our goals.'

we are just specific short-term noisy data.  I'm not saying that we will year or two? is telling people to do is to look at the couple of data points that are coming I do think that when you put in a phrase that says 'based on incoming data,' priming everybody to react to these do that.  I hope we will look at it through the lens of, what does it mean for the next But what this phrase

October 27-28, 2015

that's just the cost of this. up.  Again, it's a compromise.  It's an attempt, as I think Thomas nicely explained, to have your cake and eat it, too.  But

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Rosengren.

I have two quick observations.  I do think, like Governor Brainard, if we say 'at its next meeting,' that indicates 'probable,' not 'possible.'  If we actually want something like 'soon' would be a fuzzed-up word.  I think we have to distinguish to say 'at its say 'soon.'  Everybody can have a different view of the English connected 'at its next meeting,' it focuses the get lost.  That's just my own view of the English.  After the a sense of where the Committee is on that. MR. ROSENGREN. that 'possible,' between what we would prefer and what we think we're signaling.  I would prefer next meeting,' because I'd rather make it probable.  But if the goal is to make it possible, I would probably just with this, but I do think that, when you add a specificity of attention and the rest of the caveats go-round, we can get on alternative C.  Assuming that the economic conditions come in meeting, I'm wondering the language in alternative C gives enough information about the rate path.  If part of the to be very gradual-I'm not sure the current version of C conveys the extent that I might want.  So, as you're thinking about the next meeting, if it does maybe rethinking that paragraph a little bit to more strongly the path. The question I had was such that we actually are planning on taking action at the December whether goal would be, in effect, a dovish first tightening-which is to say, we are tightening, but the path we're taking is expected that to seem to be appropriate, I'd suggest indicate

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

October 27-28, 2015

Right now, I'm not sure I could deduce what the path or the likely the intent-to signal the path-then we might want to craft MR. ROSENGREN. path is from the language.  If that's some language that does that.

Are there any further questions?  Okay.  Let's begin the go-round. CHAIR YELLEN. President Kocherlakota.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  Our first job as a central bank is to is a common belief among citizens in this country that inflation percent over the longer run.  I see plenty of evidence to suggest that we're failing in inflation has been below target for most of the is expected to remain low for years to come.  Wage and compensation contacts, are expected to MR. KOCHERLAKOTA. maintain the nominal anchor.  It will be at 2 this task.  Inflation has been low for years.  Core past seven years and growth both remain subdued and, based on information from our labor remain so.  Global disinflationary trends are strong and expected to remain so.

breakevens are sending a clear message.  Investors believe that there's a the Federal Reserve will be unwilling to do what is necessary to hit either of longer run.  To reiterate a point that I made yesterday and have made in these meetings, the low risk premiums that have been deduced out of the low low inflation is going to take place at the same time as That's what that shrinkage in breakevens is In my view, financial market data actually provide the most compelling evidence on this point.  The low inflation significant risk that its mandates over the earlier breakevens are signaling that people think low economic activity.  So they view nominal Treasury securities as being a better protection with regard to those low-economic-activity states. signaling.

investors believe that we're going to have low What does that mean?  It means that economic activity for very long periods of time, taking place at the same time as low inflation.

October 27-28, 2015

about?  We have control over inflation, especially over long periods of time.  That's investors do not believe we're going to do what is necessary to deliver on our we're able to do or because we're going to choose not to do it. What is that a signal that inflation goals at the time when there is low economic activity, either because we're going to face constraints in what nominal anchor has slipped resting place?  Thankfully, I would say, 'Not yet.'  But the evidence from history is clear on this point.  If we wait for certainty on this mooring, either up or down, we will have waited to respond aggressively now to the risk of credibility loss to shocks, especially in world we contemplated yesterday, in which  * is persistently low. Now, Madam Chair, is available evidence definitive that our from its 2 percent around the world and from our own point that inflation expectations have left their too long.  The Committee needs avoid facing the certainty of credibility loss.  Such a loss of credibility would significantly constrain our ability to support the economy in the face of future adverse the kind of r

the risk to our credibility, I would recommend that the FOMC initiate a new the feasibility of negative rates.  The Vice Chairman asked for suggestions on what kinds of interventions we might intention to never halt reinvestments, by itself, actually has a intention to explore the feasibility of negative much as negative 50 basis points or negative 75 basis points-starts, by world in which I think investors are concerned FOMC will not be able to deliver.  So I think there's a lot of scope in terms of what one In view of round of asset purchases and publicly announce its intention to explore interest contemplate if needed.  I think such interventions are needed at this time, so I'm suggesting some.  I'm obviously not wedded to these particular ones.  There are a number of ways one could proceed.  Simply announcing the lot of accommodative power.  Announcing your interest rates-say, by as itself, to provide accommodation in states of the that the might do.

October 27-28, 2015

an intention to explore the feasibility of negative interest rates, would come It is that market participants put significant weight on outcomes in which the are necessary to achieve its objectives over long periods of for this Committee to prove market participants wrong on this point. The announcements I'm suggesting for this meeting, which would be a new round of asset purchases and as a large surprise to market participants.  We need to engender exactly such a surprise. clear from the data FOMC will not take the actions that time.  It's time someone who did a lot of this activity, I think this kind of to know the thinking of its these key policy questions.  As well, for those of us who are presidents, I believe, a shortage of Committee communication that and is likely to do in to the evolution of economic conditions. Madam Chair, this is my last FOMC intervention.  So if you'll indulge me, I'd like to offer a final thought on communications for your consideration.  Many of us around the table spend a considerable amount of time communicating with the public about our individual views on monetary policy.  As communication is entirely appropriate.  The public has a right representatives about this kind of communication helps provide a key link between the decisionmaking in this room and the far-flung residents of our various Districts.  However, this kind of communication does have its limitations.  Most, if not all, of this communication offers the perspectives of individual participants about policy.  There is, would provide the public with a sense of what the Committee has done response

I note that in 2005, Chairman Greenspan gave 35 sets of remarks, testimonies, and speeches. media technology and media focus suggests to me that the appropriate level of The Chair is uniquely positioned to communicate to the public on behalf Committee.  I believe that the public would have a better understanding of the likely evolution and direction of Committee decisions if it got to according to FRASER, The evolution of

I think, too, that the evolution of The talking about in terms of miscommunications of to fill that need, potentially on relatively short engagement is at the media means that this engagement needs to be more proactive than has been traditional. communication needs develop, as we were just the Committee's intentions.

We can now conclude that the global economy is not at serious crisis; surprises; developments is growth, the strengthening of the labor markets, and a gradual return to our 2 percent inflation target.

staff has done an excellent job in producing the Tealbooks.  I believe the things are not going well economically, as well as more generally, in the expected slowing of economic growth.  One of the many interesting features of staff growth As usual, the general feeling that United States-which we sometimes hear around this table and elsewhere-is based in part on the

October 27-28, 2015

effect of declines in participation on the aggregate growth rate.  That is seen in the table 'Decomposition of Potential GDP,' on page 26 of Tealbook A, in which to decline 0.5 percentage point a year through also interesting that the contribution of the growth of multifactor productivity to this year to 0.7 contribution of capital deepening to growth is expected to be say, more than double the rate of total factor messages from this.  First, economic growth than of the FOMC, something we all know but may, from time to effect of investment is potentially more powerful than I, at least, had entitled to broadcast to a wider public. forecasts is the powerful clearly the contribution from participation is forecast 2018.  It's overall growth is expected to rise only slowly from 0.3 percentage point percentage point in 2018, while the constant at 0.8 percentage point-that is to productivity growth  from 2015 through 2017-and then to decline to 0.7 percentage point, the same as the contribution of TFP growth.  I take two is more in the hands of others time, forget.  Second, the thought.  These are messages we're to add to my previous comments, which were essentially that and non-energy and food import price declines pass, range.  Further, if the staff forecasts for the unemployment rate are believe we're likely to of the way to 2 percent.  And we should also remind ourselves that not all shocks to negative.  They used to all be positive, and we will again see positive inflation just don't know when. On inflation, I have little once the transitory effects of energy price we will be close to our target correct-namely, a decline by 2017 to 4.7 percent unemployment-I move all inflation are shocks.  We

the risks to the forecast, but I'll leave them aside for now return to them during the general discussion of where we're going. I think we should also consider and perhaps expectations to the point at which the public and market I'd like to conclude with a few words on our communications coming out of this meeting. I believe we should aim to influence

October 27-28, 2015

expect us to move in December if our conditions are met, which could be translated rate to rise to 50 percent or above after this meeting.  But-and now I'm talking not about will decide not to move in December.  And here, in the think he must feel like Moses looking at the Promised participants into wanting expectations-and now I'm talking about probability-of an increase in the federal funds communications to the public, but about what we need to do-we need also to begin preparing ourselves for the possibility that we presence of President Kocherlakota, I Land with what I'm going to say.

than what we implied after the June and continue along the same path, waiting for the economy to we will not any time soon find conditions that the economy is too weak to raise the interest rate sends a message.  If we don't move in December, we may need to say both to ourselves and to the economy is on, and that we think we need to economic growth to be confident that inflation will return to our goal.  In short, we involve at least some regarding the path of the Vice Chairman Dudley has mentioned several times; and, third, reducing IOER rate and possibly the target range for the federal funds rate, though I doubt the wisdom moving to a negative interest rate.  No doubt there are other measures to consider.  But part of MR. FISCHER.  If we say nothing other September meetings-that we will strengthen-we may give the impression that would persuade us to move.  The message that three times-in June, September, and December-we've decided that disturbing the public that we simply don't like the path that see stronger should consider moving to an expansionary monetary policy, one that will of the measures that might be expansionary:  first, forward guidance federal funds rate, provided that guidance is real or else carefully and expertly qualified; second, extending the maturity of our portfolio by lengthening the maturity of the Treasury obligations we hold, a move that the of

Importantly, downside risks have also abated to the global economy have ebbed. MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Even at the growth we saw in the most recent forecast.  Other economic indicators, such as consumption and investment, are projections from our substantially as concerns about risks to transitory appreciation and drops in commodity prices, and those should dissipate waning of downward pressure from these factors, economy and my assessment that we'll reach our inflation target and starting to rates soon.  Indeed, most standard policy rules suggested raising rates some time ago. Of course, inflation measures do remain low.  This is partly attributable factors, including dollar over the course of this year and next year.  The along with the continued improvement in the labor market, give me confidence inflation will move back to our 2 percent target over the medium term.

ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

I do view the current language as signaling 'probable' views.

With inflation persistently lower than our Like President Williams, I strongly prefer a gradual increase in removing accommodation.  Waiting longer risks the need to remove accommodation more quickly, and, given the uncertainty discussed yesterday about the equilibrium real interest rate, a more rapid increase might run a greater risk of overshooting the equilibrium rate.  In tightening cycle that is closer slower than the median SEP numbers 2 percent target, we have the luxury of removing accommodation more slowly than in previous tightening cycles.

At our September increase in our past assessment of move back toward 2 percent once the most recent disinflationary impulse is past.  Since then, as discussed in our for seem less likely.  So I continue although I suspect we will not adopt language emphasizing December as a meeting, and it would be helpful to push back on that.  I had an experience President Williams during the intermeeting period, hearing from many to date on the federal funds futures markets, but wondering about our criteria, with many of them taking a negative If alternative B is adopted, I think the additional live option would be useful.  Market expectations regarding liftoff appear to have overreacted since the September very similar to that of commentators.  Maybe these people weren't up they seemed to view us as highly likely to change going into September and came away from our decision a bit confused while

I'll go back and read the transcript when it comes out.  But if December a big hit to our credibility to go into that meeting with this language coming out of this In that case, if that's our intention-to set a fairly signal for only if December is a serious possibility.  Listening to your comments at the end of the day yesterday, Madam how it struck doesn't have a substantial chance or it isn't probable, in the words of President Rosengren, we're risking meeting and not move in some circumstances. high bar-we'd probably be better off leaving this language out of the statement.  Thank you.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

Chair.  I support alternative B at this meeting.  I of the changes in paragraph 3 that include the bracketed language making reference think signaling that December is in important at this meeting.  It's entirely plausible that we'll get to is at least as strong as in the past quarter, GDP growth in the 2½-ish range, and with an inflation trend pretty much as it If these conditions appear to be in place at the time of the December meeting, I to pull the trigger. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Madam am in favor to the December meeting.  Like others I've already heard, I play for liftoff is particularly the December meeting with employment growth that with real-time looks today. believe it will be appropriate centered on a by the time of the December meeting.  To me, roughly even to support a truly data-dependent decisionmaking the next meeting.  Market participants are clearly placing current odds of 50-50.  Coming into this meeting, my view was that we should Based on my view of the appropriate policy course if economic conditions evolve as I expect, I think an appropriate communication would have public expectations roughly 50-50 probability of liftoff odds after this meeting is what we need to see process as we approach a December move well below

October 27-28, 2015

as a live most likely with a statement that makes explicit December as a decision point using the language 'at its next meeting.'  My guess is proposed paragraph 3 language without this reference will not send a strong enough to move market expectations from where they are today. craft a statement that would communicate a posture of preserving liftoff in December option but not a certainty.  It's my judgment that my preferred outcome, this roughly 50-50 perceived chance of a December liftoff, is reference to that the signal

Committee go in a different direction and decide on a version of paragraph 3 to our next meeting, there is a word change that I think is important. the December meeting, the phrase 'In determining whether it target range' is a construction that may be construed as implying raise the Should the without any reference Without the bracketed reference to will be appropriate to raise the an indefinite delay of liftoff.  In the event that the bracketed language of paragraph 3 is omitted, I suggest the statement be adjusted to read 'In determining when it will be appropriate to target range.'

alternative B, I think the 'slightly' modifier in paragraph 1, market-based inflation compensation, is accurate.  Thank you, Madam As to the specific options in describing the decline in Chair.

to the language issues that have been raised.  I want to say a couple of things first, on this issue of whether we now have to move because people have move and there was some expectation that we were going to move.  I second-best is not to go ahead and do is ill advised because you suggested to people beforehand that you might do it. best is to treat your earlier suggestion as essentially some variation on a sunk cost MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B, and, in a moment, I'll refer though, and they center suggested we're going to think the optimal approach to policymaking is, before you say something, to be pretty sure that what you say is what you're going to do.  But the something that The second and then go ahead and do what makes sense.

October 27-28, 2015

first point I'd make is that this, to some degree, is a self-inflicted wound.  I agree who have said that there's a lot of confusion out there, and that there was an a lot of discussion centering on September.  How could the markets and This notion that, 'Gee, the markets have focused on September-we'd better do it,' linked to the way in which our public statements have been date and calendar sense of when it's appropriate to move.  There is a lot to President Williams and others have said about there being some sense of, do we know think we've created that problem, and we've off dates dates, and then we immediately went back to The with people expectation as well as the commentators not be focused on September when so many of us were out talking about September? is somehow centered rather than talking about the narratives, as I put it yesterday, or the outlook, as many of you refer to it, that would guide our what something that the markets don't know?  But I created it by talking about dates.  For so long, President Bullard was trying to get us and onto state contingency.  We finally got off of talking about them, which I just don't think has been helpful.

second point is, I'm still having some trouble with 'act sooner so that you don't have When I say I'm having some trouble, I don't mean I reject it, but I difficulty understanding it for two reasons.  One reason is-I assume we all effect of an increase of 25 basis points in the target range will be The increase is reversing a lot of positions.  It's reversing a psychology.  It's going a big effect.  I keep getting told by CEOs to expect a lot of turbulence when it happens. not a reason not to do it.  I agree with Jeremy Stein's notion that we cannot be market reaction is going to be.  We sometimes just have to fly through But I do think there's going to be an effect, and there's going to be a tightening of financial The to make a big move later.' am having some agree with this-the substantially greater than what the models say an increase of 25 basis points in the federal funds rate will be. to have Now, that is driven by what the bond that.

October 27-28, 2015

well beyond what 25 basis points would normally suggest, particularly when, as discussion pointed out, 25 basis points is probably a good bit of the way toward what It's not as though we think, 'We've got a long conditions yesterday's almost everybody would agree a neutral rate is. way to go, so this is just a little bit.'

turn to the language itself.  I don't have a view on paragraph 1, Madam is fine with me. Now let me Chair.  Whatever you want to do on that paragraph 3, I would have preferred no change to the language at all-that is, keeping that the formulation of shifting toward saying the question we're asking to raise rates, as language change think this was a much better way to do it than the formulation that was in the original B that was circulated.  However, on the inclusion of 'later this year' or 'at its next my policy position, I'm likely to be biased against making it probable as Rosengren is right.  It will make it seem probable, and By the way, if there's a sentiment favoring removal of reference to 'later this year' or 'at its next meeting,' I think President Lockhart's suggestion would be fine. On what we said in September-but it's obvious that that's not where the center of the Committee is.  So I actually thought is whether-or, in President Lockhart's formulation, when-it's appropriate opposed to talking about how long to maintain the existing target range, is, as I said, a clever way to signal that the question of an increase is now on the table.  I believe that cannot help but be noticed by people and will have the desirable signaling effect.  Although, again, my preference would be no change in language, understanding where the Committee as a whole is, I alternative meeting,' coming from opposed to possible.  I think President that's not where I want to be.  I'm not sure that's where the Committee is prepared to be right now as to wanting to keep it on the table. the to say 'when' rather than 'whether'

October 27-28, 2015

the reasons John has already articulated-which will keep my intervention 'based on incoming data' is helpful because, to the degree that we want the data, they already know that, and John said well why.  It emphasis on a couple of pieces of data.  That's it, Madam Chair.  Thank you. Finally, for shorter-I don't think people to think that we're looking at may give an undue

YELLEN.  Did you have a view, Governor Tarullo, on 'later this year' versus meeting'? CHAIR 'at its next my impassioned plea to omit them is ignored by MR. TARULLO.  Oh, do you mean if everybody else?

those circumstances-'Once we've decided we're sending to live in?'  [Laughter]  I think probably 'later 'later this year' in December, one way or another.  If we drop it but like 'at its next meeting' and the world will think, 'Oh, they just it's the same formulation.'  If we decide-as President Lacker was Governor Fischer, in some respects, was suggesting-that you have to reorient moving, it gives us the opportunity to do that as well. MR. TARULLO.  Yes, under you to Elba, what kind of house would you like this year,' and the reason for that is, I believe it maintains a little more optionality for us, because we have to drop the formulation, we can substitute couldn't say it, but suggesting and as if we're not

Given our economic forecast, my position on policy that event.  I think the language in alternative B be interpreted as the Committee signaling that a December Currently, markets

My fear is that we are losing credibility for liftoff, and alternative B will, I hope, least to some extent. harder to get market participants to change their beliefs, at we will see steady and modest economic growth.  With that in mind, and it is currently around zero and perhaps a tad implies so if we do to believe that the process of gradual, and that starting sooner makes that scenario more likely.  Thus, that monetary policy will be characterized by some degree of accommodation over The continued, consistent underlying economic strength, in spite of recent headwinds, leads me to believe that as I stated yesterday, my assessment of r * is that positive, which is pretty much in line with much of the evidence presented in the memos. Subsequently, I anticipate that r * will gradually increase to around 1.75 percent.  That that our current policy stance is overly accommodative and will become increasingly not begin raising the funds rate.  However, I also continue normalization should be I anticipate the near term, but that the current degree of accommodation is excessive.

effect it will have, I think raising rates this year will send a message and bolster confidence.  It will strongly reflect the view that we have indeed the fundamentals are sound, and that we are approaching a degree of increasingly appears to me that the most B.  In support of President Lockhart's view, I would prefer 'at its next meeting,' but I Tarullo's view Although I can't quantify the reassuring come a long way, that normalcy that has been absent for eight years.  Indeed, it abnormal aspect of the economy is the current stance of monetary policy.  Thus, I support alternative could live with either.

So I could lose 'based on incoming data.'  That's what I would do there.

that if the economy continues on the current path, with job growth continue to materially reduce labor market slack, I would support liftoff at the meeting, and I would present such a decision in a context of a very broad agreement membership of the Committee that the path of rate increases will be a gradual one. trouble me, although, Implicit in that is sufficient to December among the For me, the tightening cycle can be very slow.  The market path does not of course, the data will dictate that.

Why not wait another three months or six or two years?  And I would offer two considerations.  First, I believe a well-telegraphed move of 25 basis points, presented in a context of a very broad sustained material effect on The question is, why move at all in December? months-or even a year that the test that we've articulated will be met if we get one more cycle of solid data.

I think there will be to appearing to change our minds, and we would simply need to weigh the benefits against guess I would really like to move past this essentially tactical decision about the of liftoff and shift the focus toward the very broad agreement about the gradual path. would be a mistake.  The reason is, we've carefully guided the public Many on the Committee, including me and many others, have expectation.  The September SEP has 13 of the 17 of us supporting liftoff this year.  In the September SEP, we had percent and unemployment at 5 percent.  Those a cost that cost.  I precise date here I echo what others have said-I suspect that a decision not public as, just another step in a change in the communications this year.  One implication would be a significant further period at the effective lower bound.  Any restatement setting the bar at a level that may not be met for a year or more. and economic imbalances over time if, in fact, we're going to remain at the zero lower With that backdrop-and to move in December will not be, and will not be seen by the data-driven, meeting-by-meeting evaluation of policy but rather a fundamental Committee's framework as it's been expressed in would be a sense that we are seriously troubled by the path of the economy.  An additional implication of our objective function risks In addition to the costs of appearing to change our mind, I am concerned with the buildup of financial bound for an extended period.

I would simply say that I thought that I really do believe it's for the period ahead we see economic growth above its trend rate.  Otherwise, I'm The question is how high to set meeting-particularly would not be setting it excessively high.  I'll end with the essential that

liftoff have been met.  Such a move is MS. MESTER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  There's been little change in my medium-run outlook, and I continue to believe there's a good case for moving policy off the zero lower bound.  In my view, the criteria we've set out for consistent with the Tealbook's optimal control simulations, which balance the macroeconomic risks of lifting off too early versus too late, and with various versions of monetary policy rules.

Our next decision point is is going to be looking at today's statement as providing information we need to see between now and December in order to lift off.  Have we gotten the criteria for liftoff or not?

However, others may see things Liftoff remains an unlikely outcome December.

That can say the same about our own I admit the communications in this environment are very challenging, but we should always be taking steps to outlook in our September FOMC statement than was intended.  The guessing game coming into that meeting reminded tag line actually won an advertising award.  I'm not sure we communications.  [Laughter]

October 27-28, 2015

in alternative B is that the characterization of labor more negative message than we intend and set up the wrong first paragraph drops language stating whether we've seen labor market slowdown in payroll growth and no change in continue to grow above trend.  Payroll growth of 140,000 per this stage to be expected.  It's a feature of many Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland staff Indeed, I interpreted the adjustment we made in the liftoff criteria in July, changing improvement' to 'some further improvement,' as a recognition that we expected the decline since September meeting.  By omitting these relevant facts, the tone is negative, and the public meeting the labor market condition for liftoff. My main concern with the language market developments will convey a expectations.  The improvement since September and then cites the the unemployment rate.  Payrolls month, if sustained, should put downward pressure on the unemployment rate, and, in of the business cycle, slowing in the pace of job gains is economic forecasts, including the Tealbook and the model.

In addition, other measures of unemployment continued to our may infer we have moved further from feeding expectations that monthly job gains close to 200,000 are needed for further improvement in the labor market.  If that's true, we to add another liftoff criterion by suggesting that of employment, and not just the first derivative, matters.  If it's not true, me offer a suggestion-I know I'm 'While the is consistent with some further improvement in the of underemployment I think this characterization is consistent with the facts and conveys the proper I fear we're us to conclude there's been some should say so.

The unemployment rate held steady, while other measures declined.' sentiment.

I So I think we do need to change expectations in order to keep December alive. language does offer us flexibility if the data disappoint and our outlook Regarding the other paragraph 3, and I favor abundance of caution, we do take market expectations into account in our understand that. I believe that the changes.

In paragraph 1, I have a small change in market-based measures of inflation over this intermeeting period than it I also support the suggested change preference for saying 'slightly' to characterize the compensation to acknowledge that the decline was smaller was last time-10 basis points versus 20 basis points.

If it stabilizes, that would be great, but we're not in this next series of releases.  We will, though, be to see that that sector is still healthy and strong and continues to be solid. Number three, we'll be looking at services.  We expect manufacturing to be weak.  We're expecting that in advance for reasons, including global overcapacities is that it doesn't get weaker than expecting very good manufacturing numbers looking hard at services on consumer spending and so on. Lastly, we'll be looking at the various data series

in December, then, with President Rosengren that we of the federal funds rate is going to be very shallow. If the data come in along the lines I've just described, I'd be inclined to say we should, in fact, raise the federal funds rate.  I agree should emphasize, though, in that statement that we will remain highly accommodative and make clear that the path think it will be very important for all of us in our public comments to emphasize than the things we disagree on.  To my ear, listening around this a very strong agreement that we should remain highly accommodative for time.  I know there's disagreement on some of the tactics and the first it would be good publicly to emphasize where there is a consensus around this table to emphasize the differences. I also the things we agree on rather table, I think we have some extended period of step, but rather than

It was with the optionality, and the world has obviously been very of the unknown and magnified the perceived importance of this initial decision, likely economic significance.  I get a number of comments also meant 25 basis points.  Does it mean something more guess you see something that we don't see in the economy.  What am I missing?'  I This thinking has caused businesspeople to doubt what and to maybe even shorten their time horizons. I do agree with the comments that the process-we're talking about pulling back-has probably gotten to the point probably necessary to provide us complicated.  However, I believe the process of stepping up and then pulling back has created a greater fear maybe out of proportion to its from people saying, 'Gee, I thought liftoff than that?  I see these comments as fairly widespread. they're seeing in their own businesses and, in some cases, to pause or pull back somewhat from confidently making decisions we look again at the paradigm avoid is this thought:  'We're about action right around the corner-just wait.  But it's data dependent.'  I'd like to see us get cycle depending on what we decide in December.  Thank you. I do agree with the comments that were made today that, if we decide in December are not going to raise the funds rate, it's going to be very critical to for our communication.

Again, others have a desire to get off of zero, but how high is really up in the air, and it's not In meeting with our CDIAC group a few weeks ago, I anticipated that they, being bankers way-yes, they would like liftoff-and then I wanted to talk about the path and how steep it should be.

Now, let me say again why communicating a shallow policy rate path is appropriate. First, the r * memos keeping rates low in order to help avoid bad outcomes on interest rates.  For me, this is a powerful argument, because it risks we face. the other side of the ledger.  If you are worried about high inflation, even if events changed quickly and underlying inflation was headed to 3 percent policy tools reason why I support an aggressive commitment to a symmetric that we are likely in a regime in which even during normal of capacity to lower the funds rate to deal with recessionary inflation.

I also support President Lockhart's suggestion if we were not going to include

I think our toward goals, and that argues that now is a good alternative C today, but, because the for C is not in place, I'd go with alternative B for today. I agree with meeting.  We cited global financial turmoil in September, which has settled down or reversed.  I agree with arguments are based on cumulative progress time to begin normalization.  So you could make a case for preparation my comments from yesterday, and, perhaps hazardously, said this morning.  We made a case of the idea that the Committee intended to normalize.  The case for that the policy rate would return to historically normal levels, and that the sheet would return to levels more consistent with historical values, once the economy I want to follow up on some of I'm going to comment a little bit on what other people have for normalization beginning in 2011 and later revised that plan.  We've had four years communication of normalization suggests balance returned to normal.

So, again, net of the oil Arguably, this is about as good as the its goals, yet the Committee has not moved to try to the balance sheet or the policy rate, even though both dimensions of our goals Today the national unemployment rate well below the median unemployment rate 5.8 percent.

My point is that the probabilities are fairly high at this juncture All of us-the Committee and the staff-have in our heads that But I'm not sure I really see that happening, given the way things are evolving and how proving to be to move off the zero lower bound. with liftoff, as Governor Powell and likely to be return to the zero lower that we will simply keep ZIRP-or, if not ZIRP, near-ZIRP-in place.  I do not think that this is the intention of the Committee. we're going to return to the equilibrium of the 1980s and 1990s, which we know and love, and that we're going to move the funds rate around according to typical policy prescriptions from that era. difficult it's think the Committee should at least begin to prepare some for the possibility that we a ZIRP or a near-ZIRP in place for some time.  In particular, if this is the way this of that and say, 'Well, the sheet is not going to return to normal very soon-maybe not at all-and the policy rate Or, 'our concepts of 'normal' have changed so that it's completely warped to think about the 1980s or 1990s equilibrium as being least think about this. I have either proceeds, we would have to de-emphasize our rhetoric about normalization and our rhetoric about exit strategy, and I don't think this would be easy for the Committee to do, because we spent four years talking about it.  But then we just de-emphasize all balance is also not going to return to normal very soon.' dramatically relevant in today's policy environment.'  We should at

So it seems very unlikely that a further commitment Now, a lot of people around the table still period of ZIRP, we'll produce what the New Keynesian consumption boom today and higher expected inflation today.  After six or seven years of this, you have to start to admit that the model is not generating anything like the kind of prediction that would come out of the basic

We'd get I think that the probability that we have converged to something like is getting much higher than it has been until recently.

It's definitely possible surprise to the upside, allowing normalization to proceed as we have it economy has definitely years of ZIRP, we need to prepare for around the table here, I thought it was an excellent them.  I have some sympathy with President citation of the low TIPS breakevens, which I have cited myself at times in the been very concerned about.

But now the oil shock is

If we can't, more dovish than at markets have moved way out, is part of what's making me very we'll just get stuck with ZIRP long term. MR. BULLARD.  I agree with those around the table reel in probability on December.  If we could get then we might have to follow up with communications after the meeting.  I don't know how that would work.  But I think the basic idea is that September was perceived as least my interpretation of where the Committee is, and that the some into 2017, on when they think liftoff will occur.  This concerned that implications of not moving in December.  I think just don't like the economic outcomes we see,' believe that's right.  The argument about normalization is an argument about cumulative and then chart a new course for policy.  Governor Fischer laid out some I agree with John Williams and others-we can't continue to wait I agree with Governor Fischer on the the words he used were, 'That would indicate we and I progress.  To mix that up with what's going on day to day in the economy is mixing two types of arguments.  If we don't like the way the economy is performing, that's fine, but the Committee should just admit this possibilities in that case.

Most likely, they're going to be agree who says you don't want to make this interest rate move in an environment of a that.  But as long as we can make the case that we're okay and cumulative progress, we should be able to get off zero in December.  I agree with the have been the big advocate of saying, 'We need state-dependent policy, every little the data is something that's going to change FOMC policy.

I appreciate we can cite Governor even though I and we've got to depend on the data.'  But it does have this feedback to us that wiggle in that if we don't move in December, we're going to have to a fundamental change in the policy outlook advanced by the Committee-how we're I agree with Governor Powell consider thinking about normalization and how we're thinking about our framework as we go forward.

On balance, the Committee's consideration suggest important reasons why our stance may be closer to neutral than may be implied by conventional For some time, there's been a conversation policy that equates normalization with moving off the zero lower bound and tightening.  I think the discussion of the natural rate of interest yesterday grounds that discussion in terms of the distance of the effective federal funds rate relative to a time-varying natural rate of interest. We've discussed a host of reasons why that natural rate of interest might be low at the and might remain have been circulated to the Committee, to the persistent financial headwinds observation that world interest rates pull on U.S. interest materials developed for the current monetary policy monetary policy empirical regularities based on historical relationships.

As against this, I believe it is With regard to the communications and recognizing there this room in favor of a December liftoff and legitimate concern to ensure that markets are on notice, although not too probable.  So maybe I'm in the

For those reasons, I'm a bit concerned about introducing language regarding 'later this year' very quickly and which in turn risks reinforcing perceptions of 'lurchiness' in our communications.  I actually think the version of the bracketed language will clearly put Committee is actively debating a rate rise at the next meeting.  The suggestions by President Lockhart and by President Rosengren did a nice would probably put those suggestions above either of the versions currently on the table.

My own view is that, in December, we lift off or not expecting is very important if we're going to enhance our credibility If the data December its own, then I think we want market participants to be expecting liftoff if we are planning to liftoff if we're not planning to lift off.  This is how we behaved historically, and, given our recent track record on communications, this with the public.

'later this year' and 'at its next meeting,' that's a really tricky one.  I like 'at next meeting' better because I think it's more explicit, but, on the other hand, I take Governor a lot easier to take out 'later this year' than it is to take out 'at its next 'later this year' because of the ease of taking it out of the statement.  You don't have to 'at its next meeting.'  If we take out 'at its next meeting' and we don't move in In terms of its Tarullo's point that it's meeting,' because it has to come out automatically.

Now, we know what we'll do if the and the labor market tightens further.  As I said yesterday, I some good answers of how we'll respond, if the economy doesn't cooperate, to the assertion that we're going to be out of weapons.  We need to have a 'plan B' need to have consist of, because 'Okay, so what are you going to do if the economy continues to disappoint?'  The credible answer she can number of options worth considering.  I'm just going to run through a bunch could extend the sheet.  The Treasury securities have been aging.  We have a lot of we think, 'Well, we'll let the in longer-term Treasury securities.'  But another MEP program:  We could sell short-dated Treasury securities and buy That's another possibility that I think we should at least to have a more powerful effect on economic activity than just I said 'look into,' President Lacker, not necessarily 'do.' your day in court if we go down this path. There are a of options to put them on the table.  The first is the very obvious one:  We duration of our balance Treasury securities maturing next year.  So, clearly, extending the duration is a real, live possibility.  When we consider extending duration, a lot of times short-dated Treasury securities mature and then invest in longer-term Treasury securities, or we'll sell the short-dated Treasury securities and invest there's also agency mortgage-backed securities. look into, because it may turn out buying Treasury securities. [Laughter]  You'll have

October 27-28, 2015

to extend the duration of the portfolio, it's also going to be very of how we message this.  We don't want people to conclude that we're because we somehow have this balance sheet constraint.  If you're going to say that's the first step in what would be potential steps to actually expand the balance sheet and do large-scale asset If we don't talk about that at all, people will reach the conclusion that the reason extending the duration is that somehow you have this very solid balance sheet limitation. would not be reassuring to people.  That would actually be somewhat alarming to If we were to decide important in terms extending our duration to talk about extending duration, you also have subsequent purchases. you're I think that people.

another large LSAP program, I've never heard anything compelling about sheet size is the limit.  If someone has a really strong argument for why limit, I'd like to hear it.  But it seems to me that $4½ trillion or $5½ trillion-it's not the zero that outcome, I would favor more QE, thank you. In terms of why the current balance this is the obvious that we're out of ammunition here.  And, to me, if the option was to be stuck at lower bound indefinitely with inflation far below our objective versus more QE that could maybe avert rate is more controversial.  We could cut the IOER rate.  We could probably territory.  We decided not to do this earlier because of concerns about the makes us more comfortable that feared.  So I would encourage the staff to work on updating our view and benefits of a reduction in the IOER rate.  We could even say in our this.  This is potentially The IOER cut it into negative unintended consequences, but maybe the European experience the costs are less than we'd of the costs communications, if the economy were to disappoint, 'We're looking at on the table, and we'll be back to you on that.'

thing I would point to-and this is going to be a little bit more controversial-is really do.  If things get bad and you're to the downside, price-level targeting is to lean against that and is particularly relevant in the current environment because been underperforming on our inflation goals for quite some time.  The current policy of PLT policy pushes against years ago.  We decided not to go there because we thought that it's not that hard to explain.  If you're actually a The last that I think we should consider price-level targeting.  I worried about inflation expectations getting unanchored a strategy we've bygones-that we just forgive all of the past misses on inflation-does run the risk over time of having inflation expectations become unanchored to the downside.  A that.  I think we discussed that a few it was hard to explain, but my own personal view is really worried about inflation expectations getting unanchored to the downside, it is pretty credible tool to address this.

in extremis, if all of these tools were insufficient, we probably should call a this thing called fiscal policy that could be used to support economic a very low level of interest rates.  Looking around the Second from New Jersey into New York City.  Of course, more federal support, that might occur a little bit more quickly.

YELLEN.  Okay.  Thanks.  We've had a very rich and full discussion of the I've heard widespread support for alternative B for today, but we do have a number of CHAIR issues. wording issues that I'd like to take up individually and resolve.

the bracketed 'slightly.'  In light of the inflation compensation has declined 10 basis points, as I think Thomas told us, to me, it in 'slightly.'  I heard some support for this, but a number of you didn't Let's start with paragraph 1.  The first issue is fact that seems reasonable to put

But it was a very substantial edit that was did not hear broad-based support for it around the table, so I want to give people an appropriate for us to change the wording about intermeeting period, would you let me know? Second, I did hear a suggestion, and a second of the suggestion, to substantially change the discussion about labor market performance. proposed.  I opportunity to comment.  If you think it really is the labor market and what we've seen in the [Show of hands]  Okay.  President Bullard and President Lacker.

pick up on it because we crossed out the 'labor market continued that would be a signal that we thought the labor market was getting that that's really what we intend to communicate.  I agree that it was a more the part that caught my attention. MR. BULLARD.  I did to improve,' and maybe worse.  I'm not sure involved edit than we usually do at this stage, but that's

A reason for having it was that there were mixed signals.  We do indexes.  We did have a good discussion.  President Mester important points about that index that we need to take up with the staff. labor market, there were other things that moved in the wrong direction.  For participation rate fell, hours fell, the quits rate moved sideways, and job declined, and these things show up with weight in the labor market conditions index. many indicators of the labor market.  That was partly the motivation CHAIR YELLEN. have various labor market conditions raised some Nevertheless, while I would agree-and I think the staff would probably agree-that the pace of job gains for the past couple of months remained above the level that is needed to produce further gains in the example, the labor force openings We do refer to looking at for the wording we have.

MR. EVANS.  Could I ask a question about this, Madam Chair?

October 27-28, 2015

CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course.

It sounds relatively benign to point out that we are expecting a step-down employment numbers we expect to see associated with that the number is actually that suggest the unemployment path is not going to be going as low as doesn't really sound as benign as just the simple observation that, MR. EVANS. in employment growth at some point in a mature recovery, so this is just acknowledging that. We don't report in the SEP what payroll our outlook.  But if, all of a sudden, people think that now it's likely moving down, wouldn't we previously had it?  It eventually, we'll get there.  I don't know if that's a feeling around the table or not.  That's why I've been puzzled by the discussion.

YELLEN.  I would agree with what you just said-that it does have implications And it did me that the description is not inaccurate.  It is a judgment about 'the labor market improve.' CHAIR for the unemployment gap and for policy.  Paragraph 1 is supposed to report the facts. seem to continued to this way, Madam Chair.  It's easier to is to support the case that 'the labor market continued to improve.'  I think that, on to go back to the other statement. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Let's put it support the statement 'the pace of job gains has slowed and the unemployment rate has leveled out' than it balance, it's a lot easier to support the statement we have than

My own preference would be to keep it as it is in B.  I see two or three people in favor.  Are there others who support changing it? Okay.  Seeing that it is a minority view, I recommend keeping the wording we CHAIR YELLEN.  I agree. alternative [Show of hands] have.

bracketed options pointing explicitly to the December Let's go to paragraph 3.  There are a number of decisions to be made here.  I think the first is whether to include one of the

October 27-28, 2015

what's in the brackets.  But, on the a bit of support around the table for including one of the bracketed it but to do so in a soft way that doesn't indicate we've meeting.  I did hear some sentiment in favor of getting rid of other hand, I heard quite phrases on the grounds that, if we want December to be a live meeting, we probably need, in light of market expectations, to signal already made a decision.

Can I suggest that we first decide whether we want one VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. of the two bracketed languages?

YELLEN.  That's what I'm suggesting.  Why don't we first decide whether we the next meeting.  Do we want one of the bracketed options, or some Powell. CHAIR want some reference to other option?  Governor newsletters clearly indicate that the market is clear signal from us that December is on the table.  The market loves to discount neither of these is in here and we just changed 'whether' to 'when,' I that the probability of liftoff in December will go down.  Now, the risk of putting these in is that it goes up more than we want.  But I think the data will drive the answer, MR. POWELL.  Madam Chair, the market looking for a our words these days.  If would predict one of so I strongly encourage keeping one of the two in.

YELLEN.  Is there anybody else who wants to comment on this?

CHAIR MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  I share those views.

CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  President Kaplan.

just said.  But I also agree with of them in, which I'm fine with, makes this much closer to in the mind of the outside world than a lot of people around the table would like.  I'm MR. KAPLAN.  I agree with everything Governor Powell the comment that leaving either one probable fine with that, and I'm prepared, in terms of what data I'm looking for in the next 45 days, to

October 27-28, 2015

a lower bar than others.  But if we leave it in, people need to be prepared that, if are choppy data, we are saying it's still probable.  I'm okay with it.  I'm not sure everybody have maybe there else is, though.

as though I'm being pushed into opposition, and that MR. TARULLO.  I was going to defer to what you were inclined to do, Madam Chair. But after Jay's and Rob's comments, I feel we're making the decision now.

my own view is what it literally says hereabout whether it is appropriate to raise rates, that decision has not been made.  Now, we'll come to the 'based on incoming data,' but at this meeting.  But I believe this language is to place December squarely on the table as a meeting at which we might make this CHAIR YELLEN.  I would like to say that that, at our next meeting, we will make a decision and that I do not regard this decision as having been made intended decision.

is a bias here in favor of moving, in the sense that we wouldn't include this that we were going to see data that would make us moving were very low, it would not, to my mind, be advisable to include this.  For in my view, it is appropriate to move.  And if we of what we're going to see, that's sufficient justification to have it isn't decided, and, to my mind, it really does depend on the data.  I don't want, at things we need to see, but I think it Yes, there language unless we thought there was some reasonable chance we would see data that would make us comfortable.  If we thought the odds comfortable example, if the staff forecast bears out, then, take that as a modal forecast in there.  But it this point, to get into exactly what number of jobs or other depends on the data.

in here is the fact own assessment, so we clearly VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  The argument for having this language that the current probability seems lower than the Committee's

October 27-28, 2015

is going to do it.  But I would argue that, if the market were to overreact, it would be easy to underline that this is possible, not probable, in public communications. want to move in the direction of pushing that probability up.  The question is, we don't know how far this pretty week.  If we saw this was a done deal and decided, my own inclination would be to CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes, especially given that I'm going to testify next an interpretation emerging that push back on that.  President Williams.

be solved through the minutes?  Would the minutes how the voters interpret this?  I actually don't like this 'possible' versus I think that is actually separating us.  'Probable' sounds like 'highly likely,' and 'unlikely,' depending on which side you're on. MR. WILLIAMS.  Can this problem summarize the sense of 'probable.' 'possible' sounds like almost 50-50.  I'm where Governor Powell VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I think it's was.

the odds were roughly equal, or some kind of description in the minutes that it as being the way you said, that we're trying to get the probability up to a value a way to do that that lessens some of these MR. WILLIAMS.  That's what I was about to say.  It could be something indicating that we saw that described implying there's a good chance of something.  Is there concerns?

is.  The staff will certainly try to draft something that and what the are.  Governor Brainard. CHAIR YELLEN.  Of course there you'll have a chance to review that accurately portrays where the Committee stands range of views

Yes.  If the minutes were to state that we saw roughly equal odds, that I was hearing that around the room.  But if people MS. BRAINARD. would be very meaningful.  But I'm not sure

October 27-28, 2015

something that could comfortably appear in the minutes, I believe that does do what think that's Jay was suggesting, which seems effective.

With those provisos, my recommendation would be to keep in takes us to which bracketed option to keep in.  I heard both of the options.  I think we're a little bit divided on that.  Either way, both of this year,' I think, can only be our next meeting.  I that it is a one-shot-only thing.  It has to be meeting' is December.  It is language that we could keep meeting after meeting, but, think it's unlikely that it would be desirable to do so.  If we time, thinking that we're just on the verge of moving.  But I can live with things.  So let me ask, how many people prefer 'later this year'?  [Show of many people prefer 'at its next meeting'?  [Show of hands] CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. one of the bracketed options, and then that support for these options point to December.  'Later guess a reason to have that language is, it's language we've used-I've used it repeatedly-so it's playing off that.  An advantage, in a way, is removed in December.  My own view is, if we're not comfortable moving by December and we feel the economy is too weak, then we really have to change our communications substantially. To me, that's an advantage, and I heard some of you echo that thought.  'At its next also very explicit about frankly, even though we could, I don't move in December, we really need to rethink our communications and not keep markets on tenterhooks all the either one of these hands]  How

Chair, you could always say 'at its next meeting later this MR. LOCKHART.  Madam year.'  [Laughter]

YELLEN.  I actually see more support for 'at its next meeting.'  Is there live with 'at its next meeting'? CHAIR anybody who just can't mean the same thing, substantively. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  They

October 27-28, 2015

would prefer the other, but not strongly. MR. HARKER.  The other question is, who can live with both?  Because I one versus

YELLEN.  Is there anybody who feels strongly? is. CHAIR MR. EVANS.  I could go with whatever your favorite

happy to defer to the Chair.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  I'm

But, on the other next meeting' is extremely straightforward and clear.  If 'later this year' is just say 'December' or 'at its next meeting'?  So I suppose, the more I think its next meeting' sounds good.  Can people live with 'at its next meeting'? CHAIR YELLEN.  'Later this year' are words we've used repeatedly. hand, 'at its December, why not about it, 'at

MR. FISCHER.  Yes.

Let's go with that.  Then the final issue is 'based on incoming could go either way.  My own view that I am going to be looking at incoming data very carefully because my own sense is that we at a rate pretty close to trend.  For me, I need economy is growing above trend, and I'm going to be looking at data on that.  I want sufficient pace.  That's crucial to me.  But I also had a lot of problems with data dependence and trying to have the world understand to feed into a view about the medium-term outlook.  I realize there is a downside the table, but it hasn't been decided.  I could certainly be supportive of CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. data,' and those are words we could remove.  Now, a reason for having them there is, I really think it does hinge on incoming data.  This is a decision that is have an economy that seems as though it's growing to think the to make sure the labor market is improving at a agree we've that data have of 'based on incoming data.'  Even if you were to get rid of it, the new language makes clear that December is on getting rid of 'based on incoming data,' but, having heard a number of people say they preferred

October 27-28, 2015

Does anybody want to speak on the issue of Vice Chairman. to get rid of it, I'd like to go around on that again. 'based on incoming data'?

DUDLEY. Well, as I said before, we've been saying that we're data seems to me their probability of their assessment in December based on meeting, and that's per Governor Powell's people, 'Pay attention to what's VICE CHAIRMAN dependent, so I just don't understand why, all of a sudden, we want to drop it.  It that we want the market to adjust information that we receive between now and the point.  By having it in the statement, you're basically telling happening to the incoming data in terms of how they inform the economic outlook.'

And it does explicitly say that we're assessing the outlook. CHAIR YELLEN.

Right.  It's not the data just for the data's sake.  It's the toward our goals. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. data in terms of how they affect our view of the progress

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lacker.

Yes, I think the principles discussed by Kocherlakota and Laubach are Obviously, it's true, but if we leave it out, it's obviously true, too.  We're employment gains.  That tilts me toward leaving it out. MR. LACKER. relevant here. selecting what to emphasize here.  To Bullard's point, we laid out a criterion a year ago in terms of cumulative progress, and this makes it sound as though we're waiting for the last little smidgen of

YELLEN.  When you say that things are based on cumulative progress, I'm not totally understand that.  That's part of it, but our outlook regarding where we're going is it's important to having reasonable confidence in the inflation can't be entirely backward looking when it comes to evaluating that.  And to be not sure I CHAIR sure I very important.  In particular, outlook.  I forward looking, I need to be revising my outlook based on incoming data.  So I'm understand.

October 27-28, 2015

think one of the things often said in the wake of there's some confusion about what our criterion is. 'considerable improvement in labor market conditions.'  We put that phrase down our criterion, and that suggests a cumulative quantum of progress. MR. LACKER.  Well, Madam Chair, I September is 'moving the goalposts'-that We said there.  That was

On net. CHAIR YELLEN.

CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  We also said 'reasonable confidence' about inflation VICE though, too.

Right.  Yes, we did.  We had both of those.  Granted, the way we of those things, but we laid down these more tactical criteria for lifting off. MR. LACKER. conduct policy has to do with the outlook and all specific

YELLEN.  Yes, but reasonable progress and reasonable confidence are forward CHAIR looking.

Well, on inflation, but on the labor market side, it was 'considerable MR. LACKER. improvement.'

CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes.

MR. TARULLO.  Madam Chair?

CHAIR YELLEN.  Governor Tarullo.

the original progenitors of this idea, and, speaking probably worth, in the end, it.  If you're more comfortable with it, I'm fine with that. MR. TARULLO.  John and I were only for myself, I think it's a secondary issue.  I don't think it's having a fight about

If you're more comfortable with including it, MR. EVANS.  I agree with that as well. I'm fine with that.

Let's see.  There are other people.  President Kaplan. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.

October 27-28, 2015

on here.  But, to me-and I'm coming at word, businessperson or market participant-this data dependence is implicit that we're going to be data dependent, but, that this is more of a short-term decision than I actually think it is.  They a long-term narrative, which is a very fundamental view of what's going are a part of it.  But, at least to a layman participant, it's it's much more of a short-term assessment than I actually think in the way we're going to go at this. MR. KAPLAN.  Yes, I'm sorry-I hate to pile this as a, for lack of a better confusing and sends the wrong signal.  It's by saying it, it suggests understand that we have on in the economy, and that the data somewhat confusing.  It suggests is reflected

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Lockhart.

it after intricate analysis-'What did they mean by that?'-when we have made this point it.  I can live with it either way. MR. LOCKHART.  I could live with it either way, but the fact that we're inserting so much emphasis on data dependence strikes me as a little gratuitous.  It's going to generate a whole lot of before.  So, on balance, I favor not including

That's the wisest last intervention in the history of the Federal Reserve. MR.TARULLO.

Tarullo said.  I agree with him. the fight, but I The fact is, the September 'the Committee will assess progress-both realized and expected-toward its of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.'  That sentence has everything you MR. WILLIAMS.  I'm going to repeat what Governor First of all, you should do on this what you think is best.  I'm not trying to fight am going to react a bit to your interaction with President Lacker. statement says that objectives

October 27-28, 2015

inserts into that the additional phrase 'based on incoming were asking for.  What this does is, it data.'

YELLEN. Which is always implicit. CHAIR

WILLIAMS. Which is always implicit.  You were reacting to President Lacker a bit like, 'Well, we have to make sure we talk about inflation.  We have to make sure we clause 'based on incoming data'? both realized and expected,' maybe I'm just wedded to this too much, but I think it captures what Governor Tarullo and I have been talking about a as though there's something short term that we're looking for, is your choice, and you should be comfortable with the language. MR. little talk about the outlook.'  This sentence has the outlook.  It has inflation.  The sentence has everything you said we should have.  The only question is-and to President Lockhart's comment-does it help on the margin to add in this extra When I read 'assess progress, language little bit yesterday and today.  This is the right way to think about monetary policy.  And I agree with President Kaplan.  It sounds too.  I realize this

Well, as I said, I'm actually comfortable taking it out.  I do taking it out.  I do recognize every little data point, and we want them, of course-as Vice Chairman-to be responsive and to know that we are thinking December is thinking about it.  Obviously, we haven't made a decision.  Obviously, it depends on an open question as to whether we're going to move. CHAIR YELLEN.  Yes. understand the point here, and I think it has merit.  I am comfortable that we sometimes focus markets on you've said, live.  We're the data.  There's

Yes, I really don't think this is a big deal.  I don't think markets are going to be way in one place versus another whether we have this in or out.  So VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. the I'm happy to defer to your judgment.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Mester.

October 27-28, 2015

tells us that 'this lot of information here in making the assessment.  So I think you could MS. MESTER.  I want to remind people that the next sentence basically assessment will take into account a wide range of information.'  In some sense, you've already said we're looking at a take it out without doing damage.

CHAIR YELLEN.  President Bullard.

Chair, it's up to you, of course, but I agree with Presidents MR. BULLARD.  Madam Lockhart and Kaplan here.  I think it is a bit confusing, and we already had this language in here.

Governor Brainard. CHAIR YELLEN.

is as inserting what seems like calendar-based language.  All it's doing is broader context, people have already been put on notice.  But I MS. BRAINARD.  I'll defer to you as well.  I think the reason that it's inserted here a counterbalance to reminding people that, although we're now being very explicit about December, we are also continuing to be data dependent.  That's why I think it is actually a balancing concept within this sentence even though, in the would defer to the Chair.

YELLEN.  What do you think?

MR. WILLIAMS.  We're putting you on the spot.

CHAIR

DUDLEY.  I just don't think it's that important, frankly.  As people it's not about December information.  With regard to Governor Brainard's point, the much do you want to lean against the time element?  That's really the VICE CHAIRMAN have said, it's really a question of whether you want to underscore that per se-it's about the incoming question is, how fundamental question.

there's more to it.  There is a question of whether we're giving impression is not something we want to do.  We've MR. FISCHER.  I think ourselves another way out, and leaving that

October 27-28, 2015

got enough to form a complete judgment based on everything that's in here.  So then the question would be, 'Why did they say that?'

DUDLEY.  Well, I think it is not a done deal.  It's a close call, and inform the view of whether you're over the line or not. VICE CHAIRMAN the data will

But, Vice Chairman Dudley, as President Mester pointed out, following MR. FISCHER. that, there is everything we're going to look at.

But that's not new.  This sentence is new. MS. BRAINARD.

It could go either way.

CHAIR YELLEN.  It says it.

VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  That's fair, that's fair.

CHAIR YELLEN.  All right.

when in doubt, don't put something new in. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  So

The dealer survey this time communications performance and detailed comments that made for very bear responsibility here, myself included.  Looking forward, we have the December meeting.  And I believe it's exceptionally important to I think our objective should be to try to make clear where we stand as a Committee.  That is the very first guideline contained in our policy on external communicationsCHAIR Before we take a vote, if you would permit round, I would like to say a few words about contained grades on our painful reading.  We all seven weeks to go before maintain discipline in our communications.  Following up on what President Kocherlakota said earlier, principle namely, every Committee participant has an obligation to enhance the public's understanding of monetary policy, including its rationale.

October 27-28, 2015

today's statement means that, although no decision has been made on December, may be appropriate to move at our next meeting if nothing new and unexpected the economy is market continuing to improve at I think it very well happens to alter the outlook and the incoming data support our expectation that growing above trend and will continue to do so, with the labor an acceptable pace.

to keep an open mind December decision and not to declare a position publicly before our next meeting. that there may be some need for me to communicate about incoming information.  I that, during the intermeeting period, I will be giving Congressional testimony a speech. Our statement indicates to the markets that December is a 'live' possibility, but also, importantly, that no decision has been made.  I would urge you all regarding the I recognize mentioned earlier twice and that, in spite of the intense focus on the timing of the first move, appropriate for policy to follow a gradual path.  I did hear suggestions that we what's now in paragraph 5 if we lift off, and we will work during the intermeeting I want to remind you that, in a way, we live or die on the basis of these plot is probably the most important form of communication we have role in the Committee's expectations concerning the path of the policy rate.  So, and well timed, and I a great deal of thought to what they write down in the SEP in December, a very important communications device. I think we also agree what matters for financial conditions and the outlook is the entire path of policy.  Importantly, based on the discussion we had about r * and in the policy round, we broadly agree that it will probably be reconsider period to do that.  But SEP numbers.  That dot about our expectations, and, if we move in December, it will play a disproportionate signaling to the markets in that regard, I think yesterday's discussion about r * was very valuable hope everyone will give understanding it is
