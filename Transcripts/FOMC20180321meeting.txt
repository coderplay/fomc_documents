Consequently, our forecast can be viewed as embodying the notion of the twin constant, a decline in the government budget balance leads to commensurate decline

Notably, in the late 1990s, strong growth contributed to a deficit and widening of the current account Of course, as shown in panel 1, everything else is not always held constant.

In thinking through the effect of our need to also global savings glut that has afflicted the world economy for more or less the past two decades persists or even strengthens, increased U.S. borrowing could be accommodated by increased current account surpluses abroad However, if deficit could indeed put more likely, I use a simple stripped-down version of a work by Steve Kamin and myself to forecast foreign current through 2020.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Questions?

Yes.  In my time on the FOMC, I don't think there's been a time the participants around the table seem to be with the Tealbook, it's really quite strikingly SEP the Tealbook dot into our dot plot, it would, I believe, be the highest dot MR. ROSENGREN. when the Tealbook diverged as much from what saying.  When I look at the SEP and compare it different.  The Tealbook has much more tightening than people around this table do in their submissions.  If you put for each of the years, and the Tealbook has the unemployment rate nonetheless coming in significantly below where the SEP median is.

you're doing with the being overly optimistic on the outcomes, as we're clearly with a very different forecast?  As you look at your own forecast-I Because I can remember and that's not true now.  I'd just be interested in the staff's perspective on that. So I would just be interested in, from the perspective of what Tealbook, where do you think we're coming around the table know we have a limited number of variables, but-how do you think about the divergence between where the Tealbook is and where the SEP is coming out? times when we would do a go-round and everybody would say, 'My forecast is exactly like the Tealbook,'

essentially no divergence. MR. WILCOX.  So let me outline one area in which I think there is divergence to speak of-and one area in which there's a very strong

We took the medians of the the SEP-we didn't do this exercise for the March results, but took the medians of the unemployment rate and subtracted off your longerrates to get an unemployment rate gap.  We did an analogous exercise with On the funds rate, we did the following exercise: unemployment rates reported in for December.  We run unemployment

inflation rate.  We subtracted off 2 percent to get an inflation gap, plugged that into the that we use in the staff projection-not the non-inertial rule, by the way, one that Etienne was using in his presentation.  And, lo and behold, what comes out, trajectory in the SEP. the inertial Taylor rule which is the to a remarkably close degree, is a replication of the median funds rate December just a second and summarize that exercise reaction function that appears to be implicit in your common SEP medians be remarkably close, in this case, to the one that we use explicitly and write down So it's dangerous to anthropomorphize 15 people and attribute to them one common framework.  However, I'm going to indulge in that for by saying that the seems to explicitly just as a mechanical process for generating the stance of the funds rate in the staff projection.

the area that I think is not a source of difference.  That makes it all the remarkable that we have an unemployment rate that is moving as low and as fast as we do just how strong the forward thrust is in of that, as Etienne mentioned, may be that many of you seem to have a is higher.  That seems to be true, for example, in the the SEP, so we can't verify that for comments indicate-in the cases of those of you who commented on Okay.  So that's more in the projection.  What it does, in my mind, is highlight the staff projection.  Part view that the labor force participation rate Blue Chip projection.  You don't give us that information in sure.

ROSENGREN. one area.  The other would be productivity than you're it.  The reason why I sort of close my eyes and take a the risk of sounding like an economist, it's complicated.  And the reason why the difference in assumptions is tell you how it would work in your projections, projection. MR. WILCOX.  No, I don't dismiss deep breath is, at it's complicated is because it depends on what the nature of regarding productivity growth.  Roughly, I can't but what I can tell you is how it would work in our

would tend to mark up actual real GDP growth by the same amount.  And the reason analytical approach is the idea that even households who in their intermediate macro class would recognize that their Say's stronger structural productivity growth, consumer spending would be well, and so all of the relevant gaps would be, roughly speaking, maintained as If we marked up structural productivity growth ¬Ω percentage point, just to name a number, we for that is simply that implicit in our haven't had Dornbusch and Fischer income prospects are brighter, and, therefore, they would spend more, and so a version of law would obtain.  With stronger as before.

a longer sort of Socratic dialogue between the two of us to tease out I think it would take what the implications of stronger productivity growth are.  And would each of you be

March 20-21, 2018

that as a structural matter?  In which case, I think-subject to consultation with my difference in real GDP growth projections, the difference in the unemployment rate, a close approximation, is driven by the gap real GDP growth and potential GDP growth. envisioning colleagues-that would be a valid explanation for the not adjusted for potential, but it wouldn't help explain because a change in the unemployment rate, to between actual that, in exerts a greater amount of restraint than that, in the past, occasionally I obtained from basically trying to invert your SEP submissionss to didn't bring room this time around,  But that was taking one particular view-namely, that you individually have, for example, a steeper slope of the IS curve than what is the staff's view, so that any given change in the federal funds rate produces a more rephrasing, I think, something already said in different a logical possibility. MR. LAUBACH.  If I may just add one point.  Logically, another possibility is your projection, the higher path of the federal funds rate is the case from the staff's perspective.  You may remember would show you these results figure out what, according to a simple IS equation, an implied r * would be.  Sadly, I that with me to the that embedded in your projections was a different view on what r * is.  However, an alternative, of course, is implicit in powerful response of real spending.  I'm ways.  But that's

There is a lot going on. MR. EVANS. want to thank the staff now, with the fiscal stimulus and the at the Chicago bank, we really count on looking at how you think about it time on the from which my 'takeaway' was that with a nonof the Phillips curve, it was kind of hard to get these outsized inflation me. And I know and bring your own thoughts to this.  And so, in light of our conversation last inflation forecast and so many presentations accelerationist view increases, it seemed to

at the Tealbook forecast this time, I was trying to figure out which elements in the fact that the inertial Taylor rule is taking is going really low, and inflation is just picking up a above 2 percent by the end of the forecast period.  And so, recognizing that there is sort the way the real economy works and how that translates to As I looked of what I know are now manifesting themselves us up really high, the unemployment rate little bit of an unhappy dichotomization in inflation because of the flatness of the Phillips curve, some of that is being manifest here, I think, in the outlook.

is the very high inertial Taylor rule funds rate trying unemployment rate from going too low?  Or is it trying to keep inflation from going 3 percent?  And I don't think it is the inflation side.  But then I looked at page 100, us into the monetary policy strategies and some of the other optimal control into the forecast period and some of the commentary I think The question I had for myself was, to keep the up to 2¬Ω or which takes exercises, and as you go further out

March 20-21, 2018

unemployment rate in some of these forecasts goes above the natural rate in on the you mentioned, the the 'asymmetric weight ugap ' scenario.

that has a very shallow funds rate path doesn't really have much that much lower.  So I wonder, what feature that is giving rise to that?  And is it somehow the fact that unemployment goes more in the out years that has that effect?  But that's a meandering kind of I'm struggling to figure out which of these features are-like the after the real side more and thinking that inflation is going to also thinking inflation expectations are headed up? I noticed that the one action on the inflation rate, and the unemployment rate goes is the above the natural rate commentary question, as inertial Taylor rule, is it going come along?  Or is it

I say that more tentativeness than other elements.  So, by and large, the funds rate fluctuation what we judge to be its sustainable position. In our analysis strongly forward-looking element of agents with a little is being driven by the surge in the economy past

inflation, I'd offer two brief addendums.  One is, keep in this concept of trend, or underlying, inflation that we have that is in operation. of centering our projection, the right center point for the next couple of years is just a 2 percent.  It's creeping up to 2 percent.  It's not literally quite yet at 2 percent over other concept to keep in mind is that we explicitly do not inflation.  So, let's say, the 'hot' economy next year, economy this year, generates no more inflation next year than it had this It is not a cumulative kind of process-the anchoring of inflation. With respect to the behavior of mind that there is So in terms little below most of the medium term.  And the have an accelerationist structure in following on a 'hot' year.

forecast is that with the economy operating as as we anticipate that it will be, those inflation expectations could become dislodged to the they were not dislodged, by and large, to the downside-at least that's an important thing to keep in mind. And, I would say, a considerable risk in the 'hot' upside.  We're encouraged that not in quantitatively significant measure, as best as we can tell.  So we haven't built in that kind of unanchoring in the projection, but think I am handicapped by my of this.  But, by themselves, I am not quite sure what the cost of that is, the low in the 1970s notwithstanding.  It is higher inflation or more inefficiencies in the MR. EVANS.  Thank you.  That's helpful.  Sometimes I economist training because I am very sympathetic to what you say about unsustainable output gaps and all unemployment

And as it does, the risk of going into recession empirically seems to be there.  But the inefficiencies-we don't talk about that quite as much around the table as the other features.

And as I've said many times, if and us, we will take dictation from you about a reaction that I see is having a fixed yardstick from one meeting to the next that will the staff projection in a transparent way, so that you can know-and we can meeting to the next or MR. WILCOX.  There is no attribution in our use of the Taylor rule of costs per se . There is no assertion of when the Committee wishes to give it to function.  The value allow you to audit tell you, to the basis point, why it changed this way or that way from one six meetings hence

EVANS.  And I agree with that completely.  Thank you very much. ROSENGREN.  So, President Evans, would your view be equivalent to the like the asymmetric from the framework we currently have but seems MR. MR. asymmetric ugap in the scenario?  What you're describing sounds a lot ugap in terms of how you're processing-there is no cost to having very low unemployment, which is exactly what that scenario is.  It's different consistent with that.  Is that what you're arguing for, or- and how the way I had been thinking about my own outlook might fit into through why it had certain features to MR. EVANS.  I was trying to understand the different elements in the material that was being presented to us one or the other.  I did look at that page and try to puzzle it.  I'm not quite sure what I subscribe to, to be perfectly honest.

Taylor rule inertial benchmarking for the forecast-I agree, I think that's And I think the really helpful.  I do think that probably the strength of it is over an empirical estimation period

when the inflation rate was higher overall than what we wanted, and so it inflation down.  I'm not quite sure are a lot of different alternatives that were presented, and we that included a time was probably always trying to push a little bit harder to get how that plays out here, but there benefit from thinking through the implications.

And, again, I agree with your highlighting the between our higher interest rate exactly right, as I believe I mentioned which we have a stronger underlying view about

March 20-21, 2018

quickly resource is going to tighten. aggregate demand will outrun potential.  It's really a statement about how utilization as a policymaker. to put in the Taylor (1999) rule, I kind of agree with the benchmark argument that meeting to meeting.  But let's suppose the Committee just does us to do over the forecast horizon.  Then I think you would say, well, and worse outcomes, I guess, if we follow the market.  And I'd with following, say, the Taylor (1999) rule. MR. BULLARD.  Well, I'll give you a suggestion that would help me If you want that gives you a comparison from what the market expects there's going to be more inflation like to see what those are compared

'worse' outcomes, 'different,' because, again, our use of Taylor (1999) inertial is not meant to have a explicitly conditioning your projections on what you would to be appropriate monetary policy, we are simply trying to define our economic views rate so that we can trace it now than it was before. MR. WILCOX.  So, we can certainly do that exercise.  I wouldn't say simply normative content.  So if you all are consider on a clear, transparent, and auditable trajectory for the funds mechanically back to the source causes of why it's different to follow up on that, again, we put the Taylor (1999) rule asked before.  I'm not quite sure why we do this.  I think that relevant of a benchmark.  It might have been at one time, but it shouldn't be the organizing feature of how we think about monetary policy. MR. BULLARD.  Yes, and just prescription on the dot plot.  I've maybe the Taylor (1999) isn't maybe

Again, to reiterate, the for the non-inertial Taylor (1999) rule, which is a very MR. WILCOX.  Fair point.  We'll take that under advisement. diamonds on the exhibit on page 3 are different beast from what we're using in-

You may have disagreements about the intercept, but you may still want of 1 to the output gap or 2 to the unemployment gap space. MR. LAUBACH.  If I may, briefly-in the case of the SEP chart, we are simply not using a non-inertial rule, because One way that you may want to look at this may nonetheless potentially to think about if you applied the coefficients and 1¬Ω to inflation, what that would imply in change you look at panels 3 and 4 in exhibit 1, this has central bank policy rates forecast horizon and then has the broad real dollar projected to appreciate through this and the appreciation comes because we're going to market to the upside on the pace of our tightening.  But, I would submit, just looking not commensurate with the amount MR. BULLARD.  Mr. Chairman, just one other follow-up on a related point on the international outlook.  If over the period.  I've asked the staff before about this, surprise the at this chart, that the amount of appreciation of the dollar is of the surprise implied by the FOMC action.

March 20-21, 2018

and the FOMC policy rate.  And, really, if you look at the a mild or no effect on the dollar.  So how do we get that? According to this chart, you're talking about, at the end of the forecast horizon, 450 basis points between the ECB policy rate dollar chart, it has kind of

Mechanically, we're taking into account the market expectation for too.  We have the surprises both on the domestic side and the foreign side, and we the difference between those two surprises to come up with the appreciation rate. MR. GRUBER. foreign rates, look at you point out, the staff has policy rates going up to 5 percent, the market is at about 2¬Ω.  So we have a big gap there.  On the foreign side, it's true that bit higher than the market-implied rate.  So that's working in the other same amount of the gap.  And so once we combine those two misses in foreign side, we come up with the 2 percent relationship of these mistakes. On the FOMC line, like whereas our forecast is actually a direction, but not by the some ways, both between the U.S. side and the appreciation rate, using the historical

about re-creating the staff forecast using the marketarea in which we're going to see it today.  Most of is coming from, as you say, the higher Taylor rule-provided forecast with market implied path.  You put the market-implied path in there, and we've got nothing, You brought up the point earlier implied path.  This is going to be an important this dollar appreciation the really.  So the dollar would almost be flat in the forecast, and so that would have some sort of effect on the outlook.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Vice Chairman Dudley had his hand up.

DUDLEY. This is going to be very quick.  The market-based The this is the optimal monetary policy.  They're saying what they think that my first observation. VICE CHAIRMAN interest rate forecast, though, is a very different thing than what the SEP numbers are. market is not saying we're going to do.  So I think it's a very different animal.  That would be

March 20-21, 2018

second observation is, it may be that you're assuming that financial conditions don't as powerfully to the rise of interest rates as the Taylor rule gives you.  I think, if rate went to 5 percent, I bet people conditions would tighten quite significantly.  So may be another source of disagreement or difference. The react, implicitly, you took a straw poll around the table, and the federal funds around this table would probably think financial that thought experiment, becauseMR. WILCOX.  It's hard to run that

DUDLEY.  We don't give you the projections, for one thing. rate is rising to 5 percent in the unemployment rate is going to 3.1.  If the unemployment is going to 3.1, then maybe-maybe-our equity price forecast looks more plausible, and I'm trying to make as soft a claim there as VICE CHAIRMAN MR. WILCOX.  That's exactly right.  In addition, the funds our projection precisely because rate maybe investors would say, 'Wow, with an economy that's as strong as it has been since the early 1950s, maybe we bid up equity prices.' possible, but-

DUDLEY.  It would be interesting to see what the equity market like relative to the level of interest rates you have in your projections and see a test. VICE CHAIRMAN valuations looked whether those were elevated on your assumptions.  That would be sort of

This would be a great first press conference conversation.  [Laughter] DUDLEY. Probably not. MR. BARKIN. VICE CHAIRMAN

Well said.  Lael has a two-hander. CHAIRMAN POWELL.

It's useful to have some kind of rule in the SEP exhibit as a it's not clear why you have a non-inertial when all of us, I'm pretty sure, put an inertial rule, whatever rule is used. MS.

Kashkari. MR. LAUBACH. I can certainly look into that. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President strikes me that one difference-it's only between my outlook and the reentered the MR. KASHKARI.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  David, a quick question.  Sorry that we're all piling on you today.  It staff's outlook-is the output gap.  I've been surprised by how many people have labor force, and the staff, I think, is interpreting that as unsustainable, an ever-increasing output gap.

to change your view to go from unsustainable to thought'?  Is it simply wages and is there something else you could look at over time and say, 'Okay.  Our assessment What data would you have to see sustainable, to actually be, 'Hey, potential is higher than we inflation, or was wrong.  It's not an ever-increasing output gap'?

think, wages and inflation.  You unfortunately took the talking points the degree of uncertainty in which we are definitive test of where the economy is relative to its sustainable location will be wage growth and price inflation. MR. WILCOX.  I out of my mouth.  We're profoundly aware of operating.  One way to crystalize the extent of that uncertainty is the confidence interval surrounding our estimate of the natural rate of unemployment.  In the end, over a lengthy period of time, the nominal is that signal is very attenuated, as we've all noted around the Phillips curve is very flat, very little to movements in resource utilization.  And what that means is that the signal-to-noise ratio is going to be very low for the natural rate.  But, in the end, I think that's acid test. Now, the sad fact of the matter the table, because, empirically, it appears to be the case that responding readings on inflation and wages, which inevitably will be buffeted by myriad transitory factorsthe the

Philadelphia has performed a detailed exploration of the cyclical behavior of people between employment, unemployment, between nonparticipation to to nonparticipation.  It turns out that both of those are which people exit the Our staff in labor force participation and the cyclical flows of and nonparticipation.  The key drivers are the transition rates employment and employment procyclical-implying that when the economy is expanding, the rate at labor market accelerates, while nonparticipants enter directly into employment more robustly as well.

Thank you, Mr. Regarding my view staff forecast and somewhat more concern over target level leads me Tealbook baseline.  So I Chairman.

Bullard. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Thank you.  President main points for today's policy baseline case, I suggest that the Committee think in terms of MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have three discussion.  Number one is that, as a a growth rate for the U.S. economy in 2018 of about 2.5 percent.

to 2.5 percent in a U.S. feedback to inflation is exceedingly weak.  So such a surprise would only help at our target rate of 2 percent. Number two, if the economy surprises to the upside relative meaningful way-let's say, 3 percent or better-that would be welcome news for the economy, but the us get inflation better centered required to maintain a neutral policy stance is likely below this regard, I note that the market is expecting rate to top out at about 2¬Ω percent in the 2019-2020 time period, according to Number three, the policy rate 2 percent in today's environment.  In my opinion, moving above 2 percent in the current environment is likely to be restrictive and, hence, begin to put downward pressure on inflation when inflation continues to run below target.  In the FOMC policy Lorie Logan's panel 10 that we just saw.

2018:  In 2017, real GDP growth surprised to the upside, and we this point, raising rates, should be that the real GDP growth rate now returns So let me run through these arguments and give some support for them.  Why I assume a 2¬Ω percent growth rate for ended the year with a 2¬Ω percent Q4-over-Q4 growth rate.  The natural prediction at especially with the Committee

March 20-21, 2018

what President Harker just mentioned-which the Tealbook puts would suggest, say, a 2.2 percent growth rate for 2018, still ¬Ω percentage the long-run growth rate. toward trend-something like at 1.7 percent.  So that point above current fiscal policy changes taking effect in the U.S. economy.  The Tealbook puts this at a few tenths on the real GDP per year-and I am happy to accept those estimates, being generous.  That gets us To that, you may want to add back some growth to reflect now growth rate back, then, to 2¬Ω percent as a baseline case for 2018 growth.

is not too far from the Macroeconomic Advisers' consensus panel, the risks associated with such a a possibility that we will see a wave of business investment in the United real GDP growth.  But supply-side effect would not require an aggressive monetary policy response. That kind of number which is at 2.7 percent.  One thing you could say is, what are forecast?  Could something better happen?  I think it certainly could, and I hope it does.  I do think that there is States, and that could improve U.S. productivity growth, leading to faster this type of risks?  I certainly think there are, and I will list are high by traditional valuation metrics, and a possibility.  This might then feed into a weakening of and business sentiment.  I think that's one risk. On the other side, are there downside three here.  Number one, equity valuations substantial revaluation is certainly a consumer

second risk is that the whole analysis is being thrown off by first-quarter real GDP numbers for real GDP growth in the first quarter have both moved below 2 meeting, a 2 percent Q1 means a lot.  If you want to get to 3 percent growth the remaining three quarters, which in my a tall order, taking into account productivity and labor force trends. A growth, which now appears to be weaker than expected.  The Atlanta Fed and Macroeconomic Advisers' tracking percent.  As of this for the year, one would need to average 3.3 percent for mind is

and tariffs.  I agree with the staff in that I do not are significant enough to have meaningful war with China is a macroeconomic perspective.  And I think a consensus is forming in the that we have been too accommodating of Chinese mercantilist trade practices for United States.  So I think that this is a tangible possibility, and that there may be important And the third downside risk is trade think that the steel and aluminum tariffs macroeconomic consequences.  I do, however, think that a brewing trade downside risk from a United States too long and, therefore, that a period of trade disruption may gain considerable political support in the macroeconomic consequences down the line.

United States surprises to the upside on econometric evidence.  In addition, with regard performance would only be helpful in getting inflation Now, let's turn to the second point.  Suppose the GDP growth and, by extension, on labor market performance.  My question is:  So what?  The feedback to inflation is miniscule according to recent inflation has been running below target, so the U.S. economy surprising to the upside to real GDP growth and labor market better centered at our inflation target of 2 percent.

committee to using the Dallas Fed trimmed mean as our underlying inflation.  I think it is less susceptible to a one-time price movement like the year-over-year core PCE measure. an example in which the core measure is an imperfect the underlying inflation rate in the United States.  The core PCE inflation and 100 percent weight on other price movements. I do think we should switch as a measure of the cell phone prices that are soon expected to roll out of I think the cell phone price movements are means of how to get at measure is badly outdated.  It does not have theoretical backing, as it simply puts zero weight on certain price movements

March 20-21, 2018

trimmed mean is running at about 1.7 percent, year over year.  I expect it on inflation and inflation expectations. The Dallas Fed will move toward 2 percent, provided the Committee does not soon become overly restrictive and start to put downward pressure

90, has estimates of the probabilities that inflation will inflation will be less than 1 percent over the forecast probability of less than 1 percent is a greater risk for the Committee as of today than the probability of higher than 3 percent. think we should take these numbers seriously. I also note that the Tealbook, page exceed 3 percent versus the probability that horizon.  According to the existing models that we use, the actually If we have a symmetric inflation target, I

simulations, there is only one scenario to worry about from an inflation the nonlinear Phillips curve case.  In my opinion, there is almost no in favor of a nonlinear Phillips curve.  And if it does happen, I think we will have react.  That kind of thing takes years to develop, and this Committee is very In the alternative perspective, and that is evidence plenty of time to vigilant on inflation.  I don't think we'd get behind the curve on that.

I said it is likely below 2 percent, This is probably the leading issue facing this this is available in the slide had to mention.  We worked for a long time on idea is to divide the real natural rate of interest into three other papers have done-productivity growth, labor force growth, and the global safe assets.  And, further-which is different-is to think of each factor as being to make a lot of additional assumptions. The third point was the idea of the neutral policy rate. and let me just talk about that for a few minutes. Committee, in my opinion.  An expanded version of my remarks on deck ' * Wars:  The Phantom Menace,' which I r that title.  [Laughter]  It is available on my webpage.  I delivered that at the NABE meeting here in D.C. a few weeks ago.  The core factors like demand for either in a high mean state or a low mean state, but to refrain from putting additional structure on the analysis, in which case you have

March 20-21, 2018

in tandem to keep real rate exceptionally low.  This is the end result of a 30-year trend, not a temporary of interest to mean revert 30 years, especially since the three driving factors do not seem to be The evidence in the deck suggests that all of these factors are acting the natural phenomenon.  Therefore, we should not expect the real natural rate after having declined for shifting, based on the evidence available today.

Taylor rules at very low levels, and we can conduct we should not be thinking of moving back up to they were at in the 1990s or early 2000s.  Instead, we should expect the secular that drove the natural real rate of interest to this level to continue to exert downward think of as a period of about two years for monetary So what that is doing is centering our stabilization policy around those low levels, but the old levels that forces pressure over the forecast horizon, which I policy purposes.

feed this result into the ubiquitous but unsatisfactory Taylor (1999) rule, which given current output gaps and inflation gaps, we that the policy rate setting as of this meeting is approximately within 'neutral.'  So, according to this analysis, we're about after the presumed policy rate move that we will make at this meeting, If we then suggests a nominal policy rate setting, taking as will come to the conclusion the range that would be described as neutral today, and, even we will remain neutral.

to be here is, as a baseline case, unwise, in my view.  We should proceed on such a path economy surprises to the upside in a manner that has tangible implications for But a policy rate setting above 2 percent, conditional on today's gaps, would start restrictive, putting downward pressure on inflation and inflation expectations, according to this analysis.  Thus, although we are arguably fine for today, pushing the policy rate substantially higher from only if the

Such an increase in the unemployment rate is a roughly neutral stance.  The Blue Chip forecasters may be it will eventually revert back to trend. explanation for the projected increase in the unemployment rate in 2020 and of the unemployed.  Perhaps because, in my own forecast, I do not expect a resurgence in When comparing the Tealbook with the Blue Chip, the biggest difference is the path of the unemployment rate levels achieved with monetary policy set at assuming that productivity is now below trend, and that Another possible beyond involves a notable expansion in labor force participation that eventually increases the ranks

in the dynamics of labor force participation, it is productivity nor significant changes qualitatively more similar to the Tealbook than to the Blue Chip consensus.

However, when more closely examining the pattern in the previous report, most of the increase in the labor force came from fewer people labor force rather than from more people leaving the category to join the ranks of the employed.  In addition, the gains in the were particularly strong in the case of those who had college education.

Many of the forces that acted as headwinds to U.S. growth in previous years are generating tailwinds currently.

significant elements that have since then are the passage of both the tax act and the budget act.  I had already of the effect of the tax act into my December SEP, and the actual act effect was going to be.  The boost budget act has pushed up my projections a little bit further, but my view on the I continue to be optimistic about the economic outlook and even more so since December, when we last filled out our SEPs.  Obviously, two emerged incorporated an estimate didn't really change very much my assessment of what the coming from the

March 20-21, 2018

the outlook is not dependent entirely on the fiscal stimulus.  The economy was driving that is quite broad based.  If you look at the recent investment spending, for example, that significantly predated the stimulus.  And the strength of already quite strong.  I think what's strength of stimulus will certainly help, I think, support and extend that, but it was not the driver of that.

And you would expect, again, that the act would increase whatever pressure that is.  The decline in is not that well understood.  I certainly was encouraged by the fact number of people who were out of the labor force because of a disability has recently rapidly as those people were being drawn in-again, for reasons that I don't want to make jump in labor force participation in February.  And, more broadly-as others have noted-the participation rate has been flat for quite a while now, coming from demographics.  And that suggests that something is going on that has at least some durability, because incentives that are created by the tax participation of the workforce that the tended to move down quite defy easy explanation.

March 20-21, 2018

that Governor Brainard made, I think, is very interesting, that the-if the recent data on the changes in the educational that we saw in about how that has moved-there has been a significant movement even the course of the past 20 years in that composition.  And half of that 20 years has been the its aftermath, which would have masked or distorted whatever the effect of workforce would be on the natural rate of where I have set the natural rate of unemployment. And then the point you had asked me before looking at composition of the U.S. workforce when that had happened and what had happened, I probably would have said that that shift would have happened about 20 years on either side of the middle part of the 20th century and was largely done by 1970, 1980.  And yet the charts front of us just here over financial crisis and that change in the educational composition of the unemployment.  So there is at least the possibility-I wouldn't call it a hypothesis-but it creates doubt in my mind about of the 1970s, we in the same way that the views the neutral rate of interest.  And it was about 5¬Ω percent, and that was a given, in front of us-in the composition of the workforce-to say that that has only come down 1 percentage that I outlook is-that there is probably more room to allow the might otherwise have thought. I remember, in my first exposure to macroeconomics back in the middle were given the natural rate of unemployment as kind of a constant Taylor rule and there has been such a change since 1975.  Again, in the data we have educational point, I have some doubt about that now.  That would suggest to me-notwithstanding have a very robust view of what the economy to run than I

It is unclear if what I was hearing was just a that businesses hate uncertainty pessimism contacts shelving expansionary projects until the latest bad news will offset most, 'takeaway' my contacts and directors paint of the labor meeting.  In their words, conditions are still tight, they are still struggling to find qualified workers, and they are increasing compensation where, and only when, they need to.

March 20-21, 2018

not surprisingly, most firms are having difficulty filling positions. response to hiring difficulty depends on the nature of that difficulty.  When applicants or competition from other employers, firms were likely to be raising compensation in response.  This, to me, sounds exactly the simple supply-and-demand effects we expect to come from firms facing cyclical in a tight labor market.  However, when the problem was applicants lacking change the jobs lacking skills was the number-one complaint of firms, this difference in response the fact that nominal wage growth has not increased, even as other indicators market conditions have continued to tighten over the past year or so. I did find the results of the recently completed national Small Business Credit Survey interesting.

All signs point to an economy operating above full employment.  Job vacancies and quit rates are high.  Surveys of workers and employers show a taut labor market.  Employment rates, both in aggregate and in various demographic groups, have reached lows that would have been dismissed as unattainable just a few years ago.  Even higher..

nominal wage growth has been running well below what it historically would have the tightness of the labor market.  And, similar to the comments of shortfall to various structural factors, including lesslabor and product markets that have lowered workers' bargaining power.

He noted that been, taking into account President George, he attributed this competitive such structural factors cannot be offset with

Also, what happens if barriers actually prove to be politically popular, even as they are likely to be If that's the case, why stop at aluminum and steel? trade barriers will tend to introduce new frictions into the economy by to have negative consequences for productivity and GDP growth.  So both factors imply some upward impetus to inflation coming The Administration's decision to impose others that the are quite trivial, countries respond in kind, what will higher trade destructive from an economic perspective?

To pick one particularly favorable number:  Core PCE inflation has the past 6 months.  Ample experience over the past few years makes clear, too much of a brief run of favorable inflation data.  Thus, the discussion around the table focused on how much confidence we should have that into modest fluctuations around 2 percent. The inflation side of seems thus, increase our confidence that inflation will around 2 percent.  And, on a positive note, measured inflation has rebounded, as predicted, from the lows of run at 2 percent over however, that we should not make much of inflation will rise and settle

As discussed in the bullets to the right, the northwest and southeast quadrants, shown in blue, depict situations economy is in the northwest quadrant, monetary policy should be restrictive so as to reduce inflation and return the unemployment rate to its natural rate, while southeast quadrant, monetary policy should be accommodative.

Alternatively, the green from a sustained reversal in financial conditions and in attitudes to could lead to unrealistic situation and to unwise borrowing commitments If, at some point, expectations of high growth and low the economy might enter into recession without first a bout of inflation.  We don't have clear evidence supporting a causal link this remains an active jury is still out.  As discussed to the right, either of these two both could motivate the emphasis placed by alternative C on slowing the sustainable rates.  To achieve this, longer-run level, as The lower-left panel illustrates, that you have cited at past meetings illustrates nonlinearities in the Phillips curve appear, leading to a substantial increase in inflation and necessitating a marked policy tightening that triggers a recession. Although the Phillips curve appears to have flattened substantially in recent decades, during that period, the economy has not operated for a sustained period with a labor market as path might arise risk-taking.

But why is it downward sloping?  You gap is still negative.  I'm trying to understand why you wouldn't have this direction and the solid arrow in

You're absolutely right that it's not necessary that that's what would movement strictly along a Phillips curve, for example. MR. LAUBACH. happen.  So this is not necessarily

Okay, but that's what you had in mind with that arrow-right?-that if raise rates in order to get the unemployment rate to move back toward the natural MR. EVANS. you were to rate, the Phillips curve would be reducing inflation, right?  That's what you had in mind.

DUDLEY.  I like it.  I mean, I think it's a great way of bringing out VICE CHAIRMAN the key issues-I do like this.

There's a question. CHAIRMAN POWELL.

I mean, I took the direction of the arrow to be the Phillips curve.  You're one would be, you rate sitting-if you could make it sit, which is a big question by itselffor a few years, what might you think inflation MR. EVANS. right-other things can happen in Vice Chair Dudley's question.  Another have the unemployment under 4 percent, and if you were to do that expectations would do?  Then they might push you toward the origin.  That would be the nature of how you do that.  So, anyway, I thought it was very interesting.  I appreciate it.

CHAIRMAN POWELL.  Other questions for Thomas?  President Williams.

if we're going to have a serious discussion I want to reiterate what President Mester said and what, I an asymmetric loss function mean of inflation and unemployment that we actually think is loss in terms of a in which the economy can have a boom an illustration of how to kind of the moment about how we deal with tradeoffs.  But if you're really thinking about it as a statement on strategy, I think we really have staff that goes through how this actually works in the current situation,  We also need to think about the interaction with the MR. WILLIAMS.  You know, I think that about the asymmetric loss function, think, President Rosengren was pointing to.  In a standard model, will not deliver you the equilibrium.  You have to think carefully about how you design an asymmetric model-in thinking about, in a stochastic environment and a recession and things.  So I have always viewed this as think in strategy, and thinking about our January consensus to have some very good analysis by the general-not just in

March 20-21, 2018

how zero lower bound and reasons why-if the economy has asymmetries in it or nonlinearities, those then feed into this.

this is good for just illustrating some situations, but it isn't really a good way to it doesn't actually work in general. So I think think about, necessarily, a monetary policy strategy in our longer-run goals and strategy statement, because

Other than that, there's no problem.  [Laughter] But I think if we're really going to think about this in terms of a more analysis about how we in a particular situation. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY. MR. WILLIAMS. strategy and something we're going to revisit, we should have a lot would implement this in general, not just

Evans. CHAIRMAN POWELL.  President that perhaps with the existence of the zero monetary policy, an asymmetric loss function might But without something like that, the lead you to think that we couldn't get, on average, to 2 percent MR.

I thought lower bound increasing the inefficiencies of be a partial offset, or it might overcompensate as an offset. effective lower bound might inflation unless we had some other overriding, stronger accommodation the other way.  So I think it comes down to the analysis, and I think that's great.

comment earlier.  I should have been a little more careful when I said sometimes I feel handicapped by my economic training, because I'm quite prone to thinking talking about.  I thought that one of the benefits of having a broader group that there are other reasons why we might do a lot better, and uncertainty, and I just don't know how it will play out.  So it's worthwhile to think all in favor of that.  Thank you, Mr. Chair. Now, I made this that through what you're of people here was to point out there's this this through-I'm

Just to pile on a little bit: this diagram, and I like this way of thinking about things.

to grow more strongly than the SEP forecasts, I would prefer that alternative C be both more significant changes to the statement's current If one views alternative C as a candidate for a future alternative B should the economy continue more clearly different from alternative B and more strongly worded.  If we indeed need to move less gradually, I expect that will require language.

projected by the Tealbook, by the third quarter of this GDP growing faster than 3 percent, the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent, inflation tenths or less away from our goal.  In such a scenario, my view of policy would not be a 25 basis point increase every other meeting.  That is, at some no longer moving quite so gradually.  If so, then I am concerned that the into unfamiliar territory, with inflation near, or at, more we will appear to have eliminated concern about the costs of low unemployment If the economic outcomes unfold as year, we will have real and a core appropriate point, it may be necessary to convey that we are we will soon need to develop language consistent with that posture. longer we wait as unemployment declines target, the from our announced symmetric loss function.

If it proves to be the case that the Tealbook or is coming true, monetary policy will need to be more restrictive, and we should If moving every other meeting is perceived as being gradual, would a move more frequently characterized by the term 'gradual'?  Put differently, if we find ourselves well below full employment and at our reflect that assessment.  While we adjustments runs the even my forecast be preparing our language, and thus our path to such actions, for such a possibility.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

provide an important signal for this Committee.  I inversion as a sign of overly aggressive monetary if we get to that point, it will be too late.  So the time to have the debate and watch the 10-year/2-year yield go to 30 or 25 basis think what could happen in that environment is that, for instance, a global shock of cushion there-at least 50 basis points.  I'd like to see 70 basis something I'd want to watch carefully, especially so in the Similarly, I think the yield curve can think the yield curve slope is okay for today, but further flattening through 2018 would be very concerning to me.  I would regard yield curve policy.  But the yield curve and the yield curve slope is now.  If I have it correctly, curve slope is about 50 basis points.  I'm not really interested in seeing it points.  I some kind could easily send long-term rates lower, and you'd end up with an inverted yield curve.  So you want to have some points.  So yield curve flattening is low-inflation environment that we're in today.

this Committee had the idea that there was a tradeoff between recession risk and possibly being able to drive inflation lower.  So the whole era in inflation lower and lower And the Committee actually talked about, 'Well, you know, we'd be taking some Previous incarnations of taking some the '80s, the '90s, and maybe even the 2000s was about trying to get over time.

President Evans has talked about this that either you should be neutral or you should be 'hawkish.'  The idea high, you were still trying to gain credibility, as in the Volcker maintain your target.  We don't that kind for a long time in the U.S. recession risk to keep inflation under control. That tradeoff doesn't exist today.  The whole idea when I was growing up in the area of macroeconomics was was, if inflation was too disinflation, and you were trying to get inflation down to the 2 percent level, and markets were always thinking that you were going to surprise them and not have that today.  We haven't had an inflation experience of economy.  So we don't have that tradeoff today, and it's unnecessary to take that in order

I think the only words that matter in this paragraph are the words is our forward guidance.  Everything else has been put in there today.  I've been keen to get out the idea that the is still below the neutral rate.  As I've been talking about yesterday and today, actually pretty close to the neutral rate-or at least there's a lot of probability that pretty close to the neutral rate-so we should not be saying that we're well below that we would say when we were at zero, but we're not at zero points on the meeting. I think paragraph 4 continues to need fixing.  It's it is 'further gradual increases.'  That in the past and, I think, has very little relevance federal funds rate I think we're we're anymore.

I do think that day is By comparison, a majority of the SEP participants federal funds target by the end of next year, and most have that in 2020.  In this regard, I'm going to mention again what I talked about last moderate overshoot of the long-run neutral rate, I think the expiration forward-guidance language in paragraph 4 of the statement, which states that 'the rate run.'

Importantly, as we saw expectations currently appear to be stubbornly below our 2 percent target.

I continue to support charting a well-telegraphed that this would be reasonable, I think, in view of the boost to demand that we have seen or as being likely, to expect the neutral rate in the medium term to rise above its longer-run to boost the neutral rate over the little imprint on the long-run neutral rate.  And, in fact, that's consistent market measures of the long-run neutral rate.  That would argue for the sentence that says 'the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, in the longer run.'  That's certainly not consistent with think 8 of the 15 participants show their above their longer-run federal funds rate by 2019, and 12 of 15 participants also where the median is by 2020. That brings path to eliminating the forward guidance in paragraph 4, and here I'm in good company, I think. Presidents Bullard, Williams, Mester, Barkin, and probably others have all spoken about morning.  It regard value.  In my baseline projection, I expect current tailwinds medium term but leave with what we see in eliminating below levels that are expected to prevail my medium-term SEP submission, and I'm not alone.

And I'm not suggesting that we're on a [laughter], so just bear with me.  When we studied the accident, it really came was broken in the control room.  The engineers were trying to control the meltdown. You know, in terms of slack, as I was preparing for this engineering school-so, 25 years ago.  I'm going to share with you an analogy-and forgive me, because we learned path toward that down to one gauge that nuclear power plant, doing their jobs appropriately.  But one gauge was broken, and they didn't realize that gauge was broken.  So they kept making other changes, not realizing the gauge was broken, and that's what led to the

that was, we're making many different assessments of our output gap-is the economy overheating?-and our outlook for the labor market.  And my observation over the past two years is, our gauge two years how many Americans have come back into the job market. context of modest nominal wage growth. The reason I thought of outlook for the economy:  the wages, for inflation, and for inflation expectations.  All of those come back to one gauge:  our measure of slack in is broken.  We just don't know how much slack is in the labor market, and I, for one, have been surprised over the past You know, I keep thinking we're close to maximum employment, and then I keep getting surprised.  And yet it's been in a testimony a couple of weeks ago-maybe it was a week ago-you natural rate of unemployment could be as high as 5 percent or as low as 3¬Ω percent, range, expressing the uncertainty that we face.  But a the natural rate, but also in effective unemployment rate today.  Is 4.1 really a meaningful measure in light of representing current slack in the labor market, in a situation of low nominal wage expectations, would we be raising rates now? Mr. Chairman, in your said that the which I thought was an appropriate different way of expressing that uncertainty is not only in terms of what's the people who have left the labor force?  And I think we're overly focused on and influenced by this 4.1 percent number.  If we really thought maybe 5 percent was the right unemployment number growth, modest inflation, and modest inflation Probably not.

labor growth, and that'll more confidence that we're actually, in fact, using up the slack. I've said this before:  If you want to assess supply and demand in a market-the market-we have to look at wages.  And for me, I want to see more wage give me thing is, I don't think I have a better assessment than the rest of you of slack in just think none of us know.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

That said, I also believe we do need to acknowledge that, while our reaction function is broadly the same, the outlook has changed, especially on the fiscal side. Thus, I am supportive of including language that acknowledges for economic activity has improved. mainly to a risks of economic overheating have reason why I now have the federal funds rate path moving above my the federal funds rate in 2019 and 2020.  As I see it, there's a high story will change from removing monetary policy accommodation to having a somewhat restrictive monetary policy stance.

As I see it, the challenge we face is to strike an appropriate balance in our policy between the rate of unemployment.
