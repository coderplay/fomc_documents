I also asked in the System to try to help them guide their good reporters talking to lots and lots are obviously damaging to the reputation and credibility of the everybody, please, to be more careful in the future. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Good afternoon, everybody.  A couple of people asked me about the leak investigation relating to the to remind you of what I wrote review, and, based on their findings, we Michelle to talk to all of the public affairs officers principals and staff in following the rules, and I think that's already been done.  My own sense is that the leaks were probably unintentional.  We have very of people.  But that said, they Committee, so I urge want to ask President Evans and President Williams if they yet.  Not yet?  All right. On a somewhat lighter note, I made the World Series bet

They're better at it than we are. MR. WILLIAMS.  We decided to delegate that to the first vice presidents.  [Laughter] MR. EVANS.

This has to do with our forward you know, we currently have guidance that suggests the to communicate our future policy, and that it would be better if we But the details matter-in particular, the language we Okay.  The first item on our agenda is guidance for the federal funds rate.  As date at which we expect to begin to raise rates.  I think many people around the table agree that that's not the optimal way could do a state-contingent type of policy. use, the choice of indicators, the values, and so on.  So we have asked the staff to prepare a

Such guidance may make it more likely that an amount consistent with the Committee's view regarding the about the Committee's In replacing or threshold values of inflation and unemployment that would need to be policymakers would consider increasing the federal funds rate target.  As outlined in the top panel of the first guidance could lead market participants to focus than the conditionality of the outlook for the funds rate target and so leave the impression that the Committee has committed to a specific time-dependent policy. By contrast, quantitative thresholds could increase the clarity of the Committee's intentions and improve market participants' understanding of the monetary reaction function.  In particular, thresholds could enable market participants to obtain a better understanding of changes in the economic market responses to economic developments would move longer-term interest rates in a direction and by likely future path of short-term rates.  Enhanced clarity intentions might also reduce uncertainty about the future stance of policy.  In both ways, thresholds could therefore contribute to improved macroeconomic performance.

review the date to verify that it is still appropriate-a contentious because participants have different views about the and to do so in a way that needs to be reviewed only to time. As indicated by the second bullet, the adoption of thresholds could also facilitate the Committee's deliberations.  With the current date-based forward guidance, the Committee must regularly review that can be economic outlook and about the appropriate date for the onset of policy firming.  In principle, thresholds could allow participants with different outlooks to agree on the statement's forward guidance from time might provide additional change market expectations for the future path rate, both with regard to the date when policy would begin to firm of tightening. Finally, the announcement of a thresholds strategy policy stimulus if it were to materially of the federal funds and the subsequent pace

However, if the Committee were to green lines, in which firming begins would be postponed by a year, resulting in assume that market expectations are currently in line with this baseline forecast.  We then assume that the FOMC credibly promises to keep the funds long as the unemployment rate is above 6½ percent and inflation is projected to remain below 2½ percent, but once either threshold is crossed, it will follow the prescriptions of the outcome-based rule.  As shown by the red lines, because this strategy implies essentially the same path for the almost no effect on real announce the more aggressive threshold strategy, denoted by the the unemployment threshold is 5½ percent and the inflation threshold is 3 percent, then the date when policy lower unemployment and higher inflation.

As can be seen, this strategy does about aggressive threshold strategy in providing additional policy The blue lines illustrate a somewhat different point-that forward guidance about the Committee's strategy for the pace of tightening important effect on the economy.  Here, the Committee announces the same moderate threshold settings of 6½ percent were implicit in the red lines, but also credibly promises to tighten more slowly than market participants initially anticipate by an inertial version of the as well as the more stimulus.

First, the model simulations that the Committee could use thresholds to help clarify its communications without compromising macroeconomic performance.  In particular, using projected inflation and unemployment thresholds to guide the return to a 'normal' policy setting-as approximated by having policy rule under a variety of economic conditions.  Second, the model simulations suggest that the use of thresholds could improve expected macroeconomic performance-subject to the caveat that thresholds can be set too aggressively.

I should note that we explored the effects of more reported in the memo, and that one of these followed President Kocherlakota's proposal to set the unemployment threshold at 5½ percent at 2½ percent.  Although we found that these settings worked well in many circumstances, we ran into technical obstacles in solving the model with them in our stochastic simulations and so did not include this

conclusions First, because the amount of slack in labor markets is uncertain, reliance on a risk that the Committee could keep policy to if it had full information about funds rate, and the use greatly.  Moreover, the consequences of such error would probably be modest provided that inflation expectations anchored and the Committee corrected its error once it saw We also investigated some issues that arise when thresholds are defined in terms of the unemployment rate and projected inflation, where two important emerged. an unemployment threshold creates persistently easier or tighter than it would choose the economy.

A third challenge arises because the thresholds would a threshold strategy would describe Committee draws on a wide range memo provided possible statement your handout. We also considered some of the communications challenges that would likely be associated with using One challenge is that it's difficult to formulate a threshold for inflation in terms of the realized headline inflation rate because headline inflation is volatile and often buffeted by significant but transitory shocks, particularly from oil and other commodity prices.  A second challenge is that the current financial and economic conditions depends at least as much on market participants' expectations for policy after the onset of policy firming as on the expected start date of likely differ from the Committee's longer-run objectives and market participants may not understand the distinction.  Finally, the use of monetary policy in terms of two variables, but the of indicators when setting monetary policy.  Our language that would address some of these communications challenges.  That language is reproduced on exhibit 3 of remarks.  I glad to take any questions that you have. The last page of the handout provides the questions for discussion that were distributed to you last week, which you may want to refer to in your would now be

you very much.  Are there any questions for the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank staff?  President Bullard.

'Federal Funds 1.  The green here, the outcome-based rule, has the liftoff date in the MR. BULLARD.  Yes.  Thanks for the presentation.  I'm looking at the Rate' picture on exhibit

October 23-24, 2012

I'm reading this correctly.  I think the relevant comparison would be versus the Committee just saying that instead of mid-2015, the date is the second quarter of 2016.  Then would I get the same green lines here that you're second quarter of 2016, if this particular threshold going to be showing?

are following the same rules.  So if you just MR. ENGEN.  In the model, whether it's an announced date or whether it's the thresholds, the public takes that as credible and they shifted the date, you would get very similar results.

We often talk about thresholds as if the state-contingent policy is really, in the model, it's MR. BULLARD. going to give us something different than the date-contingent policy, but the same thing.

In the model here, we're has the same outlook for economic conditions and fully understands is.  Providing the conditions that we expect to see at the time of liftoff for the public exactly what those conditions are. MR. ENGEN.  Well, would those thresholds help clarify that? assuming that the public what the intent of policy may help clarify

I'm wrong, but the date-contingent policy and the answer in a nonstochastic environment, correct? MR. WILCOX.  Correct me if thresholds will give exactly the same MR. ENGEN.  Yes.

if the date-contingent statement is a binding commitment, they'll MR. WILCOX.  But give different results in a stochastic simulation.

date-contingent policy would not move. MR. BULLARD.  Well, in a stochastic simulation, the date, for instance, might move earlier because the data come in more positively, but a And according to the model, that would actually be more accommodative than the statecontingent policy.

October 23-24, 2012

ENGEN.  If you had the dates always moving exactly where the thresholds were and would behave the same in the deterministic or the MR the public understood that, then yes, they stochastic environment.

MR. BULLARD.  Okay.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Other questions?  President Plosser.

you do them, the triggered, policy would then reached.  Is that MR. PLOSSER.  Just a technical question.  On the simulations as assumption appears to be that once these thresholds are in fact revert to the outcome-based rule or something upon the reaching of the threshold.  So the presumption is that the Committee will in fact act when those thresholds are correct?

I just want to clarify.  It is definitely the case that once one of the is crossed-or if both of them are crossed simultaneously-policy moves to, say, the of the different policy settings for crossings than there it would stay there until the prescription of the rule had it starting to rise. MR. ENGEN.  Well, thresholds outcome-based rule.  That doesn't necessarily mean that the federal funds rate starts to rise.  And indeed, in some of the simulations that we did, particularly in the stochastic setting, you can see that there's a much wider range across all is for actually having the federal funds rate start to rise.  So it's not the case that, immediately after crossing a threshold, it is assumed that the federal funds rate has to start rising.  If the prescription of the rule is such that it would say, 'Still keep the funds rate at approximately zero,'

MR. PLOSSER.  Okay.

the funds rate. MR. ENGEN.  So it's not a trigger in the sense of you are switching regimes at that point. MR. PLOSSER.  No, I understand.  But

policy rule, yes. MR. ENGEN.  It switches from the threshold to a

with Governor CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Seeing no more questions, let's start Tarullo.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I apologize in advance for the length of my my comments in the brief.  I'll actually trust Betsy to keep me under two minutes on each several. MR. TARULLO.  Thank comments on this subject.  So I'll balance my interventions off by keeping next three go-rounds very of the next a matter of textbook monetary policy and, on the other a practical choice about whether to substitute specific thresholds for the specific to be a very than the use of a date.  This approach makes clear that the conditional on economic developments.  The use of thresholds also obviates that the Committee associates with conditions that will prevail on the date able to infer our reaction function.  Finally, but not the appropriate date for Pareto-type gain here-that is, if we all accommodation achieved by the mid-2015 date, conditions I think we need to distinguish here between, on the one hand, making the abstract choice between thresholds and future dates as hand, making mid-2015 date that's already in our statement.  As an abstract matter, there seems good case for the use of thresholds, which, whatever their imperfections and shortcomings, define our reaction function better forward guidance is the need, for those observers who do understand that the date is conditional, to try to deduce the economic thresholds identified in the forward guidance so as to be least, the approach would mercifully spare us the need to revisit the issue of regularly.  In fact, there looks to be the opportunity agree on the superiority of thresholds as an abstract matter, we should be willing to substitute thresholds that leave unchanged the amount of based on our current knowledge and expectations.  Most, if not all, of the problems and issues that may be raised by the use of thresholds, such as whether or how to specify the under which the Committee might deviate, will also be present in some form where a date is used

guidance.  Similarly, the question of how much we would be committed to the already extant question of how much we're committed to the date. for forward thresholds is paralleled by particular circumstances in which we find ourselves, we should conditionality of the forward guidance in both directions and of well.  Let me begin by when we first discussed this issue.  Each still has merit, I think each has become weaker than it seemed to me a year ago.  First is the potential for not themselves policy targets.  This potential that the threshold idea and also by the fact that we're further away from the this year.  The risk of confusion can be further mitigated as appropriate, and most importantly, through Second was my hope that a good bit of what with targets and with been As to whether, given the substitute thresholds for the mid-2015 date, I think the answer is less straightforward.  The basic advantages of underscoring the better communicating the likely parameters of that conditionality are, of course, still good reasons to do so.  But there are considerations on the other side as mentioning two that I suggested last year but sowing confusion by putting out numbers that are does still seem present, but I think it's been reduced somewhat by the fact has been kicking around for a while now publication of the inflation target earlier through publication of minutes, through speeches the Chairman's explanation at a press conference. might be achieved with thresholds could also be achieved through a modified SEP or, conceivably, a consensus forecast, with less risk of confusing thresholds less need to haggle over the phraseology of our conditionality.  Those hopes have somewhat dashed, though I think there's still some prospect of improving the SEP enough to serve a useful supporting role in forward guidance.

the use of a date allows some ambiguity, whereas the A third consideration is that threshold numbers are, by design, quite stark.  Some Committee members who went along with the date might disagree on the appropriate numbers.  Similarly, some may be uncomfortable with

October 23-24, 2012

that they will be the dominant a working consensus within the some credibility. thresholds precisely because their use strongly suggests considerations in the Committee's decision, effectively excluding other considerations.  That is, the inferiority of the date relative to thresholds for purposes of communicating clearly with the public may be an advantage in the practical task of forging Committee or in preserving flexibility to react to developments other than the passing of the thresholds without the Committee thereby losing first question, I don't believe we should decide in not we want thresholds, and then turn to defining what they might be.  I thresholds of 6.5 percent unemployment and I actually believe that, at least under the current expectations and analysis reflected in 6 percent-could increase accommodation, with the mid-2015 date, without any change in the inflation number.  And even if a conceivably belowus currently think is the case, the inflation number should guard against as we got closer to the actual NAIRU.  Of course, if we put complete faith in the and current projections, we could push the unemployment number down below what of us believes will be the NAIRU over the coming couple of years, and that we project will prevail.  But because predict, my instinct is not to try to cut things And so, at long last, to answer the general terms whether or would support the proposal in one of the unadopted alternative policy statements from the September meeting-that is to say, substituting the 2.5 percent projected inflation for the mid-2015 date, thresholds that the staff memo explains to be roughly consistent with the accommodation provided by the inclusion of that date in our statement. the memo, a lower unemployment number-say, compared lower unemployment number were eventually shown to be closer to-or the NAIRU than most of an overshoot in accommodation because presumably inflation projections would be rising appreciably models even the most optimistic push the inflation number down closer to the levels things usually don't quite turn out the way models

October 23-24, 2012

ago.  Indeed, the potential, maybe even too closely, and I just incorporate by reference here what was in the staff memo and what Eric reemphasized in his presentation a few minutes likelihood, of unanticipated developments is a strong reason to move from a date to thresholds.

would hope that those who supported the mid-2015 date could agree on these also think there's something in this change for those who oppose the date, whether advised to use a date at all, or you think the mid-2015 date is too accommodative, that's where we are I don't think the communication gains from this shift would be worth any removal would oppose any unemployment number higher than 6½ percent or enough colleagues conclude that they can't go along with these I suggested earlier or for other reasons and thus we can't get I thresholds.  I on grounds that it was too much accommodation, that it was ill both.  That is, even if now, and the shift to the thresholds would make the conditionality of our policy much more explicit.  But of accommodation.  So I any lower inflation number.  If numbers, either for the reasons agreement on them, I'd rather stick with the date, awkward as it is.

So I would make the change a clean substitute. 2.b., I favor using an inflation projection, and I think it's got to be our own-either the tendency or a staff projection.  I believe it would be unwise to give private In the crisis, Blue Chip forecasters have generally predicted higher inflation in about equal case that we've been systematically biased As to the other questions identified for FOMC discussion in the staff memo, I some quick answers.  On 2.a., I think the potential for misunderstanding would be significant if we retained the date On FOMC central forecasters, even in the aggregate, this kind of influence over monetary policy.  There's at least some chance that their forecasts would be affected by the knowledge of this influence. years since the financial than our central tendency, but their projections and ours have proven right proportions.  So I don't think anyone can make the

Obviously, if there were an extended period during which private inflation forecasts were well above our central tendency, we'd need to divergence.  As to both questions 2.c. and 2.d., I would think the Committee would want to pursue ideas along the lines of the suggestions in the staff memo, though I these issues are also with us in the use of the mid-2015 date to reject the threshold approach.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

a you on the inclusion of so many stochastic simulations.  I think they're really to think clearly about this.  The memo also does a good job of summarizing the guidance in the statement and the funds rate MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  First, my compliments to the staff for good, thorough analysis of the issues involved in setting numerical thresholds; I particularly compliment essential for us problems that we now have with our current, calendar-based forward guidance.  Perhaps the key issue is the perceived dissonance between policy forecasts in the Summary of Economic Projections.  Tomorrow we'll discuss the idea of eliminating the dissonance by developing a consensus forecast to replace the SEP.

[Laughter]  One might add that the consensus on the natural rate of unemployment, the the reaction function, and a host of other things to a forecast.  Today, though, we're discussing an alternative approach to eliminating Instead of replacing the SEP, replace the calendar date with numerical The staff's memo on the something of an impasse.  The memo stated the reason with admirable candor:  'The Committee does not currently reach a consensus on the get the award for understatement in staff Committee doesn't currently reach a monetary policy transmission mechanism, relevant this dissonance:

that this effort will also reach an impasse, or should, for the same reasons at a zero lower bound, so one liftoff is about the most rule, so it's going to be the one that's the hardest to agree on. thresholds.  I predict the consensus forecast has-namely, failure to reach a consensus on a monetary policy reaction function.  Thresholds are just one implication of a policy rule might think it would be easier to obtain a consensus on thresholds than on an entire policy rule. But in current circumstances, the level of the unemployment rate at critical feature of the policy consensus on the thresholds is clearly evident in figure 5 of rates.  And at the date of liftoff, there are different calendar year in which liftoff is most likely, and they disagree just as much In fact, the two seem to go hand who forecast a later liftoff also forecast that liftoff will take place at a In contrast, participants appear to agree that inflation will be near regarding an assertion in the staff presentation, the reaction function. as if we have very similar forecasts and just pick different times along that path at which we rates.  So I don't think it's a matter of differing The difficulty of obtaining a the September SEP packet that was distributed.  This is the scatterplot that shows participants' forecasts of inflation rates and unemployment symbols:  triangles, squares, dots, and the like-some colored, some not.

So, just as an aside, disagreement is clearly less about the economic forecast than it is about the It's view it as appropriate to lift off and begin raising outlooks.  I think it's a matter of differing reaction functions.

another problem with the calendarguidance as a noncontingent commitment.  Governor Tarullo talked about with the calendar-based guidance is that moving the date in-that is, Numerical thresholds are also designed to remedy based forward-guidance language, which is that some market participants might still be misinterpreting our this.  A related problem

In contrast, the automatic guidance was based on economic conditions would not action and thus would presumably involve less drama. toward the present-is a adjustment even if economic conditions would justify it.  This was evident Mr. Chairman, when I believe which suggests a perceived danger that market participants would extrapolate and expect rate increases just around the adjustment that would take place if require our positive

I've been saying guidance by 'the Committee low levels of the federal funds rate until it sees a substantial or 'substantial ongoing improvement in the labor I think it makes eminent sense to move away from the calendar date; that for some time.  And I think it would make sense to move toward providing saying more about the economic conditions under which we envision lifting off.  But I think it would be much better to do so by adopting qualitative language rather than specific numerical thresholds for the unemployment rate.  For example, we could say that anticipates exceptionally improvement in labor market conditions' market'-add your central bank adjectives-subject to the usual provisions about inflation and expectations.

would avoid several pitfalls associated with adopting numerical an implication of this is that growth might pick up rapidly in response to an increase in employment growth, or it we need to recognize about that.  On the other Qualitative language thresholds.  For one, adopting a numerical threshold based on the unemployment rate places a great deal of weight on our understanding of labor force participation.  This seems particularly difficult to forecast right now because it's not clear how much of the decline in participation since the recession is cyclical and how much is trend.  In particular, labor force might not.  I think there's a substantial uncertainty

October 23-24, 2012

rate could fall without a substantial increase in employment growth because of increased net flow from unemployment to nonparticipation.  A broader assessing labor market a getting boxed in if that particular hand, the unemployment simply principle here is that in practice, we consider a wide range of indicators in conditions.  In fact, we said exactly that in our January consensus statement-that we consider wide range of indicators in assessing labor market conditions.  Adopting a numerical threshold based on just one statistic opens us up to a significant risk of indicator goes astray.  Guidance based on qualitative characterization of the conditions under which we would lift off, I think, provides benefits and avoids the pitfalls.  And, in addition, it would be much easier to build a consensus on qualitative language than it would be to build one on specific numerical thresholds.

also believe that the broader optics of what we were doing in the statement deserve concern the potentially confusing reference to price stability in the fourth year talking about inflation and unemployment in debating the statement.  We wrangled over that for months, and we agreed that it made sense to and would for the Committee to write down a numerical figure for the unemployment rate, I consideration here.  In September, we tilted our statement toward significantly more about unemployment.  In comparison, the provisos regarding inflation seem perfunctory, like boilerplate, especially in paragraph.  We spent much of last consensus write down a numerical objective for inflation.  We agreed that it did not make sense be misleading and we are considering doing just that.  I don't see how to reconcile the language of the consensus statement with the use of numerical thresholds in the statement, and to me, it seems like more of a repudiation of the January statement to do so.  So I oppose numerical thresholds, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you very much.

Lacker, because I rate was, say, above 6½ percent. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thanks.  I had a question for President think this issue about labor force participation has come up before when we talked about thresholds.  So I'd be interested in what conditions about labor force participation would lead you to want to raise rates even though the unemployment

the threshold was 6½, as Governor that would lead us to want to raise rates at that time? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Above 6½.  Suppose Tarullo talked about.  You're positing that labor force participation is growing rapidly.  What would be the conditions

LACKER. In the staff memo, figure 2 shows the performance of a threshold stronger demand, the baseline.  Real GDP growth varies substantially.  The federal funds rate In the stronger-demand case, it's 4 percent in late 2015; in the baseline, across the scenarios.  Well, what if labor more elastic with regard to employment growth than depicted by these demand conditions could be orthogonal.  It could be very That's the kind of thing I have in mind, President MR. strategy in the face of unanticipated shocks to aggregate demand.  There's weaker demand, and path varies substantially. it begins to rise in 2015; and in the weaker-demand case, it doesn't rise until the first quarter of 2017.  The civilian unemployment rate is very different force participation is far simulations?  If that's true, the unemployment rate might not vary much at all across these scenarios in the limit-it's conceivable-in which case we'd have different but virtually the same unemployment rate, and we might need a 4 percent funds rate in late 2015, or we might need to wait until 2017-we don't know.  It independent of what rate we want. Kocherlakota.

LACKER. This turns on the question of the relationship between labor force those very closely.  There's a lot of literature I don't think the standard models on which a They talk about output about the interaction of inflation and output for nonneutrality in the standard models these days, links it to going to be linked to real output and growth.  That suggests that the to employment growth, not on what happens to variation in labor see? MR. participation and capacity.  And you could identify that talks about the permeability of that boundary. New Keynesian Phillips curve is built say much about that margin at all. growth and inflation.  They talk about marginal cost, which is going to depend on employment, not on the supply of labor.  So what we know growth, and the possibility marginal cost, and that's reaction function should depend on what happens unemployment, at least if unemployment can be influenced independently by force participation.  You

The consensus statement is about long-run monetary neutrality.  It's short-run monetary policy the unemployment rate in the long run.  So I don't think that's inconsistent.  President Evans.

I'm sorry, I'm not sure I followed the interchange here very well, so if I I would think about this.  The concern that I would have thought us toward was, if we find ourselves with a threshold that is inappropriate MR. EVANS. could express it the way that you were trying to point

Well, the inflation safeguard is there to protect us against that.  So if we're not generating a lot of inflationary pressures, I'm not quite sure you shake

This is the broader point we've talked about before on this topic, about the role of the inflation escape clause. possess the property that policy authority's target.  Always.  Probability 1.  Very definitely.  These thresholds sound like, 'Well, we're goes and see that happen.  Ideally, you want to run a policy that maintains price stability, not one that lets it drift around.

We've I do find great difficulty in coming down to specifics, and I while I've been I've also been reading a book by Ken Follett called World. choices and then had that great line from that book-which is about 700 pages into that long book-where writes about a character who's Harvard educated, by the way.  He says, 'Scientists who is Harvard educated-'knew from Harvard:  for them was reality, and the world a rather inaccurate model.'  So I'm trying to think of the realBoard memo is really very well crafted, and I do understand-and I've made my best efforts state-of-the-art I come back to, what would be the realGovernor Tarullo, I economy and policy short.  I'm going to take a MR. FISHER.  I I talked about this for a long time.  But like the recommendation of qualitative, state-contingent statements.

I think the work done by the staff in the exceptionally good.  It's to understand-the theoretical and state-of-the-art model, which is what it is, or argument, for having these specific thresholds.  But world requirements, and what would be the complexities?  So, again, like promise to keep my subsequent comments on the little bit of time here.

Now, to be real world, it seems to me to make some sense that we emphasize, if we go down this path, our commitment to price stability.  And in this exercise, this would mean setting

October 23-24, 2012

inflation.  I think as a useful threshold We'd have to be prepared to defend our inflation forecasts.  I do not like the idea of is that Blue Chip forecasters have never been certainly when looking forward for long time periods.  I think the go down this path, could be realized and wrapped around core inflation.  Or, as from Dallas, I would prefer trimmed mean inflation.  I find that trimmed mean categories of goods and easy to sell rule-of-thumb forecast of well anchored.  That the concerns that we might have about broaching the 2½ percent since I would also say that, so as not to scare the real world, 'Once it begins the process of the stance of monetary policy, the Committee expects to proceed at a gradual pace.' a threshold for projected headline inflation rather than for realized headline realized headline inflation contains too much short-term noise to serve variable. relying on private forecasters.  My sense of history very accurate for long, threshold, if we you know, being inflation, because it doesn't automatically throw out any particular services, has less of a public relations problem than core inflation.  I find it very when I explain it to people.  It's more real world, and it's also a better headline inflation.  Now, to reassure the real world, I think we'd have to include a specific, separate requirement that longer-term inflation expectations continue to be would deal with some of we're throwing a new number in there.  And we would also possibly have to include an escape clause related to financial conditions. we'd have to signal that policy would not move sharply back to business as usual, even after rate hikes commence, probably by including a phrase like this: normalizing This is, I think, referred to in footnote 32 of the Board memo.

I come back to the real world.  I think we have to take time in evaluating this project. one, is still being evaluated.  We don't it is yet.  We have to take account of the fact that the economic environment is are tormented, and uncertainty is rampant and is hampering But The impact of our QE exercises, and particularly the last really know what very unsettled, fiscal demons

And even though we've made improvements, I think we have to acknowledge that our public image and the support we have-not unimportantly, in the among have to be extremely careful in how we reflect this discussion in the minutes and how far we're willing to go, having done so much and having changed the way we do business so much-and, historically speaking, rather quickly.

market, we need to keep in mind that the labor market is being forces and shocks that cause unemployment to fluctuate.  I would think of this, but there are other aspects of that I don't think it's appropriate for monetary policy to try to affect.  It's still not or the degree to which it's cyclical.  To the it's cyclical, I would think that monetary policy would be an appropriate or more whatever it may be-I would think that it would be beyond our control. great deal less control.  So, to go back to Lacker's statement and qualification, I would almost want it to say, in terms of the 'substantial Another thing I would would we unannounce a threshold target if unemployment data show And I think that's With regard to the labor constantly buffeted by that monetary policy might be able to affect some unemployment clear to me-and I'm not sure it's clear to us, even though I've heard arguments on both sidesthe degree to which unemployment is structural degree that appropriate tool to apply.  And to the degree that it's structural-say, dependent on fiscal policy or education policy or We might help condition it, but we would have a President nonquantified expression that we would look for, that we would look for improvement in labor markets that can be affected by monetary policy.' want to consider is, how that the natural rate of unemployment that we assumed, is actually higher? something that we need to contemplate.

October 23-24, 2012

first question is, 'Do you think it would be beneficial to on the funds rate using numerical thresholds?' are some subquestions.  Again, come back to the fact that the real issue here-as, I think, you stated in your presentation and as convinced me that a modified SEPa better vehicle for conveying our about the likely date and conditions of liftoff.  I plan to talk a little bit the second subquestionreference?'-I think it's critical that we have a proviso In terms of the third subquestion, 'In I like the qualifying 'if at all'-'should the language indicate that the any thresholds are crossed?'  Again, the requirement for be well anchored is essential.  It also may be appropriate to abandoned if the Committee senses a threat to financial figuring out an escape clause is important.  And yet, when you try to you get into very complicated language, which I think, in and of itself, whole exercise may not be conceptually sound. With regard to the questions, the express the Committee's forward guidance Obviously, my answer is no.  And then the second one begins, 'If the Committee were to incorporate such thresholds into the forward guidance,' and there I we all know-is what happens after liftoff.  My staff has even though it's difficult, Governor Tarullo-is probably participants' thinking about that in less than two minutes tomorrow.  Again, with regard to 'What variables should the thresholds that we would make whatever decision we make under the conditions and understanding that longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored. what way'-and Committee may tighten policy before longer-term inflation expectations to signal that the threshold system could be stability.  So somehow figure out how to do that, is a strong signal that the guess those are my comments, Mr. Chairman.  Those are observations.  In general, I don't like the date-contingent guidance and would like to go for state contingency, on this is, I think, a difficult exercise, as President Plosser argued from I don't believe it's timely.  I I much as putting specific numbers the very beginning and as others, including myself, also argued.

However, I did not find the analysis I see as a thicket of difficulties with MR. BULLARD.  Thank help indicate the likely conditions under which policy firming may take place.  Qualitative thresholds are versions of what we have now.  On the employment side, we say that we observe sustained improvement in labor market conditions.  On the inflation side, we stress that everything we do is in the context of price stability. idea that the Committee intends to maintain an exceptionally accommodative policy future.  I think we quantitative approach, by contrast, raises addressed. this issue here at this table over the last two years there very compelling.  The memo downplayed what quantitative thresholds.  I think these difficulties may haunt the Committee into the distant future without providing any additional benefits today.  Most of the problem is that communication

October 23-24, 2012

would be in fact muddled, instead of clarified, with the adoption of quantitative thresholds.  Let me discuss five key communications hazards with quantitative thresholds.

I think that are five communications hazards. of the literature is that there are no completely monetary policy.  If hysteresis occurs in the for EMU unemployment would have kept ECB monetary existence of the European Central Bank-from 1998 argument is that it would be prudent for the Committee to talk about labor way in order to respect the fact that we know very little about the real For each of these communications hazards, I will describe reasons why qualitative thresholds avoid the communications problems but provide all of the benefits to the extent that they can be obtained through this channel.  So here Communication hazard number 1:  Hysteresis in unemployment is a known problem in industrialized countries.  European unemployment went to high levels in the 1980s and never really dropped back down to lower levels.  The phrase 'structural labor market reforms' became part of the EU policymaking lexicon.  My reading satisfactory theories of the nature of the hysteresis problem.  The theories that do exist emphasize real factors and subpar labor market policies, not United States and we have tied monetary policy numerically to the unemployment rate, we will have two problems, not one.  We will have a labor market that is not functioning in a satisfactory way and a monetary policy being pulled badly off course by poor labor market outcomes.  In Europe, a threshold of 6.5 percent policy on hold for the entire period of the until the present.  My markets in a qualitative factors driving the hysteresis problem in industrialized countries.

or might not be decided once a threshold is course, the Committee does not have to act at that point.  But if no action is will rightly wonder why that particular threshold was chosen versus Communication hazard number 2:  Thresholds will be interpreted as triggers.  The staff memo goes to some length to describe what might encountered.  Of taken, the private sector

October 23-24, 2012

I thought the staff discussion in the memo was telling on this dimension, as it is in attach to the possibility of some action being taken by the FOMC change the probability.  Of course, if policy will already have occurred, regardless of what the It's possible and conceivable that the Committee would be able to convince markets that no action whatsoever will be taken once the threshold is probability of FOMC action is still zero, even though the threshold has opinion, would have no meaning at all, because in that case actually has some other, more true, more distant threshold FOMC action.  If that is the avoided by simply talking qualitatively about sustained improvement in labor markets in way to run monetary some other numerical value that better reflected the Committee's intention to act if the threshold was crossed. fact very difficult to simultaneously draw a line in the sand and then, once that line is crossed, maintain the position that policy action is not required.  At a minimum, financial markets would change the probability they once a threshold was encountered.  They would surely markets change the probability of Committee action, that change in the probability will be priced into markets and the tightening of Committee says at that point. completely crossed-that is, that the been encountered.  But then the threshold, in my the Committee evidently in mind that would lead to a significant change in the probability of case, why didn't the Committee just name the true threshold in the first place?  Again, all of this can be the context of price stability.  We can then prepare markets when we are good and ready to prepare markets and the time comes to respond to either one of the qualitative triggers.  Absent this preparation, markets would expect no action from the FOMC.  This would give, in my opinion, the FOMC tremendous latitude.  This seems like a more desirable policy.

Communication hazard number 3:  The thresholds will be interpreted as an unemployment target and a deviation from the Committee's announced inflation target.  This

October 23-24, 2012

case.  I think this may badly damage our credibility, because we just year.  In our announcement, we essentially cited central bank cannot influence labor market outcomes in the medium and run.  Adopting numerical thresholds would raise many difficult-to-answer questions on opinion, without any will almost surely be the announced our inflation target earlier this textbook macroeconomics in saying we did not think it was appropriate to set an employment target, because the longer this issue.  Prudence suggests simply sidestepping this debate altogether by referring to our thresholds for action in a qualitative way-again, all of the benefits, in my of the costs.

approach to the dual mandate.  Saying that the unemployment trigger is forecast that puts weight on output gaps, is not my idea of balance.  The approach should two sides symmetrically-either both as forecasts or both as observations.  Trying to use again, all of this could be avoided by simply describing the thresholds say in our qualitative Communication hazard number 4:  Quantitative thresholds, as often discussed, do not represent a balanced based on observed unemployment, while the inflation trigger is based on a heavy and questionable treat the observed core inflation as the metric for the inflation threshold has its own problems, as detailed in the staff memo.  But qualitatively.  I do not think that there is much doubt that we mean what we approach.  The thresholds for action are clearly in the distant future, and the Chairman can prepare markets should one of the qualitative thresholds be near.

indicator of labor market performance is in on the level of unemployment.  The labor force participation rate, which Communication hazard number 5:  The unemployment threshold suggests that the Committee is unconcerned, possibly, about aspects of poor labor market performance outside of the unemployment rate.  The Committee's own key fact not the unemployment rate but the nonfarm payroll employment number, yet the trigger is often stated as a marker

Committee members often cite statistics regarding broader measures of unemployment-unemployment in specific sectors, hours worked, temporary workers, and so on.  What we really market.  Ideally, the Committee could design an index of labor market performance, taking into account all of these dimensions, and set a threshold for that index.

I am well aware that no one we are progressing against our a numerical threshold merely provides guidance on when we will discuss of data is consistent with taking a new action.  Thus, if there are a MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I've been supportive of using numerical economic outcomes to set thresholds rather than continuing to use amounts when discussing asset purchases or variable can proxy for labor market conditions or, for that matter, the underlying rate of inflation. In reality, we look at a broad array of data when evaluating how dual mandate.  This would be a problem if we were choosing a single variable to trigger action. However, providing whether the broader array variety of sometimes conflicting measures of inflation and labor market conditions, that's not a reason to avoid adopting thresholds.

I view numerical thresholds as being useful for two reasons.  First, they provide a simple communication to the public tied to economic outcomes.  We will not take action to reverse our

October 23-24, 2012

threshold.  So if there is a negative shock, monetary policy can be offset by participants' to communicate does not need to be precise.  We are committing path to achieve our dual mandate within an policies until we reach a automatically becomes more accommodative as the date for ending asset purchases or reaching liftoff is pushed further in the future.  Second, qualitative measures communications, which, at times, may make our actions less effective.  A quantitative threshold provides a clear indication that there is a consensus among voters that tightening will not begin at least until the threshold is attained.  To be effective, a threshold must be simple and observable to the public.  Unlike a trigger, it only to postpone action until the threshold is met and, at that time, to begin a discussion of whether taking action is consistent with the acceptable time frame.

a because we are setting a threshold, not a I am comfortable with that degree of imprecision.  I would use an unemployment rate of market conditions had improved a term not well defined in qualitative terms for the public or, for that matter, for an unemployment rate of 6½ percent to begin a discussion of a potential For a proxy of labor market conditions, I would use the unemployment rate.  It is variable widely understood by the public.  At times, the unemployment rate can fall for reasons other than improvements in labor market conditions, but trigger, 7¼ percent to begin a discussion of whether labor 'substantially,' ourselves.  I would use liftoff of short-term rates.

a target tied to the PCE inflation rate, so the threshold variable about the SEP and consensus forecasts will be discussed later in the meeting.  In regularly disclosed PCE inflation forecast, I would use the four-quarter moving For inflation, we have should be the same as our target variable.  If we had a median PCE inflation forecast in the medium term that was publicly available at each meeting, that could be a potential threshold. What we decide the absence of a

October 23-24, 2012

actual PCE inflation and an inflation threshold of 3 percent.  The four-quarter moving average of average smooths the series to reflect the supply shocks that have occurred with some regularity, and the 3 percent threshold reflects that even this threshold is crossed in the historical data around times of significant supply shocks.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lockhart.

already, but I will go through some thoughts anyway.  I haven't been a great fan of date guidance is hard to adjust with changing conditions, and great pains to describe it as conditional, the date is taken as a commitment at the risk of diluting their influence on economic conditions. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Quite a number of my points have been made guidance for a number of reasons.  Date although we went to or promise by much of the public.  In principle, I think expressing forward guidance in the form of economic conditionality ought to be preferable, but on consideration, I've concluded that specific numerical thresholds taken alone might not improve the clarity and effectiveness of our communications.  So I'm going to advocate for thresholds that are pretty substantially qualified, even especially skeptical of a single numerical threshold for the unemployment situation. economic LSAP, the Chairman emphasized that LSAP program would be based of indicators that collectively present a full I'm In my view, the unemployment rate is not a sufficient statistic for describing the conditionality we ought to have in mind.  The Chairman put some emphasis on this point in his last press conference.  In response to a question on the new the decision process for continuing, adjusting, or halting the new not on a single market metric, but rather an array

October 23-24, 2012

conditions and prospects, and that the decision would involve a you, Mr. Chairman, but that's my you said.  I'm not sure I understand why this holistic approach to the rate I think it's would have to be accompanied by substantial qualification that, in practice, the and, unemployment rate should not be taken as decisive.  I have similar about the risk of conveying simplistic and potentially misleading specificity around a advocate full substitution of single numerical guidance. picture of labor market qualitative judgment in the end.  I don't want to speak for interpretation of what conditionality that will guide our asset purchase decisions should not also guide our policy decisions.  If the Committee chooses to adopt a numerical threshold for employment, likely that the threshold we introduce to the effect that the unemployment rate is just one of several indicators; Committee will synthesize a view from an evaluation of a dashboard of relevant data; therefore, that the single concerns single inflation metric.  However, I don't feel so strongly on this side of the threshold question because there's been a lot of public education explaining that we look at a variety of inflation numbers to discern the trend.  So I do not thresholds for the current practice of date the questions:  'Should the thresholds replace the date-based The public has become accustomed to the date-based guidance.  Keeping the a little confusion.  Because the date currently projected is far in the guidance when the economy has evolved further. Now, to answer some of guidance or be combined with the date-based guidance?'  On balance, I favor a combined approach, repeated routinely for a while, at least until conditions are such that we would want to change the date. date-based guidance provides more information, even if it may dilute somewhat the primacy of the thresholds and create future, it might make sense to use this combined approach for some time and then later drop the date

October 23-24, 2012

by someone earlier, President Bullard, but I don't believe it's a good idea to specify an unemployment threshold an inflation threshold solely in terms of a treatment is desirable in order to preserve a sense of a balanced explaining that the threshold both I think it's possible to combine both backward looking and unemployment threshold of and a ½ percent tolerance above the inflation objective, if sufficiently qualified as I 'What variables should the thresholds reference?  Regarding inflation, should the thresholds reference actual inflation or a projection?'  I think this was said by in terms of a realized value while expressing projection.  Symmetrical approach.  And I think it's possible to craft language acknowledges realized values and places weight on the outlook for each threshold indicator.  For example, focusing on inflation, the statement might read something like this:  '. . . provided that realized inflation as indicated by the 12-month change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, taken together with the Committee's projection of inflation at a oneto two-year horizon, does not deviate by more than ½ percentage point above the Committee's 2 percent objective and longer-term inflation expectations continue to be well anchored.'  I realize that that's a mouthful, but forward looking in one statement.  I'm comfortable with an 6½ percent said earlier.

at all, should the language indicate that the any thresholds are crossed?'  I favor explicitly enough included in the statement. There is a question of, 'In what way, if Committee may tighten policy before communicating that conditions may develop in which, in the Committee's judgment, policy would be tightened before a threshold is crossed.  This may have to be repeated ritualistically to ensure that it isn't lost on the public consciousness.  I think language to this effect could be easily

October 23-24, 2012

Committee provide guidance about the course of policy after the initial the staff members developed in their memo The final question:  Should, and how should, 'the timing of liftoff after a threshold is crossed and the likely increase' in the fed funds rate?  The language that works quite well in that respect.  So I think it's quite sufficient.

I believe the tests of an approach to thresholds, if adopted, as follows:  improves clarity of the Committee's reaction function to the extent I think there are limits in how far we can achieve that; allows flexibility to deal thresholds have a hard To summarize my views, should be possible, and with various circumstances; recognizes that multiple indicators must be considered, and the Committee will make a judgment call in the end; and does not convey that and fast mechanical character.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I I think that's a good low for longer than we typically would.  Maybe that's a good thing. data MR. WILLIAMS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, appreciate the thought and the effort that went into the staff memo on thresholds.  After listening to the discussion this morning, I'm would like to move away from calendar-date descriptions in our forward guidance and move toward descriptions based more on economic see our September statement as actually a small step in that direction, and step.  But moving further to explicit thresholds for funds rate liftoff obviously would have two main benefits, as has been discussed already.  With suitably aggressive thresholds, we effectively signal our intention to stay But more important, thresholds cause our forward guidance to adjust to incoming automatically.  If labor markets improve faster than expected or inflation gets too high, the expected timing of liftoff will move forward, and on the flip side, if the economy slows, the

October 23-24, 2012

endogenously moves out.  So there's no need for the Committee to about whether or how much to move the calendar date.  That is, to me, the main expected liftoff date deliberate benefit.

them.  First-and it's discussed in the critical to communicate that about thresholds here and not triggers.  President Rosengren, you made that point I'm actually more worried that this could be as triggers, that would be a negative thing. I do think, as others have said, that thresholds bring some new challenges and potential pitfalls, and I'm just going to go through a couple of memo, and President Bullard talked about this-it's absolutely we're talking but thought the difference would not be confused. confused by the public, because if it's interpreted conditions risks to the outlook, in setting policy.  I think that having these of a relationship, and I'm just than I think is really the medium-term natural rate of interest is the intercept in a Taylor rule.  So, estimate of the natural rate of interest.  If the natural rate of interest declines, rate than otherwise.  And that's just another that the unemployment rate associated with the liftoff date is not invariant to the you have of the r* natural rate of interest.  This is not just a theoretical point.  It's I think has been pretty important over the last couple of years.  As I've Second, as we've talked about, focusing on just two variables in describing the for liftoff could be problematic.  Obviously, we look at countless variables.  We look at forecasts, along with the unemployment rate and inflation rate thresholds implies too tight going to talk about unemployment for now, assuming that the inflation escape clause isn't hit.  It implies a tighter relationship between unemployment and the date of liftoff there.  And this problem is illustrated by the notion of the medium-term natural rate of interest, or r*.  Recall that according to the Taylor rule, the unemployment rate at which the funds rate rises above zero depends on one's then liftoff would occur at a lower unemployment way of saying estimate that actually something that

October 23-24, 2012

Vice Chairman and Governor Yellen have mentioned, there's quite a bit of rate of interest has declined significantly over recent years.  Indeed, my is that the appropriate threshold for the unemployment rate has come down The current Tealbook also illustrates a related point nicely, since it modified the r* and the mentioned and as the evidence that the natural own thinking significantly, in part because of mounting evidence of a sizable decline in the natural rate of interest. constant term in the outcome-based rule in a way that's equivalent to lowering conditions for liftoff.

I encourage I think we've all criticized it in different ways-is not yet a 'burning platform,' as IT world.  So there is time to work out some of these issues that we've been expected.  Market expectations for liftoff currently align pretty closely with the conditions have changed, market expectations for the date changed correspondingly.  That means that markets are not viewing our current an unconditional commitment to a calendar date, and already we're getting the effects automatic stabilizer, which I think is the main goal So, despite these concerns about thresholds, we should strive to find ways to communicate more in terms of economic conditions rather than calendar dates, and continued efforts in this direction.  Fortunately, our current approach, although far from perfect-and we say in the discussing.  I would argue that the calendar date right now is actually working better than maybe one would have Committee's, and when the economic of liftoff have policy as of seeing the expected liftoff date work as an of going to thresholds.

We also included a critical inflation safeguard-namely, the phrase 'in a context of price stability.'  These declarations on unemployment and price stability providing the type of useful forward guidance that explicit state-contingent worth pursuing.  But I certainly heard a lot of commentary today that is concerned about goals.'  I think at some point I heard something like, 'We can get all of the costs.'  It sounds a little bit to me like the way they market fat-free with an inflation safeguard, the calendar date is here to stay for quite some time.  I just don't going to rear their heads as we get closer to far more restrictive monetary policy than what we're currently envisioning. I strongly favor incorporating explicit state-contingent language into our forward policy I think additional explicit numerical guidelines over the medium term will help further and are this.  There have been a lot of people who have mentioned the term 'qualitative'-'qualitative state-contingent benefits without incurring the cheesecake.  Without a constructive substitute for the real side, along it sounds to me as though understand why all of these same issues aren't withdrawing accommodation and try to substitute out the calendar date without doing something that actually leads to So guidance in order to further clarify our nontraditional policies.

year now, I've advocated thresholds associated and an inflation safeguard of 3 percent over the medium persuaded by the staff's analysis that 7 percent for the unemployment threshold statements and FRB/US analysis, a compelling 6½ percent or even 6 percent.  For a medium-term inflation threshold, I With the federal funds rate pinned at zero for quite some time, explicit economic thresholds are the best game in town.  For over a with an unemployment rate of 7 percent term.  Now, I am is too modest.  In line with our most recent policy case can be made for understand that the Committee largely feels that 3 percent is too high.  One reason I had argued

October 23-24, 2012

a concern about policy reacting prematurely to nonmonetary, transitory the staff's analysis that 2½ percent over the reasonable safeguard against such shocks and parameter uncertainties, for 3 percent was variations in inflation.  Again, I'm persuaded by medium term provides a such as in our theoretical benchmarks.

spent a lot of time digesting these threshold proposals, and it's easy to already, over the last many months, media explanations and market consulting approach to forward guidance has many.  So I think markets will get this quickly.  Most of the learning already been traversed. Now, a typical concern whenever we introduce a new policy is the public's steep learning curve, and some have talked about that already.  In numerous speeches and interviews, I've spoken at length about these types of explicit guidelines, and others have as well.  Financial market participants have find commentaries to clients about these policies.  This particular already been digested by curve has contingencies, I think that the calendar date is a example, if we adopted the 6½/2½ rule, it would be which the Committee expects this threshold to the minutes to mention that the unemployment At this point, I'll turn to some of the suggested questions from the staff.  On question 2.a., when economic thresholds are used for state helpful addition for the statement.  For helpful to point out the expected time frame over remain unbreached.  It would also be useful for margin was the most likely threshold to be breached first.  Clearly, this would be associated with a strengthening recovery.

and will work adequately.  The Chairman's press conference can point Question 2.b.-which variables?  I think unemployment for the real variable is the single best summary measure out the obvious issues related to formulating a consistent reading of developments from a host of economic indicators.  Namely, to support the unemployment figure, we would also be looking

October 23-24, 2012

averaging above complications average total PCE inflation over the next two years as the threshold, as in the years should be enough time to smooth through transitory variation in inflation like simply using a current 12-month rate was an Is inflation rising or falling in the year It would be embarrassing if we hit our threshold because of a transitory and then saw inflation fall below our long-run target, words, we must ultimately whether the inflation uptick is transitory or well formulate our strategy in terms of the medium-term inflation for above-trend GDP growth; monthly increases in payroll employment 150,000, at least, to maintain momentum for a declining unemployment rate; and strong consumer and business spending.  Of course, the Chairman could also discuss any arising from statistical noise in monthly unemployment data.  On inflation, I think we should use the projection for staff memo.  Two readings due to energy price shocks and other relative price shifts.  I do not threshold based on trailing 12-month inflation.  This would be an unacceptably incomplete guide.  Why?  Well, suppose we hit the threshold with an uptick in 12-month inflation.  In deciding how to act, it would be essential to assess whether the indication that medium-term inflation was unsatisfactory. following the uptick? blip in inflation, raised rates prematurely, all at the same time the economy failed to improve further.  In other refer to our inflation projections anyway to assess persistent.  We might as projection to start with.  So, ironically, there's a transparency argument here in favor of using forecasts.

I prefer the first draft statement of the medium-term a threshold is hit.  Language in the brackets allows for the possibility that the constellation Turning to what the actual statement would look like, paragraph prepared by the staff, because the inflation safeguard is in terms inflation outlook.  I would also include much of the language in the brackets.  The staff memo discusses a number of important communications issues surrounding the description of policy after

October 23-24, 2012

a threshold is hit.  I also found the last language is necessary to after liftoff.  Indeed, as we get closer to the time for liftoff, we will have to do policy as usual of an inertial Taylor 'balanced approach' language should work. of indicators that we look at may not lead to a liftoff when sentence to be important.  The addition of the 'balanced approach' describe policy some serious thinking about how to portray the post-liftoff path.  Will it be described by the outcome-based rule, or something slower, along the lines rule?  For the time being, the

I heard a lot-which I, frankly, just do not understand-is a the natural rate is higher and we're continuing to pursue accommodative we're pushing more accommodation into the system in an attempt to hit some that is unattainable, we ought to be generating inflation.  If we're not not even sure what's going on and what the problems are.  But if you're that this is okay to continue doing because you're not having there, and I don't understand why everybody The other comment that comment like, 'What if policy?'  Well, inflation is likely to go higher.  That's what all of our thinking about monetary policy is about.  If real-side objective generating inflation, I'm an inflation targeter, you would say an effect on inflation.  So there's a big disconnect is ignoring the inflation threshold in that regard.

And changes in the date, I understand, are always that its view on MS. GEORGE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff thoughtful memo.  It was helpful to me.  Given the communication challenges that the highlights, and taking into account the number of the statement, my support for numerical thresholds is, admittedly, reluctant.  Ideally, I'd prefer to return to more calendar date, though, as open to interpretation-either that the Committee's outlook has changed or

October 23-24, 2012

and clarify how the Committee's view of the appropriate policy path is would not want to restrict the flexibility of both for the possibility fed funds rate crossed.  And in that sense, I prefer that the language not the latter.  If thresholds were to be adopted, I would prefer that they replace the dateretained alongside the thresholds, I would be concerned that the would continue to put too much weight on the date.  In addition, at each meeting, at which one of the thresholds would likely be appropriate policy has changed.  In that sense, I think thresholds could allow us to replace the date-based guidance related to economic conditions.  On the other hand, I the Committee to respond to unforeseen events, especially if conditions dramatically improve or deteriorate.  So escape clauses along the lines of those in the mockups, I think, are important considerations, including financial conditions as factors in the Committee's decision on when to tighten policy.  These clauses suggest that the Committee is equally ready of a liftoff before thresholds are crossed and for the possibility of maintaining a close to zero even after thresholds are emphasize based guidance.  If the date were private sector the Committee would have to agree on the date crossed.

While a against inflationary pressures. concern, whether it is due to misestimating the amount or to a persistent shift in inflationary expectations.  The condition in the remain well anchored is therefore another in my view. Turning to the specific questions, rather than using only the unemployment rate as a measure of broader labor market conditions, I agree with the language in the mockups making clear that the Committee threshold for unemployment would signal the Committee's intention of continuing to support the economic recovery, it is also important that the Committee guard A buildup of such pressures is always a of slack in the economy mockups that longer-term inflation expectations important escape clause,

To capture broad inflationary pressures, I would suggest setting a trigger based on observable inflation rather than simply a forecast of future inflation.

I also want to thank the staff for the very useful and thorough background memo that was provide forward guidance about the liftoff of the federal economic conditions rather than a date.  After thinking about the issues raised in the staff memo and listening to my

October 23-24, 2012

framework would entail on an effective threshold framework is going to be difficult, and such a its own risks.

I see little value in publishing the public.  To me, crucial challenges that we're going to have to address before we could switch to assessment of these challenges leads me to be hesitant about adopting Turning to some of the questions posed to the Committee, both dates and thresholds, because publishing both is very likely to confuse the question is whether we should completely scrap our date-driven language and replace it with thresholds.  While the answer may be yes in principle, in practice the devil is in the details. There are many thresholds.  And my numerical thresholds.

As the memo the inflation a credibility problem that would be associated with the would prefer to use backwardTo mitigate the chance of prematurely violating the threshold, I would prefer to Still, this is a far from perfect choice.  It just seems to be the best among In response to the question of what variables to use, I would choose the unemployment rate as the though, concerns what inflation measures describes, using projections of inflation minimizes the chances of violating threshold prematurely.  However, there is verifiability of our forecast.  And in light of this problem, I looking measures of actual inflation, which have the clear and crucial advantage that they are easily verifiable. use core PCE inflation. a range of imperfect options.

before the thresholds threshold when we want to tighten policy.  This problem is endemic to It would seem prudent to set a relatively lower threshold for the unemployment rate, and a relatively higher inflation threshold, so that we're not led to tighten policy are breached.  But generous thresholds can lead to the problem that unemployment or inflation might not have crossed a

October 23-24, 2012

difficult.  This is especially the case when a any threshold.  The distinction between thresholds and triggers is therefore important, but conveying this difference to the public may be very threshold has been breached but there's no reaction on our part.  How we communicate that thresholds matter, even when they're not being reacted to, is important.

going to proceed with the adoption of numerical thresholds, to me, a reasonable memo that keeps the emphasis on our 2 percent of our monetary policy depends critically on what reaction function or gains are associated with informing the public of the likely path of with inertia provides the strongest policy prefer adopting a (1999) rule with inertia.  And I do hope that we on this issue.  But after listening to today's comments, it's undoubtedly If we're balance, given our objectives, would be 6½ percent on unemployment and 2½ percent on inflation, using the wording that's outlined in the longer-term inflation objective.  Regardless of whether we use thresholds or dates, the macroeconomic efficacy rule we use after we begin increasing rates.  The staff memo clarifies that from a pure efficacyof-policy perspective, the big the federal funds rate after liftoff.  A rule accommodation, as it promises to keep rates lower for longer.  I personally guidepost for policy that is similar to the Taylor can make some progress going to require some additional discussions.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I think it's useful to distinguish three MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll echo others in saying that I thought the staff The first question asked, 'Do you think it would be beneficial to express the Committee's forward guidance on the little incomplete, because it left out a phrase that's important:  'as opposed to the current approach of using a date.'  My

If knows that we're providing some We can mimic that by changing the date, but the public does not know ahead of time go about doing that.  At the same time, if there's a positive shock and the recovery change the date in response to that.  So I think the separate issues when thinking about thresholds: The main desirable feature of a threshold policy is, as a couple of people have referenced already, the there's a shock that drives unemployment upward, the public automatically going to be keeping rates low for longer, and that's going to be immediately easing. how we might proceeds more rapidly than we expected, then policy is automatically tightening.  Again, they don't know right now how we might automatic stabilizer component of the thresholds is what I find most attractive relative to the date-based forward guidance we're using right now.

If you look at the simulations, there are welfare gains from going lower in terms of the partial derivatives that you can So the threshold policy of 6 and 2½ looks like one under the simulations.  And what's the intuition behind that?  The intuition behind In terms of the numbers, Eric referred to an aggressive policy as being one that had a low unemployment rate and a high inflation rate.  Well, I don't know what 'aggressive' really means. inflation and lower in terms of unemployment.  Those are tease out from the simulations that are available. the best that is simply, you're conforming more to the dual mandate kinds of objectives that are embedded in the staff's objective function.

away from that that a threshold-based reaction function is desirable.  At the that others have everything the labor market, and that has to be right.  I'll say a I'm taking risk of being somewhat incoherent, I'll try to address some of the concerns raised.  There is this concern that the unemployment rate somehow does not capture that we're trying to measure in terms of

October 23-24, 2012

about that.  First, I think the public, when it thinks about labor market a lot about the unemployment rate.  The unemployment rate really bulks a thing to be thinking about.  But I felt that a lot of the conversation didn't really with the real question, which is, what exactly is the nature of the situation where you'd projected inflation was under 2½ and unemployment was, say, above I never got a full grasp of what kind of situation would lead one to do that.  For example, in to-and don't get me wrong, I think that is a going to manifest itself It's going to rise above our escape clause, and we would be, at that point, couple of things conditions, really thinks very large in their thinking.  So if we're trying to communicate that we're keeping policy accommodative until labor market conditions have improved, the unemployment rate really is very natural tangle want to raise rates when 6½? the hysteresis case that President Bullard referred very real possibility that we have to be thinking about.  But the way it's is by inflation rising. raising rates.

I think we can all guidance in that case is not as useful as quantitative guidance.  Many of us The same is true here.  Having certain. uncertainty, we should be striving for more policy certainty. Can we really Congress of the United States is offering qualitative guidance Either taxes agree that qualitative have expressed the desire to have more quantitative guidance. quantitative guidance offers more clarity to the public and makes monetary policy more In a world full of policy rates?  Why would the Committee want to raise and President Bullard mentioned, that the Committee has learned that the Let me move to my next topic, which is credibility.  And this gets to the question I asked about:  When would we want possibly to raise rates when the inflation outlook is under 2½ and the unemployment rate is above 6½?  One point is, as President Fisher

October 23-24, 2012

conclusion about unemployment unless the going to drive natural rate of unemployment is actually higher than it currently thought.  My own thinking is simply, this Committee is not going to reach that medium-term inflation outlook has risen above 2½ percent.  I don't see how we're ourselves to that conclusion if the inflation outlook looks pretty much the same as it is now, where it's at or below 2 percent.

and President George that low interest rates are generating financial Our theories are still in infancy in trying to understand this.  I found the October 18 range represents a very blunt one.  Do we really think a future FOMC-with up on the employment and possibly give up on the price stability mandate in order to use the blunt tool of tools we have available?  I find that unlikely in my thinking. I think the more interesting issue is the one that President Fisher have both referred to, which is the issue instabilities. memo about financial instabilities comforting, though, on this dimension.  We have a wide of supervisory and regulatory tools available to address financial instability.  The monetary policy tool really unemployment above 6½ and the inflation outlook under 2½-would give mandate monetary policy to combat financial instability, as opposed to using the wide range of supervisory and regulatory

I've argued that challenges in this regard.  The public may view the inflation threshold as a new and And we just announced an inflation target, so this is very problematic. an inflation-targeting regime is, at times your medium-term outlook for mandate allow for I've argued that threshold-based reaction functions are desirable, and they would be credible as well-that the Committee would go along with keeping rates low when the inflation outlook is under 2½ and the unemployment rate is above 6½.  The communication issue is one that's received a lot of attention around the table, and I think there are two key higher inflation target. But part of being inflation might differ slightly from 2 percent.  Even countries with a single

October 23-24, 2012

said we have a balanced approach to those about the possibility that year.  I think we have made some progress in terms of communicating on anyway.  This is a such deviations.  We have a dual mandate, and we two mandates.  So those kinds of deviations-we have to be able to talk inflation might rise at times above 2 percent.  Thanks to President Evans for talking about this at length over the past this.  But it's just a problem we're going to have to confront at some point very natural time to talk about it.

FOMC planning to raise the fed funds again, you just have to emphasize that a threshold and not a trigger.  And I think the staff has done a good job of conference would as Now, another problem that we have not talked about, which I think would come up, is that if we were to choose a 6½ percent unemployment threshold, or even a 6 percent threshold, I believe many members of the public would ask, why is the rate when the unemployment rate is still so high?  Here the rate is really helping us with that emphasis, but of course, Mr. Chairman, your press well.

answer to question 1.  You've noticed I've made no economic and policy go-rounds [laughter], but I'll be brief in my We can rely on a Committee forecast to needed information about how long we anticipate rates to be low with the threshold So that's my rather long commitments about my answers to the other questions.  I would drop the date-based guidance completely.  I think it would be confusing to maintain it in the statement. provide the policy.

exceptions will create confusion.  Another thing is that, frankly, we will be I think they're more likely to be I'm in favor of using projected inflation.  I think actual inflation is much too variable. Trying to carve out making policy.  When we make policy, we do it based on our forecast for inflation.  We might as well be articulate with the public about what those forecasts are.

October 23-24, 2012

and the conditions that we're actually making policy on.  I aggressive in terms of the actual numbers.  I'd be willing I understand that you do not want to use the a way of sneaking in more accommodation.  So accurate if we have to communicate them on an ongoing basis with the public.  We'll be held more accountable for the variables would be, to use Eric's language, more to go to 2½ and 6, as opposed to 2½ and 6½.  But idea of switching to state-based guidance as from that point of view, 2½/6½ would seem reasonable.

Lockhart talk about the need for having lots of caveats.  I think if we I don't see the benefit of the thresholds at all at that point.  We have to that they're thresholds.  We can talk about the fact that we're looking at a lot of different but we are keeping rates extraordinarily low at as these conditions are met.  The only caveat I would include would be stability of I think is hard to quantify, and so we can't really put a I heard President have lots of caveats, then be clear economic indicators to actually decide on liftoff, least as long long-term inflation expectations, which metric on it.  But we have to have some reference to it.

to happen after we have reached liftoff, I thought the staff's wouldn't have anything more on that.  So the reference to a going to do.  Thank you, In terms of what's going sentence on this is beautiful.  I 'balanced approach consistent with maintaining . . . satisfactory progress'-that's what we're going to do.  I think that's a very reasonable description of what we're Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

as strict inflation targeting?  That is, would you expect-really, regardless of what about unemployment-that everything is going to show up in inflation anyway, so you MR. BULLARD.  I have one question for President Kocherlakota.  Can I interpret what you're saying you say

October 23-24, 2012

½ percent of the target,' and not say might as well just say, 'I'm going to keep inflation within anything about real variables at all?

point of view, having an unemployment an more set of rates low.  It's actually a rather hawkish provision to have an I'll let you think about that.  [Laughter] MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Well, from a logical threshold is just another restriction on the provision of accommodation.  So having unemployment threshold, from a strict logical interpretation, is merely one conditions on keeping unemployment threshold.

No, it's true.  As long as you really obey the 2.5 percent, the unemployment trigger zero.  It doesn't matter.  This is just an extra CHAIRMAN BERNANKE. you could make protection on the inflation side, really.

President Kocherlakota's proposal at one point was to have an inflation trigger of 2¼, and I'm saying that using projected inflation of 2¼ as pretty moving outside that bound. MR. LACKER.  Right.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  President Plosser.

for their In earlier meetings, I've argued in favor of a state-contingent policy It seems to me that the case for thresholds has two related arguments.  The first is, it policy.  The second argument seems to be that is to communicate to the public that we will not withdraw and yield more stimulus at the the near term.  I actually don't find either of these arguments for MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff excellent discussion and analysis in the memo.  I thought it was very helpful and very useful in clarifying my own views. that was rooted in a more systematic reaction function, and against calendar-date forward guidance. can help clarify the state-contingent nature of our a use of forward guidance accommodation too soon, and this, in turn, will boost confidence zero lower bound over thresholds compelling.

of and the communications required for thresholds could have some very undesirable side effects.  To begin with, it's inflation is not a very incomplete statement of a set of states that may occur.  Suppose the accommodation.  Now imagine I certainly can I believe the implementation prove very difficult and actually important to realize that specifying simple thresholds on unemployment and reaction function.  It's a unemployment threshold were passed and we acted to reduce that, unexpectedly, the unemployment rate rose back up above the threshold.  What would we do?  Would we remove the accommodation, or would we leave it where it is?

October 23-24, 2012

a robust discussion around this table as to what we would do in that case.  But the we passed the unemployment threshold and we What would we explain to the public about how we're going to behave in the future the threshold was in the first place?  In fact, I think the staff memo guidance using these expectation not of the threshold, but of how policy will after the threshold is reached.  We don't specify that post-threshold reaction function and currently expects our reaction function to be.  We can't reaction function that's well understood by the of our June discussion of policy rules suggests that we've not reached a that credibly binds future Committees to abide by it, the threshold questionable as an effective stimulus exercise. imagine communication of thresholds tells us little about what the Committee would do in those circumstances.  On the other hand, suppose didn't act. and what the meaning of underscores in a very convincing way that the stimulative effect of forward thresholds is determined by the public's behave that it's different from what the public rely on the thresholds to have the desired stimulative effect in the near term.  Indeed, the simulations assume that we have a well-specified public.  And my reading consensus on how we'll be setting policy in normal times or after the onset of tightening as we move away from the zero bound.  As illustrated by the staff memo, without specifying that reaction function in a way strategy becomes are other reasons I'm uncomfortable with thresholds.  For instance, selecting the is above X percent, or as long as close to Y, would seem implicitly to embed a particular loss Lacker and others are having trouble There appropriate level of any threshold is also quite problematic, as many have suggested.  Saying that we will not change interest rates when the unemployment rate inflation is projected to stay function, and perhaps an implicit policy rule, in the statement.  Yet the Committee has not agreed on either of those.  I think this suggests why President coming to agreement on what those thresholds would be.  Again, according to the September

October 23-24, 2012

unemployment rate liftoff ranges from 5.7 to 6.8, and inflation ranges from 1.8 to 2.3.  The simulation exercises to have any effect on the economic outlook, because these thresholds are not going to change the SEP, there's significant disparity across the participants' views on what the will be at the time of liftoff, ranging from about 5.7 to 8 percent.  Even if we look at only the participants who anticipated that liftoff would occur in 2015 or beyond, the unemployment rate at suggest that setting thresholds consistent with those projections is unlikely significant public's expectation of the timing of liftoff.

can see at least three other problems in selecting an appropriate unemployment happening in the labor market, and many of you have talked about that. a wide diversity of views about the size of the unemployment gap, and we struggle to curve, and in a features of the labor market that we don't fully understand.  Even Okun's law well anymore.  It's very difficult to model unemployment and considerable uncertainty about the level of unemployment case of hysteresis. attention on the unemployment a number when the extent to which monetary policy can speed up the decline is highly In the last press conference, the Chairman went to great aspects of the labor market that would matter.  I would could undermine that broader I threshold.  First, the selection of an unemployment threshold is complicated by our limited understanding of what's There's understand movements in the labor force participation rates, in the Beveridge number of other doesn't seem to fit very understand its movements, and there's over the medium run and its natural rate.  Again, President Bullard used the Given these difficulties, it seems ill advised now to focus more rate as uncertain.  Second, the unemployment rate is a noisy and imperfect indicator of labor market conditions, as many people have said. lengths to say that there are many other think that switching to some point estimate of a particular number perspective.  Third, I think there's a high likelihood that the threshold would be misinterpreted as

October 23-24, 2012

an intermediate target.  And indeed, our unemployment target, even if we tried to say it was only the lower we make the threshold, the more it will be interpreted as our unemployment target.

explain to the public why it is goal.  Using such a number now would likely confusing to the public, no matter how hard we tried to explain it.  How many times framework and still remain credible?  Here again, the conducted and continuing to conduct policy in a and transparent manner that is well understood by the public.  I'm not sure that we we may not achieve the benefits it would suggest. As many have said, in January we were careful to inappropriate for us to quantify our employment prove highly can we be perceived to be changing our models that are instructing us to use forward guidance to generate stimulus at the zero bound depend crucially on the central bank's having systematic can say we've achieved such a state, and so also see three problems with the inflation threshold.  First, how will the public interpret 2 percent goal?  Will they long-term goal?  Is this an intermediate target, or is it an objective we Some are already interpreting our recent statement as saying that we are putting an unemployment objective.

One disciplining device that for projecting inflation.  This would require the Committee to agree on an model.  An alternative would be to use private-sector forecasts of inflation, like the SPF or Blue Chip, as the basis for the problems:  gaming by the survey participants to try to influence the inflation outlook and thereby influence the stance of monetary policy.  Do keep inflation near our target?  If they do, then they medium term just for that reason.

outlook for inflation, we need to take medium-run inflation.  I say this not to denigrate the staff's forecast, but those forecast errors be perceived by the public?  And how will from the private sector? Third, in setting inflation thresholds based on the into account that we forecast inflation with error.  Now, over the past 10 years, the Tealbook has tended to underestimate merely to point out that we need to recognize that there are sizable error bands around our forecasts of inflation.  How will those forecasts be perceived when we do something different credibility problem may not problem he is trying to solve with forward end of their historical ranges and noticeably above Finally, we need to keep in mind that the Committee's true be the one that Mike Woodford has in mind.  The guidance is how to credibly convey that the Committee is not going to raise rates too soon.  But the real problem might be to convince the public that we will not fall too far behind the curve when the time comes to tighten.  While market indicators today don't suggest that that's a serious problem, breakevens are near the high the Tealbook forecasts.  The pressure to backslide on our commitment to price stability might

when we return to a more normal economic and policy important takeaway from the staff is that such an effort is in fact a necessary at the zero lower bound.  In the am sympathetic to President Lacker's suggestion that we move away from and thresholds to describe our reaction function in qualitative terms.  While be shared by my colleagues Presidents Kocherlakota and Williams, our a step exactly in that direction, and I would urge us In summary, I'm not in favor of moving to thresholds at this time, and I am skeptical that we could ever implement them in a constructive and well-communicated way.  Communications would be difficult, and any attempts that we might use to manage expectations in this manner could backfire on us.  I would prefer that we focus on trying to reach consensus on how we will conduct systematic monetary policy environment.  An foundation for articulating an effective policy even when we're interim, however, I dates and triggers that view may  not efforts to rewrite the policy statements and craft those statements in terms of a qualitative, as opposed to a mechanical, reaction function is to consider pushing in that direction to help with this problem.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

close to would summarize as, 'Good thresholds trump date guidance, which can try to develop a consensus for VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My views are pretty Governor Tarullo's, which I trumps bad thresholds.'  I think it makes sense to see whether we on thresholds, and I believe that thresholds could be potentially much better than a date several reasons that others have mentioned.  First of all, the date is based on something, and the thresholds help explain, at least in part, what that date rests on.  This provides more clarity to

October 23-24, 2012

about how we are likely to behave in the future.  Second, the thresholds going to be more dynamic, and so if the economy is stronger, date will be moved in, and vice versa, even without us having to do And, third, with thresholds based on economic variables, we'll get less caught up in at each meeting.  This also has the benefit of us not having market will react to a date change.  It takes us out of the process unless I would expect that the hurdle to actually would be quite high.  We'd have to have some sort of determination that different way than we thought, but I wouldn't rule it out completely. I would think that would happen very infrequently, if at all. market participants based on economic variables are the expected takeoff anything. the issue of whether to move the date to worry about how the we decide to change the thresholds themselves. changing the thresholds the economy works in a But to two-year time horizon strike map quite well to the current date guidance, and good place right now in terms of whether the thresholds change expectations about rates from thresholds versus a date.  There's been a little bit of discussion here and they're actually quite separate.  The second reason is, the the unemployment rate associated with factors such as labor market I consider the So then the question is, okay, what thresholds?  And the second question is, what language?  How do we communicate that the thresholds are thresholds, not triggers, and that the variables selected are not the targets of policy?  The thresholds of 6½ percent on the unemployment rate and 2½ percent on the PCE deflator at a oneme as about right for several reasons.  First, they I think that's important, because we're actually in a relatively how market participants judge our policies, and I don't really want to do something that disturbs this.  I think you have to separate the issue of the future path of that's conflated the two, unemployment rate at 6½ percent would be low enough that it's unlikely to be prematurely triggered by volatility in participation rates or sampling errors, but it's high enough relative to what at least

October 23-24, 2012

would tend to hit it, rather than the inflation variable, first.  It would more NAIRU to be that we likely be the binding threshold.

clearly we'd be expecting inflation at one- to two-year highs to be 2½ percent.  I'm not putting all of the If we picked a much lower unemployment rate, as the Chairman and others have mentioned, we're essentially saying that we expect inflation to move above our long-run objective.  So if we had an unemployment rate objective of 2 percent, then saying we're actually comfortable with that kind of outcome.  I think that would create some risk that inflation expectations might become unmoored.  And we can say, 'Well, that's a trigger, too,' but that would actually be a bad thing to happen, because it would be difficult to put that genie back in the bottle.  Two and a half percent seems about right to me on the core PCE deflator.  It allows for some noise and variance, but not so much that it looks as though we're weight on the unemployment threshold.  So I like those two numbers.

crossed, so I don't view this as a binding commitment.  And this can be done by inflation expectations remaining well anchored.  I think the that the unemployment rate is expected to eventually fall below a target.  So I think that really underscores that it's a threshold, I think the language needs to indicate that the Committee may tighten policy before any thresholds are using the words that we've had in the statement before, like 'currently anticipates,' and emphasizing the importance of language that the staff has suggested-'at least until the unemployment rate falls below' the threshold-is vastly preferable to the language 'as long as the unemployment rate exceeds 6½ percent,' because it emphasizes 6½ percent, that 6½ percent is not not a trigger.

would not try to provide much guidance about how policy tightening might occur after I the threshold is reached.  I think discussion about this is, first, premature.  We don't know

October 23-24, 2012

going to want to proceed, and I certainly wouldn't want to endorse any given the fact that the equilibrium real interest rate may be have in the Tealbook.  Second, I think if we would happen after, we would create confusion about whether the we're talking about exit, then people would take it more thresholds, and so it would confuse our message.  I think also that if we want that in our exit strategy documents, consensus statement, rather than in the FOMC statement. precisely how we're particular policy rules, especially much lower than some of the policy rules that we were to talk about what parameters are thresholds or triggers.  If as triggers than as to talk about how we're likely to exit, it's better to address like what we published in the January additional point.  If we do arrive at thresholds in terms of our commitment to exceptionally low, we will have a little bit of inconsistency in the statement can manage that process, but that difference. I have one keep short-term rates because we'll have thresholds relative to the liftoff of short-term rates, but we'll have substantial improvement in the labor market outlook with respect to the balance sheet.  So that will raise some inevitable questions.  Why one and not the other?  I think we we should just be cognizant of it-that there will be a little bit of inconsistency and people will ask about

different set of thresholds.  But that doesn't really bother me, because I are the right thresholds, and if we get a lot of additional information on wouldn't rule out changing the thresholds in the future.  I going to get information like that that's going to Finally, I do acknowledge a lot of the discussion around the table that thresholds might not turn out to be right.  With the benefit of hindsight, we may learn things that would make us wish that we'd picked a don't really view the thresholds as an immutable commitment.  I view them as, we currently anticipate that these hysteresis or labor market participation rates or other things that tell us that the optimal thresholds should be different, then I don't think that's likely.  I don't think that we're

October 23-24, 2012

want to change the thresholds, but I wouldn't rule it out categorically.  And if we don't arguments about, oh, we can't do this because going market.  Thank you. make us rule it out categorically, that undercuts a lot of the of all of these problems-that the unemployment rate is not a sufficient indicator of what's on in terms of the labor

for the very guidance.  I've been a fan ever explicit statement of our long-run objectives to avoid possible about our reaction function. I do think it's a meaningful step step is within our reach. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me first thank the staff detailed and informative analysis in the thresholds memo.  I strongly support the use of numerical thresholds to clarify the conditionality of our forward since we discussed the idea in connection with the introduction of the calendar date.  When we discussed the use of thresholds around that time, though, several participants argued that we needed to couple them with an confusion about the difference between the thresholds and our objectives.  With the consensus statement now in place, we should strive to provide greater clarity Threshold language is not a complete reaction function, but toward providing more information to the public about the Committee's likely response to future economic developments, and I fervently hope this our current guidance.  First, as a number of you-Presidents Kocherlakota and Williams and Dudley-have all emphasized, spelling out the conditionality of our forward a kind of automatic stabilizer.  Second, spelling out explicit thresholds to communicate a commitment to keep rates lower for longer, and it more normal levels.  I There are two principal advantages, in my view, that thresholds have over calendar-date Vice Chairman guidance would serve as for action is a way for us provides the public with a way to monitor whether or not we're actually sticking to that commitment as the recovery proceeds and unemployment declines toward

October 23-24, 2012

policy rules developed during more normal periods, and I'm pleased that and our September statement as confirming about ½ point to around 6.8 percent, but it may be we make in the calendar date for consistent with their prior expectations about the economic conditions required for believe it is quite important under current conditions for us to keep rates low for a longer time than implied by markets seem to have interpreted our mid-2015 date that we do plan to stay lower for longer.  Since March, dealers' expectations about the likely unemployment rate at liftoff have declined by difficult for the public over time to discern whether changes liftoff are liftoff or not.  Beyond that, with thresholds, we won't have to keep revisiting our decisions about shifting the calendar date.

also think providing explicit economic thresholds, far in advance of the time when accommodation in place.  So I prefer to replace the date-based accommodation.  But I think it would be helpful some calendar date. I we're approaching them, may help to keep inflation expectations anchored as unemployment declines but we keep our guidance in the statement with thresholds that direct attention to the economic conditions we'd need to see before contemplating the removal of when the thresholds are first introduced for us to clarify that they are not intended to remove accommodation by stealth.  We could achieve that objective by including in our statement, at least initially, a formulation such as, 'The Committee currently expects those economic conditions to prevail through at least'

excellent job of illustrating the upshot of the path that would lead to bad economic outcomes.  I'll come back to a second.  But for now, let me just say that I view the unemployment rate as The simulation results in the staff memo do an consequences of alternative choices of threshold variables and values.  The analysis, in my view, is that even without any escape hatches, thresholds would be extremely unlikely to lock us into a escape hatches in

October 23-24, 2012

employment side of our Detmeister showed that current predictors for headline PCE inflation over the years. the best and most appropriate variable for providing a threshold for the dual mandate, and concerning inflation, I prefer projected to actual inflation, given the volatility of PCE inflation.  But we would need to find some reasonably straightforward procedure to reach consensus on projected inflation in our deliberations so as not to become completely bogged down on this issue.  A recent Board briefing, actually, by Alan four-quarter core PCE inflation is one of the best next two percent for Dudley that setting tighter withdrawing accommodation, and that's something I would certainly the Tealbook B, liftoff usually and PCE inflation over the next recognize that these results depend on the for example, it may be optimal to accept of being unlikely to cause harm.  For that reason, I would want the force us to I support threshold values of 6½ percent for the unemployment rate and 2½ inflation and agree with Governor Tarullo and with Vice Chairman thresholds would imply oppose.  In the optimal control simulations regularly included in occurs when the unemployment rate is slightly below 6 percent one to two years is projected around 2¼ percent.  I structure of FRB/US and that optimal control in alternative models can deliver different results. In models with less persistent inflation dynamics, inflation that temporarily runs above 2½ percent.  So I view these threshold values as conservative in the sense statement to be crystal clear that these are thresholds and not triggers, that they do not remove accommodation once they're crossed.

choose for the thresholds in at, and for that reason I In light of our imperfect understanding of the economy and the transmission mechanism, we will, of course, always want to consider whatever variables we the broader context of the myriad of indicators that the staff is looking

The language suggested in this regard in the final section of the language that we have included in the September statement suggests I would forward guidance pertaining to our policy after of policy, but even so, I think that thresholds good. Finally, I think we should continue to communicate that we will maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for a considerable period after the economic recovery strengthens, and I think the to market participants that we will not be unduly aggressive in tightening after liftoff. welcome finding a way to be more specific in the liftoff.  I recognize that's important to our stance are a valuable step without such forward guidance, and I would not wish the perfect to be the enemy of the

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

Still, my preference is not to use thresholds.  It's still that we plan to hold off liftoff until after the recovery has begun to I think it's easy to underestimate the communication challenges that you consider a wider audience than the dealer community, academic community, and the financial press, whose feedback we hear most clearly most of a lifetime reacting to the level of interest rates and the speed of a solution that gets us off the zero bound earlier and that has a gentler slope after MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also found the staff memos to be very helpful, especially in understanding the potential outcomes from various thresholds.  And a number of people around the table, at this and previous meetings, have been quite persuasive in their arguments in both directions.  [Laughter] not clear to me that the use of thresholds offers significantly better results than more-general communication in indicating strengthen.  Furthermore, are posed by thresholds, especially if the narrow and who may be more inclined to pay attention to the nuances of our language.  And finally, as someone who has spent change, I prefer

October 23-24, 2012

(1999) strategy as having nearly the same outcome as the extended gentler slope.  Having said all of that, my preference is a preference rather liftoff.  Thus, looking at the simulated outcomes under alternative policies in the Tealbook, I prefer the inertial Taylor baseline but with a than a strong objection.  And the memo did help me clarify my thoughts about thresholds should they be implemented.

On 2.b., of the alternatives tested in the 2.c., I will admit that I lean more toward the than the commitment side of the date guidance, and I think the date gives us room to I yearn for every degree of flexibility possible, too many escape clauses negates the benefits of the policy that we're trying to LSAPs.  So if we do adopt thresholds, I don't think I would indicate that the explained if and when it happened, or language that could be For 2.d., along the same lines, I think too much actions after the thresholds are reached would have many of the same agreement as to what those actions might be and how responses to 2.c. and 2.d., I find it hard to see how our that we might not act after they're reached, depending on to date guidance that Taking the questions in turn, if thresholds are implemented-2.a.-I think they should replace the date-based guidance, even in their first use. memo, my preference would be to use thresholds of 6½ percent unemployment and 2½ percent projected inflation one to two years out.  On forecast consider a range of factors.  But much as including implement, especially when combined with all of the exit ramps we had to provide to reach agreement on Committee might tighten policy before the thresholds are crossed.  Rather, I would view any such decision as something to be added if the possibility became more likely. discussion about the likely difficulties, not the least of which would be to articulate them.  Combining my 'kinda/sorta/maybe' approach, such as articulating thresholds but modifying them to say that we might act before they're reached or other measures that aren't specified in the threshold-how is that preferable

we might or might not move in response to incoming data, and that might be a forecast or might be a commitment?  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.

these discussions before the usual go-rounds we want to probe their value as a standalone proposition.  This makes good sense from a analytical perspective.  But in doing so, we shouldn't lose the perspective of timeliness MS. RASKIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I noticed that the way we're discussing quantitative thresholds is as a matter distinct and separate from the discussions about the current forecast and economy.  Presumably, we're having because purely and the fact that it makes a very big difference-it is consequential-when we choose to implement a threshold approach.

what was done in September, I'd argue now, as I did then, that we did in September to conditions that, when we see them, imply that considered improbable and that the extraordinary support can and market participants seem to well.  However, the longer we wait to adopt explicit thresholds, the From the perspective of we haven't completed our policy job.  We started but didn't finish.  What was to make policy decisions that essentially cut off the lower tail of outcomes, or, to state it in the vernacular, we promised monetary policy support that could cushion the blows to the economy that would otherwise hold back economic growth.  But what we haven't done yet is define for markets and the public the economic this lower tail of outcomes can be be removed.  We've taken the first step in clarifying our policy, have understood it fairly higher the likelihood that our forward-rate-guidance message will become muddled.

muddled message possibility, also known in my notes as the MMP. A threshold approach avoids the muddled message possibility by completing the To me, the threshold approach is beneficial, in response to the first question, because it positions us ahead of the [Laughter]

Moving the calendar date out is usually taken as an overly negative signal about the medium-term outlook for the economy. guidance. forward guidance. under which the Committee says, 'Now will be the beginning of a new phase, the beginning of a new conversation.  And the conversation will be that we're approaching the end of the era of the low federal funds rate, and we can tell discussion of the path for the funds rate liftoff.'  So I think that the thresholds will be more beneficial the sooner we calendar date that must by the public Moving the calendar date in, when stronger-than-expected information arrives, runs the risk of undercutting the value of the information contained in the forward rate

ZLB leads us to an MMP.  People will be confused about what the vacuum.  Bloggers and editorial writers and Committee, are to communicate clearly.  Confusion about our thresholds could also If outsiders begin to believe that we have a lower inflation above that level, there might be some expectations lose their anchor.  If, instead, market participants fully as it remains below get to a point close in time to the calendar date and unemployment is moving More generally, if we decline to clarify our thresholds, we face the MMP, the muddled message possibility.  A vague thresholds are, and speculation will likely fill that others will likely start to offer opinions about what those thresholds are and should be.  It seems to me that by allowing others to frame that discussion, we, as a collective shirking our responsibility affect inflation expectations. threshold than we do, then when inflation moves slightly concern that we've lost our resolve or our ability to keep inflation in check, thereby raising the possibility that inflation understand that we're merely temporarily allowing inflation to rise as long the threshold, inflation expectations seem more likely to remain steady.  Stated differently, what happens if we

October 23-24, 2012

to two-year outlook for inflation is at 2 percent? that in this situation, and this loss in In essence, this would let the market's perception of inflation drive a policy economic conditions.  Why is this scenario not a real down, but is still above 7 percent, and the oneMarkets are in the dark about what the Committee projects and intends.  So one possibility is that markets believe that the Committee needs to raise the fed funds rate and that the Committee is underestimating the inflation outlook.  Markets won't understand because the Committee never told them that we're seeing the inflation outlook at 2 percent.  It's possible markets lose the sense that this Committee is committed to price stability, credibility itself unhinges inflation expectations, forcing the Committee to defensively raise the federal funds rate. choice that is decoupled from underlying possibility that we should seek to avoid?

So, to the questions:

- 1.  Yes, it would be beneficial to express the Committee's forward guidance on the funds rate using numerical thresholds, as couched with the qualitative language that appears already in the draft.
- The thresholds should replace the date-based guidance.  Date-based guidance 2.a. doesn't help the public understand the rationale for our forward guidance to the same extent as thresholds would.
- could explicitly, quantifiably reference many different variables. The staff a concise case for looking at projected inflation between one and two years 2.b.

Of course, this raises the challenge of how we would agree on an inflation outlook.  For that reason, we may want to consider referring to forecasts made by an outside and independent

The dealer survey source, such as for employment, the unemployment rate seems to be the most reliable However, I think the additional language in the draft regarding the 'pace of improvement in labor market does provide the Committee with the ability to make a better threshold has been crossed.  If the principle at stake in the use of thresholds communication, rather than one of added accommodation, we would set the thresholds at levels that align with market expectations. match market views of when the federal funds currently shows that date to be late 2015, at which point unemployment is projected to be 6½ percent and projected inflation is not higher than 2½ percent.  So I would set these thresholds to align now.

My continue to see the intellectual appeal of numerical thresholds, and I still have an I will say that between the memo and conversations with various think I'm starting to better appreciate some of the limitations as well.  Also, and I feel as though we succeeded beyond at least my own expectations with our guidance at the last meeting in that we were able to quite effectively thresholds.  So I guess I might have otherwise felt. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Let me start by of the memo on this topic, which I thought was bottom line is, I open mind about them.  But people, I importantly, reformulation of the communicate a shift in our reaction function without relying on numerical that takes away some of the urgency that we trying to develop a commitment technology or a If you read much of the academic literature, you find that the payoff is comes from being able to essentially bind yourself to you would be tempted to renege on ex post.

Now, I think if this is your framework, if you're commitment of this sort, I think you're naturally going to be drawn to relatively sharp, For example, observed inflation, as a you can see when we've reneged in some sense.  So the principle here is, if On the assumption that we do go forward with trying to think about design, the first fork in the road I came to was the question of, are communication strategy? very much about commitment.  The payoff something that be, you can't literally bind yourself perfectly, but reputation if going for verifiable formulations-go easy on the escape hatches. number of people have pointed out, is better than our own forecast of inflation because it's a verifiable item and

October 23-24, 2012

for commitment, you can't 'tie yourself to the mast' with the kinds of 'loose you a lot of wiggle room. you're going ropes' that leave you will.  I agree a super-compelling worry, because that's exactly what the inflation are important.  We don't really understand them all that well, and we're I agree with President Kocherlakota that guess I can take only so give up with commitment, because you give up is the ability to react to unforeseen contingencies, and that's the stuff that's left a little bit of a bias that one wants to be wary of Now, of course, I think commitment has its downsides, as the memo points out, in the sense that you lose the ability to adjust to a variety of omitted contingencies, if with others who've pointed out that, 'I don't find these errors around the structural rate of unemployment to be threshold is there for.'  On the other hand, there's other stuff not in the model.  In my mind, the financial stability issues talking about a pretty long horizon, so I'm concerned. monetary policy would be a blunt tool, but it needs to be compared with the other tools in our toolbox, some of which may be blunt or untested or otherwise not up to the job.  So I prefer the idea of keeping a little bit of an open mind.  Moreover, I think one much comfort from what a model can tell us about what we what out of the model almost by definition.  So there's there.

I think this is the view that Vice Chairman Dudley was that we're not really going for commitment, but rather, we have a time-consistent communicate aspects of this reaction function as comfortable with this formulation.  Now, in this can be helpful.  At the same time, they don't strike me as necessarily you do use them, it would make sense to use them in a somewhat looser way.  I An alternative view-and expressing-is reaction function, and we're just trying to clearly and credibly as possible.  So I'm more case, I think numbers indispensable.

And I think it's interestingagain, my views on this have been strongly statement-that with regard to open-ended QE, where we're using reaction function, it was apparently extremely credible-at least directionally credible, maybe not the subtleties of it.  It was quite credible in a verbal sense.  So that's just worth bearing in mind.  Again, I'm still open to the idea, although do want to be wary of a situation where we use numbers in a way that doesn't really add much to where we are now communicate-and, flexibility.  So

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

I started with thresholds after reading of months ago was that my tentative position was fairly skeptical on the I thought they'd be very hard to agree on, and that the current system was actually good memo.  I was able to persuade myself over the weekend in reading the I'm hearing all of these arguments-has moved me I started.  So thanks for that.  [Laughter] MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Where the old memos a couple grounds that working pretty well.  That was greatly strengthened by the reaction in the market to what we did in September, which, again, as Governor Stein was saying, supported the use of qualitative guidance and the date.  Then I met the memo, and-let me make it unanimous-it's an extraordinarily memo, that quantitative thresholds are both doable and worth doing.  And then I have to say that the conversation today-this is the first time significantly back to where

I do agree that as a theoretical matter, the use of the projected To be a little more specific, liftoff date, without explanation of a reaction function, is inelegant.  Like others, I see difficult

We also know that and 6½ percent-which make good sense to me, as I'll come back to in a secondmarket is already assuming.  I guess I would while the date may be dumb, inelegant, unattractive, unpopular, and out of style, it's right now.  So I don't know why we're in such a hurry to throw it over the side. problems of implementation, and to me, they first is that the timing just seems odd, as others-most recently, Governor Stein-have mentioned.  The combination of the crude liftoff date and the language in the statement convinced the market of Tealbook B, for example.  So it's working.  Why 2½ percent provide little or no accommodation.  So the benefits could be quite modest in terms of either transparency or pre-commitment, given what the say that working example, 2½ and 6½ percent are really a stable There, I would say that it strikes me as I know that we have.  Most of this last year, I've been an observer appropriate to do so in the face of evidence about the guess I would take issue with Vice Chairman Dudley's comment that we can move your comment.  I would just say that it seems to me there costs in being wrong about that.  These are numbers that we put out there; we own out there.  To change them in any way in the near-term, I think, would from our standpoint. A second, related question is whether, for equilibrium, or will we change our minds fairly soon? fairly likely that we will. from the outside, but it seems to me that the Committee has moved on which Taylor rule is the most appropriate.  It seems to me only development of the economy and its reaction to our policy, and in relation to the natural rate of unemployment.  Views are, and should be, evolving on that.  So I suspect that 2½ and 6½ percent, particularly the employment threshold, will not prove to be a stable equilibrium. And I them-I don't want to characterize would be real them when we put them be problematic and costly

'Is it a trigger?  How does it relate to 2 percent?  I thought you don't answer those things.  It could well be confusing to the public.

that we could Finally, in terms of the post-liftoff reaction function, I do think it's unlikely agree on a post-liftoff reaction function that would kick in, in a credible way, in the middle of 2015.  And I don't think it's likely that such an agreement would hold for very long.

I hold these views tentatively because I feel as though I'm still evolving on there may be some benefit, some merit, in quantitative thresholds.  It's Bottom line: this, but I believe something we ought to take slowly, particularly since there's no urgent need to make a change and no obvious net benefit in doing so in the short term.

The difficult question, of course, is, when we disagree with the public, we're just going to have to explain ourselves, and it's think it's probably manageable.  Unemployment is just very tough.  For one thing, as President

At the end of the day, you lose the guess I would say that it's problematic.  In terms of and 6½ percent make sense, if you could get over all guess that's Plosser was pointing out, there are just so many aspects of the labor consider.  I also think we're market that we don't have a target-or it's not really NAIRU; hard to explain that.

Yes.  Governor. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.

I can enter Arrow theorem country just for a minute here, I heard express a preference for qualitative thresholds, but I want to be sure I your position that, given that the effective choice may be or already MR. TARULLO.  If several of our colleagues understood their position.  Is is between the date and moving toward quantitative thresholds, you would prefer to stick with the date?  I think I heard Jeff, Charlie, Jim, and Richard for qualitative thresholds.

about neither?

MR. LACKER.  How got to pick something. VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  You've

you've got a choice of two things-that's why I said it's Arrow way; we've got the date, and if we're not going to change from the date, MR. TARULLO.  Yes, if theorem country in a

going to stay with the date.  I think I heard all four of you saying implicitly you prefer rather than going to quantitative thresholds, but I wanted to be sure I we're staying with the date understood.

I'm less averse to the date than I am to thresholds. MR. LACKER.

I thought.  Okay.  And that's true for all four of you? I would prefer you could align the two and then have it be I think that's something that didn't come up a lot here, only a little bit. MR. TARULLO.  Yes, that's what MR. BULLARD.  Yes, and I'll just add one thing, which didn't really come out around the table here:  On the quantitative easing side, we already have the language that to have also for the interest rate.  So I would say that the same way.

in my two cents' worth, I would rather have us move toward the That may take some time, but I think that's where we ought to be trying to get to, not to MR. PLOSSER.  To put qualitative nature describing our reaction function, keep the date for now, and gradually transition to the point where we could substitute the qualitative reaction function and get rid of the date. thresholds.

me as well, that the Chairman did a good job in the press conference.  He said we know we're not there yet, but he didn't lay that's a qualification.  It's a qualitative way to express ourselves.  I want that somewhat.  We're trapped with the date, and then we keep having to move it out. going to try to move it in, and it sends a signal.  Everybody has talked about that.  I just better outcome than what we already have.  I have, but I don't think it's a better outcome. MR. FISHER.  I think, Danny, since you mentioned pretty out a number, and to me to refine Or we're don't think that having these specific numbers is a don't like what we already discern. MR. TARULLO.  That's what I was trying to

October 23-24, 2012

I would slowly, as many people have said at this table.  In contemplating this thing, I you said in the last press conference was pretty good issue.  But that's as I would wish to go right now. MR. FISHER.  And I want to ask about the time line here, Mr. Chairman, but urge us to go very don't rule it out, but in the meantime, what at giving a sense that we're not there-we're thinking about the unemployment as far you, Mr. Chairman.

So we substantial improvement in labor markets. MR. EVANS.  Sensing the warm feeling for qualitative state contingency in the language in our current statement about that, but stop asset purchases before we need a second qualitative description of 'substantial'

approach is better.  What I heard was a continuum:  people who want a qualitative who would prefer the quantitative approach.  Interestingly, regarding those I thought there might be a lot of debate okay with those particular numbers.  I a wide range of views.  I think what we ought to do is huddle again with the additional information; and you who are concerned about the rigidity, the best way to do it is to to do that in the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  I think most people agree that in principle, the statecontingent approach to those who wanted the quantitative approach, the one thing that about-the numbers-actually, most people were understand there's now the staff and see if there are ways to provide the qualifications; the other kind of material that can satisfy some of lack of clarity, whatever, associated with this kind of approach.  I think the try to write something down and then see how people react to it, but we'll try intermeeting period.  President Fisher.

I ask, Mr. Chairman-in terms of your own concept of the time line MR. FISHER.  May of conducting and maybe completing this discussion, what do you have in mind?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  It depends on what the reaction is.

MR. FISHER.  So that would be the next step, and then we'd see.

would be the next step, but we'll try to do that CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right.  That well in advance of the next meeting.

On net over the period, intermediate and longerdated forward rates exhibited large declines, likely reflecting increased expectations for total MBS and Treasury purchases.

Others express this as a more symmetric approach greater account when addressing increases in Many investors have described recent what they call the Committee's 'reaction function.'  While this term is used somewhat loosely by market participants, some perceive a greater willingness by the Committee to tolerate above-objective inflation temporarily more-rapid to the dual mandate, in which the Committee would take deviations from the unemployment side of the mandate into inflation above the 2 percent objective.

The lower-left panel shows the two-day change in MBS spreads announcements, plotted against the change in LSAP expectations.  The MBS spread response around the September FOMC meeting, shown in red, was notably larger in magnitude compared with prior MBS purchase events.  This likely was the initial investor expectations that the significant size of Desk purchases would MBS to become quite scarce in the market, particularly continued to contract modestly in size.

Another factor contributing to narrower spreads for credit instruments may low net supply of such instruments in the market.  Some investors have observed that after assuming no substantial instruments for the remainder of this This can be seen in the top-right panel.  This has led some market participants to view the new program as likely ahead of the September FOMC meeting mainly due to the successful gains reflected investor perception of reduced short-term tail central banks.  Since the September FOMC meeting, global growth forecasts and some negative earnings Composite Index remains near extent to which growth is slowing.  Steve Kamin will discuss this more in his Overall, despite broad gains in risk assets, investors continue to note a global growth outlook, and the looming fiscal cliff here at home. Similar to credit markets, domestic and most global equity markets experienced a significant rally announcement of the ECB's OMT program.  This can be seen in your middle-left panel.  Those earlier risks in Europe and growing expectations for more-accommodative monetary policy across a number of equities are little changed, on net, as the positive effects of the policy decision were offset by a moderation in earnings surprises in recent days.

As represent a sizable proportion of the gross issuance The Desk issued in the TBA it is easier to purchase The TBA Over the intermeeting period, the Desk purchased $96 billion in agency MBS under the new flow-based purchases expected, the combined purchases activity in the TBA market, where the Desk's purchases are concentrated. continues to concentrate purchases in securities that are newly market, because this market is the most liquid sector, and thus securities in large size without significantly impacting market functioning. market is also used by originators to sell forward most newly originated loans, and so it is closely tied to the primary mortgage rate.

However, market As shown in the upper-left panel, through June 2013 we anticipate that our purchases the supply of newly share similar to that purchased during the first MBS

For example, the agency MBS market saw record growth during the first more closely reflect issuance.  Though these securities have and originators have produced lower-coupon mortgages, we have coupon. Given the size of purchases, the Desk has made some adjustments to its purchase allocation.  As shown in the top-right panel, we have increased our purchases of MBS in the 15-year sector to shorter durations, the shift should alleviate some pressure in the 30-year sector.  As rates have declined also shifted the allocation of purchases to newly issued securities with lower coupons, including the newly issued 2.5 percent

dealer survey.  The lower-left panel shows the dealers' expectations for the forecast for balance sheet size reaches its peak.  The median dealer expects about a $150 billion increase with the flash survey conducted immediately after the September FOMC. The bottom panels report on expectations for an increase in the balance sheet from the size and composition of balance sheet expansion through mid-2014, when the median dealer agency MBS purchases to total $600 billion and Treasury purchases, not including remaining purchases under the MEP, to total $540 billion, for a total of about $1.1 trillion in asset purchases.  This represents compared The increase reflects a firming of expectations that Treasury purchases will continue in 2013.

To attempt to measure this uncertainty, we asked the dealers to With flow-based purchases, investors are uncertain regarding the total increase in the balance sheet. assign probabilities to different outcomes for the level of the SOMA portfolio at the end of 2014.  As seen in your lower-right panel, the probability distribution of dealer

Simon, I'm talking to a number of the originators, I learned that they toward June.  What are your expectations in terms of refinance volume and new purchase volume, and how do you see that unfolding?

Our expectations are shown here in 13.  That's based on Tealbook where interest rates will be, so that might differ a little bit from what some people expect.  We're reasonably confident three to six months ahead in what the issuance MR. POTTER. assumptions of in the market

I would imagine that we'll know more early in the year. much traction the policy will have and what happens in the housing will be, and then issuance period.  We were surprised in September about how much reinvestment we had, and that was because It partly depends on how market.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Simon, in chart 4, on inflation expectations, I could have asked years ago.  I'm never quite sure what the answer is.  How inflation rate compare with our long-run objective of 2 percent on headline PCE?  I ask in part because I've read commentaries who try to relate the two, and wonder how it's calibrated.  I'm going to guess inflation compensation MR. EVANS. have a question that I does the five-year, five-year-forward breakeven inflation of various people that one answer is, it's the CPI, not the PCE.  Then the other is, it's versus inflation expectations, I think, in spite of the heading on this chart.  Any information you could provide on that would be helpful.

of the chart should have said a CPI-linked instrument that we use.  So you could think of the includes an inflation you look at that inflation risk premium is important to understand.  For the the financial crisis because we felt that was biased got reasonably high but then came you plotted the time series. MR. POTTER.  Well, thank you for that.  The heading 'Inflation Compensation.'  It is inflation objective mapping from the 2 percent PCE to somewhere between 2.3 and 2.5 percent. Inflation compensation means that this is not just inflation expectations; it risk premium.  How history, we excluded the period during downward a little bit.  So the five-year, five-year forward back down, and the 2.81 is not unusual if for the translation, you'd back off at leastMR. EVANS.  So

Put 2.3 to 2.5, and then you have to decide what the inflation risk MR. POTTER. premium would be.

MR. EVANS.  Any thoughts on the order of magnitude or the time variation of the risk premium?

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Fisher.

MR. FISHER.  Simon, you mentioned, in reference to number six on exhibit 1, a limited amount of pass-through in terms of the primary mortgage rate.  I suppose the question is, would

October 23-24, 2012

of the offsets, which increase in the fees and so on.  After all, this is our actually taking out mortgages.  So I would expect the MBS pricing to, your standpoint as a you view this. you expect this to increase as we pass through time?  You mentioned some we discussed at the past meetings, the objective.  We're obviously not working for Wells Fargo or J.P. Morgan and have 40 percent of the market.  We're working for the American people, and the objective in terms of efficacy is what happens to people over time, work its way into the mortgage market.  I'm just curious from market operator how

The models that we have, which try to look at the recent relationship you pointed out and other people have competition in the market.  I think Governor years.  You might see right now over the past two years, most of the MR. POTTER. between the secondary rate and primary rate, would suggest we've seen most of the passthrough.  However, some of the structural features that pointed out might suggest that we could see more Duke pointed that out, that this is one area where the banks are actually making money.  That would then disturb the relationship we've estimated over the past few more pass-through, but on the models we have pass-through is there.

could just monitor that as we go through time MR. FISHER.  Maybe, Mr. Chairman, we in terms of the efficacy of the program.

Yes, and then, of course, the ABS market has become pretty Yesterday vehicles, these little four-wheel Target just sold off their is helping.  The other is, as a market operator, at least from my background, that these are signs of concern.  We may be froth in certain markets and maybe, again, could we track this over time from the standpoint of financial red lights or financial stability issues?

That's clearly a concern we've heard from some market participantsyield that could produce some distortions.  So far it seems don't think it's something we should worry you pointed out, I think most good sign if we're getting more securitized loans out there. MR. POTTER. that we would see more reaching for to be in pretty small segments of the market, so I about.  We should monitor it quite carefully.  In terms of the ABS of us would think that's a reasonably auto market. MR. FISHER.  The hottest market right now is, of course, the

In previous briefings, I have presented results from a statistical model that pools estimates of private household and establishment surveys and that also controls for recession-related distortions to seasonal factors.  Updated estimates of the 'signal' from this modelshown as the solid red line in the bottom-right panel-have been in the neighborhood of 100,000 jobs per month, with previous months a little lower than our estimate at the time of the September Tealbook (the dashed red line).  On the household side, we are inclined to discount a portion of the recent drop in the unemployment rate because other indicators-including not only the payroll employment figures but also unemployment insurance claims and various measures of job vacancies appear Nevertheless, we do think that labor market conditions are a little better overall than we were anticipating in September.

However, we made no material revision to our payroll employment forecast and continue to project that, aside from seasonal distortions, private job gains will average about 130,000 per we expect recession-related seasonal distortions to add roughly 20,000 jobs per month in the fourth quarter, bringing the published total to 150,000 jobs.

somewhat brighter picture of the labor market does seem received since September, which coming into the current quarter; are discounting some of last month's spike in single-family starts previously assumed. On the whole, though, a to mesh with the news about spending that we have is likewise somewhat stronger, on balance, than we had expected.  In particular, consumption appears to be on a higher trajectory both retail sales and consumer auto purchases surprised us to the upside last month, as did the recent improvement in the Michigan measure of consumer sentiment. Moreover, while we and permits, the recovery in housing-related activity appears to be on a somewhat steeper path than we had noted in the Tealbook, the recent news about business capital goods have plateaued, while orders have plunged and are now On the downside, as we investment has been worrisome.  As Glenn Follette noted yesterday, shipments of nondefense well below the level of shipments.  That constellation of data is particularly concerning in light of some recent research by Jeremy Nalewaik and Eugénio Pinto of the Board staff, suggesting that shipments respond asymmetrically toward orders and move down especially quickly when orders are below shipments.

good news about consumption and residential construction look growth by year, with the effect on growth unwinding early next year. Nonetheless, the more important to us in terms of their implications for near-term activity; accordingly, we have marked up our projection for second-half real GDP ½ percentage point relative to the September Tealbook.  And I should note that we still expect the drought to shave about ¼ percentage point from real GDP growth in the second half of this modestly, mostly as a consequence of the adjustments to you announced at the conclusion of your last meeting.  You will recall that assumption that the Committee's in some probability of additional policy would be disappointed when this easing failed to occur. your flow-based approach to asset will cumulate to $750 billion in additional purchases of longer-term of the funds rate into line with the you provided in September. Turning to the medium term, as shown in the top-left panel, we have upgraded our projection for real GDP policy that we predicated the September Tealbook on the balance sheet policies and forward guidance would be unchanged from what was then in place.  As markets had already priced easing, we assumed that they In contrast, the latest Tealbook assumes that purchases securities, and it brings our assumption for liftoff forward guidance that

We also still will be addressed in off the sharper fiscal retrenchment implied by current law.

Overall, the contour of our medium-term projection for real GDP broadly similar to our September projection, with a moderate pickup in growth expected over the next couple of this projection right panel).  Combined with our lower assumed jumping-off point, the projected decline in the unemployment rate leaves it at 7¼ ½ percentage point below our September growth is considerably percent by the end of that year.

The incoming data on core PCE price panel-have been about in line with our expectations.  Going forward, we have nudged up our forecast for core inflation in 2014 by one-tenth in response narrower margin of labor market slack in this projection.  We expect core inflation to hold steady inflation expectations, modest increases in imported goods prices, and some remaining slack in resource utilization.

Nonetheless, domestic energy prices are boosted by contrast, food price inflation has surprised us to the downside.  Smoothing through these various revisions, our near-term forecast for middle-left panel-is not too different from the September Tealbook.  Further out, we continue to expect that total PCE inflation will run a little below the core anticipated declines in crude oil prices put downward pressure on retail energy prices.

We do not judge this to be the most probable outcome, but it would become far more likely in the event of another event in the United States or a severe intensification of the crisis in Europe.

happy to take your questions. David and I will now be

Lockhart. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Questions?  President were trying to understand the staff's assumption of the duration of the MBS and your assumption related to any continuation of Treasury purchases after the expiry MEP, and how that connects to your estimate of 2013 employment gains.  I wonder if you as a Committee substantial in the outlook for employment. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  David, while we were going over the Tealbook, we purchases of the could just clarify that.  That's in the context of how we assess improvement or the lack thereof

what it was that you meant by substantial MR. WILCOX.  We engaged in a fair amount of scriptural analysis, I think, just like outside people did by trying to discern exactly improvement in labor market outlook.

'outlook' as having a concordance to 'forecast,' and then we projected pretty flat likelihood function, having gone year, the Committee might be prepared to declare itself as seeing a substantial I would build the case for that is that by the year, if there's any mercy in the world, the fiscal cliff should be at that point policy steps that will definitively put that crisis in the healing process. We interpreted forward.  Now, the truth of the matter is we had a through that sort of textual analysis.  I think there's a plausible case to be made that by the middle of next improvement in the labor market outlook as distinct from measures of employment conditions on the ground prevailing at that time.  The way that middle of next substantially in the rear view mirror.  The uncertainty related to that should be lifting.  By that point on our baseline narrative, European policymakers should have begun to more assertively put in place the kinds of

GDP would I think it's consistent with the Committee's language, as we elimination of some of the downside tail risks, And so although it's still the case that the more substantial acceleration in remain a forecast at that point, imagined it, to believe that those conditions-the

That said, it you pointing to real evidence in the employment markets I read the Tealbook correctly, continued at a fairly muted level of to the fourth quarter of this year; is that correct? MR. LOCKHART.  I don't hear per se in the first half, which, if job creation, basically similar

To put some numbers on it, as David mentioned, we think the growth is going to be about 130,000 in the fourth quarter, and and then gradually pick about 160,000 and then moving up to about 200,000 by the year. MR. WILCOX.  Yes, that's right.  Bill, do you want to add anything? MR. WASCHER. underlying pace of private payroll we're expecting that to continue with that same pace in the first quarter up.  In the second quarter, we have end of the would end at that point. At that point, we decided that the outlook will have improved enough for asset purchases to end.  The employment numbers are starting to pick up to above 150,000 and move up over the course of the second half to about 200,000.  Given that outlook we made the decision in the forecast to assume that asset purchases

MR. FISHER.  Steve, of a cable and a conversation with now Vice Premier Communist Party how he and the Politburo got the best measurement of economic shipments and electricity consumption as well as lending you have as well, but I have a question at the end of few data points.  One is that electricity consumption, at least in the series that we've robust number.  If you look at down 7 percent, and that's the lowest we can construct 2003.  And last, intercoastal shipping activity has dropped 34 percent, wondering if we are able to parse from that how much is related to fallow might tell us about their own domestic activity and how weak things really you look at the indicators that I just mentioned, the growth rate, which I've We've been tracking this.  I'm sure making a been able to construct, is expanding at about 2 percent-not a very freight in terms of train shipments, it's going all the way back to year to date.  So I'm export activity-you mentioned Europe, which is certainly hurting, and the slowdown elsewhere-or what it are.  Because if always found suspect, would seem to be much less than what they're reporting.  I wonder what your take is on that.

the official GDP data understate the true growth of the economy. MR. KAMIN.  Sure.  First of all, we've been very alert to two issues that are related. One of them is whether

Oh, I'm sorry.  Overstate.  Thank you.

MR. FISHER.  Overstate or understate?

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

developed these issues, and we have a box in MR. KAMIN.  And second, as a related matter, has the slowdown in China been steeper than the official data would suggest?  We actually the Tealbook that addresses them, and I'll just mention some of the issues.

Chinese GDP growth.  In fact, in the third at least by our seasonal adjustment estimates, it seems to have popped up a little bit.  By your freight cars or some of the other issues.  Actually, since a particular weak with export activity could show steeper declines than GDP growth generally, First of all, electricity production, indeed, has tailed down over time, but it is reasonably well correlated with the ups and downs of official quarter, that metric, the movements in the official data don't seem broadly out of line, although we haven't looked at spot for the Chinese economy has been exports, I could easily imagine that some indicators that are most correlated so that's one area of investigation we've pursued.

growth to three indicators:  retail sales, import growth, and industrial well in terms of its ups and exceptional degree lately, they'd growth, but also to these other indicators, which I won't that seems less likely. Another focus of our analysis has been to note that we've used a short-term forecasting model that relates GDP production.  Over time, that has tracked official GDP growth pretty downs.  If the Chinese authorities were fudging the data to an have to be doing it not only with GDP rule out as impossible, but

I mentioned, since the Tealbook was put to bed, the Chinese GDP in the third quarter, which looked stronger.  That was, indeed, IP data that they released at the same time. would be looking at quarter-to-quarter annual rate GDP growth of like actual data suggest 8 percent, and we're going with that. One final point is, as released new data for consistent with the stronger tone of retail sales and By our model, we actually 8½ percent, but the

October 23-24, 2012

100 percent confident about the guns, So long story short, for obvious reasons we're not official data that the Chinese have released, but we haven't been able to find any smoking as it were, that the data are basically distorting in a significant way our view as to what's happening.

MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

One other point on the whole electricity-GDP really big user of and so to the extent that the manufacturing sector is example, you're going to see a disproportionate decline in that manufacturing you look at the household sector, consumption seems to be you break the electricity consumption down by sectors, you can reconcile electricity consumption.

What seems to be happening in China is activity is under some pressure, but if doing quite well.  So if the weak

Our business contacts report that their desire to engage in cap-ex or hiring has declined significantly since the beginning of the year.  As you can guess, the one-word explanation for their caution is uncertainty, primarily about MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As think that the economic tale is an unusually tangled one.  There are definitely positive signs.  In the Minnesota labor market, the number of job vacancies their pre-recession levels.  At the same time, Minnesota's unemployment rate was 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 2012, only about a percentage point higher than in the second quarter of 2007.

For example, a large equipment manufacturer said that the nearthe balloon.  But he expects a pickup in activity As to September.

I had been expecting to hear a end of the possible on uncertainty and caution.  This fall, businesses have avoided making forward-looking commitments as much as is practical, as we have heard from others around the table.  Another heavy equipment manufacturer told me they put on hold any new spending in November and December.  They have plans in place to muddle through the rest of 2012, and then we will see where things stand in January.  After all, with demand so sluggish, the opportunity cost for waiting is about zero at the moment.  These kinds of comments suggest that we won't be seeing any significant cap-ex or labor expansions in the fourth quarter.

The risk assessments in the Tealbook-and here I am referring to page 96 of Tealbook A-show that in the BVAR, the tilted to the upside, not to the downside.  So there is more probability of an upside outcome than a downside one.  Now, of course, the account some of the more intangible does suggest that the underlying data history around the table have spoken at different times about the difficulty in determining These same conceptual and measurement issues plague our measurement of output gaps.  The Budget Office currently estimates a large gap between actual and potential GDP. to estimate potential output reliably in real For example, after the 2001 recession, real was Many the longer-run equilibrium level of unemployment.  We acknowledged those challenges in January when we explained why we do not have a numerical employment target. types of Congressional But many economists are skeptical about our ability time, and with good reason.  In fact, the CBO tends to revise down its path of potential outputboth the level and growth rate-around recessions. output never returned to the level of potential implied by the potential growth rate the CBO

If there had been no revision in potential gap from the start of the 2001 recession through the adjusted this gap is zero at the start of the 2001 recession. projecting output, it would have meant that the average start of the 2007 recession would have been minus 3.4 percent.  And I have calculation so that the their calculation with the latest vintage of potential output.  Potential output now a positive output gap near the end of the Indeed, what happened was potential output was revised down and eliminated the revised downward as potential is revised down.

We repeated has been revised downward showing that there is boom years. gap.  This should give us some pause about expecting to return to the projected path of potential from the recent peak.

estimated to be minus 4 percent.  That is, the end-2011 gap gap is not as large as we Indeed, the staff estimates of the size of the gap continue to shrink.  In the January 2012 Tealbook, Board staff estimated the output gap at the end of 2011 to be minus 5.7 percent.  In the latest Tealbook, that 2011 gap is now is 30 percent lower today than it was in January.  So, in retrospect, the thought it was.  Did we overreact in January when we extended our forward guidance?  My point is that, looking forward, just since the previous Tealbook, the gaps for 2012 and 2013 have been revised down about ½ percentage point.  I am curious as to how much further they will end up being revised down by the end of January.

As the output gap has narrowed, we have seen little change in the unemployment rate forecast, but upward revisions in the inflation forecast.  We had a very useful discussion at our

October 23-24, 2012

about the influence of the estimated output gap on the inflation outlook.  What effect on inflation, while expected inflation of an effect.  That is, the coefficient on the gap in the expectationsPhillips curve is quite small.  This suggests two things to me.  First, we need to be reason to be confident inflation will remain subdued attuned, then, to changes in inflation expectations and evidence that expectations can we push on accommodation before we consume our credibility in that communication about our policy March meeting we learned is that the output gap is having less of an seems to be having more augmented cautious in relying on resource slack as a going forward, and that is even independent of the measurement problem.  Second, we have to be particularly are becoming less well anchored.  So far, those expectations have not unraveled on us.  How much longer or harder regard?  This puts even more burden than usual on clear intentions.

concern that the open-ended nature of our LSAP program could have action.  I certainly hope that and that we will be able to exit gracefully.  But I don't think we and the economy and greatly undermine our exit plans.  Going forward, I have some destabilizing effects on inflation expectations.  And as we have been discussing, those expectations did rise, at least as far as the TIPS markets, since that all things will play out smoothly, can rule out that things won't necessarily move in a smooth, continuous fashion.  As the time for liftoff approaches, we could see a significant jump in long rates, which could potentially be very disruptive to the markets we need to keep in mind our exit strategy as we make our policy decisions.

The same improvement in confidence since mid-September is evident in the daily Gallup poll, although, interestingly, it is confined to Democrats and Independents.  Incoming data on housing has also been upbeat.  In contrast to this encouraging news, data pertaining to the business sector reveals disconcerting trends.  We have seen goods orders and sluggishness in manufacturing output.  Moreover, surveys suggest that confidence among businesses is weak.  They seem preoccupied with the prospects for Narayana and Richard noted, in the NFIB, for example, small business hiring plans recently plunged.  The latest Conference about both current

I, therefore, think that at our December meeting, we must be prepared to asset purchases to replace extension program. The latest employment report contains similarly conflicting signals.  On the unemployment rate declined notably, which is a welcome and favorable development.  Some of the decline may conceivably reflect statistical noise, but the fact that the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the Gallup poll also declined by a similar and mid-October supports the view that there is signal in this decline.  The Gallup poll is a completely independent survey that reaches around 30,000 households over a 30-day period.  In contrast, private nonfarm payroll gains were lackluster.  The magnitude of household survey briefing, when adjustments are made to put the household survey measure conceptual basis as the payroll survey, the two figures come into close 100,000.

Higher inflation expectations lower real interest rates, thereby boosting spending.

meeting.  So in light of our actions at that meeting, I prepared for this a deep dive into the mortgage business. MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  My outlook for the economy hasn't changed much since our previous one by taking remaining credit headwind But I believe that it will be necessary to maintain a steady level of rates given through to a wide range of potential home purchasers.  Transmission and longer than in other credit markets as a operational features of this market that I would like to discuss in some I strongly believe that the mortgage lending market is the only that is retarding economic growth and that it is in mortgages and housing that monetary policy still has some potency. for quite a long time before that level works through the housing market, and that significantly lowering the rate might actually be counterproductive in terms of the degree to which any level of rates finds its way in mortgage markets is taking longer than normal result of three somewhat detail.

The historical clearly to a relationship between the refinance index and the primaryIf so, the spread itself should actually attract additional capacity.  But I think recent data would be to remember that a steady release of new come as rates have steadily gone lower and as changes have been made getting refreshed. President Fisher data seem to point pretty secondary spread.  This is generally attributed to capacity constraints and lenders' efforts to regulate demand. that one caution in interpreting the refinancing demand has to government programs such as HARP2, so that demand keeps

So for the largest current volume is 70 to 80 percent refi business, and they believe that their In addition, the originators are much less willing to add capacity to meet refinance demand than to meet demand for purchase mortgages, as President they view refis as likely to be only originators, the

would expect banks to reconsider the conditions for the lower-quality borrowers.  If you your basket with perfect apples, there is no reason to sort through the ones less than are satisfactory.  Furthermore, I think the real economic impetus for and increases in house prices rather than as refinancing mostly shifts cash flow from lenders to borrowers with only small reasons, I think it is actually more productive to hold rates at means sending top-quality borrowers back through the refinance line again.  To be I don't see much point in lowering them either. I suspect the same capacity issues that create wider pricing also contribute to tighter standards.  We have already seen standards ease in the C&amp;I market and the auto market, as banks' appetite for assets has sharpened the competition.  So once the easy refinances are done and excess capacity starts to show up in pipelines, then I credit overlays that are currently tightening can fill perfect to find some that mortgage rates comes from home purchases refinancing, pickups in net spending.  For these the same low level long enough to work through the refinance pipeline.  That is, to keep lowering rates clear, I don't favor allowing rates to rise, but

I believe it is going to take a long time for the effect of a given The second reason why level of mortgage rates to work its way into the economy is that the appraisal process creates some real friction in the adjustment of house prices.  Two commonly used measures of the

October 23-24, 2012

an affordability index that compares median income a comparison of debt service to comparable property.  In both measures, it is the mortgage interest rate that appropriate level of overall house prices are levels to debt service requirements for a median price home and rental rates for a drives the debt service calculation and, thus, house prices.

an individual purchaser would be willing to who needs financing is able to value determined by appraisal.  Residential appraisals use only approach or replacement cost. cash to a are able to realize higher rental returns comparable sales analysis but below In much the same way, as long as the price of existing homes appraisals high enough to allow them to purchase the homes at a profit.  Even in the consider the direction of prices in the market.  So if prices These factors certainly influence the price pay, but it is the appraisal that determines the price a purchaser pay.  Credit-dependent borrowers are limited by the interaction of loan-to-value requirements of lenders and the property comparable sales to derive price.  They don't consider the income So the price adjustments must work their way through less credit-constrained actors before they will show up in comparable sales.  For example, investors, who tend to bring more purchase, benefit when the appraisals used for mortgage approvals don't consider the alternative cost of renting and potential income from rents.  So they by purchasing at prices that are higher than indicated by the the value of the rental alternative. is well below replacement cost, builders are reluctant to build because the potential buyers can't get comparable sales analysis, appraisers are falling, the price of an older comparable sale is marked down.  And if prices are rising, the reverse happens.  Thus, the direction of house price changes reinforces momentum.

who can pay more to win a property, will do so.  And then, as appraisal values and allow the pool of potential to grow, as borrowers with less cash receive appraisals high enough to justify their loans. I believe we are only beginning to see the current level of mortgage rates work through the and I expect prices to still climb substantially faster than in the Tealbook. Over time, if demand is strong relative to supply, as it seems to be now, those buyers who are less dependent on financing, those sales are recorded, they will increase buyers But higher prices, restrict credit and work against improvement in the housing market.  Risk weights GSE prime, 'bright line' debt-to-income ratios-as proxies for But I fear that these proxies will generate an alarming number of false Finally, I think we must be quite vigilant to ensure that regulatory policy doesn't unnecessarily in capital rules, QM, QRM, servicing standards, lender compensation rules, and escrow requirements all use various loan structures such as balloon payments, pricing over or underwriting characteristics-such as problematic practices. positives and will close out borrowers or properties with nonstandard features from credit as those who make nonstandard loans find it increasingly difficult to maintain compliance.

able to piece together a picture of the role of community banks in the are more important than you might think.  Consider these factoids: The combination and complexity of all of these new rules seems particularly likely to close smaller banks out of the mortgage lending business.  Using HMDA data, Call Report data, and Y-9 data, I was mortgage market, and they According to HMDA data, the number of mortgage originations has dropped from 11.4 million in 2004 to 5.9 million in 2011.  And even though it might seem like the mortgage lending market

October 23-24, 2012

and credit unions have is more concentrated at the top, the share of loans originated by large banks was 52 percent in 2004, and it actually dropped slightly to 49 percent in 2011.  The nonbank share of originations was 32 percent in 2004 and fell to 27 percent in 2011.  Community banks picked up the slack.  With only 16 percent of originations in 2004, these small institutions were booking nearly one-fourth of all originations by 2011.

show a similar pattern in originations for data are only available back to 2007.  In the first quarter of 2007, small bank accounted for less than 10 percent of mortgage loan sales.  However, by the for nearly from origination for sale has attracted new banks reporting any income from sales, securitization, or servicing of entrants are small, it will take a lot of them to make up Data from the Call Reports and the Y-9 filings sale, but these holding companies second quarter of 2012, these institutions had almost doubled their share, accounting 20 percent of sales.  And, indeed, the net income entrants.  The number of mortgage loans has shown a substantial increase since 2007, with much of the entry occurring as the recession ended in the first half of 2009.  Recent quarters have seen the entry of about 30 additional banks.  But because the new for any pullback by the larger players.

So community banks are a small but not insignificant part of the loan economics for these institutions encourage entry, and they are able to In addition, not to be overlooked are the loans held on the sold, which are a substantial fraction of small banks' originations. It does look like mortgage sales activity makes more of a difference to small banks than large ones.

I went over what would be expected from a lightning round, but I Mr. Chairman, I realize promise to hold Governor Tarullo to his promise [laughter], and to hold my own comments very short tomorrow.  Thank you.

you, Mr. Chairman.  I have four points to make in this soon-toeconomy is going forward but without a whole lot of traction.  This is that I've noticed that each time we have a get a little bit of growth in the economy.  Then, the next good.  Instead of one area that gets some traction areas to build off of it, we seem still to be bouncing around a little bit in growth rates. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  That was very high value.  Governor Tarullo. MR. TARULLO.  Thank be-enforced two minutes.  [Laughter]  My first point relates to the basic picture.  The still slogging along, which is to say really just a variation on the basic metaphor, which is little burst of data that looks good we quarter it's a different data stream that looks and then allows other the economy, which I think is why in the end we still have these disappointing getting traction, as you have mentioned, and I just note that there is still an awful lot of regional variation My second point is on housing, which is an area that does seem to be several of

I think the situation was well put by the chief economist for Zillow this released its latest housing price index.  He said, 'The housing market is on the in both sales and pricing. morning when it mend, but the housing bottom will be a protracted one.'

I think most of you do, that downside risks still risks by a substantial margin, but I guess I do think that the downside risks have a bit since the September meeting, particularly on the foreign side.  It seems to were six or seven weeks ago, although there's no guarantee that three or four months from now they will not darken again.  Obviously, there's been fiscal situation domestically. My third point relates to risks.  I think, as outweigh upside actually receded me-at least in the near term with respect to both geopolitical and economic risks-things are a little less dark than they three-and-a-half or no change on the

I would term 'indicators of dynamism' in the labor market.  It does seem to me as though no means the only for us to be looking at.  The unemployment rate, as mentioned in the earlier even as things are improving.  If job creation pulls people in from the group into the participating group, the unemployment rate may not go down actually is a good deal of dynamism in the labor market.  I like the a sense a dynamism, looking at hiring, openings, and to rest a lot on JOLTS because each of those can vary a good bit for idiosyncratic reasons from month to month.  So I Fourth and finally, with respect to the labor market and, specifically, how to judge improvement in the outlook for the labor market, I would make a pitch now for an emphasis on what the monthly job creation numbers are probably the single best-though by good-indicator go-round, can vary some nonparticipating much even though there JOLTS report as well because it gives separations together, but I think it's a little harder factors individually would put the most emphasis on the net job creation numbers, and it's worth noting in this regard

October 23-24, 2012

good that only one out of the past seven months has had what could fairly be characterized as a job creation report, and even that one-which was the 180,000 in July-was hardly spectacular.

would hope that between now and December when we have to make an evaluation, we as I said, I would like to put in a pitch for the sustained increases in job creation, I can be bouncing these potential criteria back and forth off one another-virtually, if not in person.  But which, to me at least, would have to be significantly north of 150,000.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Raskin.

Given the constraints of time I'll focus my you, I'm encouraged by some of the good a earlier this year as a matter of fact, and those weren't a sign that consumer spending MS.

Of course, we've seen strong spending months before in this recovery, as recently as was turning up substantially.  But maybe the rise in spending seems more sustainable this time. Why might this be?

President Kocherlakota, consumer sentiment has improved conditions has improved.  Concerns about unemployment have about future conditions has picked up.  Indeed, even consumers' year, a measure that had stayed stubbornly low this recovery, has moved up noticeably. For one thing, as noted by markedly.  The jump in sentiment has lasted two months now, and it seems to be pretty broad based.  Sentiment about current lessened, and confidence expectations about their income in the coming throughout

Until recently, weak, according to the Board staff, a factor that likely has in October for the first time in about a year, going to turn more decidedly positive. The more-positive readings on the stock market and the housing market suggest that the upward movements in confidence may have some we cannot sentiment had been surprisingly contributed to the sluggish pace of spending.  But sentiment has become surprisingly strong.  This seems like just the kind of news we would need to start seeing if things were really encouragement I'd like to mention is the rise in home values.  As little bit.  And as I mentioned, rising home values are likely Another area of homeowners see their net wealth and thus their lifetime resources increasing, this is likely to support their spending, at least a improving households' economic outlooks and their expectations for the future.  In addition, of course, once potential homeowners stop fearing that they might buy in a falling market, home purchases become a better bet.

I think there's yet another way that the rise in house prices could be helping the year, 1.3 million borrowers moved from having negative equity positive equity.

Since the start of the in their homes to having and almost underwater mortgages accounted for 27 percent of all residential properties with a mortgage, down from close to 30 percent at the end of last number, it represents a nontrivial number of households who, if they can access the refinance, could take advantage of the current low mortgage rates to create lower monthly

The potential starting to move in the right direction.  Of course, as President tapping into low mortgage rates demands a strong consensus on how such credit constraints could be alleviated.

I've mainly been focused on the changes I perceive in economic It's easy to get excited that conditions may be finally we still have a long, long way to go before we can have any sense of see some signs of In these observations conditions in the household sector, but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the level of economic activity is still really lousy. starting to improve, but satisfaction with the economy.  Nonetheless, it's nice for once to be able to encouragement in the household sector.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

MBS purchase component, might affect things in these areas going Like President Rosengren, I was very struck by the market response to our There are different measures of it, but one number that I remember was something announcement.  That's a big, big number. MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  In thinking about the outlook, I've also taken note of some of the same emerging bright spots that others have:  retail sales, consumer confidence, and housing starts.  I've been wondering how our policy actions from the previous meeting, particularly the forward. September 13 announcement and, in particular, how much MBS rates moved relative to Treasuries. like 40-plus basis points on the option-adjusted spread of mortgages to Treasuries in the first week after the what has happened-you could have had two theories going in.  One theory you're taking out of the market and whether is to some extent, secondary.  That's how the FRB/US To caricature is that all that really matters is how much duration you do it by buying Treasuries or MBS

October 23-24, 2012

it have approached it.  The other extreme, and of you have a very highly segmented market, and there's essentially you touch it is where it's going to stick.  And it seems like the dataand other models that we've used to think about course, I'm just caricaturing, is a flypaper effect:  Where when there's this kind of outlier in the picture-have been trying to speak in favor of segmented markets, not as a general statement about the world, but at least in this particular case at this particular point in time.

expect, and it means that things are we intended and maybe we should think about tilting our mix back expected.  You could argue it My guess is if you're a FRB/US literalist, you might say this is not the best thing in of the lower elasticity of substitution-sure, I'm moving MBS rates by more, a small economy, and maybe you'd rather have 10 or 15 basis points on the Treasury than you think about the 40 basis points of you adopt the view that I'll associate with President Fisher, which pretty insensitive to further movements in the market segmentation is in some sense your friend because it's allowing your ammunition on a part of the world that is arguably more sensitive to financial those things don't feel like a big thing in the model, I'm a little bit This leads to the question as to whether this market segmentation is something we should think is a good feature or is something that we didn't really not working out the way toward Treasuries because it's somehow not working the way we either way. the world because but that has to come at the expense of moving other rates by less, and housing is only sector of the 40 basis points on MBS.  You just don't get enough if MBS in a model.  However, if is that the nonfinancial corporate world is probably rates that they face, then you to focus conditions.  Even with the partial pass-through from the secondary to the primary, we have gotten a significant move, and as Governor Duke suggests, we may, with sustained pressure, hope to see more.  And even if with Eric in thinking that right now the timing is such that a push in the right direction on

October 23-24, 2012

gotten a little bit lucky with MBS purchases in the way about those components of the outlook that are most closely connected to lower housing might have a bigger effect than it otherwise might in other circumstances.  My general inclination is to think that we've actually that they've played out, and as a result, I'm a little more optimistic about the outlook in general and especially mortgage rates.

you have to believe that this effect on MBS spreads will be durable, and when you thinking about very low elasticities of substitution, it may be that that elasticity is low in the course, in the long run, if there are these big movements in spreads, people are for yield elsewhere, and things may look different at a one-month horizon I don't know Where is it going to stick at a more intermediate horizon?  And then, of I think if we do and housing. Now, of course, this is all contingent on two things, and two things that are a little hard to know.  One is start short run.  But of going to start hunting than they do at a one-week horizon.  We have seen some retracing of the effects. how to quite think about this, but this a very important thing for us to think about in terms of the efficacy of the policies: course, second, there's the whole issue of pass-through to the primary rate.  But okay on both of these dimensions, and we push on this for a while, I can imagine that we would see some further positive momentum on consumer spending

I see some improvement at the world with 2 percent inflation and 2 percent economic growth, enough to reduce unemployment.  Like others, I found a a fairly strong run of data, being to It has been well covered by around the table, so I'll skip to the punch line on that dichotomy to say that it's not easy to MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  While margin, it still feels to me like a which is obviously not strong dichotomy between the household sector, where there's been some extent canceled out by the weakness of the business sector. many

activity here at home.  Or it could be that businesses are seeing weakness that the versa.  I guess time will tell. generate a story that accounts for both the strength in households and the weakness and uncertainty in business.  I think the hope has to be that a good part of the business weakness comes from the decline in global trade, as President Plosser suggested, and that does seem to be part of the story-the overall weakness in Europe and Asia and the decline in global traderather than households haven't seen yet but soon will or vice will just mention a couple things that I thought were interesting in my conversations I talked to are now saying that more positive regarding Europe after the example, the founder of a large it had gone heavily to cash at the time of the Greek now and it's safe to invest and it's safe to stay invested, despite expectations of bumps a big change in risk sentiment in the past 60 days, and it's much broader than courageous few.  So I central bank stepping in and cutting off tail risk. I with investors.  First, a number of hedge fund managers that thanks to the ECB, sentiment has turned markedly events culminating in the OMTs at the end of the summer.  For multi-strategy hedge fund told me that elections in June, and his firm now believes that post-OMT the bad outcome is really off the table for in the road.  That's just the handful of firms that are buying peripheral sovereign debt, the think it's really a

I would share is that a number of investors said to me in the 'Well, your policy is working,' but what they meant And one place that is was not a lot of pass-through in our corporates, but the pass-through a reach for a yield.  Investors are for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, anything with a decent yield. In that light, the second thing past few weeks the same phrase, which is, in context was, 'Well, you want people to take some risk, and they are.' showing up big time is in lower-quality fixed income.  There September announcement to Treasuries or to super high-grade to BBBs and to high yield was very strong, and it does speak of clamoring

October 23-24, 2012

of a cautionary that deals are being done in the high-yield market on terms that are 2005 to 2007.  You've got the return of dividend deals, and in peaky, bubbly and more of those. So that part of it is working.  In fact, a number of investors-this is a bit note, more than a bit-say very similar to the bubble terms of a dividend deal, ownership doesn't change hands, but fixed-income investors fund a large onetime dividend to private equity investors, and it typically involves structural subordination, peak leverage levels, payment-in-kind bonds, and no covenants.  So this is a very structure, and we're seeing more a large industrial deal that I'm pretty familiar with that is weeks.  It's rated CCC by both Moody's and markets there is no CCC market for paper, and this is being done at 6 percent.  So private equity than they are the spread, and under 6 percent for that kind of all-time record, again, very reminiscent of a bubble period. In the new deal market, there's being done at 6¼ times leverage in the next few S&amp;P.  In most ordinary 6¼ times leverage with a weighted average cost of capital of under firms are more focused on the level paper is an

yet see the return of that leveraged yet.  There's sort of a cap around $5 billion, and you don't see dealers I think all three of these things are positives for holding down of this emerging bubble, if you will.  But we've seen the competitive definitely worth eye on.  I pass that along.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So demand for leveraged loans and high-yield bonds is far in excess of supply.  This can be expected to continue.  On the bright side, you do not mark-to-market structure that was so unstable in the crash, and you also don't see very large deals getting done committing their balance sheets. the systemic risk aspects dynamic develop into a race to the bottom before, and so these markets are keeping a close

October 24 Session

I'd start today with a few comments on the you, I was struck by the difference between consumer and Business section this morning, and the 'Firms Don't Share Consumer Optimism.'  I'm wondering why that is.  One greater exposure to the global economy. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  I thought economic go-round.  Like many of business attitudes.  I opened up The New York Times headline was reason might be that businesses have

I were at the IMF meetings in Tokyo last weekend, and the mood was pretty IMF has downgraded its global economic growth outlook.  We know that U.S. real exports were down in both July and August.  So there is a sense that global growth course, in the international meetings you have a much closer sense of the Janet and dour.  The merchandise is slowing, and of European situation, which continues to be a concern.

also more attuned to the fiscal situation than everyone mentioned the fiscal cliff yesterday.  I point out that even if the fiscal cliff is resolved, we have also the debt limit and the case.  The Tealbook estimates a minus year, and I think other analysts have had bigger numbers than that.  So that is I think it's also possible that firms are households, and I would point out that virtually would also fact that fiscal headwinds are still fairly significant in any 1 percent drag next going to be a problem.

guess the good news on households is that they do provide potentially some traction for yesterday, through wealth effects-if they're rising house prices both increase demand and improve creditworthiness I monetary policy, as was noted by several people reacting to stock prices and house prices through the housing market.  We talked about a possible positive dynamic where and the willingness of banks to lend.  Finally, auto sales should not be ignored.  Those have been a source of strength as well.  So we continue to have a mixed outlook, and in many ways the U.S.

October 23-24, 2012

global peers, but we, of course, are part of the global is doing a little better than some of our economy.

word should be said about inflation.  No one mentioned the price of gas, which of months, the CPI was very much affected by you've noticed that that's largely reversed, and we should see adjusted gas prices fall to about $3.30 in the next month or two.  That will be a past three months is at an annual rate, and the past six months is 1.28 percent at an annual rate, so core attention to, including food.  That index is flat for the with the general view that I think a of course is a very salient price.  The past couple increases in gas prices.  I'm sure not seasonally plus both for inflation and also for consumer spending.  Core inflation remains subdued.  The run rates for PCE core inflation, including the staff estimate for September, the 0.93 percent inflation does remain a bit below our target.  And I have regularly cited here the commodity spot price ex energy, which is interesting to pay year and down 16 percent from its April 2011 high.  So I agree inflation, at the moment at least, is fairly moderate.

wanted to take a couple of minutes to report on a simple, back-of-the-envelope exercise I did to try to understand better recent developments.  At the IMF meetings in Tokyo, and the IMF made waves by upping their estimates of fiscal multipliers and, changing some of their recommendations about austerity.  The way that that analysis errors that the IMF had made for different had been overly optimistic were also those concluded from that that maybe they had austerity impact. I that Olivier Blanchard therefore, was done was that Olivier looked at the forecast countries and noted that the countries where they countries that had taken austerity measures, and they underestimated the

Tealbook because it actually has a forecast with In a similar spirit, I looked back and asked what were the sources of the forecast errors that the Tealbook made-and I only pick on the

October 23-24, 2012

as a Committee don't have.  I looked at the forecast for 2012 that was years ago in the October 2010 meeting.  I thought by doing that I could learn and try to understand better how the economy is I did this, I took it back to the staff.  They noted that they are working on a more was very interesting because year by a large 4 percentage year would be 8.0 percent, which is identical to what the Tealbook given that estimate, the October 2010 Tealbook also 4.0 percent.  So there major revisions to the output data going back to 2009 so that actual production was lower than all the details, which we made two something about what's been happening evolving.  After elaborate version of this for the Committee in the next couple of meetings.  This was just a very rough preliminary look at this issue.  When I did this, I noticed it the October 2010 Tealbook overestimated the level of real GDP this points, but at the same time, the October 2010 Tealbook estimated that unemployment in the fourth quarter of this currently estimates.  Not surprisingly, estimated that the output gap would be 3.7 percent.  The current estimate is has been some variation, President Plosser, but at least two years ago they had it about right:  an overestimate of total output, but a correct estimate of unemployment and slack.  The way they reconcile that, naturally, is by downgrading potential output, and indeed, a lot of this is the result of anticipated.

problem from the perspective of the FRB/US model because the Say's law, which works as follows:  If there is a drop in longreduce their aggregate demand proportionally as a permanent income effect.  If we that their potential output was lower and it's Now, the combination of lower real potential output and unchanged slack is actually not contradictory.  It's not a FRB/US model has in it a kind of run productivity or long-run permanent income, and households and businesses recognize that, then they think of this as the public learning at the same time

October 23-24, 2012

comes down by the same amount. going to be lower, then total output comes down because potential output is down, but slack is unchanged because aggregate demand errors are broadly consistent with this story.  For example, household consumption was rate was predicted to be 5.3 percent, and in fact, it was a little bit more willing to spend than was on household behavior other than the fact that That would be the diagnosis that the forecast errors would suggest.  Now, the other forecast over-forecasted in 2010, but it was over-forecasted by about the same amount as disposable personal income.  In fact, the saving 3.8 percent.  So households, if anything, were expected, and indeed, household durable spending was actually higher than was forecast two years ago.  There's not been any unexpected drag they've become more pessimistic about their longer-run income.  That's consistent.

close to what actually more favorable than exports were higher than expected.  All of that is consistent, again, with of the forecast error was potential output, which by the way was about capital deepening and less participation, so all Also residential investment and business investment in 2012 were pretty was forecast in 2010, just a bit below, and the trade balance was anticipated.  That is, net this view that the source half from TFP growth and then the rest from less three components of potential output.

expenditure that doesn't quite fit this story is government spending. government spending by state, local, and federal was 6 percentage points lower this quite a big number.  Some of that could just be that with lower revenues, governments also cut back on their spending.  But it am waiting for the more-detailed analysis from the staffThe one category of Total real year than was anticipated two years ago, which is part of the fact seems to me that-and again, I unanticipatedly tight fiscal policy might be part of the story.

October 23-24, 2012

at the difference between total inflation and core inflation, that spread is core can be attributed both to some pass-through from those energy shocks, but labor costs were higher than expected, that story. The Tealbook also underpredicted both total and core inflation, and you can tie this back in to the story.  Looking bigger than expected, so obviously, energy price shocks and so on were larger than anticipated, and of course, that may have had some effect on aggregate demand as well.  But the higher inflation presumably also if productivity was lower than expected, then unit and that could be part of a very rough, back-of-the-envelope outlook from 2010 to now is on the level of real that they were revised down, and perhaps there was over-extrapolation of the strong part of the story.  In addition, there have you know, and some unexpected fiscal contraction. To summarize-and again, please take this as exercise-it seems like the biggest change in the GDP and potential output.  The major issue was the fact that the data were overoptimistic in the sense productivity numbers we saw during the crisis-that's been energy price shocks, as

find this quite interesting.  One issue that this bears on is the story we tell story that you hear a lot is what is now known as the Reinhart-Rogoff financial crises lead to very slow recoveries, and sometimes the implicit causing the economy to grow too slowly.  I think What you could as saying is that the financial crisis may have disrupted to some extent the TFP deepening, through entrepreneurial activities, Now, again, I about the recovery.  One story, which says that message is that all we can do is wait it out and hope it gets better.  The other story is that aggregate demand is insufficient, and that's what this shows is that both of these stories can be right at the same time. interpret this growth through capital allocation, through capital et cetera, and that slowed down potential output growth.  But, at the same time, the slow growth, the slow recovery, the shock of the crisis, all of those things have also made businesses and

October 23-24, 2012

households pessimistic about the future and depressed aggregate demand and, therefore, created an output gap reflected in the unemployment rate.

I guess, is that there are, therefore, two reasons to will eventually pick up.  One is that as the financial crisis wears off, so to also a temporary source of growth.  Again, I found that interesting. The most positive implication of this, think that the economy speak, we should see perhaps somewhat more normal output growth or TFP growth.  At the same time, if the economy begins to return to full employment, that's faster-than-normal about how this bears on our definition of substantial good was basically That was an issue that was raised yesterday.  But case, it does suggest that we need to look at a number of factors as we think about labor If there are no comments or questions on the economic Policy,' and ask Bill English to introduce it. That last point, I thought improvement in the labor market.  In this case, the unemployment rate would have been a pretty good measure since it was correlated with slack, which is sort of what we're about.  Payrolls would have been a little bit less good, but the reason payrolls were less because participation was lower than expected. in any market conditions.  I'll stop there.  Okay. go-round, let me turn to item 4, 'Current Monetary

I think this is in line with Lockhart was asking yesterday.  This is leading me to be comfortable alternative A.  If someone was of the opinion alternative A, the substantial improvement language Should we convey preferences for a different alternative?  I'm not quite alternative B versus alternative A since alternative B MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  Bill, of the size of the asset purchases seems to be suggesting the question that President interpreting substantial improvement in line with that we were expecting something like an isn't sufficient for that. sure how to make these judgments about

MR. ENGLISH.  I'm not sure if there was a question there or not.  [Laughter]

MR. EVANS.  Well, I'm surprised.

I thought the are different than what we've written I mean, we had to write down our alternatives before we had the dealer from immediately after the September for this meeting.  So where we were writing down balance sheet sizes that were, to us, yesterday-but are not that well aligned with what's in markets. MR. ENGLISH.  I wanted to present this information precisely because expectations in markets for the total amount of purchases down in alternative B. survey in hand.  The dealers' expectations moved meeting, when the Desk did kind of a flash survey, to the final dealer survey we ended up in a place reasonable-as we discussed were likely to guess? MR. EVANS.  Okay.  This seems like a normal type of adjustment that we get with qualitative types of guidance, I

communications issue that would have MR. ENGLISH.  I think that's right.  I think it's a to be addressed.

MR. EVANS.  Thank you very much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Raskin.

I noticed that in all three alternatives, in the first energy prices. you could elaborate a little bit on that decision, especially given the fact that in actually heard very little about higher energy prices.  If, in fact, we were to I wonder whether we'd be maybe signaling more than we're I just wanted to hear your thoughts on including energy prices. MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  Bill, paragraph in terms of our statement of current conditions we're mentioning higher I'm wondering if the go-round we make a change in this direction, actually seeing.

October 23-24, 2012

ENGLISH.  The past couple of CPI releases, for example, have had pretty high energy prices, and so it seemed to statement of what have we seen over the really weren't that subdued over the past couple of months.  They were due to energy prices, and this is not something people should be concerned about as an MR. headline numbers, and the reason underlying that is basically us that paragraph 1 is kind of a backward-looking intermeeting period, and it seemed appropriate to say something like this.  It was a little uncomfortable to stick with the language we had about inflation having been subdued because the headline numbers kind of to the high side, but they were to the high side for a very identifiable reason that we don't think will persist.  So it seemed worth spelling out that we've seen some higher inflation, but it was underlying trend in inflation.

are not going to going forward. MS. RASKIN.  But, I mean, our current view may be that energy prices be higher

1 is kind of describing the over the intermeeting period. MR. ENGLISH.  That's right, but again, paragraph information that came in

Bill has got it exactly right.  The past couple of CPI readings were got retail energy prices in the PCE price index increasing at an annual rate in the third quarter and 11½ percent in the fourth quarter, and then going forward from there.  Notwithstanding those pretty big energy top-line PCE inflation at 1¾ percent in the third quarter and just a shade MR. WILCOX.  Yes, pretty high.  For what it's worth, we've 10 percent we have that unwinding prices numbers, we have over 2 percent in the fourth quarter.  So we think core inflation is going to be very moderate over the second half.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Governor Duke.

October 23-24, 2012

Actually I had a little bit of the same question about the alternative B and alternative A.  Particularly when we get to the next looking at exactly this decision:  Do we continue on with the Treasury I'm not sure I see in alternative A the indicator that goes from $750 billion to that magnitude of a jump is.  I think some discussion at least internally the stopping rules are would MS. DUKE.  Thank you. difference between meeting, we will be purchases? $1.2 trillion or whatever of how we're thinking about what the total purchases would be or be important next time.

to do oddly with exit.  As our balance sheet gets bigger and we're still assuming the same five-year time period for selling off the securities that are how feasible that is, particularly as our you're ready to talk about I'd be really interested in your thoughts about how continuing to build the balance period of exit. But my big question has bigger, on the balance sheet.  So I'm beginning to wonder holdings of mortgage-backed securities get larger, and with us in the market buying, the market for mortgage-backed securities begins to shrink.  I don't expect that that today, but sheet impacts the time pace of sales? The Tealbook talks through this for you under alternative B.  What I for normalizing, I think.  We would sell, under alternative B, at about an alternative A, about MR. ENGLISH.  Simon, do you want to say anything about the MR. POTTER. have here would be $18 billion per month pace, the average sales pace.  And then, under $22 billion per month.

DUKE.  Really? MS. MR. POTTER.  Yes. MR. FISHER.  Thank you.

October 23-24, 2012

gets bigger by more generally assumed five.  And normalization of the size of the balance sheet If the sales take place over five years and the balance you go from alternative B to alternative A, the normalization would take longer years that we have written down in the exit principles. MR. ENGLISH.  I think one issue that comes up, if the balance sheet than roughly $750 billion, is that the exit principles say sales will take place over three to five years.  The staff has will take place over two to three years. sheet gets more than about $750 billion larger, the normalization will take longer than three years.  So as than the three

and it is a perfect lead-in to the going to have afterwards.  If you were to do this chart a fed funds rate going up by 25 basis guess is that we would see a lot of When I take the period of unconventional policy and multiply to convert the getting a huge spread on what people's a result of our qualitative guidance. MR. ROSENGREN.  Bill, this is a great chart, communication discussion that we are during conventional periods, where we are talking about points, down 25 basis points, or staying the same, my clumping around no change or 25 basis points either up or down depending on the circumstances. amounts to a fed funds rate, it seems like we are anticipations of monetary policy will be as would be interested in two things.  One, is this chart an outlier relative to history?  If we are trying to make a guess about what our actions are, would I right in making my mental calculation that if I were trying to I look at other periods where people we normally be this far away from expectations of what are probably the most informed people in the market?  Then, second, am put this in terms of a fed funds rate up or down, this distribution is substantially wider than what we would see under conventional policy?  I mean, I should be happy, because this is implying

October 23-24, 2012

it looks like at least the staff thinks our about if we are creating a lot of variance in our current communication strategy.  Any comments you have on that? the market expects much more easing.  And given that that would be my bias, I might be happy that the market is willing to ease much more than intentions are.  But it does raise some concern policy through our

I think if you converted this to fed funds difference in the years. MR. ENGLISH.  I haven't done the work, but equivalents using various staff rules of thumb, you would indeed find a fair amount of easing the different broker-dealer firms are expecting over the next couple of guess I am not sure.  I think even if we were in a world participants were looking at some trajectory for the rategoing to be a tightening cycle or an easing cycle-there would probably about the views of how large that tightening cycle would need to am not positive that this would be that And as to how unusual that is, I of conventional policy, and the market they thought there was be a fair amount of difference be or how large that easing cycle would have to be.  So I unusual, but, nonetheless, we are in a situation where some participants see an expectation that there will be quite a lot of easing, and some not very much.  That range is indeed pretty large.

I'd say that three meetings ahead it is really close.  Most dealers assume Treasury purchases will continue at $45 billion and the MBS at $40 billion.  That's very where the expectations of the fed funds rate over the next this issue, as Bill you go further out, there are different views on the reaction function, which is also on what the economic situation might look like that gives the dispersion. MR. POTTER. that the similar to the normal state of the world few meetings are very close to what we see in the Tealbook.  And then there's pointed out, that as reflected here, and

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Bullard.

I was just going to weigh in on this issue a little bit.  This is just is based on an assumption of a little less accommodation than the market MR. BULLARD.  Yes. that the staff forecast

October 23-24, 2012

you wanted to incorporate that in, then you would have a little more aggressive thinks.  If forecast I guess.

would be the forecast under alternative A, roughly, on my second MR. ENGLISH.  It exhibit.

you say, you didn't get the dealer survey until later in the process. incorporated into the main baseline of the I would read this. MR. BULLARD.  As I think in the future, then, that would be probably Tealbook.  That's how

I think in the past we have been hesitant to just use whatever the because we don't necessarily agree with the your likely reaction function.  I wouldn't want to say that are going to be writing down the market participants' expectations for policy are going to have to make judgments about the outlook and about the MR.

Well, another way to look at it is the market is expecting more do.  That's why they think we are going to MR. BULLARD.  Okay. accommodation, but they don't really have an appreciably different forecast from what we do. They think it is going to be less effective than we have to do more than what we think.

guess I would want to look more carefully at the dealer survey to see whether the right way is that they have a MR. ENGLISH.  I whether that is the right way to interpret this, or different reaction function built in than we do.

can do that.  President Kocherlakota. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  These priors look like they are pretty loosely held.  I think that if we choose to communicate differently, we you just said.  If we want to communicate that our anticipation about the If we are happy with what the market participants currently expect, then I guess we should way we think about the future path of policy. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Yes.  Thanks, Mr. Chairman.  I have just a few things to say. One is to second what future path of policy is close to what the staff's forecast is, well, we should figure out ways to do that. take that on board in the

paragraph 2 of alternative B, there is a 'The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the medium term likely would we did not take action.  Now that we've taken objective.  I guess my this sentence at the end of Is it about the path of inflation without sufficient policy described in I have a separate question, though.  At the end of line that says, run at or below its 2 percent objective.'  This sentence made more sense to me at the previous meeting, as it referred to what would happen if action, it makes less sense to me.  I think it would be read, perhaps sloppily by people reading the statement, as saying that the Committee anticipates that under its current policy choice that inflation over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent question is, what is the staff trying to communicate by including paragraph 2 of alternative B? accommodation, or is it about the path of inflation under the path of policy alternative B?

It probably should be understood as the inflation outlook with sufficient MR. ENGLISH. policy accommodation.

you refer to this morning because that article confirms what many people at this table have been after meeting.  (Although in the upper right-hand side of that newspaper, it has Print,' there are cynics who would say, the News That's Fit to Tint.')  I'm not quite sure if that is an affirmation or something that I that are made in that article, many of them this one thing, but how it affects businesses' confidence is another.  I'm glad MR.

I was happy to hear The New York Times saying meeting always been proud to say, 'All the News That's Fit to 'All should be worried about, having made the points morning.

I want to respond a I listened very carefully to the conversation around the table make a couple of quick points because I people were saying.  [Laughter]  Governor Tarullo made the point some time ago that we shouldn't be reading statements, we should actually be having little bit.

If you shove Simon gave a brilliant report yesterday-as he always does-and we saw the spreads and what has Powell and I pointed out certain activity, at least in the CCC and lesser category-the junk bond sector-and some of the activities being seen the stock market is actually down since we previously met by 3.2 percent.

Stock prices are questionable. affect, at least in a reasonable time frame, the median household?  And I interpreted it, was a key point.  And that is, the transmission between prices and what actually happens to the average household-and we think it will take time. The real issue was raised by point that You mentioned that, Mr. Chairman, in How much does it really then, Betsy's point, as MBS

am always thinking at this table:  I don't work for the big banks; I don't work for the I work for the average American household, and that is our job.  And the question is I dealers;

October 23-24, 2012

I think it is a little bit too early to judge an effect.  Besides that, as we know, despite data that Governor Yellen presented from Zillow, and so on, the housing market we launched QE3.  We were not quite sure, but that has been confirmed careful and take our time to understand what the real effect efficacy. contradictory actually took off before by the data now.  We have to be very of what we have done is, in addition to what we see in terms of immediate financial indexes. That is my point.

I still think it is to be determined whether it is successful-I would support I appreciate some of the language tweaking that took place in the first paragraph memo.  I'm grateful that With regard to the options that have been presented to us, although I was not supportive of QE3-and alternative B. to indicate a little peppier consumer behavior.  I had suggested that in a you took it, and I consider it certainly less worse than alternative A.  And because we are already going down that path, it is the most likely option to adopt, and, even though my heart tells me that alternative C is closer to my thinking, I would support alternative B.

Treasury purchases when the me, that seems At our next meeting, I would ideally like to adopt thresholds for actions based on economic outcomes and to build a consensus around beginning MEP ends.  Reducing our gross purchases at the start of 2013 risks a noticeable reversal in the configuration of asset prices that our initial announcement set in train.  To

The optics, if not the economics, of we 0.1 percentage point higher The Tealbook assumes that we will stop purchases next at 7.9 percent, half of this stopping under such circumstances seems troublesome.  Our statement is clear in suggesting will continue purchases until we see substantial improvement in labor markets.  I do not view substantial improvement as consistent with an unemployment rate than it was in September.

For lower unemployment rate reflected job creation rather than reductions in the labor force; we had seen sustained, robust payroll employment growth; and whether we substantial improvement in labor markets for some quarters to come.  Under those conditions, I would stop asset purchases and stop reinvesting.

a real improvement in labor markets and the My threshold for beginning the discussion about raising the federal funds rate would be an unemployment rate of 6½ percent-again, assuming that inflation and inflation expectations remain well behaved.  Whether the threshold became a trigger would, again, be determined by whether the lower unemployment rate reflected likelihood that it would continue on.  Thank you.

Unemployment does remain high by historical standards, but the been held back by real impediments beyond the stimulus balance sheet would make our exit strategy riskier and more Economic activity has been growing at a modest pace on fluctuating improvement in the labor market appears to have capacity of monetary policy to offset.  In such circumstances, I think further monetary runs the risk of raising inflation and destabilizing inflation expectations.  Moreover, I think further expansion of our challenging.

So at our next meeting, we'll need to signal this alternative A, although when I look at alternative A, I favor That said, to continue the comments that President Rosengren made, I expect it will be some time before the outlook for the labor market need to continue our purchases of longer-term Treasury securities well past the end of the year, and longer-term expectation along the lines of continuing with something like the substantial improvement in labor market language.

needing to improve our own reading of the market view on what our purchases will be is consistent with our policy statement.

I think we would similar improvement. I think substantial improvement in the labor market outlook ought to be associated with growth in payroll employment on the order of 200,000 per month for a period of, say, four to six trend for almost two quarters, to align with substantial improvement in see clear downward momentum in the unemployment rate if we were seeing that type of substantial improvement, and I think that all the other associated labor market indicators ought to show any disagreements with the way President Rosengren described that we to make a decision I think that's more like the I saw them.  So I agree with President Williams.  I think we're doing a good job with communicating there, and I think that some additional commentary from I don't have should be seeing the unemployment rate perhaps down as low as 7¼ percent on ending purchases and a lower unemployment rate for liftoff. dealer survey results as pretty you, Mr. Chairman, will help there.

'in a context of price stability,' is an important thing to also offer clarity on.  Here, I would say that must be associated with underlying inflation that remains below an acceptable upper tolerance with would take to be about ½ percentage point preference is to educate the public regarding our intention of what we Now, given that it's a qualitative type of description, something like respect to our longer-run inflation objective, which I above 2 percent.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Bullard.

October 23-24, 2012

you, Mr. Chairman.  I support alternative B for today, and I the last sentence of paragraph 2, which reads, 'The Committee also over the medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent I see that, based on his comment, as a little bit inconsistent with what we think now, action at the last meeting, and we do think that that's 'at or below,' how about MR. BULLARD.  Thank have one suggestion for a change in the language based on President Kocherlakota's earlier comment concerning anticipates that inflation objective.' because we did take the aggressive easing supposed to keep inflation a little bit higher.  So maybe instead of 'near'-'would run near its 2 percent objective'?  And that would suggest that the Committee feels like it has responded to this as opposed to just saying that we're going to accept the lower inflation that would otherwise be projected.  So instead of 'at or below' it would be 'near.'

I just make a comment?  I think the Chairman was correct accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to 'The Committee also anticipates that inflation over the again, if there were not MR. ENGLISH.  Sorry, could earlier, that that sentence was intended to be conditional on 'without sufficient policy accommodation.'  So the earlier sentence on economic growth and labor market conditions said 'without sufficient policy generate,' and then the last sentence says, medium term likely would run at or below its 2 percent objective,' sufficient policy accommodation.

MR. BULLARD.  But we do have sufficient accommodation, or we think we do.  We're trying to adopt a policy that's addressing this.  So I just think it's confusing.  I took it that the first part was to say, well, if we hadn't taken action, we'd be in trouble, but now that we have taken action, we're getting close.

MR. ENGLISH.  I think the 'sufficient' is supposed to pick up how long do the purchases continue.

October 23-24, 2012

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  We have, in effect, not made any commitments beyond December.

MR. BULLARD.  Well, that's my suggestion, 'near.' CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  All right.  Thank you.

I appreciate the subtleties here.  Okay.  Inspired by yesterday's want to make an extended remark concerning the ability of the Committee to MR. BULLARD. discussion, I commit to future policy actions.

your normal policy rule, and the policy rule rate.  So you're at the zero lower bound.  That's the first part. to Woodford, policy is constrained during that period.  In his world, QE has no effect. going to go into that.  I don't agree with that, but let's just go from there.  So policy is you're at the zero lower bound. Mike Woodford does the following.  He divides the period of the zero lower bound into two parts.  In the first part, you're following recommends a zero policy According I'm not constrained while your policy rule that you followed before the shock hit the zero lower bound.  However, you do not come off the zero lower you'll get exactly the correct amount of total what's novel about his analysis and about his recommendation, the Woodford Then there's a second part.  You're still at the zero lower bound, and there's a second part to it.  The second part is that recommends coming off bound; actual policy remains at the zero lower bound because the policy is making up for the fact that policy was constrained in the earlier period.  Then you add the total amount of time at the zero lower bound, period one plus period two, and accommodation in response to the shock.  So I want to call this second period 'the Woodford period.'  That's period.

October 23-24, 2012

rule, and I appreciate that different people have different policy rules around policy this way, to me, refers only to the first part of the zero-lowerthat the reason we're at the zero lower bound is because our policy rule I appreciate the staff understands exactly what I'm talking about here. Much of the discussion about policy with respect to the federal funds rate seems to be that we will lift off when economic conditions suggest that we should according to some appropriate policy the table.  To talk about bound story.  It suggests is telling us to be at the zero lower bound.  In fact, much of the Tealbook discussion is in this framework, although

Jackson Hole paper that merely pushing out the date of the first can be interpreted as a are not raising rates because conditions in the Woodford warned in his increase in the funds rate is not the right type of commitment.  It pessimistic signal, where, in effect, it's saying we future will be poor.  Woodford warned that this is actually counterproductive, as it's sending a pessimistic signal, and this has been discussed around the table.

that lower rates will be maintained 'for a considerable time after and the Chairman did a good job, I thought, at his press expectations among change in thought of Woodford's paper at Jackson Hole. In my view, the most improved part of the September statement with respect to this Woodford period is the phrase the economic recovery strengthens,' conference in referring to this.  And I think this has had a marked effect on financial market participants.  They have taken note of this, and there is a about this partly because

I'm going to give you my view on this.  The first part is, I don't think we can you to do as soon as you hit the zero bound is make a Now commit.  So what Woodford would like

October 23-24, 2012

going to be and how long you're you're constrained during the first statement about this Woodford period, about how long that's going to stay at the zero bound, to make up for the fact that part.  I don't think you can commit, so I think that kind of attempt in the first period doesn't have any effect.

we can gain credibility for the Woodford period once we enter the Woodford rule suggests liftoff but that we are nevertheless at the zero lower bound exactly for the Woodford reason, that we're making up for the were constrained in the first part of the period at the zero lower bound.  Then, I effect, because the Committee will be behaving differently than a standard policy rule.  So what I would predict is you would get no zero-lower-bound period because you can't enter the Woodford period.  Then you can point out to markets and to other you actually are behaving differently.  Then you'll earn you're staying at the zero bound even though your policy rule is However, period.  We can point out that a typical policy remaining fact that we think, you actually will get some would be predicted by effects from announcements in the first part of the commit effectively through a Committee to the future, but you might get potentially significant effects once you participants in the economy that credibility for the fact that telling you to come off the zero bound.

few minutes generate some discussion about it.  Let me just you an example.  Suppose your rule is Taylor (1993).  Most people don't have that rule, but a moment.  You say that the Taylor (1993) rule described the the Taylor (1993) rule predicts that we should bound, and then we go out and say to the public, 'Yes, Taylor (1993) behavior in normal times, but we're not doing that.  We're staying at the zero So I think there's potentially some action here, and I just wanted to take my to point this out to the Committee and maybe give let's just suspend disbelief for Committee's behavior before the shock.  Now come off the zero lower does describe

October 23-24, 2012

(1993) tells us to come up because we're making up for the period constrained, and we're going to do this for some length of time.'  And then, bound even though Taylor when policy was eventually, we will come off the zero bound and go back to the normal behavior.

you have some other policy rule that's suggesting something else, at that point you come off the zero lower bound, you could earn you're in the Woodford period and you should get an additional boost Now, if when that policy rule would suggest that credibility for the fact that to the economy at that juncture.

I've had.  I have been concerned that a lot of the discussion about also have it's just that conditions are not going to be right for raising the funds rate.  To I have just the one suggestion for today for alternative B, and I on that dimension. So this is a thought that pushing the funds rate date out-we do have ideas about commitment in there, but we ideas about how me, that's a reference to the first part of the zero-lower-bound period.  So I just wanted to get that thought on the table. appreciate the subtleties

I just want to confirm that understanding and comment about it. MR. LACKER.  Thank you.

So you have to temporarily raise period to have some then make a

I would like is to get some other things:  Whether, for instance, you really are you've got QE-that's my position-or about the price reasons.  But if that's what we're trying to do, I just MR. BULLARD.  That's definitely my understanding.  What clarity-maybe in my own head and, to some extent, maybe around the table-about what we're trying to do.  And then you can argue about constrained in the first part, because level path.  So the kinds of things that are talked about in Woodford haven't really materialized. The theory could be wrong for many other wanted to get the- year or so analysis about the prospect of deliberately raising expected inflation; communications after the meeting is that you've been clear that we don't intend to raise our zero-lower-bound period and the notion that we're not MR. LACKER.  Right.  I just wanted to follow up.  We had a long discussion a ago and had a lot of staff we decided not to go down that path.  I'd also point out, Mr. Chairman, that my understanding of your inflation above 2 percent.  So there's a tension in our communications between interpreting this as kind of a Woodfordian extension of admitting that we want to raise inflation.

any meaningful contradiction.  The I interpret what we're trying to do is that in the Tealbook, there's an optimal control path for you could perfectly commit today all I think what we're trying to do is, in some sense, convince the public going to take that optimal control path. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  No, I don't think there's way the federal funds rate, which is the path you would take if the way out to the future. we're a time-inconsistent path, mildly, because it does go a little bit further out than the working through a deliberate increase in It's estimated reaction function goes, but (a) it's not expected inflation, and (b) as it happens, the projected inflation under that path is like

October 23-24, 2012

2.2 percent.  So there is no meaningful increase in inflation under that path because the Phillips curve is so flat.

approach.  We're change our target and we're not trying to change inflation expectations in the long a small amount of inflation-2.2 percent-is a side effect of getting better overall Now, as a matter of principle, it is saying that we are taking a balanced not trying to term.  But results and is within the range of the optimal control path.

MR. BULLARD.  So, Mr. Chairman, I just want to follow up on that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes.

I agree, of course you'd like to get to the optimal control path, but I is going to be very effective just with words.  What I'm trying to point your favorite policy rule starts to project liftoff and you stay at zero, that's a period you actually can start to gain credibility and perhaps get closer to that optimal path. MR. BULLARD. don't think commitment out is that as where

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Right, but that will help us in 2020.  It won't help us in this-

MR. BULLARD.  It depends on when you think you're entering the Woodford period. That's the period when you should be able to start to gain some credibility, in my view.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  President Evans.

I could just add to what you said, Mr. Chairman, in our Chicago DSGE funds rate continues to be zero for a very long period of fact that inflation goes up; it's really moving down the IS curve It does not have to much in the period that could be referred to as could be referred to as the Williams period, I'm told, as well.

But I think I detected-as President discussion of our September actions yesterday. I for one, expected.  And I statement language was critical in achieving the success that we have seen so far. mind, Fisher referred to-a note of complacency in our And I think as we look forward to December's meeting, I would caution against that complacency.

her bid to add to the relentless Fed following what I am going to call ROMP, R-O-M-P: policy.  ROMP means judging our level of accommodation not by how we are doing in terms of our dual mandate objectives.  Now here, Yesterday in her remarks, Governor Raskin made drive for acronyms with what she referred to as MMP:  muddled messaging possibilities.  And I think we can maybe avoid MMP by results-oriented monetary historical standards but by

October 23-24, 2012

fear the news continues to be challenging.  The outlook for the labor market, however one consistent with the dual mandate.  In terms of you just want to think about price stability.  The Tealbook forecasts for for five years.  This is after the policy accommodation we who voted for the I chooses to measure it, is hard to describe as being inflation, suppose inflation remain below 2 percent adopted in September.  And this is consistent with the projections of those statement last time, who have inflation running below 2 percent through the forecast period.

labor market conditions, I think, is hard given from the Congress.  And, again, I would say that even if you were just a price stability person and all you cared about was inflation targeting-say, you worked your job-this path would not be seen as being a success on your operation. This path for inflation, and the associated path of to think about as being consistent with the relentless pursuit of our dual mandate objectives that we have been purely at the Bank of Canada, and that's the part of purchase front.  I'm just not going to talk about that, though; I'm going for households and firms to extract and could just be our saying that the economy is going to be lousy for two more years.  I think what is from what is currently gives great guidance on this, and I was I was hoping we So we follow results-oriented monetary policy and we should be doing something more. That raises the question of how we should be doing more.  And there is probably something that can be done on the asset to focus more on forward guidance.  We could extend the date from mid-2015 to mid-2016, mid2017.  I think, as President Bullard alluded to, and we have talked about-and changed the statement language, in fact, because of this-extending the date is just problematic.  The signaling component is very challenging perceived as better would be to communicate that our reaction function is different expected by market participants.  The staff memo disappointed we didn't really dig into the details of the staff memo as much as

October 23-24, 2012

of FRB/US, that the thresholds of would yesterday.  I thought the staff showed, in the context 2½ percent inflation and 6 percent unemployment worked extremely well.

would encourage them to go further, to explore 2½ percent inflation and 5½ percent feel confident that that would actually work even better because it is dual mandate objectives.  Why do these thresholds work well?  We have yesterday.  Part of it is delivering more accommodation, because you are your willingness to be more accommodative than they think.  But a lot of worried about inflation risks, being as explicit as we are talking about being through for us to be vigilant against upside inflation risks. I unemployment, because I more tailored to our talked about that surprising markets with it also has to do with this automatic stabilizer effect that I have been emphasizing.  And for those who are thresholds is a great way

I heard yesterday about thresholds is the Committee wants to retain full at all times, and I understand that.  I think you can sit here in October of 2012, and suggested yesterday.  I think 'currently anticipates' is a little too weak would say something along the lines of, 'The Committee's current you to change these are the benefits of this?  It means that the market expectations of when we're prevail when we're The problem optionality you do not know what is going to happen in 2013, 2014, 2015, and that is fair enough.  I think that the solution to this is to adopt strong, but not ironclad, language.  I would be stronger than what the Vice Chairman for my taste.  But I assessment is that as long as long-term inflation expectations remain anchored, it is unlikely'-I would prefer 'highly unlikely'-but 'it is unlikely to raise the federal funds rate until the unemployment rate has fallen below 6 percent or the inflation outlook has risen above 2½ percent.'  This is a way to try to get some of the optionality that people wanted around the table, while still conveying a sense that it would take something unusual for numbers.  Where going to raise the fed funds rate will change in terms of the conditions that

In a way that the Board staff has handled this issue in the labor market Of course, I would also like to see whether any momentum appears to be building in the labor market.  In September, we told the public that more policy accommodation would likely be forthcoming if in coming months, and that we will continue asset However, we have yet to vacuum, the public will fill that void, and I don't think that it is constructive for them to be hearing multiple and diverse interpretations from the Committee participants.  So, clearly, we have some unfinished business.  I do like the the baseline forecast.  The asset purchase program stops when the outlook for improves rather than actually having to experience a long period of stronger job gains.

I would like to make is that if the Committee does conclude in accommodation is appropriate, we should be open to One additional point coming months that more policy

I think that our most recent action to acquire more MBS was successful in further reducing home mortgage rates, but I am skeptical about the likely benefits purchases.  We could, of more room there is to do so without adversely

I am sure we are going to be discussing at our December meeting, I remain concerned that a decision to go beyond the scale of asset purchases we initiated last which kind of assets are purchased, could complicate our exit strategy, as These are issues that but month, regardless of Governor Duke mentioned earlier, and could present financial stability risks.

we undertook last time.  My view on that really hasn't changed.  I see the costs of the as exceeding the benefits.  I think the nature of the program makes it particularly MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I was opposed to the new round of asset purchases program important that we think hard about our stopping rule for our open-ended purchases.

appreciate President Rosengren's comments about how if we go to a threshold system the funds rate, we have to be very careful not to necessarily have people infer that what we for asset purchases as opposed to the funds rate going to be an important part of that communication, if we go with thresholds.  I could have some very confused markets and bad outcomes. I about mean by substantial improvement in labor markets isn't what we just told them in the thresholds. Distinguishing between what is the stopping rule guidance is think there is a lot that we need to talk about in terms of that, and I am worried that if we don't get that communication right, we been concerned about the nature of forward guidance and the I am not convinced, as some people are, about the quantitative Part of the reason I have challenges we face is effectiveness of this forward guidance.  People seem to attribute movements in asset prices to be

October 23-24, 2012

I'm not sure that in terms of the real economy and the unemployment rate am concerned about the effectiveness of our forwardso much on that and relying on managing expectations, I think, is a very game.  Trying to signal, through a commitment that we may or may not be able to reach, going to maintain low rates longer continues to make me concerned about the that happen at the exit. driving all of that, but we have seen much benefit from that.  So I guidance tools.  Relying tricky that we are consequences am very concerned that the built-up effects of keeping interest rates too low, too long, cause long-term rates to rise very rapidly at the point when the get a whiff of the idea that it is time to change policies.  And we will have a needs to be.  And if the I so to speak, could actually markets begin to long way to go to catch up to where, perhaps, standard policy might say it that happens-interest rate risks, the effects on bank balance sheets, the effects in the market, difficulties of interest rate risk on our own portfolio, and our ability to raise rates fast enough without losses and turmoil in the marketplace-that could be quite traumatic and quite challenging for us and for the economy.  I hope not.

I don't think the effectiveness of that forward guidance is quantitatively as I think are dubious and meager gains on our you will.  I think it is very important at our next meeting, as we continue to going to think about stopping and how those are going to relate to one another. So, given that important as we seem to think it is, the risks on the upside are quite troubling to me.  And we are taking potentially very large risks to achieve what dual mandate, if discuss the threshold argument, to combine that with how we are rules for asset purchases comment.  I can live with alternative B, but I do want to go back to I think it is kind of confusing.  President Kocherlakota focused on the last actually think the confusing part of paragraph 2 is the second sentence: Okay.  I do have one paragraph 2, because sentence on inflation.  I

October 23-24, 2012

'The Committee remains concerned that, without sufficient policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions.'

me we put that statement in last time to signal something about what the were taking.  At this meeting, we are not taking an action.  I am concerned a bit could be very much misinterpreted as saying that we don't think we made that decision yet? It seems to action was we that this sentence actually have sufficient accommodation in place at this time or won't in the future.  Is the interpretation going to be that this is signaling that we will continue to do more accommodation come January, when we really haven't

Committee outlook is for gradual improvement I think tying it in this paragraph to policy is what makes this saying something about policy-we on, I think it's in paragraph 4, that we are prepared to take further action our employment and price objectives at risk. So I am a bit worried about that sentence.  I think it would be more straightforward to go back to a sentence that says something like, 'The in labor market conditions.' paragraph confusing.  The second paragraph, typically in the past, I think, has been a paragraph about our outlook for the key variables.  And this is sort of make the statement later if we view that we just change that second sentence, and So I think putting this statement in the second paragraph is actually the source of confusion here.  So my own modest suggestion is then I think the paragraph hangs together better, and we still have the indication of policy in paragraph 4.  So that is my suggestion, Mr. Chairman.  Thank you.

Plosser? Because this is mostly about outlooks in paragraph 2, I think you could CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  What would you change it to, President MR. PLOSSER. just change the second sentence to say, just like we've said before, 'The Committee's outlook is

October 23-24, 2012

gradual improvement in labor market conditions.'  And not make some reference to whether Thank you, Mr. Chairman. for the level of policy accommodation is sufficient or not sufficient at this point.  You make that reference down later when we talk about policy actions and the prospects for future policy. That's just my suggestion.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Yellen.

alternative B.  I take President ourselves on the back, but overall I think our serve to raise my with the statement language as it stands. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I support Fisher's point that we should not prematurely pat actions did elicit the financial market responses we expected, and that does confidence that our asset program will be efficacious over time, especially in providing support to the housing market.  For today, I am happy

I discussed during the economic go-round, despite some encouraging signals from the recent decline in the unemployment rate, I have seen no evidence of fundamental with Presidents Williams, Evans, and expectations, their interpretation that we see in the dealer survey of what that means is As household sector and the any substantial improvement in the outlook for the labor market or any strengthening in economic conditions.  And I would agree Rosengren on what substantial improvement in the outlook means.  It seems to me that the dealers' quite reasonable and coincides with my own.

So I expect that at our December meeting, it will prove appropriate to extend our longer-term Treasury purchases

we have made to our forward guidance have been quite well expectations do reflect some element of typical policy rule would call for. I think that the changes received.  Market participants now expect the first tightening to occur in the second half of 2015, only after the unemployment rate has declined to around 6.8 percent.  This is a downward shift of almost half a percentage point since March in market expectations concerning the likely unemployment rate at liftoff, and I think these understanding in the market that we do intend to be lower for longer or to provide somewhat more accommodation than a and today, probably would not forward guidance would enhance its effectiveness, years, as the recovery proceeds and For yesterday, and that President Kocherlakota has emphasized this in our December constructive Given the close alignment between market and Committee expectations concerning liftoff, the adoption of thresholds, as we have discussed yesterday entail meaningful additional accommodation.  But even so, I really think that adopting quantitative thresholds to further clarify our not just right now but particularly over the next several attention in the markets begins to focus more intensively on the likely timing of tightening. all the reasons we discussed morning, I think it is a good idea to include quantitative threshold language statement.  And I think President Kocherlakota this morning made some very suggestions about how we might craft language to go about doing that.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

food and energy prices swing, looks like it is about year.  So, if anything, inflation may be on the low side. At the same time, inflation appears to be well contained.  Core inflation, which seems the most relevant measure right now as 1¼ percent in the second half of this And survey measures of inflation expectations have ticked down.  In addition, in my view, the primary risks to the outlook are still large and to the downside.  For all of these reasons, I support keeping in place the accommodation that we agreed on in September.

'lower for longer' language begins to clarify for economic agents with our mandate.  With this forward guidance, about gets cut off.  For odds that this Committee begins to tighten at the first sign of good labor market economic data with a shrug and a 'we've done all we can' to economic participants.

Similarly, the chance that this Committee will greet worsening probably seems less likely changed our forward-guidance language, we also backed up asset purchases.

However, the longer we wait to adopt explicit thresholds, the higher the likelihood that our message will become to me that by allowing others, rather than the our responsibility to If we decline to clarify our thresholds, markets and the public will be confused about what they are, and speculation likely will fill that vacuum.  Bloggers and editorial writers, and maybe even individuals at this table making speeches, will likely start to offer opinions about what those thresholds are and should be.  It seems Committee as a collective whole, to frame that discussion, we are shirking communicate clearly and to help shape expectations.

there might be some As argued so well this morning by President Kocherlakota, confusion about our thresholds could also affect inflation expectations.  If outsiders begin to believe that we have a lower inflation threshold than we do, when inflation moves above that level, concern that we have lost our resolve or our ability to keep inflation in check, thereby raising inflation expectations.

I am ready to implement thresholds because I think they will enhance the clarity of I also think that as we continue to wrestle with the am content to support alternative B at this Thus the policy moves we made last time. effectiveness of large-scale asset purchases, the need to focus on refining our forward guidance becomes increasingly more pressing.

October 23-24, 2012

alternative B, but I do want to say a few words in looking forward to December alternative A because, obviously, we are going to have to start thinking about pace, am not going to try and advocate anything at few of the issues.  One way to frame the problem that we as long as we are falling short on the employment leg of our mandate, and as long as in either the Treasury or the MBS is associated with some form of cost, be it in the form of either exit. I support about composition, and duration of asset purchases.  So I this point, but I do want to lay out a face is that inflation is contained, we want to maximize the stimulus we can provide, but subject to two constraints.  One is not overly degrading market functioning market, and the other is some kind of limit on total balance sheet size to the extent that we think that a larger balance sheet expected losses on our positions, strains in money markets, or a more challenging willing to do something like If ever be a reason not to go out of the gate fast?  That go out at the $85 billion pace, understanding that all the balance sheet that would constrain you to do things for a To make an example, you might say, 'Well, we're $500 billion more in total,' and then the problem becomes one of, do we want to do it at an $80 billion pace for 6 months or at a slower pace, say, $40 billion for as long as 12 months? you pose the problem this way, would there is to say, would there ever be a reason to not else equal, there is a shadow cost of shorter period of time?

and MBS purchases are relatively close amount of duration that you are taking out of getting So my thinking is that, in a world where Treasury substitutes, and where all that really matters is the the market, the two options should be roughly similar.  And I would think, in fact, there is a small presumption in favor of the higher initial flow rate because, all else equal, you are the purchases done sooner, so the total amount of stimulus is a bit greater.  That feels to me like the classical argument that you would make here.

October 23-24, 2012

you want to take the other side, a necessary condition is you are going to have to and MBS purchases are not perfect substitutes.  And we have heard a little you think that MBS purchases are constraint, you might have an you go slower you can continue the MBS head room to do the MBS purchase piece.  So I be made here, and I have alluded to it, others have alluded to it.  I don't get a I think if argue that Treasury bit about that in the last couple of days.  So, for example, if more helpful to the economy because there is more potential to stimulate stuff related to housing, then in the presence of some kind of shadow balance sheet argument to go slower because, all else equal, if purchase piece of it longer.  You will have more suspect there is a case to want to say it is an empirically validated case, but I think it is something worth trying to more precise handle on.

are getting into a zone where we think the exit, I suppose you could argue that have a shorter duration and tend to run off on hand, if we're determined, as in the exit get rid of the MBS before they run off by selling, I think that complicates I think it is quite possible that liquidity in the MBS market will have been Another dimension on which Treasuries and MBS differ is exit, and this has also been alluded to; Governor Duke mentioned this.  If we sheer size of the balance sheet may complicate the process of that is an advantage of MBS, to the extent that they their own without having to be sold.  On the other principles, to actually things, because compromised by the fact that we will have occupied such a large space in this market.

is that in December-this has come up before-we are going to pointed out between market and our own admittedly heterogeneous views about the cost of an $85 billion flow, so I think there is going to be a natural temptation to want to A final point, just to flag, have to really wrestle with the potential divergence that has been expectations for the path of policy expanding the balance sheet.  As has been noted, the market very clearly expects us to come out of the gate at

October 23-24, 2012

that is a reasonable one, given what we have said-this program to go deliver that so as to not disappoint the market.  But, of course, the market also expects-and I think it is an expectation on until early 2014, which implies a balance sheet somewhere north of $4 trillion.

later.  And this is very inherently a dynamic problem.  If there are constraints of this So if there are broadly felt misgivings about that prospect, I do think it is important that we confront them in December as opposed to kind of just going with the flow and dealing with that problem sort, I think they have to be factored into the whole path of the policy rather than pushed off into the future.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Powell.

Most World, Bill Belichick, Woody Allen, and now Hamlet.  [Laughter] MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So we have had Gary Cooper, the Interesting Man in the alternative B, to relieve the suspense.  And as far as what is to be decided at the another good run of data, I think there would be a strong case to defer action.  And I I support next meeting, it seems to me we should let it be decided at the next meeting.  But I will say that if we have don't see us as committed to act unless conditions warrant.

and purchases through the first quarter of admit that is a much stronger reaction than I anticipated, and I am uncomfortable with it I have concerns about more purchases.  As others have pointed out, the dealer community is now assuming close to a $4 trillion balance sheet 2014.  I for a couple of reasons.

will never be enough for the market.  Our models will always tell us that we are economy, and I will probably always feel that those benefits are overestimated.  And First, the question, why stop at $4 trillion?  The market in most cases will cheer us for doing more.  It helping the we will be able to tell ourselves that market function is not impaired and that inflation

expectations are under control.  What is to stop us, other than much faster economic growth, which it is probably not in our power to produce?

encouraging risk-taking, and that should give really do understand now that we will be there to prevent serious losses.  It is risk, a fixed-income duration bubble come up down the road. Second, I think we are actually at a point of us pause.  Investors not that it is easy for them to make money but that they have every incentive to take more and they are doing so.  Meanwhile, we look like we are blowing right across the credit spectrum that will result in big losses when rates You can almost say that that is our strategy.

of exiting got a set of principles from June 2011 and have My third concern-and others have touched on it as well-is the problems from a near $4 trillion balance sheet.  We've done some work since then, but it just seems to me that we seem to be way too confident that exit can be managed smoothly.  Markets can be much more dynamic than we appear to think.

market, effectively, and private capital will begin to leave that activity else to do.  So when it is time for us to sell, or even to stop buying, the you take 60 months, you get about where the norm by year is $80 billion a month.  Another way to look at it, though, is that it's not our short volatility position.  When you turn good chance that you could Take selling-we are talking about selling all of these mortgage-backed securities.  Right now, we are buying the and find something response could be quite strong; there is every reason to expect a strong response.  So there are a couple of ways to look at it.  It is about $1.2 trillion in sales; $20 billion a month.  That is a very doable thing, it sounds like, in a market the middle of next so much the sale, the duration; it's also unloading and say to the market, 'I've got $1.2 trillion of these things,' it's not just $20 billion a monthit's the sight of the whole thing coming.  And I think there is a pretty

First, we showed a high-level commitment to persist with an accommodative monetary policy households and businesses anticipate that there will be a sustained economic recovery, then that makes the recovery more determination to achieve agency MBS yields and Treasuries.

If you Fourth, the It is true that five-year, five-year forward rates are slightly higher now than before the last meeting, but the increase does not appear to be outsized.  Some increase was to be expected, given that we are essentially removing some of the downside tail risk through our Importantly, we still remain firmly within the range of recent years.  Moreover, there is no evidence

And, similarly, as Simon noted in his briefing, the primary dealer survey showed no rise in dealers' probability whether inflation would be 3 percent or higher over the longer term.

muted than I would have anticipated.  So the costs in terms of the noise were lower than I would have anticipated. And then, finally, the outcry about QE, I think, both in the political realm here and internationally was more around our policy decisions and downside risks to the forecast, I think it is very seen as walking any of this back, just because some people might view a little bit better than we had thought.  As I noted in a speech last week, there not been sufficiently accommodative in recent that we had hoped to achieve by now.  We had agree that we can put Europe.  I do think that some of it is on us.  So I as a remedy to the fact that we were falling short before that point.

It is also the probability-the comfort level that it is going to continue.  So I think somewhere in between would be where I would So it is not you have that land, and I think the staff should try to think about whether the $750 billion assumption is the right assumption, given the language in the statement.

B was widely supported. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  And thank you, all.  So, obviously, there is no sentiment for action today; alternative the next meeting.  We have two labor market and fiscal policy generally, so we will have some broader knowledge base. We have a lot to do and a lot to learn by reports.  We should learn something about the resolution of the fiscal cliff developments more

It also depends on our further analysis.  We need to think about the implications for market efficacy of the various programs.

FISHER.  May majority of the Committee feels just by saying economic conditions,' sustained improvement in the labor market conditions.'  That's really what we're saying.  Why do we have to include 'sufficient policy accommodation'?

LOCKHART. I have to say I'm a little confused, maybe, about the debate around 2, but my simple reading of it is that we're kind of repeating what we said last time, continuing to express the concerns about sustaining policy accommodation.

The Committee has now completed two experiments in constructing a forecast that could be used to elucidate the rationale for the Committee's policy decision.  To assist in your process of taking stock of where this initiative stands, the Chairman asked the learned difficulties associated with producing a consensus forecast.  In addition, the staff was asked to consider possible options for continuing consensus forecast, and to identify possible enhancements that could be made to the SEP that would allow it to attain some of the benefits sought by a consensus forecast. This memorandum was circulated to the Committee main findings are summarized in the first exhibit in

Perhaps the a consensus go beyond the Committee's potential As noted in the upper panel of exhibit some key issues for be addressed if the Committee were to publish a most important of these stems from the fact that an integral part of forecast would be a transparent specification of the expected paths of the federal funds rate and the SOMA portfolio over the projection period and beyond.  In other words, a consensus forecast would necessarily postmeeting policy statement (as it is currently designed) by outlining the Committee's intentions over the next several years.  This raises at least two problems.

the Finally, the subcommittee on communications circulated a memorandum earlier this month with a list of specific questions for discussion at this meeting.  For reference, those questions are reproduced on the second and third pages of handout.  Thank you.

good work on this All right.  If not, we'd 13 questions on this your you think we ought to be doing.  Let me start with Governor Yellen, who, chair of the subcommittee that has been working on this issue.  Governor Yellen. CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you, and thank you again for very background memo.  Are there any questions for the staff?  [No response] like to get views of the Committee participants on this initiative.  There are list, so please don't feel obligated to go through every single one.  We just prefer to get overall sense of what of course, is the in June, we did so based on the premise that a consensus forecast had the potential to explore this initiative in a systematic and deliberate manner, and I think have conducted yielded a number of valuable insights.  I'd like to thank enhancements to the SEP. MS. YELLEN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  When we launched the consensus forecast initiative significantly enhance the Committee's communications by clarifying the rationale for our policy decisions.  We agreed to the two experiments we the staff for the memo and presentation, which summarized the most important lessons and our options for either continuing the initiative or, alternatively, pursuing

October 23-24, 2012

a memo with questions.  The first group of questions forecast.  The second set you consider to be more promising in terms of improving communications. My subcommittee circulated concerns possible directions for further development of the consensus pertains to possible modifications of the SEP.  And finally, bottom line, we'd like to know which of these two routes

I think there is a problem with our communications, and I this problem one way or another.  So I do consider it very important another about Personally, I would say that think we need to address that we decide today which path for providing further information about the rationale for our policy decisions is apt to be most effective, and that we make progress on providing this information soon.  The memo highlights what struck me as the biggest challenge associated with the consensus forecast, namely, that we would need to reach agreement one way or the future path of monetary policy, including, in current circumstances, the path of the balance sheet on which the forecast would be conditioned.

and the balance sheet, we would end up depreciating the to explain the rationale for whatever policy If, on the other hand, we condition on the path with which those who I fear that the task of reaching agreement at any If we detach ourselves from the policy paths incorporated in the forecast by describing them as merely illustrative, or if we instead resort to conditioning on financial market expectations of the federal funds rate value of the forecast for its core purpose, which is decisions we make. support the statement can associate themselves, given meeting may become unmanageable.

consensus about monetary policy sometime in the future, but this go forward with a consensus forecast, we would need to go beyond agreeing on, for example, Of course, our inclusion of forward guidance in our statements has taken us some ways toward communicating a guidance has often been a bone of contention, and not all of us always agree on its interpretation. To

October 23-24, 2012

to also agree on the post-liftoff pace of firming and the ultimate level to which expected to converge.  The problem of reaching consensus on the future even more severe now, given that we're operating with two tools. the time of liftoff the nominal funds rate is path of policy is first stint on the Board, I think it's fair to say that we have made for our conduct of monetary goals and objectives.  But specifying a a common, agreed-upon path of policy under all kinds of contingencies is, I'm When I think back to my enormous progress in communicating to the public the rationale policy based on a coherent framework with well-specified forecast based on afraid, still a project for the future.

almost as hard a consensus forecast current meeting, but the cost from a communication the projections available in time for the Chairman's press conference is Riksbank's, but probably not for us, given diversity.  For that reason, the issue of how to convey the degree to The other questions we have posed concerning the consensus forecast are as the first one.  I think it would be much more desirable to have conditioned on the policy action taken at the standpoint of not having quite high.  The reality is that a comprehensive Committee forecast seems to work well for committees the size of the Bank of England's or the our size and geographic which participants associate themselves with the forecast is much more difficult in our context.

concluded that we may be better served by to the SEP that would enable it to provide greater clarity about the any given meeting, I find it eminently sensible to whose preferences the policy decision reflects, but also the collection of So for all these reasons, I've reluctantly exploring enhancements outlook that motivates our policy decisions.  Because these decisions are ultimately taken by those members supporting the statement at publish the median of the projections of those members.  Not only does this focus attention on the projections of those median paths for real activity, inflation, and the funds rate should come much closer to

October 23-24, 2012

The materials that were circulated to illustrate how and others, but on a few occasions, there have been presenting an internally these medians differ suggest that there hasn't been much difference with respect to the economic projections of those who voted 'yes' noticeable disagreements about the associated policy paths.

publication of the scatter plot of combinations of inflation and at the time of liftoff.  If we introduce quantitative threshold and require almost no additional I'd also strongly support the unemployment rate prevailing language, this would seem a perfect complement to these thresholds.  But even without thresholds, the scatter plot is quite informative about participants' views concerning economic conditions consistent with liftoff.  Releasing both the median projections of those who voted 'yes' and the scatter plots are steps that have very high value logistical effort.  I think we should start doing so as soon as possible.

time of liftoff, it seems only logical to are several possible options here.  For example, think we should carefully evaluate our options any decision, to avoid the risk that publishing balance-sheet-related projections Given that we released to the public our projected release some information concerning our projections for the balance sheet, which is currently of interest and concern to markets.  However, there we could disclose the date at which we expect to stop purchasing assets or the ultimate size that we expect the balance sheet to reach.  And here, I before taking could undermine the efficacy of our asset program.

for the other proposed modifications, I'm entirely comfortable with circulating experiments helped me understand colleagues around the table. As individual SEP submissions internally, with names attached.  In fact, seeing the submissions and commentary that we provided for the consensus forecast better the thinking of some of my

So, move in this direction if we're comfortable with full attribution.  I am will have to be prepared to defend our forecasts and explain the methodology on eventually prove uncomfortable for those of us who resources to prepare a rigorous and independent I'm not opposed to coloring the dots, that is, providing some information about whether a particular projection was will only liftoff chart.  Moreover, coloring the dots doesn't help to link participants' views about policy with their economic projections.  So that suggests going further to publish the SEP full matrix, with or without attribution, perhaps with an indication of which participants are voters. guess is that Fed watchers will quickly ultimately, we should only not unalterably opposed to this step, but I admit to some qualms.  With individual attribution, each of us which they're based, a situation that may lack the necessary background and staff forecast.

advocate continuing the consensus forecast gained useful insights, and it has served to sharpen our of the commonalities and differences in our views and thinking.  If it enhanced the quality of our discourse, it has, to my mind, been well worth the effort. So to conclude, even though I do not initiative at this time, I believe we've collective understanding has thereby I'm optimistic that we can take meaningful steps toward better communications through SEP modifications, and my subcommittee would be happy to work with the Chairman to propose concrete steps.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.

to clarify, because I started MR. TARULLO.  Mr. Chairman.  Could I just ask Janet taking notes too late?  Janet, if we look at the questions for discussion that the staff passed out, I

October 23-24, 2012

I was just trying to figure out whether you did, in fact. I understood correctly, you're for A. A.  I'm for B, possibly C, and possibly D. think you addressed each of these, but This would be the sub-questions under number 2.  I think, if MS. YELLEN.  I'm for possible, but think about it?

MR. TARULLO.  D

we have to decide how to go about doing that. MS. YELLEN.  Yes, but

MR. TARULLO.

Right.  E-you said to think hard, right?

MS. YELLEN.  Yes, I'm a little bit worried about that.  F, yes.

MR. TARULLO.  F, yes.  Okay.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Let me turn to President Fisher.

Yellen that a will be go through time.  So that would be argued, may well influence the going forward.  So that's a general comment. MR. FISHER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree with Governor modification to the SEP is probably the best course to follow.  I just offer the following thoughts very quickly.  I think in any communications exercise designed to look beyond the near term, it makes little sense to exclude the views of those presidents not currently voting.  They voting, and we change the composition of the voters as we point number one.  Point number two is, I would argue against excluding the views of any dissenters because the views of today's dissenters, thoughtfully decisions of the Committee some participants.  It should not just be members only.  With the specifics, I'm best way to modify the SEP, probably, I expect will be fairly tight-of the central consensus among the Committee.  The I'm in favor of modifying the SEP, but in terms of what we publish, I don't think it should exclude just going to address some very, very quickly.  I think the is to publish the median projection of all participants.  After all, medians are insensitive to extreme views.  The tightness of the range-which tendency around the median is a measure of the degree of

October 23-24, 2012

funds rate could be plotted if you wanted to go this far, along with the prescribed by a fitted outcome-based rule or other simple rules to reveal whether whether a simple alternative rule.  That may be too radical a proposal. that I think publishing a central tendency is probably the best way to approach this, median projection of the paths participants believe a departure from business as usual is warranted.  This would tell views can be well approximated by My point is and I would include all participants.

rate may depend on variables other than the current unemployment rate and inflation year, as we've discussed around this table.  For example, it may depend on the far as what my staff has been gap.  So that's the point that I want to make there. With regard to specific questions, I'll comment on just a couple that Janet mentioned. I'm not sure that publishing a scatter plot accomplishes a great deal, because the decision to raise the funds over the past change in the unemployment rate or, if we wanted to go as advocating, a nominal income about this. I'm concerned about if we were to do this publicly is that participants might in response to new information or arguments of their and more intent on defending their views.  And they may pull their punches a little opinions when they From the standpoint of individual attributions, I have sort of mixed feelings One of the things become less willing to modify their views colleagues bit.  As a consequence, they may be a little bit reluctant to share their true provide their input.

would I've noticed in our discussions of the SEP come forward, but what I would worry about here-and, again, this is my own Then the question Janet raised, I also have a question about, which is whether we publish internally our individual SEP submissions. that they sort of phobia-is that certain names might be leaked over time, and then we would just sort of add to the possibility that that would occur.  So I have a question mark about that, Janet, as to whether

October 23-24, 2012

release them internally. where people stand, and often people-I dothat information. we should-if we're not going to release them publicly-actually Although, you know, you can usually tell volunteer you know, I have to leave a little bit early, and I apologize for being so Mr. Chairman, as concise, though I'm sure people welcome my being concise.  Thank you very much.

Put simply, it is time to abandon you hear that all the time, but I hit all the important points, highlighting the many difficult issues preparing consensus forecasts with the goal of advancing our policy communication already covered many of these points, so I will try to be agree with everything that was said in the staff memo, and I agree with the points that So that brings me to the topic of the consensus ship.  [Laughter]  The staff memo did an excellent job-I know thought this memo truly involved in objectives.  And Governor Yellen has concise.  I Governor Yellen made, too.

the consensus policy assumption.  As Jeremy noted, and Governor Yellen noted, the all aspects problematic.  For example, before the generally expected the funds rate to lift off from the zero bound in only three or four This expectation was out of sync with the Committee's views.  If I had been asked to and inflation spiraling down toward deflation.  So I think forecast would not have enhanced our communication with the public The trial runs revealed that perhaps the biggest challenge in implementing forecast is the monetary consensus forecast needs to be conditioned on a path for monetary policy that covers of monetary policy.  Coming to broad agreement on the entire policy path, including the balance sheet, every forecast round seems, to me, a very difficult task.  But using the market-implied or status quo path for policy also seems to me deeply Committee introduced strong forward guidance back in August of 2011, financial market participants quarters. condition my forecast on the market policy path during that time, my forecast would have had unemployment rising significantly publishing such a dismal at all.

response to the idea of a status quo forecast based on the policy from the I think it has similar problems.  Importantly, that kind of approach does not forecast that would enhance our communications with the public. I have a similar previous meeting. yield a assumption for monetary policy that produces a truly informative policy.  Forecasts that assume appropriate way, they provide policy intentions and the relationship to the the assumption that To my mind, the only forecast is the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, by design, converge to our longer-run objectives over time.  In this clear, direct information regarding our accomplishment of our objectives.  Of course, appropriate policy is exactly

October 23-24, 2012

I have felt this way for some time-is that we should improve or enhance the SEP and focusing our we have in the SEP.  So this brings me back to the SEP.  I think the best approach going forward-and to better accomplish our communication goals.  Specifically, publishing communication on the median SEP projection is a low-cost and workable substitute for consensus forecasts.

am comfortable publishing the median forecasts of the voters or the nondissenting median is a robust statistic.  It should be relatively insensitive to the I voters.  Either way, the rotating membership of the Committee.

year was that the median forecast from generated coherent forecasts consistent with that is a driver of a lot of this discussion was the April you look at the range of SEP projections versus the FOMC statement, clearly tension.  But looking at the memo that we received, if you took the median you included all voters, I think the tension would have been relatively modest.  I also stages, or early growing pains, of having experience with policy rate also in the early period of having such far-forward guidance in the Presumably we have learned from that process, so I don't think we will repeat the I thought the staff memo reporting various median SEP projections over this very useful in testing out how this would have worked.  It shows the voters or the nondissenting voters would have the FOMC statements.  The one case meeting.  And there, if there was forecast from the nondissenting voters, there would be no tension with the FOMC statement. And even if think I wouldn't try to relive April too much.  I think April was a time when we were learning, we were still in the early projections.  We were statement. difficulties we faced in April.

the detailed questions, I am okay with distributing internally the SEP externally. In terms of some of matrix with attribution.  I personally find it very useful to understand my colleagues' views.  I don't think at this time we should be doing that actually have a technical question on that.  For the I understand it, we are asked what the unemployment rate will be at the end of the we would have at liftoff.  So would you add If we did, I think that would be fine. In terms of the scatter plot issue, I scatter plot, as year.  We are not asked what unemployment rate that kind of question to get this scatter plot right?

consensus forecast and places on staff, I think we should end the consensus forecast exercise at focusing our efforts on emphasizing the median forecast.  Thank you. In sum, because of the daunting challenges in implementing the the very high burdens it this time.  I think our communication goals can be better achieved by enhancing the SEP by

The staff memo does a very good job in such a consensus projection.  As always, thanks for all of the hard At any opener.  I didn't think it describing the range of issues we have had to confront and the difficult decisions that we would have to make to produce work; it was really well done.

I think it is useful to remember the firstCommittee's policy decision.  As President Williams alluded to, the Rather than discuss all of the nettlesome details, order issue.  In its current form, the SEP is a problematic tool for describing the forecast rationale underlying the

Our by the time of the press conference, with the information he needs to effectively communicate the role of the outlook in our policy decisions.

Of course, if the Chairman really wants this, we could try harder. are just too many issues to work out at the moment, from handling assumptions for a future policy to the conventions for endorsement.  We might be able to come to handle the issues and produce an informative product by the time I don't see how we could ever do this in time for the postmeeting could not do so without severely compromising the FOMC as a deliberative process. I don't think we are close to being at that point with the consensus forecast, and I am not really sure we can There complete path for up with a satisfactory way the minutes come out.  And we may want to pursue some experimentation with putting together a forecast conditioned on common policy assumptions consistent with the actions of the Committee at the meeting.  But press conference.  Certainly, we meeting itself median forecast of as fully a coherent would go a long way to describing the voters who were in I think, however, that we can make improvements to the SEP that would make it a much better tool.  First, at the press conference, I think we should highlight the those Committee members voting for the policy.  True, this need not be economic projection as the consensus forecast would be, but it has to be an improvement over 19 different viewpoints.  The median of the supporting voters collective judgment that underlay the policy decision.  When we add in other members or participants who didn't agree with the policy decision, it is not helpful for explaining any nuances in the decision.  We could go ahead and publish the median of the

There are all kinds of cuts of the data that we we chose to do that. favor of it, as well as the could produce if you that I would be willing to publish the entire matrix of I am fine with doing that with attribution.  If we can't get there, I for put together the scatter plots that they like-although the particular you were talking about, President Williams, would not be conveyed.  At a minimum, I It probably doesn't surprise SEP submissions myself. would at least identify the members voting for the policy decision, if that were possible.  With the matrix, the public would be able to see the individual projections and judge the rationales themselves.  They could issue would distribute these internally with attribution and also include balance sheet assumptions whenever possible.  Thank you.

persuasive in the consensus forecast at this time.  Different weighting of the policy, as well as the a consensus with such a large committee-with MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  The staff memo is quite describing the challenges with dual mandate, different views on the transmission mechanism of monetary many operational challenges in reaching members with rotating votes-make a quick resolution of these problems unlikely.

communication objective should be for this own view is that the most important objective for communication is to make clear given that we are setting policy, at least in part, by being more It is important to focus on what the primary exercise.  My what outlook for inflation and unemployment justifies the Committee's policy decision as communicated through the statement.  The second most important objective is to make clear how unexpected changes in the path of inflation and unemployment are likely to influence future policy actions, particularly explicit about our future intentions.

I would prefer to make these who did not.  This would avoid the problem of not and nonvoters that occurred at the April meeting.  The public could also those who are likely to be voting members in future years.  It also makes his or her own forecasts, and the public could discount those systematic errors or that have serious consistency problems.  However, make participants less willing to compromise would propose an year they are voting.  I but with the participants not identified. At this time, I do not believe a primary communication objectives.  I do believe that an enhanced SEP is the best way forward. Each participant should provide a funds rate and the balance sheet path from the previous SEP, which I would do at This would eliminate the problem of vastly different policy variables being policy.  At meetings where policy is changed, forecasts based on the previous SEP would presumably show outcomes that necessitated submissions public with attribution.  The public would then see the views of those who supported the statement and those distinguishing voters associate forecasts with each participant accountable for forecasts that have large there is a legitimate concern that attribution may during the meeting.  If disclosure with attribution does not have support, I enhanced SEP that distinguishes voters from nonvoters, based on the would release all of the variables by participant, remaining concerns with the approach we adopt. An enhanced SEP with full disclosure could begin with the first press conference next year.  That would give us time to work out any Thank you.

I have more modest objectives than what the subcommittee seems to have particular, the get this baseline view out there, given assumptions about future policy that my main comment is that the process around this should not be an attempt to make policy decisions through an agreement on forecasts outside of actual FOMC meetings, and I agree with President Evans on this.

One way to do an event where you an updated Fed forecast, given the recent policy decision as it's understood in markets at Finally, the third thing is divorced somewhat from the FOMC meeting itself, so that we are not in this position of trying to scramble around to put the statement out there.  I just don't see it as being part of this process here, the meeting itself that particular meeting. that would be, during the middle of an intermeeting period, you could have give that point in time.

I would like to remind the Committee that I don't really I don't oppose the changes to the SEP, but much of the impetus for this was that there was dissatisfaction with the SEP.  So see this as helpful, to go back to the SEP and then have the same list of complaints about it that we have had before.

my outlook I think the main issue with the publication that everyone really wants to know what the Chairman's view are not going to care about anyone else's we really willing to go that far? Identifying members is fine with me.  I am happy to discuss my forecast or on the economy and all kinds of issues at length.  But of names and voters, and so on, is is.  And once they have the Chairman's view, they view, which is fine.  But, you know, are approach that I am suggesting, which is to go get it a little bit offline with the the minutes or a little bit after the minutes or I do think it would provide fit together, at least from the staff's perspective, So I think we would be better off with the to the staff forecast, put in market-based policy assumptions, actual meetings-either the same time as somewhere else in the intermeeting period-and have it be quarterly. a lot of information for financial market participants and the private sector in general, because they want to understand how the pieces

enhances accountability by confronting the Committee with the difficult task of rationalizing according to the dual perspective that the Committee forecast is supposed to augment the entirely appropriate to be focusing on the set of people who voted for the done as a collective process.  The staff memo was excellent.  I wouldn't call it and convincing that this can't be done. MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  So, in my view, the point of a Committee forecast is to augment the statement, to illustrate why the Committee is making the decision it is making through its outlook on key variables such as unemployment and inflation. It what its decisions are in terms of the variables it is charged to influence mandate.  So given the statement, I see it as statement when we are thinking about the forecast.  Now, I had always hoped and thought that this should be uplifting [laughter], but it was excellent about it, I realized that the people who had voted for the statement it because they viewed it as appropriate policy, and they had appropriate policy.  So there should what we want to achieve, which is some collective judgment of what would be, and then a collective forecast based on that.  So, to summarize, it median projections of those who voted for the and have the Chairman use that as backdrop for his press After thinking presumably had voted for formulated their projections under what they thought of as be a confluence between appropriate policy strikes me as eminently reasonable to release the statement with the statement, conference.

I think there are a lot of arguments for sharing those am not sure I am willing at this moment in time to go along with all of them.  I be in the minutes.  The all of the heterogeneity of A number of the other suggestions have to do with enhancing our description of the heterogeneity of views held at the meeting. with the public.  I would like to think more about that.  But my basic principle is this:  Anything that has to do with the heterogeneity of views that are being described in the meeting should Chairman shouldn't have to stand up there and take responsibility for viewpoints being expressed in the meeting; that doesn't make any sense.  He is there to explain the Committee decision and the statement, and then the projection of the people who voted for the statement should help him with that.

can go on thinking about that.  Certainly the SEP, you would put in the minutes.  That would be my starting want to slice and dice am open to lots of other suggestions. What should be included in the minutes in terms of the heterogeneity of views?  I maintain an open mind about that.  I think we in its current form, would be one thing point:  Take the SEP in its current form, and put it in the minutes.  How we it beyond that, I

I found very useful in the process was, I really would like to have people's forecast of what the I think it was almost accidental, but I found it a very revealing step when economic conditions would be if they were in charge, what the Committee would do.  And then sharing that where we are all coming from.  So those are my comments, Mr. One thing forecasts conditional on their version of optimal policy and based on their Committee would do. we saw not just what people's forecasts for but also based on their forecasts of internally with attribution, I think, would really enhance our discussions.  I think it would give us a much clearer idea of Chairman.  Thank you.

I also want to thank the staff for the excellent work that they experiments have highlighted the considerable diversity of views firmly believe that historically this agreement on the model of The consensus forecast on the economy and policy held by Committee participants.  I diversity has been a source of strength to the Committee.  However, the extent of our diversity of views poses a considerable hurdle to the development of a consensus forecast.  To have a consensus forecast, as others have pointed out, we need to have more the economy, including a common policy reaction function.  Based in part on the two experiments, I am inclined to think that such agreement is out of reach.

One significant cost, as has certainly recognize that there would be some in terms of assessment of the outlook and policy path.  But given the with the SEP, the Chairman's press conference, and speeches by I think the marginal benefits of a consensus forecast are just modest. Even if agreement could the marginal costs of a been pointed out, is the time required of System staff and Committee participants to produce individual forecasts under different policy paths and to provide other input into the development of the consensus.  As to the benefits, I our ability to communicate a collective tools that we have today Committee participants,

I also think the SEP does a good job of average view of the Committee, which usually isn't going to be far removed forecast would look like if it were feasible.  Still, we have learned this that there may be times when an FOMC meeting produces a policy decision that differs Of the tools that it does an effective job of capturing the diversity of views.

In those a clear opportunity to explain the differences outlook and policy.

may be some opportunities to improve either a pre-vote tally of supporters or postponing the publication of the the table circulated by As useful as the SEP is in its current form, there upon it.  And I will answer just a couple of the questions pertaining to possible enhancements to the SEP.  It seems as though publishing the median projections of just the voting supporters would require projections.  So for timeliness reasons, I would prefer to publish the median of all voters, which would be very similar to the median of voters supporting the statement, as David Reifschneider showed.

plots are Based on our experiments with scatter plots some time ago, I think that the likely to be hard to explain to the public, so I don't think scatter plots would improve our communications all that much.  So I would prefer not to include them in the SEP.

Given our interest in better communicating the Committee's collective judgment, I think that publishing individual details could be counterproductive.  Providing individual detail would probably increase the public's attention on individual forecasts and reduce the attention on the central tendency.

action is the communications but also, perhaps, the most difficult.  It And, finally, I think that publishing more information on the balance sheet biggest opportunity for improving our may be worth exploring the addition to the SEP of individual projections, either quantitative or qualitative, relating to the duration and composition of asset purchases.

October 23-24, 2012

enhancements use before we roll them out to the public.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I am open to considering some enhancements to the SEP.  But to avoid any unintended consequences, I do think we need to have plenty of practice with any we decide to

for all their uncovered some thorny issues that would need around the I've become skeptical whether we will be able to achieve a workable solution. MR. PLOSSER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I, too, want to thank the staff work in helping the subcommittee with its efforts on the consensus forecast.  It has been very helpful and very insightful in helping us work through this.  I've been supportive of the initiative to explore development of an FOMC consensus forecast, and I found the two experiments quite instructive.  As many people have noted, they've to be resolved in going forward with such an initiative.  And, quite frankly, like many table,

October 23-24, 2012

want to touch on a few of the questions.  I'll try not to repeat too much of what's I generally agree with many of Governor Yellen's expressions of concern to tie my comments back to a point purpose of this exercise is and how it relates I already been said. about what these problems really involve, and I also want that President Bullard made about asking what the to the SEP.

one of the challenges of agreeing I want to add to the discussion-I think Governor Yellen mentioned going to take in a meeting and, consistent with that almost means that we have to talked about. of conditioning paths based on, let's say, B, and C, but then if we decided to do something in between, we once again a mistake to think effectively achieve a mechanism that's going to rationalize our policy decision at difficult to implement.  I'm a little bit concerned about heading down So rather than repeat those things, let me suggest that on a conditioning path that this-is that in order to condition on a path of a policy that we're therefore, provide the right set of forecasts have the meeting before the meeting.  I think that is a very difficult and undesirable attribute of this, and I think it could prove quite difficult to implement, as many people have That would suggest we would have to have lots alternatives A, would find ourselves with a problem.  So I think, actually, that it is most likely that we can every meeting.  We'd end up having to do it at every meeting, which we don't do with the SEP, and it's going to be very that road.

SEP, we would also have to think about how we deal as policy tools. So I'm not inclined to want to produce a consensus forecast at each FOMC meeting.  I think it's going to encourage us to overreact to current data, have a short-term focus, and lots of other things.  Even going forward with the with balance sheet issues and other things that we're using

October 23-24, 2012

remain a fan of the SEP and have been for some time, and I continue to think it has guidance.  And I think that the not been with the SEP, which was just revealing participants' views; it is that we were trying to reconcile it with calendar-date guidance.  Now, given the talk of guidance, I think this get rid of the calendar date and move to other forward guidance.  I think we risk undermining the value of the I consider to be some short-term issues caused by that I hope will eventually go away.  I would prefer that we handle improving our communications about the role that the SEP plays and good job of I served us quite well.  I'd like to remind everybody that the concerns that arose in April really arose in part because of the conflict with the calendar-date problem, from my view, has but thresholds or reaction functions or moving away from calendar-date tension is going to be substantially reduced if we mechanisms for describing our SEP if we try to tweak it to address what forward guidance, which, again, any potential conflict by how it fits into the Committee's deliberation.  And, indeed, the Chairman did a pretty that in his press conference when he talked about this, and I think continuing that approach is better.

I alluded to earlier, we only do the SEP quarterly, so getting that would rationalize every meeting would force us to do this every The other thing is that, as into a consensus forecast meeting.  I think that could be terribly expensive, not just on staff but on this Committee as well, on occasion.

to enhance the SEP and use it to the best of our ability to make a role in the deliberations at every meeting.  Making such a distinction could potentially So I'm in favor of trying it useful in our communications.  However, I do oppose any action to distinguish SEP submissions by voters versus nonvoters.  I think such distinctions undermine a long-standing tenet and the actual practice of this Committee that all participants play and formulation of policy

October 23-24, 2012

been the hallmark of effective monetary years.  We would tend to emphasize distinctions that could add to market during the turnover of voters at the end of the year.  At the December that are voting next year or the current year? nonvoters in the SEP does much to resolve the median forecast difference between voters and trivial, so I don't see any reason to make that distinction.  Doing it that fails to make it known that people who are voters one year won't be voters next year or year will be voting in the future.  I think it's a role in the going forward.  Again, the staff memo shows that the medians are not really that much purpose. undermine the collaboration among participants that's policy for many volatility, particularly meeting, do we talk about voters being the people So I don't really think designating voters versus potential differences.  As we have seen, nonvoters is really pretty way also some year later, or people who are not voting this important for the public to understand everybody's views because they will all play process different.  So I see no reason to make this distinction; it doesn't serve very a very good idea. a coherent view of the I'm okay with doing it with attribution, but I actually see some benefit to not is going to want to know what the Chairman else may matter, and I think it might put undue pressure on him.  Or if you do you wanted to use attribution.  But I think it would bring a lot of do it any other way.  So I'm inclined to want to I have no problem with releasing the full matrix.  I think that would be It allows people to line up projections with appropriate policy, so you get range of views and where they're coming from.  So I have no problem with publishing that and making it public. giving attribution on that.  I think, again, everybody says, and nothing it with attribution, another option would be to do it with everybody except the Chairman.  That would be another possibility if pressure and focus on the Chairman if we tried to publish the full matrix without names at this point.

October 23-24, 2012

would also be supportive of publishing scatter plots of the combinations of you want to know the truth, because they are actually a pretty good substitute you where everybody thinks liftoff is going to occur.  You get the range of can get a modal value for the unemployment and inflation rates; and, more how that may change through time as the economy evolves.  So I think view is evolving about when liftoff is for getting liftoff.  So I think that actually you will, and we could use it to I unemployment and inflation expected to prevail at the time of liftoff.  I think those are actually quite informative.  Actually, I think they're more informative than trying to come up with thresholds, if because they tell views; you importantly, you can see there's a very useful way of looking at how the Committee will be and what the range of acceptable values could be a very useful tool as a substitute for the thresholds, if our advantage.

the balance sheet is evolving.  I think it would us to think harder about how we might incorporate information about what the balance sheet is doing and how it's evolving.  I don't know that I good answer about how to do that right now, but I think it's something that we ought to go through some experiments with. I think there are some issues that we need to think about in terms of the balance sheet. Obviously, a lot of our policy today is about how be useful in the SEP for participants' views of have a give some thought to and perhaps at a quarterly level and do it, whether they be about rolling out the entire matrix or about be the best strategy for us at this point. So I think at this point, we should focus our attention on enhancing the SEP and set aside the consensus forecast for the time being.  We should keep the SEP some experiments with enhancing other ways we could produce scatter plots that might be informative and communicative about what the Committee is thinking.  I think that may

October 23-24, 2012

of a quarterly monetary policy report, much like Jim Bullard, report somewhat differently.  I actually think that the SEP, particularly the basis of a quarterly report that highlights the monetary policy report doesn't hinge on a consensus forecast at every meeting action.  So I see it as a different exercise with a little different purpose, I think it could prove very useful and an important communication tool when combined and it.  So that's where I am.  Thank you very I remain supportive although I see the policy enriched as we're talking about, can provide outlook of the Committee and the range of views, and would provide us with an opportunity to talk more about the economy, give richer descriptions, and talk more broadly about the policy strategies that we're using, as a way of enhancing our communication to the public.  And in that sense, the monetary that justifies a particular but integrated with the SEP as we've been developing much.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  President Lacker.

and effort to the consensus forecast initiative.  The a good job of spelling out why it requires us to agree on far more than is necessary consensus on what we put in the policy statement. MR. LACKER.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I'll join the call for abandoning ship.  I think it's not worth really devoting any more time staff has done to obtain a workable coherent way to aggregate our diverse views, and views about policy.  We're asked for projections conditioned on a given I don't think going to lead to disaster under a lot of different scenarios, and forecast. In particular, I don't think we found a in particular, our diverse policy path, but that request can be interpreted in several different ways.  One way it's meant is a reaction function that's literally fixed and invariant with respect to shocks-that doesn't make any sense.  It's averaging over those scenarios is going to lead to a really poor

October 23-24, 2012

reaction function and my model economy and putting shocks will yield that policy path?  Are we supposed to assume that the economy either.  I mean, that's the doesn't make sense.  I think what people have reaction function, but in a lot of cases that's going to mean that forecasts about the economy are going to be driven away from each other.  It might the views about policy, but then it spreads apart views about how the I supposed to assume this is sort of perfect foresight with a one-time adoption of a new that this policy rule is learned by the public over time?  And in a situation where worried about inflation expectations and how they behave, that's a germane thing So does it mean taking my into the economy that turns out to make us want to do that?  I don't think people mean that way, maybe, Professor Sims would do it, but that in mind is substituting a different participants' unify the presentation of economy behaves.  And it raises other questions:  How are expectations supposed to be handled? Am policy rule, or some of us are for some forecasts.

single out the policy reaction function?  I mean, on the other side of the coin, instead that the structure of the economy is such that we agree on the That's an equally plausible way to get us to the same policy.  So it just logical to single out policy, condition on that, and not condition on It was never clear to me.  So I don't think we've figured out a way to aggregate And why why not have us assume appropriate policy path? doesn't seem to me to be anything else. views other than just sort of averaging appropriate policy, our view of the forecast, and just average or take the median of what we do.  Anyway, that's just my two cents about the conditioning part of the consensus forecast.

number of modifications have been proposed; I great step I think it would make sense to continue relying on the SEP.  I think that conveys our views about the economic outlook and policy.  A like a bunch of them.  I think circulating our submissions with attribution would be a

October 23-24, 2012

don't see why we need to be coy with each other.  I think it would within the Committee.  I improve incentives and perhaps even increase effort devoted to the forecast.

I don't see a huge value in it either.  I think it's sort of, literally, a secondnot aware of a huge public clamoring for the information.  You know, release, there's going to be curious about something else and will want to ask for more, so slope there.  You referred to that in your remarks, Governor Yellen. On the scatter plots, matrices of individual forecasts, I don't have strong objections to publishing those, but order consideration.  I'm maybe one or two people have asked for it, but no matter how much we somebody who's there's an inevitable slippery could understand why that would be very useful and a logical thing to do we go down the road of calling attention to the difference between voters and forward-guidance language represent any sort of implied nonvoters, we'll be encouraging people to think that the policy and the policy guidance itself could change when the voting roster changes. does it make to give forward guidance?  I don't understand that.  In you view future voters as constrained by current policy, why wouldn't you want to consensus view?  Why wouldn't you want to downplay the difference going to I think some of the proposed modifications would be bad ideas.  I don't think it makes any sense to distinguish between voters and nonvoters or between voters supporting the statement and others.  I if voting membership didn't rotate, but it does.  And because it does, it raises really problematic questions.  If nonvoters, does the current commitment that constrains future voters?  Sort of a fundamental question here.  If we emphasize the difference between voters and action in the future If that's true, what sense contrast, if emphasize the collective between voters and nonvoters?  I think that drawing attention to these differences is undermine the value of forward commitment because if there's evidence of disagreement, it's

October 23-24, 2012

year-end as voting membership changes.  So it seems to going to imply it could shift around at me shortsighted and potentially counterproductive.

been a huge problem.  People have been citing the April discrepancy in the rate paths.  As I said yesterday, the motivation for the consensus forecast in the SEP and the guidance you count the dots in April, it's clear there were enough possible voters to support that I think that general notion is consistent with the evidence we saw generally aligned with the Committee's I don't see this as having statement, and as President Plosser pointed out, it's mainly an issue for the forecast of the funds initiative was this perceived dissonance between the funds rate path in the language.  At some level, I don't think there's been that much dissonance because if carefully statement's calendar date. yesterday from Mr. Potter that market participants have view about future policy.

you do that careful dot count, at times-and April is a good example-it's revealed the direction of an earlier liftoff. has been there.  Now, we could have adopted a different calendar that resulted in fewer perceived skews of the nonvoters, but we didn'twith that.  It's the prerogative of the Chairman and the voting members of the But if that the views of the nonvoters sometimes have been skewed in There's no doubt that skew date at that meeting, one and I'm fine Committee to choose a workable consensus from a range of possibilities.

and at the time we chose that was independent of the choice of the voters.  Publishing the funds rate projection in replacing the SEP I think the burden of adjustment, if any adjustment is needed, should But the range of participants' views is an objective reality, in April, it the SEP represented a move in the direction of more transparency about those views, and I think it would be a step backward to damp or limit information about the views by with some sort of consensus forecast.  More broadly, if dissonance is a problem between the voters and the nonvoters,

fall to the statement and the statement language, not to the SEP.  So those are my views.  I favor moving ahead with the SEP.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

the SEP.  It's just a question of whether to add a subset.  President CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Just for clarity, I don't think anybody is proposing eliminating the full range of Lockhart.

Yellen was going through going to add a little bit to the commentary this morning. MR. LOCKHART.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As Governor her commentary earlier, I found myself in substantial agreement with almost everything she said, then others also have supported much of that, and there have been other thoughts.  I'm just to make a few points to try the sort of abstract point that the FOMC makes a consensus decision more achievable than a consensus a decision.  I think this exercise makes that more clear as a practical matter, and I reality.  So we're not the England, and we're not the Riksbank either. In an earlier discussion some months ago, I made institutional setup of the rationale for think it's unavoidable that our communication is influenced by that Bank of

about purposes; several I consider to be a primary purpose of this Whatever decision we make, I think it's important to be clear have pointed that out.  Particularly, what communication tool is to equip the Chairman to explain in his press conference why a policy decision was made and what it's expected to accomplish.

I weighed the arguments in the staff memo, the balance of pros and cons seemed to consensus forecast and settling for an improved SEP.  I press conference. As me to lean in favor of abandoning the would support the suggestions made by the staff in the memo, for the most part.  The median of voters-I like the idea of the median of supporters, if that could be compiled quickly between the time of the end of the meeting and the time of the

October 23-24, 2012

I made this argument, again, some months from criminology [laughter]-Kremlinology that just feeds the beast of articles be that material. I support publishing the full matrix of submission information.  I'm a bit uncomfortable with full attribution to the public, name by name. ago, and it's important.  I say this word carefully.  I don't want to encourage Kremlinologythat's different about who said what exactly and tries to create dissension within the Committee that may, in fact, not exist or at least not go forward with another trial of the common policy assumption going into the forecast exercise.  As I think about it, The first is the policy status quo ante, but that doesn't help in the press basically says what the policy as it existed before the meeting would in terms of a forecast, and that doesn't help if we make a decision in the meeting. So let me just take a second and say if we were to consensus forecast-and I'm not totally ready to throw in the towel-I think it's obvious a key requirement is a there are three options: conference because that accomplish

expectations, probably derived from the I can't get comfortable with having, essentially, the external world dictate our forecast.  It just seems to me to be too dependent on outside opinion, The second would be a summary of market dealer survey. base assumption for a which in some cases diverges from opinion within the Committee.

consensus going into the meeting about the path is sort of similar in spirit to the approach in one trial where the Chairman going to summarize the forecast and come back to us with a summary statement that then we going to decide whether we bought into or didn't buy into.  So if the Chairman were think he might just provide an adequate enough assumption of the Then the third option I see is that the Chairman defines an assumption, perhaps broad enough to be inclusive of what seems to be the of policy.  I think that was were comfortable doing this, I

October 23-24, 2012

ideal.  To be ready for a press conference, a forecast based on the actual feasible.  So it does appear to be extremely difficult. policy.  None of these is decision is not really adopt a consensus forecast approach, I do favor doing the exercise for each after each meeting, and knowing the Chairman's view on be the final nail in the coffin.  So those are my comments.  Thank you, If we meeting.  I don't think we can render half the meetings more equal than the other half.  I think this would require a press conference this [laughter], that may Mr. Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Vice Chairman.

of the real difficulties with the consensus forecast.  I think there is a am with others in that I think that to fix the I have noted in the past, the SEP has numerous difficulties, so I I think at the end of the day, in terms of what we want to do, VICE CHAIRMAN DUDLEY.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I think the staff memo did a great job outlining some consensus about the consensus forecast today, obviously.  So I it makes sense to spend our time now turning back to the SEP process, to try shortcomings of the SEP.  As just want to restate those, because we want to fix the SEP so that it works correctly.

difficulty is that the central tendencies are not consistent across the different are important to people in the markets.  And, third, the interest rate projections are The first variables.  The second is that there is no way to distinguish voters and participants, and those differences not tied back explicitly to the real economic variables in a consistent manner.  So my test for the SEP is something that actually fixes those three things.

posed by the staff memo, I have one caveat about the median I don't really I want a median In terms of the questions projection of voters supporting the statement.  I'm not really opposed to it, but want a median forecast where it is the medians of the individual variables.

October 23-24, 2012

a consistent set of variables.  So I would encourage the staff to see how I think if we just have a median forecast that is just the having a consistent I just wanted to highlight. forecast that actually has one would go about doing that, because medians of the individual variables, we haven't solved the issue of actually set of forecasts.  And that seems to be a problem that of the individual forecasts, and I would identify and nonvoters.  But I also would be happy to identify what year the going to become voters, so people could actually anticipate when they actually especially as we get late in the year and people year flips over.  I don't feel strongly about the guess I would favor publishing the Kremlinology issue.  But I would be happy to I think that you want to give the Chairman a little bit more Obviously, if we identify voters and nonvoters, and the nonvoters by the year they going to be pretty easy to identify most of the forecasts.  So if you decide to well just disclose all of the forecasts. I do think that publishing a median forecast, though, is still second best to putting out a lot of additional information.  I would publish all the forecasts as voters nonvoters are move into the voting-because that does matter, start to anticipate what is going to happen as the names versus no names issue, in terms of public disclosure.  I names in the interest of transparency, to avoid the defer to others on that.  If we do publish the names, though, I think you want to publish everybody but the Chairman, because flexibility. become voters, it is go that far, you might as

where we come out in terms of external disclosure, it is crazy point of that is, so I exchange of information within the Committee, and I think that is the try to build on.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that regardless of not to circulate the forecasts and the names internally.  I don't see what the think that we should have all of that stuff circulated.  I think the consensus forecast exercise actually did improve the one lesson of the exercise that we should actually

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Duke.

October 23-24, 2012

consensus forecast even like the idea of rushing to publish the fed funds rate projections.  So these are designed so much to provide more transparency about room but, rather, as an attempt to show more agreement than I believe MS. DUKE.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I have not been a fan of the idea, and I didn't efforts just don't feel to me like they the range of views in the actually exists.

feel even more conflicted about signing up for a more comprehensive level of agreement about going to be made over a number of years than I found necessary to allow at any given meeting.  The reason why it is so hard to formulate a feel like And as one who has occasionally struggled to support the decisions about current policy, I the decisions that are me to support the policy consensus forecast might actually be because there is not that much consensus.  So I trying to shoehorn a large majority into agreement on several dimensions could actually increase the level of dissent and be counterproductive to the strength of the policy statements.

I going to do in three or years is especially difficult.  So trying to come up with more detailed communication complexity.  So to the extent that the consensus forecast fed funds rate is actually the only policy variable available. I know the communications in the current environment have been awkward at times, but think it is because decisionmaking in this environment is really hard.  And there are a lot of moving parts, and we are in uncharted territory, and knowing what we are four devices doesn't necessarily reduce that implies any commitment, it seems to me more likely that such efforts will yield better results when the path of the work to do for the next meeting, by seems an unproductive use, or less productive use, of critical staff As Governor Yellen noted earlier, there is a lot of primarily by the staff.  There is always a lot of work for the next meeting to be done primarily the staff.  And this effort resources that are also needed to understand the costs and the benefits of the policy actions that

October 23-24, 2012

I strongly believe that this is the wrong priority for these valuable we are actually taking.  So resources.

also don't see who supported the you are talking about projections of policy for three years, some point in the projection period.  And, once exposing varying degrees of conviction in support or pushing some either of these actions I also think it is a real possibility that this solution could By now, my answers to the first set of questions are probably obvious.  I the value in separating the submissions of individuals, or voters, or voters action, or any other subgroup.  If everyone submitting projections will be voting at again, separating the views of those supporting the action from those who did not could have one of two outcomes-either who are on the edge of support into dissenting positions.  I fail to see how strengthens our policy statements. create a new source of awkwardness for the Chairman to explain at a press conference.

SEP should include a balance sheet variable as well as a fed funds LSAPs among the voters, and the If our objective is to be truly transparent, and we do decide to go down this road, the policy variables that are in the variable.  If we had adopted this approach prior to our last meeting, the public would have been able to see the diversity of expectations about continuing market reaction would likely have been quite different.

guess I am in the camp of 'be careful what you wish for,' and let's be very careful what we plan to do before we go public with it.  Thank you, Chairman. So I that we know the consequences of Mr.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Tarullo.

October 23-24, 2012

the of the work of her subcommittee, meaning put the consensus in cold storage, and then follow inclination she had on each of these six items.

a couple of things to elaborate a few points.  One, as I think has become close to saying this-there are two basic ways you can get to collective group.  One is through a consensus-type approach, and the other is process is I think it is pretty clear congressional committee than it does a committee curricular reform, which is to say that it begins with a lot of views that up there most of the time.  [Laughter]  We just account of the idiosyncrasies of this group.  One, that it's big; another, that it is I think Janet said, so there is no real ongoing opportunity for It's not Let me just say clear-and Dennis came judgments on things in any through an aggregation-of-individual-positions approach.  Almost no decisionmaking purely in one realm or in the other; everything is kind of a hybrid.  But that this Committee more resembles a producing a proposal for are basically at odds with one another, and it ends need to take geographically dispersed, as interaction; and third, that it's pretty polarized in ideological terms right now. unpleasant; it is just polarized.

as a way to get what we do with the monetary policy votes.  At some will vote yea or nay.  The difficulty with the with a lot of different outputs, and that has just proved So I think we do need to lean more toward the aggregation of views collective judgments, and that is really point, the Chairman defines something on which we consensus statement is it required this sense of manifold inputs into a process that could be shaped in a lot of different ways unmanageable.

you start from my working proposition that we are closer to the end of the spectrum, without being anywhere near all the way there, I aggregated-and having everybody's views On the SEP, if congressional committee think, in general, just having the individual views

October 23-24, 2012

as people have said, some will be voters tomorrow and some next year and after that-is in general the best way to go but with one exception.  That is A-the I support Janet on A. aggregated, because some the year likely future path of policy-which is why does seem to me that we have to get some reconciliation of the actual decision taken in particular meeting with the the policy path and economic developments as reflected in the SEP.

So I endorse everything Janet said, I feel most strongly about A.  Thank It a particular meeting by those who happen to have a vote at that projection of anomaly may well remain Plosser is right that it was a growing pain. will be a reconciliation of the collective judgment as manifested in the policy collective judgment on the the bottom line is, while you.

creation of a possible rich results.  This was because these that different want to also commend the staff, in policymaking decisions that this Committee MS. RASKIN.  Thank you.  The two experiments regarding the consensus forecast provided us, I think, with really experiments were conducted in the context of several economic headwinds participants weighted in different ways, and these experiments were also conducted in the context of a range of different policy responses and different views as to what constitutes monetary policy.  So the laboratory conditions were a close approximation to the conditions that exist here in real-life policy decisionmaking.  That said, I particular, for conducting the experiments with true laboratory-like conditions, in a way that I would say did not interfere with the very difficult was undertaking simultaneously.

conducting these experiments is that the hard issues involved in we suitably anchor, future paths of the fed funds rate and the balance sheet.  And so we're back to of these likely further paths, both for the fed What we find after framing a consensus forecast have been brought to the foreground.  Even if for experimental purposes, a set of policy assumptions upon which we can all build a forecastwhich is what we did in the second experiment-those assumptions become of limited value in terms of the likely a place where everyone then has a different view funds rate and the balance sheet, and hence different views of what constitutes appropriate monetary policy.  We also saw the almost humorous challenges involved in asking participants whether they broadly endorsed the forecast, sometimes subject to specific qualifications and sometimes not.

you have said, really presents a logistical challenge.  Policy needs to be imbedded in the choices reflected in it, but such a forecast isn't possible until after the carefully had the chance to analyze its effects on the going into each meeting decisions to come at that meeting, but if indeed policy decisions are So these results and challenges leave us at a crossroads.  We can try to create a consensus forecast a different way, or we can try to make the SEP better.  The consensus forecast, as many of forecast, but the policy isn't decided upon until the meeting.  We want the public to see the forecast with the policy Committee has voted and the staff has forecast.  Alternatively, we could construct a consensus forecast unvarnished by the policy made at the meeting, the going-in forecast will not contain the effects of these policy decisions.

October 23-24, 2012

consensus forecast is the was the forecast it was presented with as it decisions that have been made thus far, before any that have been made monetary policy. We might not have a problem with a consensus forecast that contains the last meeting's policy decision, but there would have to be another communication step inserted.  In other words, the public would have to understand under that scenario that the forecast that the Committee generally agreed convened its FOMC meeting.  The public would have to understand that this consensus forecast imbeds monetary policy at the meeting.  The public would then have to understand that the Committee would use this consensus forecast as the forecast to consider when it decides appropriate forecast, the Chairman would not have, by the So if we don't like having to explain all of this, hundreds of ways that that could be you have said, to reiterate our But with this conception of a consensus time of his press conference, a forecast that imbeds the most recent decision into the forecast. He'd have to indicate that this would come later. we're left trying to enhance the SEP, and there are probably done.  To narrow them down, it makes sense, I think, as several of purposes.

a consensus, we could think about consensus document.  From this perspective of creating a consensus the median projection of nondissenting voters costless and not a jarring addition to the disclosures already made to the public.  The communication It might be very far away from what a perfectly appropriate monetary For example, if it is our purpose to communicate retrofitting the SEP as a forecast proxy via the SEP, the idea of publishing may provide a useful communication tool.  It has the virtue of being relatively being enhancement, though, would only be a proxy. constructed consensus forecast might look like.  It might imbed a view of policy-fed funds path and a balance sheet path-that are not at all representative of the whole

October 23-24, 2012

middle person on each variable, it might look Committee.  But in highlighting the median, the like a centrist view.

a couple of things about some of the other possible SEP enhancements.  First, as I'll say suggested by President Plosser, the scatter plot might convey useful information to the public.  It is not as helpful, I think, as setting thresholds in the FOMC statement, but maybe it is a baby step that would begin to accustom the public to the use of thresholds.

convey meaningful information by by name.  The use of names, even when used internally only, and the addition of different perspectives.  Injecting a notion of egotism that should play no role in the collective Second, I'm not that enthusiastic that we distinguishing members diminishes, in my mind, the robustness of the Committee as a whole by potentially chilling individual contributions identities could introduce an element of decisionmaking body that is the FOMC.

always been reluctant to disclose for the mere sake of quantity and don't any new disclosures in terms of what the Finally, I've think that any of this substitutes for quality.  I also don't like an incremental disclosure pattern and prefer to explain to the public the reasons for disclosures are, in fact, intended to reveal.  Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you.  Governor Stein.

MR. STEIN.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I agree that it makes sense to table the consensus forecast project for now.  The limitations have been pretty well explained, both in the memo and by others who have spoken before me.  So I won't pile on here.

October 23-24, 2012

agreeable with many of the things that have been good thing to do.  I'm to circulate our stuff internally with people's names.  That's pretty much it. In terms of modifying the SEP, I'm proposed.  In particular, I think it's a good idea to publish the median projection of the voters supporting the statement.  Publishing the scatter plot seems also like a perfectly open to the idea of doing the matrix, preferably anonymized, and also I think it's probably a good idea Thank you.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Thank you very much.  Governor Powell.

forecast is I would say that I think there may be something still in the idea of a report, either with or without a consensus forecast.  I think it's worth aside from this for now. MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  I also agree that the consensus not doable now, although quarterly monetary policy holding that thought comfortable with most of the ideas that have been put empirically identical, and I'm comfortable with publishing any of them.  I'd publish would identify voters on it, but not by name. As far as the SEP is concerned, I'm forward.  I would publish the median projection of voters.  For that matter, all of the medians are essentially the scatter plot, and I

would not try to publish the balance sheet projections, just for the reasons that I don't you do with an open-ended program and I also think you're going to wind up being that brought down the I know what dragged into a policy discussion over that again, which has been the thing consensus forecast.

would go ahead and publish the full matrix.  I would not do it with names.  I just think I the issue with names is that it has the potential to change outcomes to bring forward human traits, like risk aversion and reluctance to admit error, that I see others experiencing from time to

October 23-24, 2012

would be very happy to circulate-in fact, I thought we already did thiscan't think of a good reason not to do that. time.  And finally, I the projections internally under our own names.  I

we could have an inertial component to our the medians first and And let me end with a thought that maybe SEP publication function and maybe put a toe in the water by publishing then move into the scatter plot and/or the matrix over time.  Just a thought.

actually a very is important to remind ourselves of the goal, which is both to show the the Committee's decisions.  So CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Okay.  Thank you very much.  This was informative go-round.  It diversity of views and to provide a coherent outlook that justifies I think both of those things are important.

Under the heading of the got specific attention, and it would be easy enough to go got mentioned considerably. There was the consensus forecast exercise SEP, there were a number of things that around and figure out how many supported each.  The median voter idea, the scatter plots, the matrix, and possibly balance sheet information were ones that report, and President Plosser and Governor Powell mentioned that I think we should consider this a less-urgent issue at this point, but I myself also existing congressional semiannual report and including information go forward. President Bullard was one of the few who wanted to continue with the consensus forecast, in which he was not joined by many people, but he also mentioned the QMPR, the quarterly monetary policy point as well. think that converting the from Tealbook, Book A, could provide a very useful document at some point in the future, including SEP information or however we wanted to do that.

I would just add onto what I do think it's useful for us to think about, as I indicated in my earlier remarks, what We collect a variety of statistics.  Which of them weeks later, at the time of the minutes? MR. KOCHERLAKOTA.

I just want to say that for a long time, we released the CHAIRMAN BERNANKE.  Yes. SEP with the minutes, and that didn't seem to create major problems.  I think it's perfectly appropriate to release information with the minutes.

I will in a moment adjourn the meeting.  There is lunch available, and you who can stay, after the meeting, Linda Robertson is prepared to give us an now 10 minutes to 1 p.m.; why don't we Okay.  All right. for those of informal update on congressional developments.  It's take 10 to 15 minutes to get our lunch?
