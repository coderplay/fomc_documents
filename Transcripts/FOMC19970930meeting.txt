MR. FISHER.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman.  I  will e  referring    the b to four ages  of olored  harts  n  front  f ou  under  the lass I over.  n p c c i o y C I c 1O the  first ge  are  current  -month  deposit  ates  nd  3-, -, nd  9-month pa 3 r a 6 a forward,  -month  deposit  ates  hat  or he nited  States  re  shown in ed, 3 r t f t U a r for ermany in  blue,  nd  for apan  in reen.  Looking  at he .S.  forward G a J g t U rates,  ou  can  see hat  here  as  been  relatively  ttle   change  since he y t t h li net t Committee's ast  eeting.  Indeed, fter  ising ring ugust, he  forward l m a r du A t rates  re  now back  to  around heir vels  t  the ime f he ugust  meeting a t le a t o t A and  almost ack  to  the ecent  ows  they eached t he ery  end  of uly. b r l r a t v J The single  iggest  ecline  n  U.S.  forward ate  xpectations me on  the b d i r e ca release  f he ugust  CPI on September  16. That  followed    smaller o t A a decline  he  prior  ay  after e  retail les  nd  the PI  data or ugust  were t d th sa a P f A announced.  Looking  at  these ates  oing ack  to  late  arch and  given heir r g b M t recent  eclines, ee  relatively  ttle,  ny, ricing  n  of xpected urther d I  s li if a p i e f action  y  the  Committee  in he onths  ahead. b t m

Looking  down to  the  German forward ates  hown in  blue,  ou can  see r s y that  he ise  n  German rate xpectations at  egan  earlier   the ummer t r i e th b in s has  continued.  hile  both erman  and  some other uropean  data ave W G E h been  somewhat firmer,  believe  he igger mpact  on  German rate I t b i expectations s  come from  the ather  oud hisper ampaign  that  he ha r l w c t Bundesbank has  directed  t  financial rkets. he message  in  effect  s hat a ma T i t in  order or he uropean  monetary  union  to  work,  German and  Italian f t E short-end  ates  ill ave  to  meet  somewhere in etween  their  urrent  evels. r w h b c l With  the  German short-end  ates  ow around  3  percent  nd  Italian ortr n a sh end  rates  round  6  to  6-1/2 ercent, is  mplies   150  basis  oint ise  or a p th i a p r f Germany and  a  150  basis  oint ecline  or taly.  he rather  ublic hisper p d f I T p w campaign  has  been  driving  erman rate  xpectations ,  and  you  can G e up observe  on  the ight  ide f he hart  he ather  ronounced  upward shift r s o t c t r p following  he COFIN  meeting he  weekend of eptember  13 and 14. t E t S

Looking  at he apanese orward ates  n  the ottom  panel,  ou can  see t J f r i b y that  he arious  orward ate aturities ve  continued  o  collapse  n  top  of t v f r m ha t o

the  current  ate.  he release  f he  11.2  percent  annual  ate)  ecline  n r T o t ( r d i second-quarter  P  added  to he  gloom  in  Tokyo. Rather han  try  o  parse GD t t t out  the reen  muddle of ates  t he  bottom  of he hart,  et  e observe hat g r a t t c l m t the  9-month  forward,  -month  yen  deposit  ate  ow trades  t  basis  oints 3 r n a 3 p over  the vernight  ibor ate.  he JGB  benchmark  yield  as  traded  own o L r T h d to  1.86  percent  n  the ast  ouple f ays.  These  relative  ifts  nterest i l c o d sh ini rate xpectations  ve  had  a  fairly edictable pact  on  exchange  markets, e ha pr im with  the en  depreciating  out  2-1/2 ercent  nd  the ark appreciating y ab p a m about  5-1/2 ercent  gainst  he ollar  ince ugust  1.  I  think  his  mpact n p a t d s A t i o the  dollar-mark  xchange  rate  s recisely at  the undesbank  had  in e i p wh B mind when it ngineered  ts  hisper ampaign. e i w c

Turning  to he  second  page, ou  can  see hat  ecent  evelopments ad  a t y t r d h somewhat more complex  impact  on  bond  markets. he four anels  n this T p o page  depict  he asis-point  anges  since uly  1  in -month  forward t b ch J 9 3-month  deposit  ates  mplied y  the RAs  and  in  10-year overnment r i b F g bond  yields.  n  the pper  left  anel,  ou  can  see  the tory  f .S.  interest I u p y s o U rate  arkets s  the ed  lines  ove across  he hart.  e  had  the ally  n  July m a r m t c W r i followed y  the pward spike n  early  ugust.  There  was little  t hange b u i A ne c subsequently  ntil  he ore recent  ally  ssociated th  the elease  f he u t m r a wi r o t August  price  ata uring eptember.  In  the op  panel or apan  on  the ight, d d S t f J r the  persistent  cline  n  Japanese ates, th or 0-year onds  and  forward de i r bo f 1 b interest  te  xpectations,   vident.  n  the  bottom eft  hart or ermany, ra e ise I l c f G we see  a  different  ttern  f nterest  te ovements throughout  he eriod. pa o i ra m t p The 9-month  forward  3-month  deposit  ate as  risen  y  72  basis  oints r h b p since uly  1, hile he  10-year ond  has  traded  ore or  less ideways;  t J w t b m s i rallied  little  September, eclining  8 basis  oints  n  yield. a in d 1 p i

The truly  ramatic  mpact f  the undesbank's  hisper ampaign  was d i o B w c felt  n  Italian terest  te  arkets here  participants rd  the undesbank i in ra m w hea B to  be  saying hree  hings: irst,  e undesbank  would  be  raising tes. t t F th B ra Secondly, he undesbank was so  convinced hat  taly  ould  be  in  EMU t B t I w that  hey ere  prepared o ct n  that  asis. nd third, e undesbank t w t a o b A th B thought  t ould  be  an  EMU-friendly ct or he ank of taly  o  lower  rates i w a f t B I t 150 basis oints.  s shown in  the  panel t he ottom  right, e -month p A a t b th 9 forward  3-month  lira  eposit  ate  eclined  y 125 basis  oints  rom  the d r d b p f beginning f ugust  through ast  riday nd  there  as a  similar  ecline  n o A l F a w d i the  10-year ond  yield. ne of he  questions  hat  ave  come out f his b O t t h o t experience  s ow to  explain  he  stability  long-term  erman interest i h t in G rates.  rom Frankfurt, e  markets ave  heard  that  hen central nks  with F th h w ba real redibility eaten  o  raise  ates, e ong  end  of heir  ield  urve c thr t r th l t y c

remains  stable  r allies. d much to  my surprise, reat  umber of o r An a  g n market  participants e  adopted his  iew  as  their  wn. There  is  an hav t v o alternative  ew  to  which  I  am somewhat partial.   egins y  noting hat vi Itb b t over  the  last  everal  ears he undesbank  has  been  of he iew  that  he s y t B t v t long  end  of heir  ield  urve as  followed he ead f he .S.  and  the t y c h t l o t U global ond  markets, nd  it as  not  really  ollowed xpected hanges  in b a h f e c short-term  erman  interest  tes.  he pattern  f he olid  lue ine  or G ra T o t s b l f Germany does  have  some echo  of he  solid  ed ine or he nited  States. t r l f t U One could  also ote hat  elative   U.S.  and  Japanese 0-year ates, n t r to 1 r German rates  ave  backed  up  by  25  basis oints  ince he eginning  f he h p s t b o t summer. So,  I  think here  s ome excitement  et o  play hrough n t i s y t t i European  bond  markets  as  we move forward oward  EMU. t

The  third  age  of harts  hows percent  hanges  in  equity  ndices  or he p c s c i f t second  and  third  uarters  f  1997. I  have  included  hat  hart  o ake two q o t c t m obvious  points.  irst, uity  arkets ere  somewhat more volatile    the F eq m w in third  uarter  han  in he  second.  Also, here as a  much greater versity q t t t w di of outcomes  in he  third  uarter.  hat  is rue  lobally  nd  also f  e look t t q T t g a i w a some of  the nternal mparisons. or  example, he ASDAQ i co F t N performance was quite ifferent  om  that  f he ow.  The Milan  MlBtel, he erman d fr o t D t G Dax,  and  the rench  CAC  all ad  quite  ifferent  tcomes  and, f ourse, F h d ou o c the okyo Topix  and  its  onstruction  ctor, flecting  e apanese T c se re th J domestic conomy,  also urned n  rather  ifferent  rformances han  other e t i d pe t equity  ndices. i

Turning  to  domestic pen  market  operations,  e  daily  ffective deral o th e fe funds  rate veraged bout  5.55  percent  ver he ntermeeting riod,    little a a o t i pe a higher han  the  intended  ate. his  outcome  reflected incipally  ew t r T pr a  f days  of levated  unds  rates.  'm ot  going  to ake ou  through ll he e f I n t y a t detail  n  these harts, t  I id  want  to  make a  point.  he vertical  ue o c bu d T bl lines  n  the op anel how the  daily  ange  of ederal  unds rading; e i t p s r f f t th horizontal d  lines  re  the aily  ffective  te;  he ertical d  lines re a d e ra t v re represent  ne  standard  eviation  n he olume  of ederal  unds rading  ach o d i t v f f t e day  and  give   sense f he oncentration   dispersion  unds  trading. a o t c or off The  middle  panel hows  our  misses,  hat  s,  he ctual  evel  f ree eserves s t i t a l o f r less  he  intended  evel; e ellow ars ndicate gative  isses nd  the t l th y b i ne m a blue ars  show positive sses. n  the ottom  panel,  ou  see  operating b mi I b y balances s  they  occurred ach  day. a e

My reason  for howing  this  hart  s o  focus n  three ays  in eptember s c i t o d S on  the ight  and  side f he age--the  5 t h r h o t p 1 , 6 1 t h , nd 17th--and o  point ut a t o that  either  hanges  in  operating  alances  lone or ven  our  misses f n c b a n e o some size eally  ell  s  everything  e might  want  know about hat  drives r t u w w volatility he ederal  unds  market.  The 15 t h , 6 t h in  t f f 1 , nd 17 t h a were corporate  ax ayment  dates. n the  15 th , ou  can  see  that  e had  an t p O y w elevated  ffective  te  n  the ay  but   very  narrow  effective  nge,  s e ra o d a ra a

market  participants  iced  p  for he ressures  hey nticipated  d  traded pr u t p t a an funds  in   very  narrow  range.  However,  looking t he iddle  panel or he a a t m f t 15 t h , e had  a  rather  izable  iss  of 2 billion   that  ay.  Even so, e had w s m $ on d w a  relatively  ntained  ederal  unds  rate.  n the  16 co f f O t h , he  effective te  as t ra w right  n  the arget  t -1/2 ercent.  he  one  standard  eviation  rading o t a 5 p T d t range as somewhat wider  on that  ay, ut e again ad  a  miss  and,  if  ou w d b w h y look  at he ottom  of he age,   very  low  operating  alance. n  fact, t b t p a b I we almost it  he istoric w  operating  alance,  ut  we did ot  have  a  terribly h t h lo b b n volatile  y  or  upward pressure  n he  funds arket.  The  next ay,  the da i t m d 17 t h , funds  traded  ver   quite  ide  range t ates  p  to  15 percent  nd  the ne o a w a r u a o standard  eviation  olume of rading  as much wider.  We  had  a  very arge d v t w l miss  and  again   low  operating  alance. a b

The  difference tween  the  16 h be t and  the  17 t h was in  the istribution d f reserves, th  the  need  falling   the arge  egional  anks  whose  behavior wi on l r b pattern  ends o  be  to id p the unds ate. o in his  ase, he ehavior  f t t b u f r S t c t b o those anks  determined he olatility   he  funds  rate   great  eal ore b t v oft a d m than  the evel  f perating  alance r  even  the ize f ur  miss.  I  do  not l o o b o s o o want  to verstate  hat, t  hink t s  a  significant  int  o  emphasize. he o t bu It i i po t T level f  the perating  alance s ot  the nly  factor. o o b i n o

Since  your  last  eeting,  e have  conducted wo  legs f utright m w t o o purchase perations,  th  in  the oupon  sector.  he  bill  arket emains o bo c T m r quite  ight, d  I  have  been  reluctant    enter  hat  arket. o,  I  expect o t an to t m S t continue  o  operate  n he oupon market. here  is  some possibility t t i t c T tha with  the ew fiscal ar he  Treasury  ill e  issuing    larger  mount of ills n ye t w b a a b and  we will  e  able o  return  o  bill  urchases. b t t p

Mr. Chairman,  there  ere no  foreign  xchange  operations r he w e fo t System  account uring he  period ince he ugust  meeting.  I  will eed  the d t s t A n Committee's atification ur  domestic pen  market  operations.  would r of  o o I be  happy  to  answer  any  questions.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Questions or eter? f P

MR.  BROADDUS. A quick  question, ter.  t eems  to  me that  ur  key  concern bout Pe I s o a intra-day nds ate olatility ld  be  the ossibility t  e would give he  wrong signal  o fu r v wou p ha w t t markets.  I  have  not ad  the ense hat nything  ike  hat  as  been  happening ately,  t ou  may h s t a l t h l bu y have  a  different  pression. im

MR. FISHER.  No, I  do  not.   think  he arket  understands  s  well s  any  of s  the I t m a a u implications  ow operating  alances nd  how they  may foster rket  volatility  some days. ofl b a ma on

So,  no,  I  don't  hink uch  volatility   had  any  effect  n  policy  xpectations. n and  I  have t s has o e Do worried hat  t ight  at  some point.  on't  ant  to  make too  much of his, t  we are  making  an t i m Id w t bu effort  o efine  ur  ability  easure  volatility  that  e can  provide he  Committee  with  a  better t r o tom so w t basis  or udging  nd  deciding  hether his  s omething t  hould are  about. f j a w t i s i s c

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Peter,  he umbers  look  quite  ood  in erms  of onfirming t n g t c your  hypothesis  bout he  rate bjectives  he undesbank and  the  Bank of taly.    had  always a t o oft B I I thought hat  he  Bank of taly, ecifically   Italian vernment, ould  have  been  far ore t t I sp the go w m interested   aving  their  ates  onverge ith  the erman rates  t he  bottom  of he  maturity  urve inh r c w G a t t c because,  s  you  know,  their  udget s  financed  hrough hort-term struments  nd  lower  short-term a b i t s in a rates  ould  do  wonders  for heir  iscal sition. netheless,  suspect  hat  he mplication  he w t f po No I t t i oft German action,  hich  is  essentially ing hat  hey  will ot esist aly's  ining e MU,  may be w say t t n r It jo th E the  real  riving  orce ere. ave you  spoken  to  anybody  at he ank of taly  o  get   sense  of d f h H t B I t a whether  in  fact  hey ere  focusing  ore on  German acquiescence  n taly's  U t w m i I EM entrance  r o whether  they ere  in  a  sense omewhat disturbed  y  the act hat  he ermans seemed to e w s b f t t G b pushing heir  ates  p? t r u

MR. FISHER.  I  have  spoken  with eople t  the ank of taly, e ank of rance, nd p a B I th B F a some other  uropean  central  anks.  For  the talians,  ere s   hierarchy  f bjectives. tting nto E b I th i a o o Ge i EMU is he  first,  e econd,  nd  the hird  bjective!  o,  I  think hey re repared  o ay  some t th s a t o S t a p t p price or MU f E membership. If  hey  cannot  get heir  ates  ll  he ay down to  match  German rates, t t r a t w they  are repared o  go  half-way.  ow, most  people n  the arket  anticipate  other  nterest  te p t N i m an i ra reduction  rom  the ank of taly  nce  the talian dget  passes.   believe  hat  ay occur n  coming f B I o I bu I t m i weeks,  and  there  ay be  one  or ven  two  Bank of taly  ctions  efore ear-end n  light  f he m e I a b y i o t Bundesbank's mplicit  nnouncement  that  hort  ates  ught  to onverge  somewhere in  the iddle. i a s r o c m

The Bundesbank's omments fell  n  very  fertile  ound  in  the  markets. hey seemed to e  waiting c o gr T b to  see  when something ight  happen,  and  they ot  a  pre-blessing  t f rankfurt.  t eems  clear m g ou o F I s that  eople  in urope  wanted  to  see  rates  onverge n  the ow  German rates  nd  felt    certain p E c o l a a reluctance   suggest  hat he onvergence e  somewhere in  the  middle  of urrent  ate evels.  n to t t c b c r l O the  plus ide,  ne  reason he  German action  an  be  seen  as  positive  hat  t  s reating    greater s o t c ist i i c a flexibility   he  new ECB  when it  omes in.  People  previously d  been  assuming  that  he CB fort c ha t E would simply  pick p  whatever epo  rate  as set y  the undesbank  and  that  ould  be  that.  his u r w b B w T has  introduced  n  element f ncertainty. a o u

On the  other and,   think  he rench  are  the  ones  who will eally  eel  hey ave  been h I t F r f t h misled.  They went  through he  pain f etting  heir  ates  ll he ay down and  having  them t o g t r a t w converge  on  the ow  German rates.  ow  they ear hat  hey ill ave  to  suffer  he ain f oing l N h t t w h t p o g half-way p  to  meet  Italian  te  evels, d  they o  not hink hat  as the nderstanding.  hat  is u ra l an d t t w u T painful  or hem.  There  are wo ways to hink  bout  this  meet-in-the-middle"  ory.  ne is n f t t t a " st O i terms  of ood music:  it ets    positive ne nd  gets he rocess oing.  But  if  t  s aken iterally, m s a to a t p g i i t l I think t  an  be  quite oxic. ou can  fix xchange  rates  nd  let  nterest  tes  loat  r  you  can  fix i c t Y e a i ra f o interest  tes  t he hort  nd  and  let  xchange  rates  loat.  rying o ix oth n  advance  of he ra a t s e e f T t f b i t EMU event s  a  high-wire  ct. i a

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. So  move.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Without  objection.   turn ow to  Mike Prell. We n

MR. PRELL.  Thank you,  Mr.  Chairman. It ould  not  surprise  if w me many of  you  found  the ale  f he  staff recast   the reenbook more t o t o in G tortuous  han sual. reparing  he  forecast d  then riting  t  p  proved o t u P t an w i u t be  a  considerable ruggle  or s  this  ime. st f u t

Perhaps  we engaged  in  more soul-searching  an  was really  equired, th r but  we found  ourselves  ith  what  seemed  like   complex  task. e  had  to w a W contend  with  the act  hat  s  we were at ork,  financial  rkets  appeared o f t a w ma t be  in  the rip f ew era ever  nd stock  rices  ere moving ever urther g o n f a p w f above,  and  bond yields  ver urther  elow, here  we had  anticipated  ey e f b w th would  be.  We  also ad  to  explain  hy we were  raising r  forecast  f earh w ou o n term  growth  again,  s  well s  why we thought oderation ould yet e a a m w b coming. And we had  to  explain  hy,  though  we were  lowering ur  inflation w o forecast  gain,  e still  pected rices  o ccelerate   coming  quarters. a w ex p t a in I will ry o  run  through ome of he ighlights  ur  thinking  s  quickly  s t t s t h ofo a a possible  his  orning. t m

First,    the  new era,  e do  not ave  any  problem  with he otion hat on w h t n t a  good  many things  ave  changed  in  the orld.  There  have  been  some h w marvelous  technological vances  that  ffer  he otential r roductivity ad o t p fo p gains.  The  emergence  of ew market  economies  around  the orld  has n w unlocked  vast mounts  of nderutilized  bor esources.  here  has  been  a a u la r T lowering f  barriers   international de nd  capital ows.  There  have  been o to tra a fl gains  in ompetition  nd  efficiency rough omestic eregulation d c a th d d an restructuring.  so, oday's  abor arket  is arked  by  less  nionization  d Al t l m m u an by more flexible proaches o  compensation. ap t

Of  course,  ne  may observe hat hese henomena generally  nvolve o t t p i rather  radual  rocesses, st  of hich have  been  in  train  or ome time,  ut g p mo w f s b perhaps  there  as  been  some harmonic  convergence hat  s ielding h t i y magnified ffects  ecently.  n  any  event,  he ractical  estion  s hat  to e r I t p qu i w make of hese bservations en we attempt  o  prepare    forecast at  ay t o wh t a h m be  helpful  n raming onetary  policy.  he new era dvocates ay  the i f m T a s economy can  grow faster,  th  lower nemployment,  without enerating wi u g inflation.   hey  are imply alking  bout igher rend roductivity  owth Ift s t a h t p gr or  lower  NAIRUs,  this  oesn't ggest he eed  for   new analytical d su t n a paradigm.

So,  with hat  rologue,  hat  tendencies  o  we think re  facing  ou  in t p w d a y the  economy today?  As you  know,  we believe  he conomy is till  nning t e s ru pretty  ot.

The growth  of hese ectors  nd  the assive  gains n  stock arket t s a m i m wealth  are roviding  onsumers  with he  wherewithal  o  spend, nd  they re p c t t a a doing  so.  Indeed,  udging  y  yesterday's  nthly  PCE release, ey re j b mo th a doing  so  to  an  even  greater gree han e thought.  n  light  f hose igures de t w I o t f and  the ther ate-arriving  a,  e would  now place ikely  hird-quarter o l dat w l t GDP  growth  in  the   to  3-1/2 ercent  ange. 3 p r

But, hese re ar rom  a  sure hing--certainly i t a t a f f t in terms  of iming nd  dimension. t a

It  s omewhat disfigured, a t cu i n d i s perhaps,  ut  not  dead.  On the roductivity  ont,   we suggested  n  the b p fr as i Greenbook,  there  ay well e  room for ptimism  regarding  he utlook  or m b o t o f growth  in  output er our.

MR. PRELL.

MR. PRELL.  I'm  not  sure   understand  hat  hought. I t t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Let  me take  a  step ack.  If  ou  were  to ake he ype f b y t t t o macro environment e are  looking t  and  you  were  trying  o  make up for   shortfall  om  your w a t a fr earlier  pectations,  e umbers  in  such  a  forecast uld,   suspect,   far tronger  han he nes ex th n wo I be s t t o that  ou  have.

MR. PRELL.  I'm ot  sure  I  conceive f t  s  exogenous.  In  a  sense e are  letting n o i a w bygones  be  bygones  and  not  anticipating t  he avorable  nflation  rprises ve  created  ome tha t f i su ha s pent-up nflationary  essure  hat  s oing  to  burst  orth  n he uture.    am impressed  y  recent i pr t i g f i t f I b

I  did  see  some indications I t t o d in  copper  markets f hanging xpectations at ppeared o  be  associated th  the  problems  in o c e th a t wi Southeast  sia, nd  there ay be  some special  tories sewhere. owever,  when we look  across A a m s el H the  breadth  f he ommodity markets,  here eally  o sign f eneral  ressure  n  those arkets. o t c t r isn o g p i m If e look  at  these arkets arrowly n  terms f he  domestic ndustrial  cture, pacity  tilization w m n i o t i pi ca u rates  re  not xtraordinarily  h  in ost  sectors.  nd where  utilization airly gh,  s  it  s or a e hig m A is  f hi a i f example  in  the teel  ndustry,  e usinesses  n  question  re rawing  in   large  olume of mports s i th b i a d a v i and  they ave  capacity  oming  on  stream rospectively    such  a  way that  here  eally  oes  not h c p in t r d seem to  be  much pricing  everage.  o,  in he ast  ew  months  we increasingly  ve  given eight o l S t l f ha w t the  sense hat  here eally  ot  much pressure  n he  goods  sector  nd  that  here  s  a  lot  f apacity t t r isn i t a t i o c coming  on line  n he nited  States  nd  in any instances  broad.  In  our  view, orldwide i t U a m a w economic  activity  ot  going  to e  so  robust  elative    capacity  hat  e are  going  to ave  a  lot  f isn b r to t w h o pressures  n  the ommodity markets.   do  not ee  those arkets  as  the  source f ore inflation i c I s m o m independently  f hat  is oing  on  more  broadly. o w g

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. If  ou  are  making  the ssumption hat  our  model's y a t y historical  ructure d  its  oefficients  ssentially  rrect  nd  you are etting  gones  be st an c aree co a l by bygones, ou  will et  a  specific merical orecast  hich  follows  rom  those wo  assumptions. y g nu f w f t

MR.  PRELL.  We  are n  a  sense odifying  some of he onditions   that  odel.  When i m t c in m we look  at ycles istorically, ee  that  apacity  tilization    tended o  move up  as c h we s c u has t unemployment has  moved down. It s ery  hard  to iscern  conometrically  separate  ole  or i v d e a r f industrial  pacity  tilization   measure  of he nderlying  nflationary ssure.  n  the urrent ca u as  a t u i pre I c circumstance, e  deviation  f he  capacity  tilization  e  rom  what  we would  predict  iven he th o t u rat f g t unemployment rate s ecoming substantial. i b

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  gather hat  s rue ith  the anufacturing  nemployment t i t w m u rate s  well? a

MR. PRELL.  Probably. hose  industry  nemployment rates  re  a  shaky  proposition. T u a I must  say  I  have  not eally oked  at hat. r lo t

CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN. The  last  ime e looked  at his  ssue  as a  year r  so  ago, t w t i w o and  we saw  the ame problem  for he otal  nemployment rate. t as not  a  sectoral enomenon; s t t u I w ph it as a  divergence  etween  the abor  arket  and  the acilities  ket. w b l m f mar

MR. PRELL.  Since  manufacturers  annot roduce ithout  orkers, he abor arket  is c p w w t l m still  levant  ere.  We  do hear,  nd  there  ere  some Beigebook  comments,  that  t east  n  some re h a w a l i instances  anufacturers  ere  finding  hat  hey ad  to  raise  heir ges in  order o  attract  d  retain m w t t h t wa t an the  workers  they eeded.  But  the  system eems to e  working  in uch  a  way that  e think  t n s b s w i behooves  us  to  give ome weight o  our  expectation at  apacity  tilization  oing  to emain s t th c u is g r relatively  derate. e  think his  ill ut  some damper  on what  the ickup n  inflation  herwise mo W t w p p i ot would  be  going  forward.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  inehan. M

MS. MINEHAN. As Jack  mentioned,  ost  of he  good  questions  lready  ave  been m t a h asked.

MR. PRELL.  One of he isks  e repeatedly ve  pointed  o  and  then ast  ime  said t t r w ha t l t i might  not e  such  an  asymmetric isk  as the ole f he tock arket  and  the  implications  r b r w r o t s m fo consumption.

In  the nterim, e  stock arket  has  once  again isen  ore than e o w i th m r m w expected. he difference   not  big, ut  it  s here,  nd  consumption xpenditures e  surpassing T is b i t a e ar even  our  expectation    robust  pturn n  the hird  uarter.  oing  forward,    do  not  have  the ense ofa u i t q G I s that  ur  forecast plies  n  asymmetry  of isks  n  terms f ggregate  emand being tronger  r o im a r i o a d s o weaker.  But  it  akes me nervous hat  e keep  making  revisions  he  same direction,  d  my m t w int an sense s hat  here eally  s   boom mentality  t ork  in  the conomy today.  The financial  rkets i t t r i a a w e ma are  supplying  mple  credit  o orrowers,  nd  the ngoing  appreciation  hare rices, w more a t b a o ofs p no concentrated  n  the maller  ap  issues,  roviding  heap  equity  apital r any companies.

Let  me add  something hat  on Kohn just  hispered n  my ear. e  have  helped,    think, t D w i W I to  balance hese  isks  n  a  sense y  changing he olicy  ssumptions.

MR. BROADDUS. You need  not  worry.  I'm till rvous,  nd  I  get he ense rom  the s ne a t s f questions  nd  comments this  orning  that  he taff d  other  eople re  as  well.  I  am still  rvous a m t s an p a ne partly  ecause  of hat  I  hear n  my District  d  because   have  a  sense hat  he oundation  f ll  he b w i an I t t f o a t good  news lately  ay be  fragile. m

As far s  our istrict   oncerned,  t  eems  quite  lear  o e that  egional  conomic a D isc i s c t m r e activity s  strengthened preciably  ver he  period ince ur  last  eeting.  Labor  markets,  hich ha ap o t s o m w were  already ight,  rike  e as  even  tighter w than hey ere. I  have  heard  some comments t st m no t w

recently  uggesting  hat  abor arkets n  much of ur  District  e s  tight  s  at ny  time  since s t l m i o ar a a a I have  been  in  the ederal eserve. here  is ncreasing ncern  about  this  mong employers.  We F R T i co a hear  this  n   lot  f omments,  but  I eard  it  specially udly  n  the omments of he embers of i a o c h e lo i c t m our  Small  Business nd  Agriculture visory  Council hen they et  a  week ago.  They spoke a Ad w m about  signing  onuses  for iddle  level nd  even  clerical try-level  rkers.  The  owner  of b m a en wo a construction mpany talked  bout  skyrocketing ges in  his ector.  he owner of   private co a wa s T a employment agency  said hat  alaries r id-level  eople ave  risen harply  ver  the  last  hree t s fo m p h s o t months.  One of he  members of he  group  said hat  he emaining abor ool  in er  region t t t t r l p h consisted  ostly f ssentially  employable eople,  nd  there  ere  reports  f onstruction m o e un p a w o c projects ing  stretched t  for ack f  even  minimally ualified rkers.  So,  our  regional  abor be ou l o q wo l markets  are ery  tight.  lsewhere,  e are earing  eports  f verbuilding   the ommercial  real v E w h r o o in c estate  ector.  hese  reports  re ot  universal ross  he istrict,  t e hear hat  specially    the s T a n ac t D bu w t e in southern art f he istrict  ere  s verbuilding  f otels  nd  office  nd  commercial  space  for he p o t D th i o o h a a t first me  in  some time. ti

Again,  there urrently ems  to e  a  lot f team  in  our  District  onomy,  but  having aid c se b o s ec s all f his,  et  e acknowledge  that  e still  e ot  hearing  eports  f  significant ce  ncreases o t l m w ar n r o pri i in final  oods  and  services.  hat  condition,  ourse,  s ncouraging,  ut  I  wonder  how long  it  an g T ofc i e b c last  iven  the pparent  obustness  f usiness  onditions  ur  region. g a r o b c ino

At  the ational  evel,  think  e already  ecognize  hat  he reenbook's aseline n l I w r t t G b projections  e  quite  ptimistic.  ey  call  or ontinuing  rowth  at   robust  ace,   drop  in  the ar o Th f c g a p a unemployment rate  o  4-1/2 ercent,  nd  an  acceleration    core PI  inflation   nly  .2 ercent t p a in C ofo p next  year espite  he bsence  of ny  firming ction  n our art ntil  998.

I  think,  owever, hat  here  re ery ubstantial  sks  o  this  rojection. me of hem h t t a v s ri t p So t already  ave  been  mentioned oday.  I  will ocus n a  couple hat  rise  rimarily om  the h t f o t a p fr Greenbook assumption hat  e may wait  until  s  late  s  next pring  efore apping n  the rakes. t w a a s b t o b First, e  Greenbook  is rojecting at  ur  assumed  tightening   1998 will  ontribute    20 th p th o in c toa percent ecline  n he  stock arket  over he  course f he  year. f  course,  e really  o  not now d i t m t o t O w d k where  the arket  is oing  to  be  6  months  down the oad,  specially   e keep  policy  n  hold  until m g r e if w o then, r  how strong  he  market eaction  o ur  initial  tion  ay be, gain specially   e wait o t r t o ac m a e if w until  s  late  s  next pring  efore aking  hat  ction.    think  here's ignificant  sk  hat  he a a s b t t a I t a  s ri t t reaction  ould e  very  negative.  hat worries  e about hat  ossibility hat  oncern  about t c b W m t p ist c i might  incline  s  to ait onger efore ightening rther,  d  that  ould ut  us  significantly  ind u w l b t fu an c p beh the  curve.  I  would  argue hat  omething ike  hat  appened  after  he arket  break n  1987. If  his t s l t h t m i t does  happen, e will ave  to lay atch-up  he  way we did  back  in  1988 and 1989. Obviously,  hat w h p c t t would  increase  he isk  f  a  recession.   ecognize  hat  s   speculative mment, but   do  not hink t r o Ir t i a co I t it s ar-fetched. i f

We  were  trying  o et  a  sense f hat  was  happening ithin ompanies  and  whether r t g o w w c o not  that  esonates  ell ith hat  we see  in  various  conomic  statistics.  e  of he ommon r w w w e Som t c themes  and  responses  ere  as  follows. he increase  n  manufacturing  apacity  nd  in  efficiency w T i c a and/or roductivity    seen  by  firms eflects    part  he ery  strong  ncentives at  hey  all  eel  s p as r in t v i th t f a well  as  the vailability ew technologies at  an  be  used  to  minimize  their  owntimes, ighten a of  n th c d t their  ontrol  f actor  nput  osts,  nd  improve  the anagement of heir  nventories. ey said hat c o f i c a m t i Th t the  incentives r uch of hat  ncrease  n  capacity  nd  related oductivity  uld  have  been  there fo m t i i a pr wo and  could  have  been  accommodated even  without ajor  expenditures r apacity.  hey talked m fo c T a lot  bout he  continued  hortening  n  product ife  ycles,  nd  observed hat  he nly ay they ould a t s i l c a t t o w c hold  prevailing oduct rices  teady as  through roduct nhancements.

I  got he th fo i a ne a p t sense  that  e were  nowhere  close o he nd  of hat  et f pportunities.  e newspaper  executive w t t e t s o o On talked  bout ow their  verhead elative   total  evenue  has  been  falling cause he ame support a h o r to r be t s expenditures  re ow spread ver  much,  much larger  olumes.  This  is ade possible  y  new a n o v m b technologies at  ave  caused  a  very  sharp rop  in roduction  nd  distribution ts.  teel s ne th h d p a cos S i o industry  hat  as well epresented,  d  they  commented that  ver  the ast  0 years heir  ndustry t w r an o l 1 t i has  had  a  major  ncrease  n abor  roductivity  eraging  .4 ercent  er  year.

A little  re on  labor: n interesting st  n what  we have  been  hearing  r  thinking mo A twi o o about he ehavior f nions  is hat  hey  are ow providing  ore and  more intensive aining t b o u t t n m tr of union  workers  to  insure  hat  he roductivity   heir  embers versus onunion  workers  is t t p oft m n sufficient   ore than  offset  ny  wage differences.  thin  the  last  0  years,  onstruction d tom a Wi 1 c an some other nions ave  adopted  what  they ow call    "lifetime-of-learning"  osophy  s  a  part  f u h n a phil a o the ationale r nion  membership. The objective ,  f ourse,  o  have  their  embers stay n r fo u is o c t m i demand as  the  most  highly-skilled   therefore e ost  highly-paid rkers.  This  is   shift  way and th m wo a a from  earlier ilosophies  rotecting bs hrough arious  estrictive or  arket  practices. ph ofp jo t v r lab m There  was  also   claim hat  or ffice  orkers e are nly  beginning  o  see  the inds f a t f o w w o t k o

technologies at ill llow  workers  to  be  trained  nd  retrained   a  continuing  asis  t heir  esks th w a a on b a t d or  their  ork  stations. w  that  ight  enhance  productivity  so as discussed. w Ho m al w

One note  about he ightness   labor arkets:  It as said hat  endy's  Restaurants t t of m w t W across  he  nation  nce  had  a  notice  n he enter  f very able  hat aid special  f he ay." Now t o i t c o e t t s " o t d every  table  as  a  list  positions ailable." h of" av

Other  directors mmented that etail les  ent  flat  ast  pring.  hey characterized co r sa w l s T retail rkets  by  saying hat customers  ent  into    cave."  Then,  in he  course f uly nd  August, ma t " w a t o J a customers rawled  out  of heir  aves nd  started   spend  at   surprisingly  rong ate  n  the iew  of c t c a to a st r i v some directors. jor  retailers  portedly e rowing  more confident, d  the  expectation w is Ma re ar g an no that  e will ee  orders ncreasing  he  period head. w s i int a

With  respect  o  the eal  state rket, e hear hat  igher-priced  mes are  still  aying t r e ma w t h ho st on the arket  a  relatively  ng ime  and  that  n  some metro  areas verbuilding  ecoming  more m lo t i o isb obvious n  what  had  been  hot arkets.  Our  directors pect hat  ituation    get ven  worse.  Some i m ex t s to e of  the ank  directors ported  risk  ome refinancing   the ost  recent  eeks. The bankers lso b re b h in m w a talked  bout ncreasingly  impy  pricing  n  their  &amp;I lending. hey claimed hat  anks  have a i sk i C T t b plenty  f oney to  lend  and  that  veryone  is riving  heir  olume up  to  maintain  arnings  n he o m e d t v e i t face f  slimmer  margins. ne banker  commented that verybody s hasing eals. o O e i c d

Turning  to he ational  conomy,  a year go  we were  looking t  a  near-term  orecast r t n e a a f fo the  fourth  uarter  f 996  and  the irst arter  f his  ear hat  ooked atisfactory,  h  nominal q o 1 f qu o t y t l s wit spending rowth  in  the -1/2 o  5  percent  ange.  Of  course,  hat  id ot  happen.  We  were  very g 4 t r t d n surprised  t ow much stronger  han  expected ominal  and  real  rowth  were  in  that  eriod. hat a h t n g p T was a  pleasant  evelopment ecause,  t east  n  that  eriod,  he apid rowth  was not et ssociated d b a l i p t r g y a with  an  acceleration   nflation.  th the dvantage f indsight,   can  see  that  hat  ondition ofi Wi a o h we t c

was being  signaled  y  an  acceleration   oney growth.  We  got  a  lot ore growth  in road  money b ofm m b but  also n  the ase, weep-adjusted ,  and  MZM i b s Ml than  was projected   the ime  of he  September at t t meeting.  Nominal spending rowth  needed  to  slow  down, and  it  id  slow  down in  the  spring g d quarter.  oney growth  also lowed  down,  providing    little  spite. t  money growth  then M s a re Bu started   accelerate ain,  nd  we are  now getting  pward  revisions   the hird-quarter to ag a u in t GDP numbers,  both eal nd  nominal.  I  was  out  in an  Francisco    couple f eeks ago  and  Larry r a S a o w Klein, ho was on  Bob Parry's  rogram, eported  hat  e  uses   high-frequency del to  make a w p r t h a mo new estimate  f he  economy every onday.  He has  been  revising  is orecast ccessively o t M h f su upward,  and  at hat  oint  e  already  ad  growth  of   percent  n eal  nd  6  percent  n ominal  GDP t p h h 4 i r a i n for his  uarter.  e said hat  ach  time  he  makes  this  stimate, e conomy looks   little  ronger. t q H t e e th e a st

That  concerns e because e again re  looking t  a  rather  ood forecast   the m w a a g in Greenbook. If his  orecast rns ut  to e  correct  ith  or  without  he olicy  djustments  t  mplies, t f u o b w t p a i i I  would  be  comfortable.  ut  I  am more and  more concerned hat  e are  likely  o e  surprised ain B t w t b ag in  the ear erm  by  just  ow much stronger  ominal  spending s han  we are  anticipating.  ,  when n t h n i t So the  money numbers  accelerate   dramatically   they ave  over he ast  ouple f  months,   see  a as as h t l c o I need  for hose ncreases  o  slow  and  I  am not  comfortable  hat  ur olicy s ight.    cannot t i t t o p i r I visualize e  conditions  hat ould  allow  me to  accept rowth  of he weep-adjusted  onetary  base th t w g t s m on  the  order f  percent--and at  rowth  is urrently celerating--at  s  tage f he ycle. t o 7 th g c ac thi s o t c I says  to e that  e more likely ve  calibrated  e ominal  funds  rates  oo  low  rather  han oo  high. m w ha th n t t t

The way we usually  ook t eal nterest  tes--the  al unds  rate  r  some other eal l a r i ra re f o r short-term terest te--abstracts   the  idea hat  eal  nterest  tes  ave  to  be  thought f n  a in ra from t r i ra h o i relative  ntext.  f eople n heir  ecision-making  re  adjusting ward  their  xpectations out co I p i t d a up e ab real eturns  n  productive  ssets  n  real  state  arkets,  quity  arkets,  r lsewhere,  hen eal r o a i e m e m o e t r

As far s  the ational  conomy is oncerned,  iven  the omentum  that  ppears o  be a n e c g m a t underlying  hat  is oing n,  I  have  some sympathy  for he hanges  to  the reenbook  forecast. w g o t c G We are ooking t  more real  rowth  and  lower  inflation,   that  s ensible. t  it oes  strike  that l a g and i s Bu d me changes  to he  forecast uld lmost s  easily  ave  been  made in he pposite  irection   the t co a a h t o d on grounds  that  he nemployment rate  as  fallen  ore rapidly  han e anticipated, acity t u h m t w cap utilization es  ave  risen, ployment gains ave  been  larger  han an  be  sustained  n he ong rat h em h t c i t l run, nd  all f hat  ight  lead s  to  believe  hat  e are  going o  see ore  inflation  d  less  rowth a o t m u t w t m an g in  the uture, en  in he elatively  ar uture,  han s nvisioned  n he reenbook. f ev t r ne f t i e i t G

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Rivlin.

MS. RIVLIN.  Like  Ed Boehne and  a  few others,  feel  oved to  say  a  few  things  bout I m a new and  old aradigms.  If  ne  listens   the  economic  and  financial ess nd  sometimes  to  the p o to pr a conversation  round  this  able, e  gets he mpression  hat  here  re  only  two  possible a t on t i t t a explanations r hat  is  happening t he  moment.  One is hat  he  economy's  functioning s  not fo w a t t t ha really  hanged  much over  the ast  0  to  30  years. n  this  iew, conomists'  odels  with he c l 2 I v e m t parameters  itted   the  data f he ast  ouple f ecades re  still  od  predictors;    s ust  hat f to o t l c o d a go iti j t something emporary  or  several  emporary  factors e  giving  s  more favorable  esults ght  ow. t t ar u r ri n When  these emporary actors  urn round, verything  ill nap  back  into lace. n  particular, t f t a e w s p I inflation  d  low  productivity  owth, he ugaboos  of he  U.S.  economy since  he ate 960s  or an gr t b t t l 1 early 970s,  will  e  plaguing  s  as  much as  ever. 1 b u

The alternative  planation  s hat  here  s  a  new era r  new paradigm,  hich  actually ex i t t i o w seems  to  mean no  paradigm.  In  this  iew, t s ossible o  have  the ake  and  eat t  oo" ithout v i i p "t c i t w worrying  about  productivity    inflation  cause he ormer  will e  rapid nd  the atter  nexistent. or be t f b a l no In  this  iew, conomists  re  to e  ignored f  hey ay  anything  autionary  bout verheating  r v e a b i t s c a o o bubbles  in  asset  alues r  wages outrunning  roductivity  owth.  The atmosphere as  gotten v o p gr h a little  ke  he olicy  iscussions  he  early 980s, hich  I  remember very  clearly.  n  that  eriod, li t p d oft 1 w I p the  so-called pply ide conomists verwhelmed  the  essential  rnel f ruth  n  their esis  hat su s e o ke o t i th t incentives,  cluding  ax ncentives,  tter  o  economic  performance. hey made absurd laims in t i ma t T c about  the agnitude  of he ikely  ffects   labor upply r  the aving ate  f mall,  arginal m t l e on s o s r o s m

changes  in ax ates.  hose  who warned  that  igh  deficits  nerated  y  cutting  ax ates  ithout t r T h ge b t r w cutting  pending ight  lead o  either  nflation  , ith  a  responsible deral eserve,  o igher s m t i or w Fe R t h interest  tes  nd  a  punishingly  igh  dollar re  labeled  s  old aradigm  Keynesians ho were  not ra a h we a p w to  be  paid uch  mind. It as not  a  helpful  ebate,  nd  it  ed o ad  policy  nd  an  undermining f m w d a l t b a o confidence  n  the conomics  profession. th  are hings  hat ught  to  be  avoided.  [Laughter] i e Bo t t o

At  the oment, it eems  to  me that  e ought o  be  focusing  ot n  new or  old aradigms m s w t n o p but  on  the act,  nd  it  s   fact, at  hile conomists ave  learned   great  eal bout ow the f a i a th w e h a d a h economy works over  the ast  wo or  three ecades,  t  s emonstrably  unctioning tter an  any  of l t d i i d f be th us  thought  t ould. Now, good  fiscal licy nd  good  monetary  policy learly  et  some of he i w po a c g t credit  or his,  ut here s ccumulating  vidence hat  he  economy is  more  flexible d  responsive f t b t i a e t t an and  less  nflation-prone n  it sed  to  be.  To  my  mind,  one  of he ost  gratifying  arts  n he i tha u t m ch i t Greenbook,  meeting  after  eeting,  s he  inventory-sales io  hart, pecially    manufacturing, m i t rat c es in which  keeps  trending  own  and  suggests  hat  anufacturers  eally  ave  learned  omething bout d t m r h s a inventory  anagement. m

More fundamentally, e  surprising  ing  bout  the conomy at he oment is he th th a e t m t uniformity  n  the ctivity  vels  cross  he ountry nd  across  ectors  f he conomy. Labor i a le a t c a s o t e markets  seem  to  be  almost niformly ight. elve people  around  this  able  aid lmost xactly  he u t Tw t s a e t same thing--not  ite, t  very  close. e  do  not  really  nderstand  hy this  s rue,  ut ne  has  to qu bu W u w i t b o suspect hat  here  s ore flexibility  h n  labor  arkets nd  in  production  ocation  han here t t i m bot i m a l t t used  to e.  Workers move to obs nd  jobs ove to orkers; apital  oves more easily  ationally b j a m w c m n and  internationally;  production  an  be  located  nd  expanded  in ifferent  aces,  ncluding and c a d pl i overseas nd  across  he exican  border,  ore readily  han t sed  to e.  We  have  heard ome a t M m t i u b s

wonderful xamples  of  this  oday--Cathy  inehan's ombay  back  office  or oston  area ospitals, e t M B f B h as  well s  the aquiladora rocess. a m p

The other urprising  velopment  is he  apparent  ncrease  n roductivity  owth  at s de t i i p gr a time  when the  economy has  been  growing  for   long eriod nd  the oom might  be  expected o e a p a b t b running ut  of team.  Economists ave  always  given wo  reasons  or he  observed lowdown in o s h t f t s productivity    the eak  of he ycle. he first e  never eemed to  me to ake very  much sense, at p t c T on s m but  we all  sed  to  say o  each  other  hat  e were  scraping  he ottom f he abor  arket  and u t t w t b o t l m bringing  n ess killed,  ss  xperienced  eople. hat  was undoubtedly rue,  ut  a  drop  from  5-1/2 i l s le e p T t b percent  o  4-1/2 ercent  n he nemployment rate,  hile  a  big  drop  in  unemployment,  means an t p i t u w increase  f nly  a  little  re than  1  percent  n  the mployed  labor  orce. nd it  s ard o elieve o o mo i e f A i h t b that  his   percent  f he  workforce,  owever  inept  nd  inexperienced,  uld eally  rag  down t 1 o t h a co r d productivity  l  hat  uch. al t m

The other xplanation at  ne still  ars s hat  ld, ess  fficient  pacity  s rought n e th o he i t o l e ca i b o line. hen  the ld  boiler  hat  oes  not  have  to  be  used  until  he irm s acing  evere apacity W o t d t f i f s c constraints   inally ought n  line,  t bviously  s ess  roductive.  hat  also eems to  make less isf br o i o i l p T s and  less ense fter    period f ery igh nvestment  ccompanied  by  rapid  echnological ange. s a a o v h i a t ch It ay be  that  he ight  abor  arkets n  the urrent  nvironment ctually ovide ncentives r m t t l m i c e a pr i fo increasing oductivity. pr

None of  this  eems  to e  a  reason or rguing hat  conomists o  not now anything  r s b f a t e d k o that taff  rrelevant.    oes  seem to  provide   rationale r t east    tentative  pothesis  hat  he s isi It d a fo a l a hy t t U.S.  economy is ess  nflation-prone ay han  it  as in  the  1970s  and 1980s  for   lot  f easons l i tod t w a o r relating   globalization, ormation  echnology,  ro-competitive  velopments,  nd  the  safety to inf t p de a valve  that  ecent  mmigration ight  have  given s  in he abor  arket.  Econometrics s   very r i m u t l m i a

useful hing,  ut  it  s nherently nservative   the ense hat  hen parameters  hift,  e quations t b i i co in s t w s th e pick  this  p  with   very onsiderable g.  At  the oment, it  s ery ard  to efend  the roposition u a c la m i v h d p that  conomists know" in  some sense  that  n  economy operating  elow  5-1/2 ercent e " a b p unemployment is aking  n a  serious  isk f age and  price  ncreases.  e  have  been  operating t o r o w i W in that  ange  now for uite   while,  nd  we have  not  seen ither  apid cceleration    wages  or  any r q a a e r a in increase  n  prices.  e  still  ve  declining re nflation. i W ha co i

The temporary actor  ost  frequently voked  to xplain his  s he igh  dollar, t  that f m in e t i t h bu is ot  a  fully  lausible planation en  in  an  economy that  s uch more open  than t  sed  to e. n p ex ev i m i u b This  is ot   plea or ew era hinking  n  the ense f  throwing aution  o he ind.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR.  MEYER. My view  of  the conomic  outlook  as  changed  rather  ignificantly  ce e h s sin the  last  eeting.  At  that  ime,  t  ppeared hat  rowth ad  slowed  more  sharply  n he  second m t i a t g h i t quarter  han  now appears o ave  been  the ase nd  that  rowth  might  remain  near ts  ustainable t t h c a g i s trend n  the  second  half  nd  into 998. To be  sure,  he isk  f igher  nflation  mained, ut he i a 1 t r o h i re b t slowdown in  growth  and  the ecent  avorable  nflation  rformance emoved any  sense f rgency r f i pe r o u to  the olicy  ecision. p d

The crosscurrents  at  nderpinned he arlier  recast, ecifically ween  the th u t e fo sp bet projected  lowing  in nventory  nvestment  nd  the  expected ebound  in  demand,  seem well nough s i i a r e in  evidence ow and  continue  o  underpin he orecast  f lower rowth  in he econd  half  f his n t t f o s g t s o t year.  But  crosscurrents    not  necessarily  lance,  nd  the rosscurrents   uestion  pparently do ba a c inq a have  not ielded    return  o  trend rowth.  Indeed,  rowth  in  the hird  uarter  ppears ikely  e y a t g g t q a l tob

about  as  strong  s  it as in he econd  quarter.  erhaps ore importantly,  e mple  evidence  f a w t s P m th a o positive  undamentals  ncluding, elieve,  upportive nancial nditions  nd  the  absence f  signs f i I  b s fi co a o of  imbalances uggest hat  rowth  is ikely  o  remain  above  trend or ome time n  the bsence f s t g l t f s i a o a change  in  policy.  s a  result,   ow appears ikely  hat  he nemployment  rate ill ecline  o  a A itn l t t u w d t new cyclical w in  coming  quarters. o

Three  important  hanges  in  the reenbook forecast r his  eeting  effectively  ghlight c G fo t m hi the  key  issues  n  the orecast. rst,  e  staff recast r rowth  in  the irst lf  f  1998  was i f Fi th o fo g f ha o revised  pward  to bout  a 3  percent  ate,  ith he nemployment  rate  alling   4-1/2 ercent  y u a r w t u f to p b mid-1998.

Turning  to  the abor  arket,   have  argued or   number of onths  that  here  s robably l m I f a m t i p more flexibility hat  arket  than  is mplied  y  the  current  nemployment rate. ut  at ome in  t m i b u B s point,  t  eems to e that  lexibility    to  run  out.

MR.  JORDAN.

This T 4 i suggests  o e that  he rowth  of verall  ommercial  bank  balance heets--whether   focus n the t m t g o c s we o demand for redit,  e  supply f redit,   some interaction  tween  them--also  as  to  decelerate c th o c or be h very  sharply  rom  what  we have  seen  in  recent  onths.

MR.  KOHN. We  have  a  modest  deceleration   ank  balance heets  n  the ourth inb s i f quarter.  e  do  not  have  a  major  deceleration.  t  me start th he ank  balance heet  icture.

MR. KOHN. We  track  2  growth  to he rojected  ncreases   nominal  GDP.  The M t p i in slowing  in he  fourth  uarter   M2  growth  arises  argely om  our  sense hat  here  as  been  a  lot  f t q in l fr t t h o M2  built  p  over he onths  of he hird  uarter.  here  is nough  to  finance  he ominal  GDP  that u t m t t q T e t n is orecast  or he  fourth  uarter.  n  fact,  here  s lmost ore  than nough  because,  ven  with  our f f t q I t i a m e e projected  lowing n  M2  growth, e have  a  slight cline  n elocity edicted  or he ourth s i w de i v pr f t f quarter, ich  is  an  unusual vent hese ays.  Basically,   are aying hat  here  s nough wh e t d we s t t i e liquidity  t here  o inance  he redicted  ominal  GDP  with nly  moderate  further   growth.  If ou t t f t p n o M2 we saw much more rapid urther  rowth, e would  wonder why people re  accumulating hose 2 f g w a t M assets.  e  would  have  to  look arefully. ere  could e  an  asset  llocation  tuation  at  as not W c Th b a si th w related  o  spending,  ut t  ould lso e  that  eople ere  realizing  re income and  doing ore t b i c a b p w mo m spending.

We  have  several  ndications  at  he rospective oductivity  provements  may be i th t p pr im materializing.  rst,  e  earnings  igures  till  em to  be  rising.  t s oo  early  o  get   good  fix n Fi th f s se I i t t a o the hird  uarter--obviously  reports  or he  quarter  ave  come out--but curity alysts' t q no f t h se an estimates  o  show what  appears o  be  a  seasonally justed  ise  n he arnings  f  S&amp;P  500 d t ad r i t e o companies  for he hird  uarter.  econd, here lso s   quite  urprising  celeration t t q S t a i a s ac in manufacturing  roductivity    the  data hrough ugust, nd  it  s ow running t  an  annual ate p in t A a i n a r somewhere around  7-1/2 ercent.  o be  sure,  he  August  figure  s   little  spect  ecause,  s  you p T t i a su b a may recall, e nitial  timate  f ndustrial  oduction  s ased  in  part  n  hours orked coupled th i es o i pr i b o w with  a  presumed  productivity  mber.

As a  consequence, s t t f h in man

leaving side he  question  f he  unemployment rate,  he AIRU a t o t t N or  whatever,  e have  a w fundamental isequilibrium    the  labor arket  best  haracterized    the act hat  mployment  is d in m c by f t e rising  y 2  million  ach  year  and  the opulation  f eople f orking  age  who wish  to ork, b e p o p o w w including  mmigration,  s oing  up 1 illion  nnually.  he 1  million  ifference tween  those wo i i g m a T d be t statistics r  the ast  hree  r  four ears ay be  broken own into    net low  of 00,000 ove l t o y m d a f 6 individuals  r  year ho moved from  unemployment to  employment  and  another  et low  of pe w n f 400,000  people er ear  who moved from  "not n  the  labor  orce ut ay  they ant  a ob" o  being p y i f b s w j t employed. Remember, the  definition  nemployment requires  hat    person e  making  an active ofu t a b effort  o  secure   job n  the revious  ive eeks.  The consequence  of aying I  would  like   job, t a i p f w s " a but  I ave  not een  looking"  s hat  t hrows hat  erson ut  of he  labor  orce. h b i t i t t p o t f

This  group  of eople s ow at he g t o p w p i n t lowest roportion  o  the orking  age  population  ince 970.

We  do  not eed  to n 1 f g n consider  he AIRU t N and  the nemployment rate ecause,  hile  they bviously  re  more u b w o a sophisticated  proaches o  this  ssue,  e do  not  have  to  get erribly  phisticated.   we have  to ap t i w t so All do  is o  observe here  the nemployed  people re, nd  there learly e  fewer  and  fewer  of hem. t w u a a c ar t

Since  early  996,  we have  seen  a  rise  n  average ours orked. That  is nother  ay of 1 i h w a w suggesting  hat  he ressures  hat  e are  seeing  n  this  aut  abor  arket  are nducing  mployers o t t p t w i t l m i e t squeeze  the vailable  upply f orkers.

MR. PARRY.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Governor  Meyer.

MR. MEYER. Mr.  Chairman,  I  agree ith  you  and  I  endorse ll  lements f our  policy w a e o y recommendation: o  change  in  the  funds  rate  oday; aintaining  n asymmetric irective;  d, n t m a d an importantly,  cognition at  here s n  increased  ossibility,  ot  a  presumption, at    tightening re th t i a p if n th a move will e  justified  November, assuming  the  data etween  now and  then onfirm he hrust  f b in b c t t o the  Greenbook  forecast.

My  view  is hat  onetary  policy  hould ontinue  o  lean gainst e  cyclical nds  and t m s c t a th wi be  cautiously eemptive. n  my view,  such  a  preemptive  ove might  well e  in rder  t he ext pr I m b o a t n meeting.  By that  ime,  e will ave  two  additional  ployment  reports, e  third-quarter t w h em th ECI report, d  a  better el or he  momentum  of he  economy early  n  the ourth  uarter.  his  timing an fe f t t i f q T is  also onsistent  th  my view  that  here re indows of pportunity r olicy  ightening.   are c wi t a w o fo p t We not,  n  my judgment,  t  such  a  window at  this  oment, but   expect e may be  approaching  ne.  It i a m I w o is  easier  hange  policy,  or xample, hen the  financial  rkets nticipate ove and  when the toc f e w ma a a  m public  ill nderstand  t.  t s asier  or his  eason o  tighten  hen growth  is bove  trend  nd  the w u i I i e f t r t w a a unemployment rate s oving lower  than  when the conomy has  slowed  to rend nd  the i m e t a unemployment rate  as  stabilized, tever ts  evel. h wha i l

In  my view, o  maintain    preemptive  ourse,  o  sustain  he ecline  n  inflation   have t a c t t d i we recently  chieved,  nd  to ake dvantage f   possible  indow of pportunity,   should e a a t a o a w o we b prepared o  tighten  n ovember if  he ata onfirm ontinued bove-trend  rowth  and  rising t i N t d c c a g utilization es. rat

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. President  roaddus. B

MR.  BROADDUS. Mr.  Chairman,  I  can  accept our ecommendation.  I  also gree y r a strongly  ith he hrust  f our  comment that he robability    having o ighten  n  November has w t t o y t p of t t i risen  ignificantly. pe  that  ou  will ake some public  omment, and  I  agree ith ill s I  ho y m c w B

McDonough and  others  hat  oing  so  would  be  productive.   ecognize  hat  t  s ifficult  deliver t d Ir t i i d to the  message, ut  I  think ome comment would  be  in rder. b s o

I  would  just  dd  that    principal ason n  my view  for he onsiderable ccess f ur a a re i t c su o o policy ver  the  last  hree  ears s  a  whole  is ur  consistent  mmitment to old  the ine  n  inflation o t y a o co h l o built  argely  n  our reemptive ightening tions  n  1994. That  series  f ctions  as one  of he l o p t ac i o a w t most  successful  have  undertaken  n  recent  onetary  policy  istory   this  ountry. nd it  as we i m h in c A w successful  recisely  cause e acted roactively ther  han  reactively.  cause  of hat, p be w p ra t Be t we earned he  public's  nfidence.  here  is   lot f alk  bout  a  new paradigm.

I  have  some concern  about he dea f ommunicating o  the arkets.  With  respect  o t i o c t m t what  you said n  your  Humphrey-Hawkins testimony,  told    lot  f eople o  read  the hole i I a o p t w testimony,  ot ust  hat  was in he  headlines  f he ew  York  Times or  the all  Street  ournal. n j w t o t N W J There  was a  good  deal f alance n  that  estimony.    think  t  s eally  ifficult ommunicate o b i t I i i r d to  c these hings  n  such  a  way that  eople nderstand  he ntended  essage.

With  regard o  1994,  I  do  think  t  as a  very  successful eemptive  trike perience. t i w pr s ex Two fundamental ifferences tween  now and 1994 are  that  e went  into 994 with   3 percent d be w 1 a federal  unds ate,  ero  in eal erms,  nd  had  been  there -1/2 ears. lso, hroughout  994,  we f r z r t a 1 y A t 1
