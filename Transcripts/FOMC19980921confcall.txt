Transcript  f ederal pen Market  Committee  Conference  Call o F O September  21,  1998

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Good morning.  This  telephone  onference  as set p on c w u short  otice  ecause  of  a  decision  hat  eeds  to  be  made within he  next ew hours.  The general n b t n t f impression    have  gotten rom  speaking o  a  number of  you  in ecent  ays  is hat  here  eems  to e I f t r d t t s b some disposition    move rates  own  at  our  meeting n September  29. I  have  not  spoken  to  all f to d o o you,  obviously, t  a  number of vents ave  occurred hat    suspect  ave  moved you,  as  many of bu e h t I h you have  told e, to  be  inclined  oward  doing  something n  Tuesday  of ext eek. m t o n w

The economy has  been  holding p,  but  it s ow showing  clear  igns f  deterioration, u i n s o including  necdotal  ndications    some softening  hat  e now are icking  p at  an  increasing a i of t w p u pace.  As best    can  judge,  he  indications  eakness  are ecoming  more pervasive  ut  by  no I t ofw b b means dangerous  thus  far. t the  same time, he  sharp idening n  yield  preads  s  suggesting A t w i s i significant  ghtening    private  ebt arkets, nd  the  decline  n  the  stock arket  has  had  an ti in d m a i m equivalent  ffect  n the quity ide. hen  we feed  this  nformation  nto  ur  various odels, hey e o e s W i i o m t inevitably,    we might  expect,  ngender   quite  onsiderable  oftening.  e Federal dvisory as e a c s Th A Council  with  whom  the oard  met on  Friday eemed to  be  more gloomy  than  usual. ithout B s W giving ery  many specifics out  changes  in  their  oan emand or  its  omposition,  hey aid hat v ab l d c t s t they  were observing    good  deal  of  pessimism mong their  ustomers.   think  hat  rowing a a c I t g pessimism  is robably he  case  more generally.  would  suspect  hat nless hings hange  quite p t I t u t c significantly he  next  several  ays  and  unless    have  misread hat  a  number of ommittee in  t d I w C members have  told e, we will e  easing ur  policy  ext uesday. m b o n T

My  basic oncern.... c

[Secretary's  te:  The conference  all  as interrupted  r  short  eriod  t  this  oint no c w fo a p a p because  of  transmission fficulties]. di

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Are we okay  now?

MS. MINEHAN. Yes,  and  could ou go  back  over  the  last  ew comments you made? y f VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. We  lost  ou  just  fter  ou  mentioned he y a y t widening  of preads  and  the tock arket. s s m

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay.  With regard o  the  cost f apital, elds  n lower t o c yi o grade  private  ebt ecurities  e p while  those n U.S.  Treasuries ve  gone  down as  a d s ar u o ha consequence  of  a  flight   safety, d  AAA o an yields  re  about nchanged.  But  on average rivate a u p sector  ebt ields  ave  risen  nd  obviously quity  rices  ave  gone  down, so  the ost f apital s d y h a e p h c o c ha moved up. When  we filter  cent  evelopments hrough  different  dels,  or  simply valuate  hem, re d t mo e t the  conclusion  s hat  he utlook or he  immediate  future  as  deteriorated.  hink ll  f ou are i t t o f t h I  t a o y picking p  anecdotal  vidence hat  s  quite  ignificant    that  egard.  e  have  picked p similar u e t i s in r W u comments at  recent  eetings ere  with  business  eople.  he members  of he  FAC  were m h p T t particularly omy at  our  recent  eeting ith  them. glo m w

Ordinarily   these ircumstances    think  e would  have  no difficulty  ing  directly to in c I w go in the  next  meeting cheduled or eptember  29  and  essentially  hieving  he  objective  discussed s f S ac t I with  some of ou at  our  August  meeting  in  Jackson ole, amely  to  find   way to  hold ur  current y H n a o policy tance ntil  hat  eeting  and  then  act  as  a  Committee rather  han isk  ndicating ense f s u t m t r i a  s o panic  or  even  any  sense f isturbance,  ich  would occur ere  we to  move or  have  to ove  in o d wh w m advance  of  the eeting  itself. m

As a  consequence  of  that,  tried  o  create  ome sense f ovement in ur  thinking  n  my I t s o m o i speech  at  Berkeley n the  4th  of his  onth and  in  my comments at  the earing f  the ouse o t m h o H Banking  Committee last  ednesday. I  thought y remarks  were generally nsistent  th  the W m co wi

objective  nd,  if nything,  oved a  bit  ore toward  expressing  ncreased  oncern  about he a a m m i c t outlook nd  possible  eed  for   policy  asing ction. y  remarks eflected  continuing a n a e a M r my conversations th  a  number  of  people. nfortunately,  me of y comments were  misread  when wi U so m I  indicated   response o  questions  hat  here  ere  no  discussions ing  on  with  respect  o he in t t t w go t t issue f  a  simultaneous, ordinated  eduction  f ates  y  central  anks.  Those  comments had o co r o r b b nothing hatever o  do  with  what  the ommittee might  do on September  29,  but  regrettably  at w t C th notion id  not ome through t  all. ndeed,  y response eems  to  have  been  taken  as  an indication d c a I m s that  e were  backtracking  n  some form  or  another. w i

I  am particularly cerned  that  iven  the  international ancial rmoil  hat  ontinues con g fin tu t c to  increase,  e  general ense f  persisting  terioration h  no  policy  esponses,  nd  a  widespread th s o de wit r a perception  f  policy  ncoherence  oming  from  the -7 and  others,  hat  e could un  into   major o i c G t w r a problem, specially ven  Japanese evelopments. s a  consequence,    would  feel ore e gi d A I m comfortable f    were  able o  accept    standing  nvitation  om  the  Senate udget  Committee  to i I t a i fr B appear ednesday afternoon  long  with  Larry  Summers  essentially  review  the  international W a to financial rmoil.   am concerned,  owever, bout  going  up there nless    can  signal  ven tu I h a u I e indirectly  at  e may be  moving next uesday, ecause  that ignal  n  and  of tself  ll elp  to th w T b s i i wi h contain ny  significant  terioration  at  ight  otherwise  ccur n  the  interim.    think he a de th m o i I t probability    such  deterioration r  the ext eek is uite mall,  ut  its onsequences re, f of ove n w q s b c a o course,  xtraordinarily ortant  nd  could ut  the  FOMC e imp a p well ehind  the  curve  with  respect  o b t taking ction. f   go up  there--and  have  not ommunicated  yet o  the udget  Committee that a I I I c t B I will,  nd  Larry  Summers has  indicated at f    accept  e  will  ikewise--I  n't  ant  to  go up  there a th i I h l do w unless   have  a  sense rom  this  ommittee  that  t  s ll ight  o  go ahead  and signal  ven  obliquely I f C i i a r t e that  e will e  moving the ederal  unds  rate ower ext uesday. w b f f l n T

This  is he urpose  of his  onsultation  d  I  would  very uch  appreciate mments, t p t c an m co insights,  commendations, isdom from  members of  the  Committee. re w

VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Mr. Chairman,  there  s o  question  n  my mind i n i that f  his  ere September  29 I  would be  in  favor f owering he ederal  unds ate.    believe  hat i t w o l t f f r I t the  deterioration  markets,  specially    credit  arkets ast  hursday  and  Friday,  nd  the i e in m l T a continuation   that urmoil  oday  all  ell  e that  our  accepting  he nvitation    appear  on of t t t m y t i to Wednesday and  in  your  inimitable shion  uiding he isteners  ere nd  in  the  markets o fa g t l th a t anticipate  at e are  likely  o  be  moving on  the 9th  is omething hat  s ighly esirable.  agree th w t 2 s t i h d I with  you  that  he ikelihood  ignificant  rther  arket  deterioration  the  near erm  is ot  high, t l ofs fu m in t n but  I hink t  s  important  nough  for he embers of he OMC t i i e t m t F to  endorse our  giving hat ignal y t s on Wednesday.

MS. RIVLIN.  This  is  Alice ivlin,    strongly  gree  with  what  Bill  cDonough R I a M just said.   had  come to  the onclusion  yself hat  he  case  for oving the ate  own on  Tuesday  was I c m t t m r d very  strong,  argely  ecause f hat is oing  on  around  the orld.  It s ot  such  a  strong  ase l b o w g w i n c purely omestically,  t  because here s  also  a  significant,  hough e hope  not  an d bu t i alt w overwhelming, ossibility t hings  ight  move south  in  the  interim, mmunicating  something p tha t m co about  the ossibility    a  policy  asing ove is  ood thing or he  Chairman to  do. p of e m ag f t

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Cathy.

MS. MINEHAN. I  agree ith  what  I  heard oth lice  Rivlin nd  Bill  cDonough w b A a M say. I  do  not elieve  hings  ave  to  get orse  for s  to e  inclined   the irection  oving. I  think b t h w u b in d ofm they robably ave  gotten,  f  ou  will xcuse  the  phrase,  worse  enough."  In  that  egard,  am p h i y e " r I wondering  if  ou  are still    the pinion hat  t  ould show a  degree f  panic f, r example, e y of o t i w o i fo w were  to  move  this  eek as  opposed  to  next eek? w w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Cathy,    do  not  think  e need  to  move this  eek if  o  to I w w Ig the udget  Committee  hearing nd  hint bout he  possibility  an  easing ove next uesday.  In B a a t of m T my view we will et  enough of  a  response n  the  marketplace  ithout  oregoing  hat  has  become a g i w f w very  useful  rocedure,  amely  our  practice er  the ast  everal  ears f aking  decisions  nly  at p n ov l s y o m o meetings.  I  do  not  deny  that  e may not e  able o  follow hat  rocedure ndefinitely.   the w b t t p i But ability   adhere  to  it  as,   think,  een  a  plus.   would  be  reluctant   orego he rocedure. f  he to h I b I tof t p I t Committee  is  sufficiently portive, an  communicate  as  much as  I  need  to  without ctually sup I  c a speaking or he  Committee on  this  ssue nd  in  the  process  reserving  ts  rerogatives til  ext f t i a p i p un n Tuesday.

MR.  PARRY. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ob Parry.   definitely  pport,   fact    strongly i B I su in I support,  our  suggestion.  t eems  to e that t  akes a great  eal f ense or s  to  move  at  the y I s m i m d o s f u upcoming meeting.  I  see  that  s  a  fairly skless surance  olicy  hat  e can  take ut.  In  addition, a ri in p t w o I  agree hat  oving before he eeting  would  perhaps  convey  an  undesirable nse  of anic. t  the t m t m se p A same time,    am sure hat  here  re tatements  hat  ou  could ake in  your  testimony  hat  ould  be I t t a s t y m t w helpful  eading  p  to  the eeting.  So I trongly  upport  our  recommendation. l u m s s y

MR.  BOEHNE. Mr.  Chairman, d Boehne. Even though  the ase  for oving is  largely E c m based  on  what  is appening  globally, hink ncreasing ncern s  developing ith  regard o  the h I  t i co i w t domestic  economy. While  the  economy is  still  erating  t  a  relatively  gh  level,   ave  sensed op a hi Ih a notable hange  in  sentiment  n  recent  eeks.  It ad  been  largely  n  the  manufacturing  rea, ut t c i w h i a b i now appears  to  have  spilled  ut nto roader ectors  f  the  economy.  Based  on the  experience  n o i b s o i 1994 when we were  preemptive n  the  other ide,    think uch  a  move now can  be  justified o s I s in terms  of  developments n  the omestic conomy. In  my view  it  s articularly pful  o  do  that. i d e i p hel t I certainly ree  that here  s  a strong ase  internationally. ag t i c

As to  whether e move this  eek or  next eek,  if  his  ere several  eeks ago  and  the w w w t w w need  was seen  as  acute,    don't  hink  t  ould  be  desirable   get ung up  on  whether e take I t i w to h w action t  a  meeting r  not. ut  since e are  about   week away from  the  next  meeting  and  you a o B w a have  this  onvenient  pportunity  Wednesday,  I  think e will  et 0  percent  f he  benefit  f  an c o on w g 9 o t o easing ction ith  your  statement  t  that  ime. So I  support   move next eek based  on  what  I a w a t a w know now,  and  I  support our  tactics r etting  he ord out. y fo g t w

MR.  HOENIG. Mr.  Chairman,  this s om  Hoenig.  Let  me begin y  saying hat i T b t I support hat  you  are  suggesting  oday.  o  have  an  observation  nd  a  question.  he observation w t Id a T is  that  he conomy in  our art f he  country,  nd  the  domestic conomy more  generally  s  others t e p o t a e a have  said,  emains elatively  rong.  n act,  t  s nusual o  be  thinking  bout  easing  hen we r r st I f i i u t a w have  an  unemployment rate f bout  4-1/2 ercent.  e  have  an  unusual et f  circumstances.  y o a p W s o M question  elates   the  liquidity  sue.  aybe  you or ill  cDonough r to is M B M could  comment on some of your  observations d  discussions   the nternational na hat re  of articular  ncern  to s.  I an in i re t a p co u would be  very  interested    getting  our mpressions. in y i

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Bill cDonough,  why don't  ou  take  a  shot t  it! M y a VICE  CHAIRMAN MCDONOUGH. Tom, the  reference    was making  to  the oncern I c about  markets  relates inly  to  domestic arkets, specially e ixed ncome  markets. e  have ma m e th f i W seen  a  tremendous  widening  of preads ven  in  the  Treasury  arket  between  the  on-the-run s e m Treasury ecurities  d  the  other reasury ecurities  ere  there ight  be  a  difference   maturity s an T s wh m in of  three onths,  and  we have  started   see  evidence hat  eople  are educing  heir  nvolvement  n m to t p r t i i financial rkets.  We  see  people utting  ack  on counterparty posure ines.  he market  is  in ma c b ex l T one  of hose eriods  here  it  s tarting    feed  on  itself  a  rather ngerous ay.  This t p w i s to in da w development  is vident  n  fixed ncome  markets  more generally  nd  in  other  -7 countries,  t e i i a G le

alone  in arkets  for ome of  the  more exotic  inancial struments  uch  as  debt  and  equity m s f in s derivatives.   s y strong eeling  hat  arkets  are  no  longer  unctioning ry  well  that  eads e Iti m f t m f ve l m to  believe  hat  e should ot  only  take ction ext eek but hat  t  s  quite  mportant  or   signal  o t w n a n w t i i i f a t be  given  this eek to  prepare he ay for hat ction.   should ot et  he eek go  by  without  he w t w t a We n l t w t Fed  through he  Chairman's estimony  romoting   little  oothing. t t p a sm

MR.  HOENIG. Thank you very  much. I  will ay  that  hat  s onsistent th  some of  the s t i c wi conversations  have had  out  here.  While  we still  e  a  lot f  activity    financial rkets,  here we se o in ma t is  a  great eal f oncern  about iquidity  d  increased  aution  n  those arkets.  o return  o  your d o c l an c i m T t question, .  Chairman,  I  can  support  hat  you are  suggesting re  today. Mr w he

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Tom, let  e just  o  a step urther d  point ut  the  one m g f an o thing hat    find articularly hersome.  It s hat his  lement f  disengagement,  ear,  ncertainty, t I p bot i t t e o f u and  the  like  s eally rvasive  round  the orld  and  it  s  occurring  n  the ame time  frame.  In i r pe a w i i s other ords,  we see  a ery  dramatic ise  n  the  yields  n  the tripped adys  for irtually  ery w v r i o s Br v ev emerging  economy. Concurrently,  are  seeing unk ond  yields  n  the nited  States  oing  up we j b i U g very  sharply  gainst  reasuries d  indeed he unk arket  is  virtually  utting  own. We  are a T an t j m sh d beginning o  see  a  squeeze n  a  lot  f he iddle  market ending,  hich  is  related   some respects t i o t m l w in to  BAA and  similar edits. fectively, t  we are  seeing s  very  rapid  hange  in  views  toward cr Ef wha i a c commitments. While  we have  yet o  see  this  n  the eal  ariables   the  U.S.  economy,  except t t i r v of a the  margins, t  s ery ard  if istory  ny  guide  to elieve  hat rowth  above  3  percent  s ossible i i v h h isa b t g i p in  the ontext f  the  types f  decisions  hat  re  being ade for apital  nvestment  nd  inventories. c o o t a m c i a Those decisions  eed nto he  gross omestic roduct,  nd  we clearly e  beginning o  see  their f i t d p a ar t effects  ery  early  n  in  the inancial rkets. s I ecall,  e  opening f  spreads  n  the  corporate v o f ma A r th o i area s  the argest at  e have  seen  in  such  a  short  eriod f ime n  at  least   ecade.

MR.  HOENIG. I  appreciate at.  hank you very  much. th T

MR.  BROADDUS. Mr. Chairman,  this  s l Broaddus.  I  support  hat  you  propose  to i A w do,  though  maybe a  little  ss trongly an  some of  the thers  ho have  spoken.  I  have  had  a le s th o w chance  to  talk  o  a  number of eople n  the ast  eek or  so. We  had  our mall usiness  nd t p i l w s b a agricultural  visory  ouncil eeting  last  eek,  and  it s lear  hat  here as  been  a  change  in d c m w i c t t h sentiment.  ut  I  do  not hink  t  as  been  pronounced  as  of et,  t  least  ur  area.  here  may be a B t i h y a ino T little  in Street/Wall reet  ichotomy  here.  Against hat  ackground,  hink hat  n  doing  this Ma St d t b It t i you  will robably ant  to  be  cautious  nd  convey  the otion hat  e still ve  an open  mind in p w a n t w ha order o  avoid nducing erhaps ore concern  than  might  yet e  warranted,  iven he till  gh t i p m b g t s hi level f conomic activity. o e

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. In  fact f    go  forward ith his,  will asically  ve  both i I w t I b gi sides f  the  story  ecause   think  t s ecessary  o  do  so.  But  I  would  tilt   remarks  very  clearly o b I i i n t my in  the rocess. p

MR.  BROADDUS. I  can  support  hat. t

MR.  STERN. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s  Gary Stern.  oo  support  hat  you are  proposing i It w to  do  in  estimony  n  Wednesday. Having  said hat,  must  say  that  t east  s  I  perceive  he  global t o t I a l a t situation,    s ot  clear  o  me that    change  in  domestic onetary  policy  s he referable sponse, it i n t a m i t p re but  it  ay be  the nly  available sponse.  nder  those ircumstances, m certainly mfortable m o re U c I  a co with  what  you  are  proposing.

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. I  agree ith  that. w

MR. GUYNN. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ack  Guynn in  Atlanta.  et  me piggyback n  Al i J L o Broaddus  and  Gary Stern ecause   think  heir  hinking  s robably losest  o y own.  I  certainly b I t t i p c t m have  not  sensed ny  collapse  f onfidence  r  a  significant erioration  the utlook mong my a o c o det i o a contacts  n  this  egion. aving  said hat,  small usiness  dvisory  roup  that  et  with  me  last i r H t my b a g m week clearly  as  shifted s  verall  entiment  ubstantially ce he  previous  ime  they ere here. h it o s s sin t t w Three  weeks ago  I  met  in iami with  some Latin merican  bankers ho were  telling  al ive M A w re l stories  bout  the  movement of oney out  of atin merica. It  s he  sort  f  thing  hat  learly a m L A i t o t c catches ne's ttention. m certainly pportive  f  your  conveying ur  readiness  o  move next o a I  a su o o t week if  hat  s here we are  then. t i w

CHAIRMAN GREENSPAN. Okay.

MR. POOLE. Mr.  Chairman,  this  s ill oole n  St.  ouis.  I  certainly    support i B P i L do a decision  o  testify  d  provide ome indication  ur  likely  irection. hink hat  s  an excellent t an s ofo d I  t t i idea.  I  have  an observation d  a question.  y  observation  s his: t  the  moment the  needs  of an M i t A the  U.S.  economy and  the nternational nomy are  clearly  ligned. hat  may not  always  be  the i eco a T case.  It eems  important  o  me to  focus ur  move on  the equirements  or he .S.  economy. s t o r f t U Otherwise  we may set p  some misleading  xpectations   some time  in  the  future. u e at

My  question  elates   the  size f  the ove we are  contemplating, ich  we have  not r to o m wh talked  bout.  Maybe that  eeds  to  be  discussed    little  so. a n a al
