YELLEN.  Any questions or comments for Governor Fischer?  Okay.  Then let's 'Long-Run Framework for Monetary Policy CHAIR turn to the first item on our agenda, which is Implementation.'  Troy Davig is going to start off our presentations.

Chair.  We will be referring to the materials Long-Run Monetary Policy Implementation the work of the latest phase of the longAs you are aware, this has been a Systemwide project contributions from the Board and all Reserve Banks.  In addition to the additional coauthors on the main memos, also present and available to answer questions.

DAVIG. 1   Thank you Madam titled 'Material for Briefing on Framework.'  The briefings today summarize run framework project. featuring presenters at the table, there were several including Ron Feldman, who is Following on the foundational work presented at the money markets, foreign experiences, and lessons project focused on issues related to as well as considerations regarding the balance sheet. these elements comprises broad listed on page 3 of your briefing packet.  The first project objective was framework needs to achieve an appropriate degree of short-term interest rate and in a manner robust to structural in the financial system.  As the briefings by Jane Ihrig and Antoine Martin be achieved using different policy rates and with a the level of reserves, and the breadth of counterparties. The scope of this project was outlined now over one year ago, with three objectives that any control, including in periods of financial distress changes will highlight, this objective can range of operating frameworks, which could vary in the use of ceiling and floor facilities,

second objective was that a framework should enhance the ability to achieve financial-stability objectives at the effective lower bound.  Here that the ability to effectively respond to the effective lower bound operating at the lower bound.  In addition, maintaining readiness is important, particularly if the Committee intends to possibly or other tools that are not used routinely as part of the day-to-day balance sheet policy, Deborah Leonard and can be used to support interest as macroeconomic goals and financial stability.

The third objective was that address liquidity Regarding liquidity strains, the work suggests separate lending facilities for different types of liquidity provision as well as a broad set of when decisions about one aspect of the framework can have are exceptions.  For example, the briefings will some separation between decisions about the and the policy rate, such as in the current framework.  Decisions about framework, of course, can also have important implications from Tradeoffs often exist implications for others, though there discuss arrangements that allow for balance sheet various aspects of a a political economy perspective.

just discussed, there was a set of listed on the top of page 4 of your packet that are addressed in and plans in the memos do not necessarily call for any near-term decisions about a existing analysis.  Thank you.  With I will now turn the briefing over to Jane. In addition to the three project objectives I additional objectives today's briefings.  Finally, the Committee's normalization principles provided an additional set of criteria, also listed on page 4.  In general, the issues discussed long-run framework or for a need to make decisions about changes to the framework.  Looking ahead, today's discussion will help inform any additional staff work or dimension of the project that warrants further that,

Thanks, Troy.  As noted on slide 6, the memo titled 'Interest Rate Operating Regimes' analyzes several interest rates that you may wish to using as a policy rate and analyzes operating regimes designed to promote with the target policy rate.

Targets and consider money market conditions consistent like who helped develop the to illustrate tradeoffs across a variety of policy we review some choices of several overnight rates that can be grouped into The memo's goal is implementation frameworks with respect to a few considerations, including the objectives Troy just outlined, to help the Committee begin evaluating features that it may want in a long-run framework.  To start, on slide 7 policy rates.  The policy rate serves the function of communicating the stance of policy as well as supporting transmission of monetary policy to broader financial conditions.  The memo considers money market rates and administered rates.

Committee could continue with the federal move to the overnight bank funding rate, or OBFR, to publish in March.  A secured rate could be a rate, and the administered rates could be interest on or an overnight reverse repurchase offering rate, rate. In terms of an unsecured rate, the funds rate as the policy rate or which the Federal Reserve began general collateral Treasury repo reserves, such as excess or required, an ON RRP

of the policy rate is an important factor affecting the selection of to interest rate control.  This point can be seen by looking at the three presented in the memo.  Your next slide summarizes case 1, policy rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on excess the Federal Reserve The choice operating tools and the counterparties with which the Federal Reserve interacts achieve illustrative frameworks in which the reserves, and a key feature of the operating regime is that operates on the flat portion of the reserve demand curve.  This case encompasses the current framework.

next slide, has similarities to the pre-crisis system.  The rate can be an unsecured market rate or the interest rate on required reserves.

A key tool in this Case 2, described on your policy The Federal and actively manage the supply of type of framework is reserve requirements, either mandatory or voluntary, to establish a fairly stable and predictable downward-sloping reserve demand curve.

the long-run objectives.  As mentioned by Troy, one key conclusion is that, in normal control can be achieved in the case of a wide range of potential through the appropriate choice of operating regime tools, and the policy rate control would be maintained at the although it might require some changes in operating some cases. Your next three slides evaluate the three cases with respect to framework times, interest-rate policy rates rates will likely also effectively transmit the stance of policy to broader financial conditions and the real economy.  Interest effective lower bound as well, regimes in regimes mitigate liquidity strains.  Regimes that operate on the flat for reserves, such as in case 1, can easily accommodate the increase in the level of reserves does not affect money steep portion of the demand for reserves, as in case 2, interest rate control can be maintained by using tools.  Alternatively, this framework could transition to case 1 by the level of interest on excess reserves.  In a repo regime, you could rely on to support the policy rate. Turning to your next slide, the memo highlights a difference between the with respect to how they part of the demand curve liquidity injections, as market rates much.

The first two rows As noted in row 1, the choice of policy rate would be cases 1 and 2, particularly if the Committee chose to continue targeting the closely associated overnight bank funding rate.

For instance, to maintain elevated levels of reserves to foster financial to control interest rates effectively. In sheet, its size would likely be determined primarily by currency in circulation, other autonomous factors, and the level of bank's operating regime.  As Jane and Antoine illustrated, interest-rate control achieved with either a small or a large balance sheet.  Just as the choice of operating regime can influence the size of the balance sheet, balance sheet as an active policy financial stability if policymakers wished stability, they would need to rely heavily on policy tools such as IOER, overnight RRP, or voluntary reserve targets

These support stronger economic growth and higher central banks since the crisis suggests that asset of stressed market conditions. Slide 21 addresses the balance sheet's use to support macroeconomic objectives. A large research literature has documented channels, large-scale purchases of long-term bond yields changes in financial conditions inflation.  The experience of purchases have appreciable macroeconomic benefits when the effective lower bound binds, especially in the event using all available tools, especially in the multiple goals.  However, policymakers would have to coordinate the use policy tools.  Communicating the nature of the central bank's could be challenging.  Moreover, the affect financial markets in ways that are Economic theory would suggest presence of of multiple multidimensional 'policy reaction function' ongoing use of asset purchases could difficult to anticipate.

One possible approach would be to use the changes in the size and the macroeconomic objectives only when the of stressed conditions, and then revert to its passive role and prior structure at other times. future use of expanding the Policymakers may therefore assess the tradeoffs between the benefits and costs of active use of the balance sheet differently at the effective lower bound versus away from composition of the balance sheet to achieve policy rate is constrained at the effective lower bound or during periods market This strategy would seek to preserve space that permitted

In my mind this type of regime has several important advantages.  First, it's quite simple.  One doesn't have balances and then add and drain reserves each day or week to keep the supply of reserves in balance with demand.

There are some regimes in which there's a lot reserves from banks that are long in reserves over to banks I don't think actually ends up generating a lot of benefits to the Second, it enables the financial system to operate more efficiently.

Sometimes you can actually lose monetary policy control.

In 2007 and 2008, we were reluctant we didn't enact programs that were open-ended, because we actually offset, by corresponding draining operations, the reserves added through such programs.

That's encourage private market participants to stay engaged rather than pull the risk of financial panic I think this is than programs that are finite in magnitude because such backstops away, and the fact that they want to stay engaged, I think, does reduce somewhat.

In staff, the general view has been that if you had $1 trillion of of the demand curve in a wide range of environments.  I safety, and that would make a lot of sense. Under a floor regime, we can expand the balance policy control or needing to conduct offsetting reserve draining operations, and I think that's important. agree with conversations I've had with the excess reserves, you'd be highly confident that you'd have more than sufficient reserves to ensure that you'd stay on the flat part think you want to have enough with a margin of respect to some of the other issues raised in the long-run framework memos, many second order relative to this issue of floor versus corridor system.  For example, I rate or the overnight repo rates, to serve as our short-term interest rate At the margin I prefer using an administered rate, such as the IOER rate or the overnight enacting monetary policy, we don't care about the level of money market rates per the effects of our policy stance on financial market conditions more from any rate raises some don't see why the Board of Governors wouldn't just decide to defer to With of them are think we could target any number of short-term interest rates, or we could have an administered rate, such as the IOER target.

Due to favor, as see why we wouldn't just get on with that the sense reserves, don't count as high-quality liquid assets.  It seems to me like there's a real getting rid of reserves should be part of the leverage ratio calculation.  As I see excluding reserves from the leverage-ratio calculation.  First, not control how many excess reserves it must hold.  We do that by our regime in which we didn't have to worry about whether a to bite, thereby undermining the incentives that banks had lending. I also think that if we were to adopt a floor system on a permanent basis, it might be worthwhile to review whether it, there are two reasons to consider the banking system does policy decisions.  I'd like to have a quantitative easing program would lose its effectiveness because the expansion of bank balance sheets was causing the leverage ratio to expand their

Including leverage ratio calculation in my mind doesn't achieve any meaningful terms of safety and soundness of the banking system that we oversee. monetary policy stringency.

The make clear that there are a number of alternative similar results considerable importance clear communication with the public and support monetary policy independence.  So I find myself drawn to a relatively parsimonious regime in which the interest rate on an administered rate, is our main policy instrument and enough reserves operate constantly on the flat portion of the demand curve.  Such a regime would achieve our interest-rate control goals in a way that is easy to supplementary tools.  Such a regime would also complexity, and the admittedly limited evidence on reserves and other short-term interest rates is quite strong.

We would be able to learn, though, as we implemented such a regime, more about how much is required, and the exact amount might vary over time.

It would obviate need for reserve requirements.  I endorse Vice Chairman Dudley's suggestion that we get on would also obviate the need for the overnight reverse repurchase program, current set-up.  A particularly valuable feature is that the of daylight credit from the Federal Reserve.  This would make for a system and would reduce the risk of large credit extensions necessitated There are a number of valuable features of the with that if we can.

Another is the erosion of volume that is now necessitating a reexamination of scope of our newly minted rate in the flat portion to be robust to potential changes in the structure of significance of rates. I also believe that flexibility how the financial money market funds you mentioned, Madam Chair, is Eurodollar overnight bank funding rate.  A framework that relies on an administered of the demand for reserves seems more likely money markets or banking regulations that might affect the behavior or economic various market rate does not mean that we have interim period, to continue to range determined by rate.

in terms of an administered rate is the fact that there are in normal times, but at other times, movements in market rates reflect changes in the risk premiums charged to private-sector borrowers.  August 2007 was a good an episode in which broad shifts in perceived credit risk affected market rates that risk free.

Just a word about governance.  I agree with you might see to a purely administered rate regime reserves is FOMC.  But, similarly solid commitment by the Board to follow the lead of the FOMC should suffice.  And you could always pursue legislation, but floor mechanism would allow us to control a risk-free short-term interest rate credit extension-that is, no standing lending would represent essentially an agnostic stance with regard to balance sheet policies In contrast, some other regimes may require a standing lending facility to one, on targeted market rates, although I would argue that in in controlling the market A simple with essentially no routine Federal Reserve facility.

It was there, and I'm not sure what a discount rate seems like it would look pretty much the same as to interest rate control for our interest it was integrated in that hadn't been integrated would look like.

For one, interest rate control is aimed at macroeconomic objectives, and More broadly, a parsimonious regime would allow us to cleanly separate decisions about our monetary policy interest uses of our credit markets in response to either market developments or institution-specific risks. parsimonious regime, our decisions about such programs would be unencumbered by fear of interfering decisions about balance targeting mechanism stems involved for credit market interventions are presumably aimed at microeconomic objectives.

First, if you think our balance sheet of more than $4 trillion and the massive QE in other countries, that is adding, at least according to our models and our analysis, quite a bit of stimulus to If you look at the methods for with Thomas and Kathryn or models, such as models, and others, they generally do into account the effects of QE on demand.  It's just part of where the IS curve is, if you Then, if you actually think about going from massive QE stimulus in the United States and world and taking that away, going back to the baseline, you're talking about reducing economy and the U.S. economy in particular, the work of my work with Thomas or other DSGE models or whatever, generally would imply that  * will be lower in the where it is today.

There are limits to how far QE can go in terms of that we can buy under current law and the amount of outstanding MBS. these research papers work, because they don't take into account the balance sheet generally, it actually is arguing that that boost r * is already there r and more generally globally, which would argue a nominal or 2¼ percent we keep the balance sheet elevated r * higher, like David López-Salido said, we don't have as much room to use QE to stimulate.

My comments actually follow very closely those of President Williams.  I would say there does consensus when the Presidents demand curve.  [Laughter].  There does seem

The staff did a fantastic job pulling it all together. Let me start by focusing on the balance sheet and make some conditioning lower bound, tools other than rates will be our first line of defense.  I make this assumption for three reasons. results arising from the experience of other nations as quite mixed.  Second, I do will stop being sticky at a zero rate. regimes disproportionately affect banks, which in turn affect monetary policy often in perverse ways.  I also make the assumption that in inflation target, even though I the inflation target too low.  Finally, I take as given that the short-term lower than it has been historically. There was an awful lot of material. I'm going to deal with only part of that, because I'm trying to keep my comments parsimonious. [Laughter] assumptions.  I assume that if and when we again hit the effective negative interest First, I view the not believe that currency will be eliminated or retail deposits Third, these transmission and financial stability, the near term, this Committee will not be willing to raise the personally think we set equilibrium interest rate will remain it is worth revisiting how frequently shortthe Tealbook and private forecasters' assessments of the that horizon.  Thus, it is reasonably likely that even if we were to shrink the balance In a world with low equilibrium interest rates, term rates are likely to hit zero and how long they may stay there.  The business cycle is unlikely to have been tamed.  If we look at probability of a recession in the next few years, it would be risky to assume that no recession occurs over sheet relatively soon, the next recession could easily occur before the current surplus of excess

to, once again, hit zero short-term rates and to need alternative stimulate the economy, most likely by engaging in large-scale asset to lower longer-term rates and rates other than on Treasury securities.  Thus, if my is, at the least, prudent risk management to assume that largepurchases, in conjunction with hitting zero for short-term rates, will be our standard the balance sheet varying but with high average excess If we are quite likely to have large excess This may well cause us monetary policies to purchases assumptions are right, I think it scale asset recession-fighting tools.  Thus, I see reserves that grow during recessions and recede during recoveries. a large balance sheet, then our operating framework should make clear and seek to optimize policy in a framework that acknowledges that we will be operating in a world of reserves.

Because the only administered rate controlled by the FOMC is rate, I would focus on that rate as a floor unless the interest rate on excess I would prefer to have a balance administered rate the overnight RRP reserves at some point in the future becomes a tool of the FOMC.  My own view is that we closely monitor short-term rates but not necessarily target them.

In particular, what are the size, composition, and duration of our sheet going to be should we experience a long period of recovery, knowing that in a nature of that recession?  How we need to think about liquidity facilities depends on make about the balance sheet during good times.

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll go through the three sets of questions with a rate that's highly robust and likely to remain so over is working at the moment, I think that for the longer term, the rate is unlikely to meet that test.  There are a couple of near-term problems with the trade that represents nearly all of the current activity in the federal funds market.  First, the IOER rate and the federal funds rate generates criticism that it's MR. POWELL. expeditiously, if not parsimoniously.  The first set of questions asked for views on the key design elements, and I would want to start time.  Although our current system federal funds arbitrage the spread between

If federal funds rate does become idiosyncratic or goes away entirely, we'll be left without a as well as with $11 trillion or $12 trillion of OIS swaps that are priced off the rate.  The plan developed in our work with the alternative reference rate committee a GC repo rate or the overnight bank funding rate, existing OIS industry and with ISDA to get the chosen rate into swap as a backup in case federal funds fails.  But the fact that we're even talking about this the quality of federal funds as a benchmark.  Bottom line:  I would be subsidizing banks, mainly large could easily disappear, thanks to potential market matter, the viable policy rate federal funds is to move new OIS trading to either depending on which rate that committee picks, we expect, in early 2017.  For trades, we will then work with the agreements says nothing good about inclined to look for a more robust alternative.

And I agree with others that the governance issues there could could also pick the overnight repo rate if that facility is to be with us for more real to me now in a lower-for-longer world.  As for a plausible alternative, although OBFR indicated, it would probably be necessary to broaden the scope of that rate. Of the two possible administered rates, either of IOER probably means easily be managed.  We the longer term, a possibility that is market rates, the overnight bank funding rate is transaction volumes have fallen by roughly half this year, thanks to money market reform, and, as I think Antoine

I do a world of plentiful reserves, but one that is no larger than it needs to be.  But, long-run framework, I believe, should that we're going to be operating indefinitely in a world of plentiful reserves. The memo asks next whether we would prefer to operate on the flat or steep part of the demand curve for reserves, and I'm face both a larger balance sheet foreseeable lean toward regardless of what one might see as the ideal end state, the assume think that the Tealbook balance sheet projections-I understand how they're from the mechanical interest rate rule and assumptions based out of touch with market expectations as well as the latest continue in full until April 2018 and estimate that the a return to the effective lower I frankly derived and appropriately derived on what the Committee has said-are SEP numbers.

I strongly that we'll be there for an extended stay and ultimately resort to another LSAP, and then in raising rates. two-out-of-three chance that we'll start from a low level of rates.  We'll go back to the suspect we'll be very cautious about liftoff and move gradually is a balance sheet that is probably just about as likely not a world that I embrace or want.  But it just to me that is the likely world in which we live.  So reserves are likely to remain abundant, uncertainty with respect to the level at which they would become scarce. If you add all that up, what you get to grow as to shrink in the years ahead.  That is seems even allowing for some

But the long-run framework analysis funds market may not is that some elements of term funding less on unsecured overnight borrowing on the federal and without a vibrant market, impractical or undesirable to return to a tightly controlled target for the federal like we are led to using the IOER rate rate like the Treasury repo rate as our formal policy target.  I understand with a large balance sheet, and I can appreciate part of the reserves demand curve is appealing from the point of view of control.  I spent a good deal of time with my staff discussing something close to the an operating regime in which the target was a range for the repo rate and a floor and ceiling facilities.

Dealers and large and small banks will all see their funding easing together as we alter our policy rates.  So technically it all should worry that shifting the public focus of policy from well-known interactions with to rates in the repo market might be seen as primarily benefiting Wall Street with no Street.

Progress on these issues has the potential to drive the much of the long-run framework and, thus, substantially narrow our choices.  In doing comment on the questions posed by Thomas and Simon's memo. In my thinking, we can start making some progress by first aspects that not constrain our choices some thoughts on the higher-level design of that, I will the framework that are desirable pretty much the overall design and that could occur sooner rather than later, not waiting full implementation of a long-run framework?

If so, then For money-like assets should be provided would basically the size of the balance sheet, and concerns over maturity transformation would affect terms of maturity. Let me now could help drive many of the operational choices we face.  An important question is whether we should actively use the balance sheet many aspects of the operating regime will be subservient to financial-stability issues. example, decisions on how much public determine this composition in as the staff emphasized, we know very little about how the size and composition stability.  Furthermore, providing for an allocation of coordination with the I think, of our balance sheet affects financial government liabilities with a particular term structure would require

Similarly, I would also avoid buying MBS or other credit market assets, as doing so distorts asset allocation and opens up the pressures for supporting various borrowers and lenders at in effects of the balance-sheet changes will be. More generally, I would not be in favor of the balance sheet being an instrument normal times.  Coordinating both tools would pose challenges, and it would be difficult to communicate the exact reasoning for any policy mix, because, theoretically and empirically, we don't know with enough certainty what the

rates as big fan of negative interest rates. potentially damaging banks' balance sheets.  When necessary, I would much rather resort to asset up with an excessively large balance sheet, with negative risk becoming increasingly likely. Another issue that others have discussed surrounds the use of negative interest opposed to LSAPs as the primary alternative tool for additional policy accommodation at the effective lower bound.  If we view negative rates as our first line of defense at the lower bound, then the operating regime must be ready for them.  I am not a They may send alarming signals, could be politically unpalatable, and are to commercial purchases, but that implies that we must be willing to unwind past LSAPs as part of the normalization process or we could end remittances and their associated political is the use of voluntary reserve targets.  Theoretically, attractive because they can be used at any desired level of the balance sheet, a curmudgeon, too, the crisis and still allow for fairly precise control over language of the memo, we would be able to operate on the steep part of at the level of our choice.  VRT would, thus, also put policy on familiar Another central question for me they appear expanding our choices while providing for an active interbank market.  An active interbank market would allow us to return to money market conditions-maybe I am President Evans-that prevailed before short-term rates.  In the the demand for reserves

is whether actively targeting a repo rate is really a viable to targeting the OBFR.  Such a move would potentially have large implications for this a viable option at present.  Basically, I don't think we a permanent Federal Reserve presence in the repo market to proceed at this moment.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

economic policy actions that help improve prospective and, therefore, give us more operating maneuverability, my team and I the flat part of the demand curve for reserves, with a sheet ideally smaller than the one we have today-and I might even go so far as to say as the one we have today-with the Federal Reserve much more with our owning Treasury securities than MBS.  The Treasury market is a big liquid portions of Treasury securities is unlikely to the dynamics of that market materially.  My concern is that we could have a big effect, and market.  So while we may have some minimum working to keep it as small as possible.  With those objectives, we also came to rate or the OBFR might make more sense as a target than the would need to employ other tools, such as the IOER rate. Assuming there are other economic growth rates totally agree with an objective to operate on balance small as possible, but certainly smaller than owning as small a percentage of safe assets as is feasible.  Like others, I'm comfortable market, and the Federal Reserve owning sizable affect we probably already are, in the MBS level of MBS, I'd prefer the view that an administrative federal funds rate.

In particular, we debated extensively the need for the to this country of a strong, independent there's a prospect of it crisis, we are likely to induce accusations that the Federal has overstepped its bounds, which I fear will reduce our scope to act in a crisis when is actually needed.

My concern is that if the Fed's balance sheet stays large and getting larger, certainly away from a Reserve action going to be

I'd like to associate myself with the perspective introduced by Presidents Rosengren and Williams and echoed, Presidents Evans and Kaplan.  That focusing on now is, as but the framework.  President Williams's point, which he made today and has made is that in a world r *, one needs to think about what your monetary policy framework is and consider alternatives what ask us to hypothesize that some external event causes a recession in the relatively near ask how we would respond.  Those are somewhat distinct together.

First, the whole purpose risk-free nature of reserves is not part of a complementary set of capital requirements.  Second, although it is true system activities and conduct of any particular bank do have an effect on the relative reserve holdings that it has,

But third, and most importantly, it seems to me premature to draw any judgments on this right now not risk-based reform requirements, we don't really yet have a good picture change in the leverage ratio will watching, but there are other ways to deal with a problem may be established over the years other than the exclusion of one asset from the the way in which regulators, particularly those from noncentral have leaned, even though central bankers sort of like the idea that their asset is the one Finance ministries like the idea that their asset is the one that would get matter, academics have tended to say that's anything.

I'd like to see the sheet return to maybe not pre-crisis levels, but as small as necessary to stay in the floor to express our reaction function to the yield curve.  I think it implies a level of wisdom that In terms of when we are at the effective lower bound or in periods of balance environment.

The key considerations associated with our longer-run needed to weigh them is necessarily as a result of the unusual circumstances, which we still find ourselves in today, led to the expansion of the balance sheet and a number of fundamental changes that have place concurrently.  Short-term money markets continue to evolve, as does the demand for the effect of our balance sheet on liquidity and maturity transformation and on generally is difficult to estimate.  This is especially true because the money markets changed dramatically during the same time in important ways. MS. BRAINARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

I agree with our current principles, which state the balance sheet should be no larger than necessary to effectively conduct monetary policy. what this minimally necessary level is, and I doubt it is as small as levels before the financial crisis, for many reasons.  Money markets have changed with significant activity outside the interbank funds market.  We will want to influence these markets, which will likely require having a larger balance in steady state.  In addition, the demand for safe assets is higher than in the pre-crisis the crisis brought into sharp relief the risks associated with private-sector money-like above pre-crisis levels.  In addition, the need for accommodation in the effective lower bound will likely be greater, because the neutral rate is markedly I will, having said that, try to assess the thought experiment us.

I'll wrap up our discussion with a few comments of my own on the three questions.  However, I want to say Williams, and other participants who have weighed in on the monetary equilibrium real funds rate is broader these topics in involves us operating on the flat portion of the demand curve for reserves.  Such a system is to operate, and it may foster an efficient payments system.

the presentation.  Lorie, I infer from what you said that the that flowed out was not replaced euro-for-euro or former recipients of those investments.  But to the degree that there was the sources of the funding that they got that had formerly been provided from the money market funds, they may you explained.  But they obviously MR. TARULLO.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I have two factual questions, and I think they are both on Lorie's part of roughly $1 trillion in prime fund investments dollar-for-dollar by the replacement, what were by the prime funds?  If banks were getting investments not have replaced dollar-for-dollar what they were getting, as

November 1-2, 2016

replaced some significant proportion of what they were getting.  Who was making those investments?

One of the other things I noted was the widening in the FX basis swap, the foreign banking organizations turned to the dollar swap market to obtain was putting pressure on MS. LOGAN. and I think some of dollars by swapping out yen or euros or something into dollars, and that that swap.  So I think they turned to that type of investment product as one alternative.

I see.  But does that mean that the balance sheets of the European MR. TARULLO. banks were, on net, reduced, because they were just swapping assets rather than getting new funding?

I think, in the term markets, they tried to replace some of that.  I think, in lot of that was arbitrage trading taking place in Eurodollars, and I don't MS. LOGAN. the overnight markets, a think they replaced that.

it.  Thank you.  The second question is on the take-up of RRP.  Again, I think I'm trying to read between the lines of what you did say, but I want to understand it.  The quarter-end take-up was substantially larger than the past couple I thought reasons why the quarter-end spiked in the past was that the European banks that are sheets at that time.  But that, presumably, should be less the market is dominated by government money market funds.  You said that of these government money market funds had parked the funds in the ON RRP initially. that subsequent quarters will not have this kind of spike? MR. TARULLO.  Okay, got ON make sure I of quarter-ends, which I found, when I first looked at the chart, a bit counterintuitive. one of the operating under this system of 'it's the last day of the quarter that matters for your capital ratios' would want to reduce their balance case when the ON RRP some But does that mean you expect

November 1-2, 2016

that type of balance sheet reduction take place in repo, particularly on the some of those European broker-dealers.  So some of these government funds are invested those balance sheets reduce as well. MS. LOGAN.  I think we're still going to learn a lot from the quarter-ends, but I think we have also been seeing part of in repo, and see.  Those would still be affected, yes. MR. TARULLO.  Oh, I

funds are still having to do some replacement MS. LOGAN.  And I think the government in the overnight RRP around quarter-end.

the same thing on month-end, that the government funds the increase around the prime funds.  So that's consistent with Lorie's story. MR. POTTER.  We just saw were a large part of

MR. TARULLO.  I know it's hard to predict, but if one had to, would one predict an endof-quarter spike that was somewhere between the spike at the end of September and those of the previous couple of quarters?

its own thing, so that could be we saw higher usage around just the quarter-end couple of days after.  And I think those were higher than largely dominated by government now.  It still could spikethis high, but higher than it was before-from the repo balance sheets being MS. LOGAN.  It's hard to know.  I think year-end also has larger.  What I was trying to emphasize was that date-a couple of days before and a typical because of the placement temporarily.  On the quarter-end itself, from what we've heard from market participants, it's maybe not quite used.

And when I look at this chart, it highlights that they a particularly essential part of the overnight RRP.  What are the costs versus benefits of can think of one benefit from a financial stability standpoint, which is money market funds may be, overall, stabilizing over time, and getting the overnight RRP might be an effective signal of that.  But are there countervailing who should have access to the MR. ROSENGREN.  I wanted to follow up where Governor earlier discussion, Governor Tarullo had made money market funds are not no longer using them?  I that having less prime them out of costs that we ought to be thinking about when we consider overnight RRP?

the remaining assets under management for prime, institutional, and I think that institutional amount is the part that we are more a fairly small number now.  I think it's possible to consider counterparties, and it's something we should the coming months.  And I do think there is still this competitive arbitrage that may interest rate control even at those low amounts.  But it's also possible that they rates they're receiving in money markets.  So I think we should MS. LOGAN.  I should note that of $131 billion of it is concerned would be flightier.

November 1-2, 2016

the prospects for that:  Is that going to be easy?  Are there impediments?  Is it hard? I was interested in going to be chart 15, most of that decline we think is related to money We're aware that about $20 billion to $30 billion of that total decline might be deposits on shore.  It's a small portion of the total amount, but it is studying.  I think it would be quite complicated to get the instructions right, to right amount of onshore deposits that we'd want for this type of reference rate, but definitely something that we're studying carefully right now.

I want to verify that, but I also wanted to ask whether you have a sense that net or gross maturity transformation has decreased?  It seems like it has some places to some other places. MR. LACKER. quantitative gone from

MR. PALUMBO.  Right.

there is less of it now, or do you know that? MR. LACKER.  But is less of it.  I'd say we think it's in a little bit a bit of an open question.  That's area in which I think we're engaged in discussions among ourselves and in new research about it over time.  Personally, over the course of a year is worth giving some attention to, the FHLB and how they're interacting with other money markets.  But I think that's an area in the table, so we wouldn't say that they're agencies with implicit government support, we don't need to consider their in the context of the system. MR. PALUMBO.  I wouldn't say there's more stable, less run-prone form.  The FHLBs, I think, are another and analysis to think about, if that developed, how we would feel I think anything that doubles in size and we are.  And I know we've got some decent understanding and knowledge about systems which work is now going to be ongoing.  But they're not off because activities

for maturity transmission to take-whether this is a little bit of a better place to that particular question. MR. PALUMBO.  So that's definitely not true, and we're just trying to see, compared with the highly run-prone prime money funds-which was, you know, from our perspective, a horrible vehicle be.  But that's why we're half yellow and half green, because we haven't really come down firmly on a dollar-for-dollar wash- why is it a better MR. LACKER.  Can I follow up?  Is it like place?

The mutualization of the prime money funds with the rounded NAV advantage for highly sophisticated investors that evidently were unwilling chances on receiving their money a few weeks after they thought they were promised it. MR. PALUMBO. provided a first-mover to take That was a very dangerous and run-prone vehicle.

MR. LACKER.  Okay.

The FHLBs themselves are doing a lot of maturity transformation and tell, shortened their asset side at all, or at least not meaningfully.  So it's worth is different.  I don't know a lot about the FHLBs, but they have the ability to that for better up the seniority structure.  So in that sense, they should be, at high a little more stable.  But I think, as you might recall, FHLB discount notes' spreads in the financial crisis.  They went to something like 150 basis points very quickly, and money funds are not necessarily always going to be well positioned to absorb those changes if they occurred.  If the confidence in the FHLBs were to erode, then I think it MR. PALUMBO. more than they were a year ago because they've been adding short-term debt, and they've not, as best we can looking at, but it take very senior positions in the debt structure of their lending.  Again, that means or worse, they do move frequency, soared government price could be a problem.

One way to think of this chart is, if we were in a be orange-red-red in the second If instead the mechanism was 'reach-for-yield,' then it look a lot like the column that you actually have there.

that you shouldn't.  I think the reason we presented it you cannot feel better about the right-hand column than the leftfrankly ended up splitting the difference.  And I tried to allude to little bit in my remarks, but I think we're of two minds.  If you're just somebody who's it to do your discounting, then, again, that's the sense in which the future price changes are going to be, but, on average, there's probably a little evidence for the right-hand side versus the left-hand side.  But I think it's just a case in part of the calculus is the reason that I would be more inclined to hedge away from the right column toward the really an unusual pricing situation for these asset markets, and I guess I too confident about how that would play out with a shock or even maybe MR. PALUMBO.  Well, I can't say this way is that, necessarily, hand column.  As a group, we that a discounting cash flows, and you're using a risk-free rate and you don't mind a rate that has a negative term premium in right-hand column gives you more comfort, and I think neither of these have super predictive power for what the bit of which we don't know.  And I would say, to me, the low-term premiums as part of middle column.  That's wouldn't want to be with something that's not even so shocking.

mine's reasonably interesting.  [Laughter]  Is one way to interpret if you look at the valuations all by themselves of these risky assets, they look right value, then these are MR. LACKER.  I think this that overvalued?  If you believe longer-term Treasury securities are at their not overvalued.  And so then my next question is, is that a fair description?

that you hear and that many people believe. MR. PALUMBO.  It's certainly a description [Laughter]

it? MR. LACKER.  It seems implied by your colors, doesn't

MR. PALUMBO.  I'm sure investors are taking many different approaches for valuations.

Can you guess my next question?  Are Treasury securiries overvalued? the course, a year ago we said it was out of its historical range, likely to rise than to fall, and subsequently we've been marking down our forecast of what seems like the world is MR. LACKER. MR. PALUMBO.  I don't think Treasury securities are necessarily overvalued, but term premium is out of its historical range.  So I have to think about it a little bit more as an empiricist rather than a theorist.  Of more Treasury yields would do and what term premiums would do, because it different than the one we expected.

that does set me up.   There are a couple of issues about whether issue is just this issue of very low in this world of very low rates?

I guess one reason we do it that in 2006, the debt service ratio was also not looking particularly high, and so we it in terms of originations-it's also useful to track of households.  Again, we do both, typically. MR. PALUMBO.  Yes, debt service households is basically lower than it this way is think that-especially when you think about just the overall positions also useful to track the overall positions, but the ones income are not shown. MR. FISCHER.  Yes.  You said it's with the

It's hard for us to do income, because the data that we're the credit-records data.  And, unfortunately, we get to see a lot about debt, but much about income.  In these data, we don't even get to see much about little bit about payments. MR. PALUMBO.  Right. showing here are we don't get to see payments or risk-only a a different one, which is that even insofar as we characterize, again, the sustainability of those balance sheet positions.  That's the only thing I But the point I was trying to make here is do see real increases in debt owed by households, it's accruing to these households who have, in the data, virtually no delinquency rates or default rates.

I'd like about the changing structure of equity markets with exchange-traded funds and other aggregations of equities that funds passive is winning.

We had that, as you pointed out, the Michigan survey had dropped down to a expectations, and then you did the trend-augmented calculation, food and energy inflation.

quantity of QS that has been presented is really very good, and it raises a lot of questions and questions.  Let me say a few words first about the IFSM, the International Matrix, which extends the assessment of the Financial Stability Division to very colorful quilt for us to look at.  It is extremely lot of work, but there is one big reason you want to know about other is how the system as a whole will work and what the dynamics of the system looking at this.  And you might ask at whether you actually need to have 13 countries in this system of equations or whether piece of work.  Congratulations. MR. FISCHER.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  The by the Financial Stability Division answers a lot of Financial Stability 12 foreign countries and produces a ambitious.  It is a countries, and that will be.  And that's a whole other level of difficulty in some point you can manage with fewer.  But it's a very ambitious, very bold, and, at this stage, very interesting the regular QS of the U.S. financial system, which starts with going to say a few things related to what Vice Chairman Dudley just this a phony war, but I also suppose that lot going on in the background.  One of the things we do know is that if the staff has looked at continue, then Deutsche Bank would find itself, after eight from the hands of the regulators in some fashion, or the Then the first part is Deutsche Bank.  So I am said, which is, so far, nothing seems to be happening in the standoff between the Department of Justice and Deutsche Bank.  I suppose you could call actually there is a dynamics that the weeks, with very little left in the way of liquidity.  Well, what happens then?  Either Deutsche Bank is rescued from bankruptcy or

Vice Chairman Dudley probably chicken-and this is one of them-that there is a lengthy confrontation, but they end.  How will it end?  We don't know.  We are dealing with a chicken with Greece and didn't an example for the rest of it is not going to want Deutsche Bank to go broke.  So it is going to be a very troubles with a game of chicken is that, us can know, what is going to happen. Now, I don't know the inside details to the extent that does, but it's standard in games of period of German government that was thought to be playing a game of actually blink very much in that entire process.  And it is trying to set Europe, but interesting and a very closely run thing.  And one of the occasionally, neither side withdraws, and then you get a crash.

ready now to go into our round on economic And our first speaker is President Williams. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay.  I think we're comments.

The economy grew almost twice as fast as my its sustainable trend, which is about 1½ percent.  Of course, we have to remember the quarterly numbers can be volatile, and they're subject to one-off transitory factors such in soybean exports and residual seasonality. MR. WILLIAMS.  All right.  I'm losing half my audience.  Thank you, Madam Chair. Real GDP growth in the third quarter was strong. estimate of that as the spike to my right, have him wrong, let me wade back into the weeds of residual seasonality one more time read on the economy. recall, the main problem is that, on average, first-quarter real GDP growth has been growth in other quarters even after seasonal adjustment.  In fact, this seems to the individual Now, in the past, some people, including my good friend who sits here claimed that I only talk about seasonal adjustment problems when the real GDP number is weak. So to prove when residual seasonality is, in fact, likely giving us an overly optimistic Just to weaker than reflect the BEA's bottom-up methodology, which seasonally adjusts subcomponents instead of the aggregate number directly.  But small amounts of seasonal variation at the granular level when aggregated can affect the top-line GDP numbers.

to the published aggregates, taking, in effect, a top-down approach. the BEA has taken some steps to reduce residual seasonality, and in this summer's implemented several improvements to its seasonal adjustment methodology. creates a little bit of a problem, because in that annual revision, the BEA only provided us three and a half years of historical data using these new procedures, and that short sample hard to calculate a precise magnitude of any remaining residual seasonality.  And, In the past, to correct for this residual seasonality, my staff has applied a second line of seasonal adjustment Recently, annual revision, it That with means it's

November 1-2, 2016

sample of the consistently revised GDP data won't be available until then, I won't go so far as to important issue, but our windshield is still fogged up. furthermore, a complete 2018 when we get the next comprehensive NIPA revision.  So until say that we're flying blind on this the likelihood of some remaining residual seasonality, it seems appropriate to even more on the four-quarter growth rates of real GDP and prices.  And on that basis, around 1¾ percent this year, in line with the September SEP-that is, on balance, the recent data have been with our expectations. In view of focus both real GDP growth and core PCE inflation appear likely to be which is consistent

the economic and policy discussions focus on the balance of risks management of those risks.  One risk that has been that future interest rate hikes and the monetary policies may cause an appreciation of the dollar.  For the dollar to rise almost 5 percent over the next couple as market participants' expectations of FOMC rate actions are revised up.  Underlying Tealbook assumes that each 100 basis point funds rate surprise leads to a 3 'bang for the buck,' if you will-is based on Of course, much of associated with the forecast and the highlighted in the Tealbook and in the presentation today is associated divergence in global example, the Tealbook currently expects of years this projection, the percent appreciation in the dollar.  This effect-the recent dollar responses that are somewhat larger than historical averages.

issue, my staff investigated the robustness of the estimated dollar get a sense of how much larger or smaller it since one account is taken of the wide empirical Of course, these wide confidence intervals that there is a risk that the exchange value of the dollar may appreciate even more In looking into this response across several different specifications to could be.  And while the dollar has shown greater sensitivity to interest rate movements 2014, overall, this change isn't statistically significant confidence intervals surrounding these estimates. also imply

November 1-2, 2016

interest in the dollar, we can offset this jump by than assumed in the Tealbook.  But I don't lose too much sleep over this risk, because it can be fairly easily mitigated by an adjustment in the path of policy.  For example, if we raise rates a bit and we see a larger-than-expected rise postponing future funds rate increases appropriately.  We don't need to let risk-management caution turn into paralysis.

appreciation in the dollar, but there are also notable upside risks.  The the PCE and CPI inflation rates may get resolved in favor of the CPI.  That inflation starts to rise next Also, there's no question that wage growth is picking up.  If you look at the apples-toWage Growth Tracker, that's been increasing, but other are firming somewhat as well.  And if these upside risks play out, inflation target next year.  I don't think that would be such a big that case, monetary policy should be positioned to shift to a much less And it's important to see the risks on both sides.  There are downside risks to inflation from an outsized divergence between may happen, for example, if the unusually weak PCE health-care price year. apples measure like the Atlanta Fed labor cost measures could easily overshoot our 2 percent problem, because in accommodative stance.

economy, the risks look fairly balanced.  While the improvement in labor participation this year has bought us some time, I see a low probability of a repeat So it seems more likely that job gains will outpace labor force growth, rate will go back to edging down to somewhere between 4½ and 4¾ For the real force performance next year. and the unemployment percent.

it's on track.  The labor market is strong well increase in interest rates.  Thank you. To sum up, the economic expansion looks like and shows solid momentum, inflation is moving back toward our 2 percent goal, and we're positioned for a gradual

of our mandate in 2017 is likely, conditional on of continued above-potential economic growth over the next couple of years.  We relatively close to full employment, and with projected output growth above potential force participation, a topic to which I will now turn. MR. ROSENGREN.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I expect the economy will likely reach 2 percent core PCE inflation and my estimate of full employment, which is 4.7 percent, sometime next year.  Achievement of both parts my forecast are already next year, we may well see the unemployment rate continue to decline gradually , although this, of course, depends on the evolution of labor markets will tighten further might be the constancy this year.  Of course, a relatively flat unemployment reasonably strong payroll employment growth, is a good sign for the economy, as it that the labor force has grown strongly over the past year.  However, there is reason to and Alan Krueger each important secular trends in labor force participation.  In particular, the paper by suggests that the scope for further increases in labor force participation may be limited reports having a serious health condition that is a barrier to work. One reason to be skeptical that labor of the unemployment rate over the course of rate, despite implies believe that this good news on labor force growth is unlikely to persist too far into the future.

I certainly find this view convincing two or three or four years ago.  But as I mentioned at our meeting, although I haven't yet been persuaded-and, thus, I haven't been in favor of economic growth that would not be realized with rather than later-I have found the case a closer one over meetings.

But let me mention a few developments that have affected we are closer to the point at which carry sufficiently high risks that it is some number of additional jobs being created.

market front, I continue to believe there is more slack-that is, that the trend of job creation well above the number of new entrants with an rate can continue.  Again, though, this view won't be right that the pass-through from potentially nominal wage growth to price inflation is not all that direct, I think nearly everyone I've been watching for some trend may be nearing its end.  I don't think there's too much in we have begun to see some increased distance between industries in which wages are On the labor of the past year or more essentially flat unemployment forever.  And even though the flat Phillips curve means increased agrees that, directionally at least, there is some correlation.  So indication in the data that this wage patterns yet.  Here, not much has changed in the past year.  There is one measure suggesting

The more granular four-digit industry code growing faster and those with later acceleration across the board. codes, and even then it's not that significant a measure shows no change at all.

something that might prove to be a the aforementioned trend.  At the height of past business cycles, the labor rate has increased somewhat above its trend but, with the exception of the more than a couple of quarters. current estimate of trend labor force participation, actual labor force the financial crisis, exceeded the trend, albeit by a very would agree that we shouldn't have a high degree of actually higher than the staff estimate, which does fall below some other estimates I've seen, something I'll be watching. Our labor economists did, however, point out harbinger of the end of force participation halcyon period of very high growth in the late 1990s, not for Under the staff's participation has, for the first time since small margin.  Now, I think the staff confidence in current estimates of trend, as they have debated it so much among themselves.  If it's then we're still not back to trend.  And the fact that we have been below trend for so longnearly eight years-may mean that past correlations won't hold up in current circumstances.  But it is it's something we should probably keep in mind-is that the change in the labor force contrary to the instinct I think we all have, is not principally due to a lot more the labor force in greater numbers than they had previously-I guess it's a double future trend, particularly when you're talking about Another thing I want to note in passing-and I think people have commented on this before, but participation rate, people being pulled back into the labor force.  It's actually due to people making decisions not to leave positive-which may affect our sense of the

respect to inflation, I've been focused on seeing some tangible developments on the front that would credibly promise nontransitory attainment of the inflation target, with to the symmetrical nature of that target.  It does seem as though the the stronger dollar and energy prices are waning, though it's less clear dollar is done strengthening.  And the recent core inflation reading has come in a in part, slightly larger effects from now-rising nonmarket services components.

Now, if we could the Phillips curve remaining flat and inflation expectations remaining anchored, then the engendering excessive inflation following this strategy would be relatively low.  We the first alternative scenario in the Tealbook.  But what if the linear and flat so that as the unemployment rate falls economy strategy could be very high.  We could find ourselves well to bring inflation down.  We risk turning the hot economy strategy into a cold economy alternative scenario in the Tealbook captures this possibility, but it's more benign because inflation expectations remain anchored. and the unemployment rate than in the baseline. Second, history tells us rely on risk of might expect outcomes like in Phillips curve turns out not to remain further, wage growth picks up significantly and inflation expectations don't remain anchored?

That is, chart, once uncertainty is taken into account, it would look like 2 percent is roughly middle of the probability distribution for the forecast.  You could look at panels 7 and 8 on MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Incoming intermeeting data seem consistent with the regime-based view of the state of the U.S. and Eighth District economies. The regime is characterized by relatively slow real GDP growth at 2 percent per year; unemployment, which remains in the 4½ to 5 percent inflation forecast roughly centered on looking at a in the the U.S. outlook, which were just handed out, to see examples of that.

I think this outcome can be supported with a policy rate setting higher than currently. these available data and over the economy.  In light of this outlook for real GDP growth, I continue to expect unemployment remain in centered only slightly terms.  I do not see the current situation changing unless at least one of two things Number one, there is a switch to a higher-productivity-growth rate regime, which GDP growth and a higher real rate of return on safe assets; two, the large liquidity premium associated with safe assets abates and switches to a consistent with historical pre-crisis experience, which would also drive the real rate or both.  I do not expect either one of these switches to occur over the data carefully.  Thank you, Madam In short, unlike many around the table, I would not interpret the current situation in cyclical happens: would be associated with faster real number value more of safe assets higher; forecast horizon, but I will keep my eyes open and watch the Chair.

Taking into consideration the wide associated with the economic costs of diverging from the 2 percent target, I it would have been better to define an optimal range for the inflation rate, possibly Let me discuss a few other aspects because we set credible.

to inflation, the news is somewhat better.  The latest data show a small inflation, which I'm happy about.  Core inflation in Q3 came in at both 2016 and 2017 core PCE projections from When I turn uptick in core PCE 1.7 percent, and the Tealbook has marked up the 1.6 to 1.7 percent.  Market-based inflation expectations have also ticked up recently.

welcome developments, but I, like inflation this a signal or noise.  I hope it's a signal, but I'd like to see more evidence before I draw Meanwhile, wage growth remains moderate.  Now, these are many of you, am also concerned that both market- and survey-based measures of expectations remain extremely low by historical standards.  For me, I don't know whether uptick is

and global economic any firm conclusions.  Meanwhile, in the global economy, world inflation growth remain subdued.

regarding the labor market, U.S. employment continues to rise strongly.  The I and several of us around the table have been emphasizing this year is United States can continue to add a lot of jobs without driving unemployment labor force, which we've been doing. unemployment rate has barely budged, while prime-age labor force risen about 1 percentage point. Now, optimistic narrative that that the uncomfortably low as long as we can keep adding to the The headline rate even ticked up just slightly.  This has been the story over the past 12 months, a period during which the participation, ignoring demographic effects, has me is, how much longer can this play out?  Prime-age labor force in the mid-2000s.  Prime-age male labor force participation is also very low United States compared with most other OECD countries.  So there's a very real prime-age labor force participation could continue to rise labor force participation rose another 1 percentage the past 12 months, that would be another is about people reentering the labor force.  It's not that.  It's people not leaving.  I'll of you agree.  Either way, it's a net positive for the country. So the big question for participation fell very sharply during the recession, and it's still about 1½ percentage points below where it was in the possibility-it's not impossible-that back to levels seen in the 2000s.  If prime-age point over the next 12 months, as it did over 1.25 million Americans in the labor force.  And many people around the table have said the narrative take it either way, and I know all

we'll see continued decent job growth supported by rising without seeing much in terms of inflation.  Again, we just don't know, petering out, I'd like to give it more time to My conclusion is, my baseline outlook is more of the same:  modest GDP growth, subdued inflation.

I anticipate that the economy will continue to expand that strength had a sharp swing from inventory liquidation back to accumulation, which probably fourth quarter. VICE CHAIRMAN side, I'm pretty much with everyone at a slightly above-trend pace.  I agree with others that Q3 GDP probably overstates a bit because of the big rise in exports, which was so narrowly based on the soybean factor, and because we won't be repeated in the economy, I think the good news is that it seems to be relatively well from the collapse in oil and gas drilling activity looks to be over. and household balance sheets appear of continued gains in consumption.  Both residential and nonresidential investment likely to expand gradually, with, presumably, business fixed investment getting some lift minute.  At the same time, I don't see at this point.  So, for example, if you look at cyclical sectors such as an aren't stronger is a little unclear to me. When I look at the balanced.  The drag arising Household income is rising.  The household saving rate supportive seems once the uncertainty surrounding next week's election is resolved.  Of course, it depends on how that uncertainty is resolved.

In contrast, if current expectations were realized-a this would be considered a continuation of the status quo and there be much of a market response. either party of both the would lead to an equity Clinton victory and a Republican House, with the Senate uncertain-the view among this group was generally on the side that wouldn't be, however, some sentiment that, regardless of the outcome, the spending program.  And not on such a great path.  But if you add an may start to reemerge as an is very quiescent today because interest rates are low, and people don't see any negative actually normalize interest rates over time, then the net interest cost will start to go back up, and that'll be another burden.  So I think the the fiscal path today is much overstated relative to the path that, in New Jersey, we had legislation to gasoline tax by $0.23 per gallon to fund the transportation infrastructure program.  And indicator that there is actually There does also seem to Congress would be more willing to move forward with an infrastructure that's interesting, because fiscal policy is really infrastructure spending program on top of that, the fiscal situation issue.  It consequence of that.  If we on the government debt confidence in the sustainability of that we're actually on.  I thought it was interesting raise the the fact that it went through is probably an interesting leading more voter support for greater infrastructure spending in this country.

I do take some signal from the slight firming in the core inflation for tightening monetary close to its current On the inflation side, trajectory and the fact that some market-based measures of inflation compensation have firmed in recent weeks.  I think this development does help support the case policy at our next meeting in December, assuming that the economy stays trajectory.

There still may the labor market, judging from the fact that the above-trend payroll employment cost index release was interesting in the sense that it rise in total compensation, which was not an acceleration previous quarter.  And 2.3 percent is not a very high rate of increase in employee economy, it doesn't judge the gap today as only about 100 to 150 basis points.  And that's a gap we could necessary. However, I don't think that there's any great urgency to tightening.  The growing at only a slightly above-trend pace.  Inflation be some excess slack in growth hasn't caused any downward movement in the unemployment rate this year.  And the pickup in nominal wage growth-I think there has been a pickup-has been very modest.  I thought the third-quarter showed a 2.3 percent year-over-year from the compensation.  Also, judging from the modest forward momentum in the look like our nominal federal funds rate target is very far below a neutral monetary policy setting.  I close relatively quickly, should that prove good case for moving at this meeting. that I just don't think is consistent with the So the lack of urgency implies that there is not a To do so with the election a week away, the outcome uncertain, and no scheduled press conference would imply an urgency to move incoming information or the economic outlook.

Labor force participation has in light of the downward pressure from that's allowed the unemployment rate to remain close to 5 percent Along most other dimensions, labor market conditions changed this year.  The broad U-6 measure of unemployment continues to move measures of job openings, hires, separations, and quits.

So, where does that leave us?  So far, I see few signs of overheating Reports of sectors.  And in response to a tighter labor year ago.  Nevertheless, wage gains remain moderate overall, with average hourly earnings and the ECI rising only 2.6 percent modest amount of slack weight on the letting the economy run a bit hot for a time-and let me emphasize here that I rate to decline a little bit below current its natural rate-a path that is exactly consistent with the median unemployment And I was interested that several of own comments, mentioned the increased efforts that you've seen firms make in For these and other reasons, I continue to believe that some remains, and that we should welcome a limited degree of further tightening, particularly with inflation still running below 2 percent.  Moreover, I continue to put some possibility of mean 'hot' in the sense of allowing the unemployment estimates of projection in our September SEP.  Allowing the economy to run hot in that sense could have favorable supply-side effects, as I noted in a recent speech. you, in your

I consider that kind of investment in workforce an example tight labor market.

In the case of the I don't expect it to remain flat for much longer, in view of research within and involuntary part-time employment remains well above its structural change over the past decade has not resulted in a norm.  In light of the uncertainties we face, I would not be especially surprised to rate fall sharply over the next few months even though my baseline has labor utilization tightening more gradually than that.  This possibility and the fact lag limit how far we can safely go in probing the economy's absorb relatively rapid employment growth.  Although we have discovered over the at which we need to tighten, the extra room is only so great and could quickly disappear.

And, although pre-crisis level, I cannot be sure that new, higher see the unemployment forecast that monetary policy operates with a ability to past year that we have somewhat more 'running room' than we might have expected regarding the pace broadly.

ENGEN. private-sector employment increased 147,000 in October.  That was very close forecast of a gain of 150,000, which includes the hurricane hit during the reference week.  So the ADP report is very much in line we're expecting will come out on Friday for private-sector employment.

'Material for the Briefing on Monetary Policy Alternatives.' MR. LAUBACH. 6   Thank you, Madam Chair.  I'll be referring to the handout labeled roughly two-thirds odds on an increase range for the federal funds rate by the end of this year.  These odds are than the perceived probability, a year ago, of liftoff occurring at Committee's policy objectives, the reduction of near-term risks to the the Committee's acknowledgment in September's postmeeting statement the case for an increase in the funds rate had strengthened.  The drafts of B and C recognize further progress toward the Committee's employment rate is little changed in In addition, those alternatives not only increase in inflation since earlier in the year, but also recognize the by deleting the earlier statement that expected to remain low in the near term.'  As Eric pointed out in his on core makes no reference to the increase in inflation. As you know, the market currently places in the target significantly higher the December 2015 meeting.  No doubt an important contributor to the market's greater conviction of a rate increase by year-end has been the cumulative progress toward the outlook, and that alternatives objective by reporting that 'although the unemployment recent months, job gains have been solid.' note the likelihood of slightly higher near-term inflation 'inflation is briefing, the staff revised up its near-term inflation projection in response to the recent rise in energy prices and somewhat higher-than-expected readings prices.

The red line in the lower-right panel shows that the staff's estimate of the term premium component of the 10-year Treasury yield remains quite depressed.  This depressed level is from presumably reflects the value environment of low inflation and in which short-term rates remain near the lower bound.

And, second of all, would an increase in the term on longer-term yields, like the 10-year yield, due to fears of higher inflation actually a depreciation of the dollar?

I actually share some of your curiosity about In principle, of course, if you have an increase in yields that reflects an increase in term premium, I think it's logical to expect a different effect.

One approach is to look at the effect of both, let's say, and longer-term yields on the dollar, with the assumption that the longer-term hold more term premium in them.

taking is to try to use actual term structure models to and figure out how much of the resultant change in interest rates in expected rates and changes in term premiums.  Some suggest that the expected rate part affects the than the term premium part, but that's pretty preliminary.  But I think the bottom line term premium seems to go in the same direction less seems to be still a matter of research.

Yes.  First of all, it's resource utilization.  We estimate a GDP gap; we a granular labor market.  There's no unemployment rate, for example, in here.  Right from our model for the output gap stands at about 1½ percent.  One key thing MR. LAUBACH. don't have now, the estimate

At that level, there is a between this model's view of the world and the SEP medians' view of the world. focus on is basically just the revision in the estimate, because that's an to understand why the gap stays so flat once you add the SEP Williams estimate of the that means that if the median little bit. tension here So what I would like to r * apples-to-apples comparison.

And I just want that, as opposed to raising the level of the MR. KAPLAN.  I'll ask one very basic question.  I could see why higher expected GDP growth would would-steepen the yield accompanied by higher prospective GDP growth to hear a little bit more about why you would assert entire curve.

ago, Chair Yellen compared the state of the economy to a car driving to coast.  She used metaphors like 'We're about in Kansas now' to convey that, made a lot of progress, the recovery was far from complete.  In terms of our dualNow, several years from coast although we'd

And, of course, should to the downside, those can be offset through normal adjustments in our mandate goals today, the with the stance of policy, Nevada.  The current economic situation favors built up we encounter surprises policy rate.

alternative C is not the decision the Committee is taking today, the language in B does a very good job of acknowledging our progress to date and leaves conditions warranting renewed policy normalization. Given that alternative proximate to the last comment I'll make is, President Kashkari yesterday brought up the issueAnd it's a question I've been asked a lot, so let me just very briefly comment on First of all, I think President Rosengren laid out the argument just a minute ago-that is, have a 2 percent inflation objective with a balanced approach to our dual-mandate we are making decisions on how to As President Rosengren explained-and I agree with what he said-in that context, how do we best achieve what I would think of as risks of a reversal through different President Rosengren just laid out-that by, in a sense, too low of unemployment, we basically undermine the sustainability of the economic Now, and his remarks were partially addressed to me, I felt-of, how can one both be for gradual policy normalization and have a view of very low r * and concerns about our long-run policy framework? that. under our current policy framework, which the Committee has agreed on and has reiterated every January, we goals.  That's the strategy we've agreed to, and the one that execute-whether we should raise rates or not. 100 percent sustainable maximum employment?  If we allow the economy to overshoot full employment by too much for too long, I think that does create greater possible mechanisms, including the one going for

November 1-2, 2016

the harm of achieving our maximum-employment and inflation goals.  So I agree Chair Yellen's characterization-that we want to run a moderately hot economy help us get inflation back to 2 percent quicker, and that's consistent try to go too far on running a hot economy too hot too long, it creates some of the risks that President Rosengren laid out.  So I just think, in increases makes sense. expansion to completely with for some time.  That will with our strategy.  But I just worry that if we for terms of balancing the risks, a gradual path of policy serious discussion of the strategy, which I think of execution decisions we're making about whether we should raise should have that discussion, and we should involve a lot of experts and and others in thinking through this over time.  That discussion should eventually lead to a communication of that decision.  Then that might imply in the future.  But until that discussion has happened and until come out of it, I think it's important for us to execute on the policy strategy about whether to raise rates in not, we're really addressing at all these longer-run issues raising.  I mean, I don't think those are really related to that.  The longer-run issues are, raising rates or not.  They're really more about thinking about what our I do think that we should be having a as different than the tactical or rates or not?  I think we economists to a decision by the Committee and different policy decisions whatever decisions we have laid out.  I don't think, through our tactical decisions December or not or in September or that I'm to me, not just about strategy is and how we communicate that strategy, and then from that follows the actual policy decision.  Thank you.

That degree of uncertainty will probably, but not certainly, be time of our cautious about raising the federal funds rate during carried the day.  The first forced to reduce it and return to the loss of credibility.  The second is that there's very the decision at this FOMC meeting and making it at a Our Committee has been extremely the period since 2009.  That's an understatement.  Two arguments have is that we should not raise the rate, because we could soon be effective lower bound, thereby suffering a little difference between making subsequent meeting.

regard to the credibility loss of having to return to the ELB, we need to weigh the against the potential credibility loss of hesitating too long.  The the statement that it's only because we kept the rate so low for so long that the U.S. economy has performed so well since 2009.  I do not remains to be shown that the performance of rate path that was now 50 or the path that actually obtained-and thus 50 basis points or two interest ELB. With expectation of that possible loss argument I've made is liable to be countered by interest disagree with that point, except at the margins.

And I do believe we should very soon take the second gradual path away from the ELB and toward normalization. so close to the ELB for so long sends the right intertemporal decisions step on our we look to our December decision, we will be navigating treacherous waters. our expectations of future economic policies and of the future state of the the nonmonetary followed in 2017 and later.

I'm confident we'll continue to follow Finally, as When we make our decision in December, we should be looking ahead and choosing an interest rate that reflects economy.

It would more likely I'd be concerned if we started to change our strategy to try to run the economy too hot an attempt to drive rate poor economic outcomes.  While there are many differences between today's economy and the economy back then, I don't think we trying to use monetary policy to change structural aspects of the economy.

I'll vote for alternative B, although the language, particularly as Governor Fischer and Presidents Mester, Rosengren, and Williamshave already said, reflects a higher probability of a of favoring such a move higher couple of remarks to what I said yesterday.  First, I want to reiterate my of several meetings my own work with the help of the staff here, that I don't think there's a compelling case to be cited by either side from history regarding why one has to think, actually, the circumstances are different an intuition than anything else.  It's an informed I'd like to add a own conclusion, based on having listened to many of you over the course and tried to do some of particularly move now or why it would be okay to wait.  I enough today from what they have been in the past that both sides have something they can cite.

I think that's necessary at this point to maintain credibility.  But I think we move with language that further moves in 2017 are not anticipated, and the next move is as likely to be a decrease in the policy rate as it is to be an increase in the MR. BULLARD.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support view, our normalization program change in the balance sheet is not meaningful in the increasingly apparent that we should de-emphasize the idea of normalization as we go forward. My basic recommendation is that we should plan to go ahead December should accompany that that policy rate.

as the problem with our normalization rhetoric.  Policy is intended path of policy and not the level of the policy rate today.  Our rhetoric or more move upward in the policy rate.  Our for economic growth near 2 percent over the forecast horizon.  In my opinion, this is degree of precision with which we can also for unemployment near the Committee's estimate of its inflation forecasts are generally centered on the Committee's inflation general contours of this forecast are very similar whether one is looking at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Fed forecast, or private-sector forecasts.  What private-sector expectations is the policy rate path, which is very flat in the achieve the same forecast outcomes. So let me turn to what I see mostly about the is that we are on the cusp of a 200 basis point forecast is not meaningfully different from trend, in view of the measure the trend.  Our forecast is longer-run value, and target.  The Tealbook, the is different about private-sector view in order to take the private-sector perspective for just a moment.  From that perspective, it faster output growth, lower-than-expected unemployment, So let's looks like any surprise in the form of

From the private-sector perspective, this holding a hammer over the economy, as deviations from our I think that forecast that we currently have and the type of would do much better to characterize the economy and expected trajectory. or higher-than-expected inflation will be seen by this Committee as a reason to embark more rapidly on a would be inappropriate.  This is like forecast expectations will be met very aggressively in the private-sector perception. this is the wrong approach.  With the type of private-sector expectations that we can measure, I think we current policy settings as approximately correct, in light of the current state of its that moment to realign rid of the major policy rate move.  I just don't think that that's description of the Committee's intentions.  Thank you, Madam Chair. To conclude, I would say, go ahead for December, but use expectations for 2017 and beyond.  In particular, use the December opportunity to get perception that we are on the precipice of a an accurate

I would support doing this, if not today, that the path of rates over the next much lower than we've I believe, therefore, that further removals of accommodation should be amount of patience and caution.  I also believe that in economic policies, such as infrastructure spending, fiscal policy, and other reforms, prospective GDP growth is going to be very sluggish.  This is due to to be abating. MR.

At this juncture, I tried to ask myself to move by year's end, and I could come up with only some extreme that are very unlikely.  In view of the timing of this meeting, we should probably wait essential that we communicate that not moving in December would take economic outlook. I also share some of President Rosengren's concerns that our overly policy what it would take not events until December, but it is a rather severe deterioration in our

As I noted yesterday, I think we have to keep an eye out to make sure that in private domestic final purchases is just part of the typical ebb and flow the data that we see in an economy growing modestly above trend.  I believe this is the case. MR. EVANS.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support today is the recent softer tone in regard to price stability, core PCE inflation has improved somewhat over the past rounds.  I'm pleased to see that the 12-month change has made it up to 1.7 percent for said yesterday in a different context, 'Good. time for complacency.'  I remain concerned about inflation since the turn of the year, and total clearly much more low-inflation outcomes than they are about above-target inflation.  This lack of on my assessment of appropriate policy.  In Board's inflation attractor will get back to 2 percent.  And I view that perspective as strategy that overshooting is consistent with a symmetric inflation up to 2 percent.  If our primary policy objective With couple of two months in a row.  But, as Governor Fischer Nice job.  But now is not the expectations.  Core inflation has risen 0.3 percentage point PCE inflation is up about ¾ percentage point.  But instead of firming, household inflation expectations have fallen to new lows, and, even with the slight pickup since our September meeting, TIPS breakevens are still down a touch, 10 basis points, since late last year. Furthermore, futures markets continue to indicate that investors are concerned about improvement in expected inflation weighs heavily my opinion, unless core inflation overshoots 2 percent by some amount in this cycle, I don't believe the in line with the long-run objective and trying to get inflation expectations

Our communications have been pointing fairly forcefully sometime this year, unless there was a clear softening in economic activity. virtual commitment, if economic credibility risks of not statement and plan.  Hence, I can support the changes in paragraph 3 language that will further validate market expectations for a rate increase in December unless the data strongly object.

beyond December?  My last SEP submission had three rate increases feel that we should not get ahead of this pace unless factors underlying our inflation characterizing 2017. What about between now and the end of 2017.  For me, I we see a marked improvement in the data, particularly in the outlook, and I agree with President Bullard's viewpoints on that for in my public speaking to communicate about inflation through the lens Chair spelled out in her Amherst speech last year.  Basically, the transitory factors, and inflation expectations.  I outlook the rationale for my appropriate policy rate path.  I think this taxonomy also could be a to use to describe more explicitly the economic conditionality of these factors pointing to attainment of our 2 percent and sooner rather than later.  We should be able to point to I found it useful of the canonical model the model's inflation determinants are inertia, slack, find this breakdown helpful for explaining the overall inflation outlook and how this motivates useful tool for the Committee governing our moves after December.  Our communications should reinforce that future rate increases will depend on the weight objective sustainably, symmetrically,

Intermeeting to delay for additional data to confirm that these events would have no material effect on the economy. Fortunately, they have not, and the data since the case for a rate increase.

the data came close to confirming our find this convincing, however, because the timing isn't consistent with lags in the effects of monetary policy. Some Committee members have argued that December projections precisely because we delayed rate increases and pulled down the expected policy rate path.  I don't the conventional views about the next meeting, I agree with you, Madam Chair, that some data should not stay our hand.  This is especially true when are in the process of converging to a path with lower trend productivity and employment incoming data are inconsistent with fluctuations example, a payroll low as 60,000 is compatible with constant unemployment and labor force Looking forward to our weakness in the upcoming economic we growth.  The relevant question is whether around such a lower trend growth path.  As I pointed out yesterday, for employment number as participation rates.

YELLEN.  Thank you.  President George. CHAIR

Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative C, as I view an increase time.  Core PCE inflation is now moving past the window when the decline in increased this year, leaving the market near full employment.

Monetary policy has also, perhaps arguably, become more accommodative this year. funds rate has not changed, but we've signaled a terminal rate, this in addition, the real rate remains well below measures of the level of accommodation, I expect to see labor neutral level, which history shows can end poorly.  I accept as current conditions are different than those of the past.  But this our statutory objective of effectively promoting with the economy's longer-run potential to increase Even with some adjustment to the utilization rise above its reasonable the arguments that approach sits uneasily with me and, I think, with maximum employment commensurate production.

Research by conference volume argues that compassionate monetary policy is simply sound monetary policy, policy that aims and minimizes output fluctuations. Bringing more people into the labor force and having stronger desirable feature Christina Romer and David Romer published in a 1998 Jackson Hole that the cyclical effects of monetary policy on unemployment are inherently temporary.  They conclude to keep inflation stable continuing to let the economy heat up in terms of reversing past damage are highly uncertain.

as the economy strengthens, I see growing risk associated with a wait-and-see case for continuing to normalize policy.  Thank you. Overall, approach and a stronger

fair to say that the economy is not so far from full employment and is making 2 percent inflation.  Nonetheless, other features of the landscape of slack in the labor market, inflation running persistently below target MR. POWELL.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  Today I will support alternative B as written. In my view, it is reasonable progress toward have also weighed in my thinking, including uncertainty about the natural rate of unemployment, the presence of pockets for a long time, inflation expectations at low levels, a weak and threatening global economy, a

of that background, the Committee's patient approach has, in my view, been little risk of falling 'behind the curve' and plenty of reason to move cautiously.  To say policy as clearly one-sided.  But, as the economic outlook facing monetary policy are also gradually shifting.  Today, more two-sided.  For measured labor force participation ticks down again, then the unemployment rate measurement this year and over the years suggests that current So, with all the right one, and that patience has paid dividends and continues to do so.  There has seemed to me to be it differently, I've seen the risks for continues to slowly improve, the risks with job growth continuing at a healthy pace, pockets of slack being gradually used up, and positive news on inflation, I think the risks are beginning to become example, if could quickly fall well below 5 percent, suggesting less 'room to run.'

On inflation, I expect to see inflation move gradually up to 2 percent in the near I see some risk that both in inflation compensation and flows into TIPS suggests that some investors are same conclusion.  Of course, inflation has run below target for so long unwelcome more aggressive response and put the risk.  To me, that means that if the economy continues on its long path of output market, and progress toward 2 percent inflation, raise the federal funds rate along the lines of the September SEP.  And for that I am no longer inclined to put, in effect, zero weight on the possibility that upside surprises in inflation and unemployment could require a recovery at growth modestly above trend, a tightening labor I would gradually

I about yesterday, the recent uptick in inflation and inflation expectations, at ones, makes me more comfortable about the possibility of raising rates in possibility that labor force continue to rise, and we might, therefore, see continued strong job growth in of stable unemployment and subdued inflation.  Taking into account our dual a strong case for moving cautiously with rate increases. Looking forward, I think we need to remain very open to the participation might the context mandate, this offers

September, I talked about three metrics that I was looking at:  one, a sustained upward expectations-we've seen a significant decline in the headline unemployment rate.  I still feel like those three measures for me to have some confidence that this labor force participation to support a move in December, I'm to understand where and how much more it has to run.

So, for me going to want to see continued evidence along those three measurements that story is just thank President Williams for responding to my question from yesterday.

Or if we lower bound, in a more normal economic environment, I could understand best long-term operating framework for this Committee or for Committees?'  But I feel like it's a curious time, when we're debating whether now is the the funds rate, to then say, 'Well, maybe we should also be raising the target or changing to a nominal GDP target.'  I just see those two things as in conflict, they are separate questions, so thank you for responding to my MR.

These developments served us well inflation while helping the signs that there may be scope for further improvement in the fact that inflation continues to run persistently below our target, which is Looking ahead, in view of the labor market;

As we've seen in Europe and effective lower bound imposes important constraints on monetary policy, As we look forward to a time when something akin to alternative C will be appropriate, I want to highlight two areas for consideration.  First, as risk events emanating from Europe just since our the outlook as balanced.  Risks to the downside, and we've seen repeatedly over the past importantly affect U.S. financial conditions Japan, proximity to the

So if we were to risks as fully balanced, as in adequately sensitive to language in paragraph 4 since December 2015.  In the the Committee has significantly lowered its estimate of the longer-run neutral funds rate in the SEP was 3.5 percent.  It is currently nearly ¾ percentage point result, I believe it would be helpful to update paragraph 4 in alternative C to the lower projected level of the longer-run funds rate, reinforcing the message that rates are likely to rise only gradually and to a level likely well below previous norms. In addition, we haven't altered the meantime, rate.  In December 2015, when the sentences describing the future path were last modified, the median longer-run lower.

YELLEN.  Thank you very much.  Vice Chairman. CHAIR

DUDLEY.  Thank you, Madam Chair.  I support alternative B as reaching language in that will be useful in reinforcing the notion that a December rate hike, VICE CHAIRMAN written.  I wanted the statement to suggest that we now have greater confidence about our inflation objective, and I think we've accomplished that by the changes in the paragraph 3.  I think barring some unforeseen change in the outlook, is likely.

sharp tightening in financial conditions, such as what happened in January this year, I don't think the market turbulence we mainly attributable to that rate hike.  But, second, and more important, recognize that we're not on a tightening period from 2004 to 2006.  The median forecast At this juncture, I don't view a December rate hike as particularly risky in terms of provoking a which followed our first rate hike last December.  First, had early this year was unlike a year ago, market participants should now better campaign similar to what occurred during the

So I think that we can do this without great fear that this is last December was for four rate hikes in 2016-we may get one, and the flat.  The probability of climbed to about 70 percent right now.  That has not unnerved market participants. to imagine effect in financial market going to provoke an outsized market reaction.  Thank you, Madam Chair.

Thank you very much for a good discussion of the policy today.  And we did solicit suggestions concerning alternative C, thinking that if we do as we come closer to December, that if things seem to be proceeding in a direction of a thoughts about what would be valuable to see in alternative C, I would to put up B for a vote, with the language unchanged. CHAIR YELLEN.  Okay. move for move in December, it might be a draft.  I've heard some further suggestions, and I would just say, move and others have really encourage you to contact us with ideas you may have.  For now, I'd like alternative will be on the included on pages 6 and 7 of Thomas Laubach's briefing on the directive to the Desk as included in the implementation note on MR. MADIGAN.
